turni ng point in the 10year federalstate partnership to restore the everglades si nce 1993 the federal state tribal and local governments have generally worked togeth er towards restoration congress has not previously conditioned federal everglades funding on florida taking specific actions towards restoration both because of this partnership and because federal consent decree and state law the everglades forever act set deadline of 2006 for phosphorus mitigation however in spring 2003 the florida legislature amended the everglades forever act to extend the deadline until at least 2016 phosphorus pollution has been concern in the everglades for many years excess phosphorus can cause imbalances in vege tation and habitat nd alter native ecosystems much of this phosphorus is discharged in water from the everglades agricultural area eaa which is located north of the arthur r marshall loxahatchee national wild life refuge and the evergla des national park the eaa has been used intensively for farming pa rticularly sugar cane since the 1950s in 1988 the federal government sued the state of florida and two of its agencies alleging that water released onto federal lands

contributor to the nvironmental degradation of the florida everglades ecosystem in 1988 the federal government sued the state of florida and two of its state agencies alleging that water released onto federal lands from agricultural sources contained elevate d levels of phosphorus and other nutrients in violation of state water quality standards based on 1992 consent decree settling this lawsuit florida enacted the everg lades forever act in 1994 this act required the state to establish numeric limit for phosphorus by december 2003 ie phosphorus criterion and required acti ons to comply with this limit by december 2006 several evergladesre lated lawsuits have since b een filed by environmental agricultural and tribal stakeholders i n spring 2003 florida amended the 1994 act to create significant flexibility in dead lines for phosphorus mitigation and in july 2003 flor ida issued rule establishing limit for phosphorus and methods to measure compliance with that limit these new laws and the rule have generated controversy among severa l stakeholders in the restoration effort underway in the everglades and caused concern among some members of congress that the state may not meet the 2006 deadline for mitigating phosphorus this concern is reflected in the fy 2004 energy and water development appropriations act pl 108137 sign ed into law december 1 2003 and the fy2004 interior and related agencies appropriations act pl 108108 signed into law november 10 2003 these laws conditio n fy2004 everglades funding based on florida meeting phosphorus mitigation nd water quality

st johns project element which is not considered part of the everglades ecosystem 4since 1993 when federal interagency task force was created to guide the restoration with participation by state tribal and local governments as well as interest groups the everglades restoration has been viewed as new model for managing complex multifaceted ecosystem restoration efforts the interagency multi stakeholder effort was also viewed as means of precluding litigation by providing forum to raise and resolve issues before they could be brought to court although litigation has continued since the passage of the cerp in 2000 the federal and state governments have been viewed by some as working handinhand for environmental restorationenergy and water appropriations the fy2004 energy and water

also directs the epa administrator to send report n these issues to the house and senate appropriations committees the house transportation and infrastructure committee and the senate environment and public works committee analysis of legislation provisions in these acts indicate that congress has strong concerns about whether the state of florida will meet the 2006 deadline to reduce phosphorus pollution in the evergl ades these laws may cause some to question the viability of the federalstate partnership which has guided everglades restoration over the last decade4this view was supported in hrept 108212 which stated that the committee is concer ned that recent changes to the state of floridas 1994 everglades forever act re present departure from the commitments and obligations of the

200 65some may also view these provisions as evidence of the federal government establishing oversight mechanisms to monitor state actions related to restoration this could be interpreted as departure from the status quo of federalstate cooperation to r estore the everglades these provisions could also be significant for other largescale ecosystem restoration projects that use the everglades as model including simila r federalstate cooperation such as the calfed baydelta program in california differences in funding and projects affected the appropriations acts passed place conditions on different amounts of funding t he fy2004 in terior appropriations affects fy2004 funding for t he modified water deliveries project as well as unobligated funds for that project and 32 million in land acquisition funds the energy and water legislation could affect 1375 million in funding for the central and southern florida project the everglades and south florida ecosystem restoration project also known as cr itical projects the kissimmee river restoration and cerp differences in standards and water measured while the energy and water legislation requires water entering lnwr and enp to meet consent decree standards the interior legislation is broader requiring water entering and water throughout lnwr and enp to meet florida water quality standards florida phosphorus criterion standards and cons ent decree requirements although floridas phosphorus rule specifies that methodology laid out in the consent decree will be used to measure phosphorus in lnwr and enp it leaves the decision to florida as to whether the criterion was violated the interior legislation requires the waters to meet broader set of standards as state water quality standards will include limits on several substances besides phosphorus where water is measured eg entering the land or throughout the land may be significant as phosphorus levels can vary greatly depending on the point of meas urement further given the uncertainty surrounding nutrient measurements in the everg lades it is uncertain if all state water quality standards can be measured and re ported annually to comply with reporting requirements potential project delays some stakeholders are concerned that delays or changes to related projects or cerp com ponents may jeopardize cerps feasibility this concern was illustrated when land acquisitions for the modified water deliveries project were stalled due to litigation and protest over the use of eminent domain according to the cerp authorization without the completion of the modified water deliveries project tions of cerp could not be funded according to federal law6similarly the delay or loss of funding as provided in these appropriations bills for non compliance with water quality standards could also lead to delays in the overall restoration processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32131crs5 7burns and mcdowell inc final report everglades protection area tributary basins

referred to as the amended efa changes the everglades forever act of 1994 efa florida statutes 3734592 by authorizing new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the everglades known as the everglade s protection area tributary basins conceptual plan for achieving longterm water quality goals final report or longterm plan7this report provides for pla nning process to ensure that discharges of water into the everglades will comply with state water quality standards and that phosphorus levels in these waters will not alter the native everglades ecosystem in contrast to the fa the new law contains provisions that appear to create flexibility in this goal for example the longterm plan is to be implemented from 2003 to 2016 and is expected to provide the best available phosphorus reduction technology3b further the new law allows the long term plan to be changed through adaptive management which may lead to changes in the implementation of phosphorus reduc tion activities and an extension of any compliance deadlines8 the amended efa does contain provi sions that suggest the december 2006 deadline for meeting the phosphorus criterion is expected to be met for example the bill states that by december 31 2006 the d epartment and the district shall take such action as may be necessary to impleme nt the pre2006 projects and strategies of the longterm plan so that water delivered to the everglades protection area achieves in all parts of the everglades protection area state water quality standards including the phos phorus criterion an d moderating provisions 3b note that this provision requires the imple mentation of projects and strategies by december 2006 to achieve the phosphorus criterion but does not require the phosphorus criterion be met by 2006 the new law does not specify particular date by which the phosphorus criterion must be met9the longterm plan also specifies that second 10year phase 20172026 to reduce phosphorus may be n ecessary to achieve the plan objective the objective in the plan is to obtain to the maximum extent practicable longterm geometric aver age phosphorus concentration in waters discharged to the everglades that i s within

porter goss released by the house committee on appropriations april 29 2003criticism of amendments the amended efa has generated criticism from some stakeholders in the everglades restoration effort some members of congress environmentalists the miccos ukee tribe and others argue that the bill allows phosphorus mitigation to extend f ar beyond compliance deadline of december 2006 set by the efa and the consent decree some critics also argue that if phosphorus mitigation is delayed it may compromise the state and federal governments efforts to restore the everglades as well as jeopardize federal appropriations for cerp in joint statem ent issued by six us representatives five criticisms of the amended efa were listed 1 there is an uncertain period for compliance with water quality standards 2 there is uncertainty over the water quality standard for phosphorus disc harge 3 because of delays in phos phorus mitigation discharges of phosphoruspollute d water may enter federal lands such as everglades national park 4 this bill provides for discharges of phosphoruspolluted water in unpolluted dry areas and 5 this b ill does not reflect the states intent to fully fund water quality improvements in the everglades and may shift some of the cost to the federal government11 support of amendments proponents of the new law which include the florida legislature and agricultural interests in the everglades claim that it provides realistic opportunity for mitigating phosphorus pollution in the everglades some claim that lowering the phosphorus concentration in the everglades by december 2006 to 10 ppb may not be feasible consider ing the technology and implementation of restoration projects to date indeed they argue that it is more costeffective and productive to implement substitute plan fo r the plan provided in the original efa as 1 some of the more expensive project s are aimed at waters which contribute relatively little phosphorus to the everglades and 2 cerp projects incorporate water quality standards and call for diverting water away from the everglades anyway under this new plan they arg ue cerp and state efforts to lower phosphorus will work together more efficiently and that the 1994 law did not foresee the creation of cerp they support new plan for restoring water quality that incorporates adaptive management and the best technology available to reduce phosphorus further some p roponents argue th at the new law will lead to fewer lawsuits and will allow restoration projects to proceed without delays from an excessive number of lawsuits second set of amendments in response to critics of the amendments second set of amendments chapter 2003394 was passed in june 2003 amending the efa second time this second set of amendments deleted phrases that implied that phosphorus pollution was expected to be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable and included provisions th at emphasized that projects planned for implementation

of phosphorus pollution in the everglades phosphorus in the everglades phosphorus is one of the primary water pollutants in the everglades and is generally thought to be caused by natural leaching urban runoff and agricultural runoff from s ugar plantations vegetable farms and livestock operations eg from animal waste some researchers have also attributed phosphor us in the everglades t atmospheric depos ition but measurement techniques and values for this are highly uncertain the 2003 everglades consolidated report documents total phosphorus concentrati ons as being highest in the northern everglades waters flowing into lnwr and water conservation areas see figure 1 and lowest in the southern everglades where enp is located the report states that this is indicative of phosphorusrich wa ter in the canals that carry water from the everglades agricultural area although u rban runoff has also been identified as contributing phosphorus to the everglades effects of excessive phosphorus in the everglades as in other ecosystems excessive levels of phosphorus and other nutrients lead to eutrophication eutrophication is natural process that occurs when bodies of water experience an increase in the inflow of nut rients including phosphorus leading to an increase in organic matter eg plants in the case of the everglades when plants begin to die and decompose they consume dissolved oxygen from the water rapid inflow of excessive nutrients can speed this process to an unnatural pace if dissolved oxygen levels fall substantially and rapidly fish and aquatic plant populations will suffer eutrophication also f avors plants that can use high levels of nutrients for example excessive leve ls of phosphorus in the everglades is thought to be the primary factor behind the conversion of native sawgrass marshes and sloughs to vegetation stands dominated by cattails12this shift in vegetation has resulted in less habitat for wading bird s and other wildlife and reduced populations of several native plant species further the rapid growth of cattails is partly responsible for clogging waterways and altering the hydrology in parts of the everglades history of everglades phosphorus pollution the beginning of excessive phosphorus input into the everglades can be traced back to the 1940s when several thousand acres of land were cleared and converted to agricultural production this clearing exposed soils which began to erode and leach phosphorushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32131crs8 13us dept of agriculture economic research service us sugar statistical
