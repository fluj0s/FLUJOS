109163 provided authority for dod to transfer to the state department up to 100 million in defense articles services training or other support in fy2006 and again in fy2007 to use for reconstruction stabilization and security activities in foreign countries this authority was extended through fy2008 by section 1210 of the fy2008 ndaa pl 110181 and through fy2009 by the section 1207 of the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa pl 110417 the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa provides special authority for 50 million to be spent under section 1207 for georgia in addition to the 100 million for other countries this authority has been used to fund activities of the state departments office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs and activities implemented by other agencies that are coordinated by scrs operations and maintenance funds from the three military services and from the dod defensewide account have been tapped for this purpose although the legislation does not specify funding source crs2 according to united states institute of peace report section 1207 was introduced in response to requests from defense secretary donald rumsfeld and secretary of state condeleezza rice to help jump start the scrs by providing authorization and funding for projects that would involve interagency coordination this action was taken in recognition of the fact that congress was unable to pass state department authorization bill that would authorize scrs to conduct comparable program1 and because of the perception that it was easier to obtain funding from congress in the dod bill rather than the state department bill2 conditions section 1207 authority requires that any services defense articles or funds provided or transferred to the secretary of state comply with the authorities and limitations of the foreign assistance act of 1961 the arms export control act or any law making appropriations to carry out such act the secretary of defense must notify congressional armed services foreign affairs and appropriations committees when the authority is exercised the notification must be prepared in coordination with the secretary of state as of fy2009 section 1207 funds may not be used to support the budgets of foreign governments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22871 funding transfers in fy2006 dod transferred 10 million to the state department for assistance to lebanon in the midst of the lebanese conflict according to spokesperson for scrs dod lacked the funds for further transfers through this authority in fy2006 even though the authorized amount was 100 million in fy2007 dod transferred total of 995 million to the state department for programs in seven countries and regions dod described the projects funded in fy2007 as few small focused activities in various critical countriesregions to demonstrate proof of concept and judged that while largely successful most could have more significant impact if continued or expanded3 in fy2008 dod provided 100 million in transfers from the dod budget 50 million for georgia and 50 million for other countries congressional action and statements 20052007 section 1207 authority was the result of senate floor amendment offered by senator james inhofe to the senate version of the fy2006 ndaa s 1042 which would have provided funding up to 200 million per fiscal year for fy2006 the administration had asked for 200 million for state department conflict response fund but neither authority nor funding was provided in nondod legislation4 conferees on the fy2006 dod authorization bill stated in their

action on civilian capabilities by nina m serafino and martin weiss crs3 department of state until scrs is fully stood up and adequately resourced further the conferees on that bill stated that they were not inclined to continue authorizing dod funds to enable the state department to fulfill its statutory authorities subsequently the senate armed services committee sasc in its report on s 1547 srept 11077 the senate version of the fy2008 ndaa described section 1207 as pilot project in addition to extending the authority through fy2008 section 1210 of the fy2008 ndaa pl 110181 augmented the role played by the secretary of defense under the fy2006 ndaa the secretary of defenses role was limited to providing services and transferring defense articles and funds to the secretary of state the fy2008 ndaa included provision requiring the secretary of state to coordinate with the secretary of defense in the formulation and implementation of program of reconstruction security or stabilization assistance to foreign country that involves the provision of services or transfer of defense articles or funds under this authority 2008 in action on the fy2009 ndaa congress extended the 100 million section 1207 transfer authority for one fiscal year through fy2009 in march 20 2008 letter dod requested that congress double section 1207 authorized funding to 200 million httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22871 per year extend the authority for five fiscal years and broaden the authority to permit dod to provide that services or transfer defense articles and funds to the head of any us government department or agency not just the department of state as reported by sasc the fy2009 ndaa s 3001 would have doubled the authorized amount to 200 million as requested by dod and would have extended section 1207 authority three years through september 30 20115 the conference version of the bill conformed to the house armed services committee hasc version of the fy2009 ndaa hr 5658 which did not change the authorized amount and provided for oneyear extension nevertheless congress did approve special additional authority under section 1207 to provide up to 50 million in section 1207 assistance to georgia in fy2009 s 3001 was signed into law pl 110417 on october 14 2008 in addition congress amended the original legislation to prohibit the use of section 1207 funds to support the budgets of foreign governments congressional concerns from the beginning there has been some confusion about the appropriate uses of section 1207 and questions about the desirability of funding state department activities through the dod budget hasc and sasc reports on the their respective versions of the fy2009 ndaa both state separate concerns about section 1207 authority reflecting perceived need to clarify intended purposes and restate the original congressional intention that section 1207 was to be temporary authority in its report accompanying s 3001 s rept 110335 sasc stated that dod had inappropriately restricted the uses for which services or funds may be provided to the department of state under section 1207 pointing to the secretary of defenses april 15 2008 testimony at hasc hearing that section 1207 authority is primarily for 5 in testimony before congress in april 2008 secretary of state gates requested that section 1207 authority be extended for five years and the amount be doubled to 200 million april 15 2008 hasc get cite crs4 bringing civilian expertise to operate alongside or in place of our armed forces sasc stated that the legislative intent of section 1207 authority was broader and was meant to enable the secretary of defense to support the provision by the secretary of state of reconstruction security or stabilization assistance to foreign country sasc further stated such assistance could include providing early civilian resources to avert crisis that could otherwise subsequently require us military forces to assist or intervene6 in its report accompanying hr 5658 hrept 110652 hasc stated that it reaffirms that the resources provided under this authority are intended to meet immediate shortterm needs the committee reiterated the concern expressed in the conference report accompanying the original section 1207 legislation hrept 109360 that dod should not provide longterm funding in order to enable the department of state to fulfill its statutory requirements this concern according to hrept 110652 applied to both longterm development programs and to the broader security assistance initiatives that would be better suited for traditional foreign military financing authorities in addition to some members of congress some outside analysts believe that section httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22871 1207 activities would be better funded through the state department dod has never requested that section 1207 be made permanent law although it did as mentioned above request in 2008 that congress extend the authority for five fiscal years while noting the utility of dod section 1207 funding which enables the us government to meet critical needs and to take advantage of key opportunities the usip report mentioned above urges that in the future congress appropriate such quick reaction funding to the state department the dod could still participate in deciding on project proposals but the money would be guaranteed and could be made available more quickly this would require coordinating the efforts of various congressional committees but it would restore the traditional role of the dos department of state in funding us foreign assistance7 6 in february 2008 the state department and dod set forth guidance for section 1207 proposals that clarified the uses of the fund and procedures for developing proposals and coordinating with other agencies and programs this document specifies that programs should clearly advance us security interests by promoting regional stability andor building governance capacity of foreign partners to address conflict instability and sources of terrorism focus on security stabilization or reconstruction objectives in regions and countries where failure to act could lead to the deployment of us forces address urgent or emergent threats or opportunities that conventional foreign assistance activities cannot address in the required time frame seek to achieve short term security stabilization or reconstruction objectives that are coordinated with longerterm development efforts and that are expected to be sustained by the host government
