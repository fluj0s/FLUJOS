stock of fannie mae and freddie mac declined 64 and 68 respectively1 media reports raised doubts about the ability of fannie mae and freddie mac to sell new bonds to finance their portfolios concerns

secretary of the treasury emergency authority to purchase an unlimited amount of obligations and other securities from fannie mae freddie mac and the fhlbanks the secretary is to determine the terms

and freddie mac first it could view the current turm oil in the mortgage and financial markets as an aberration and make change second it could modify the charters to change the relationship between the gses and the federal government third it could repeal the fannie mae and freddie mac charters turning them into stockholderowned corporations with connection to the federal government fourth it could combine fannie mae and freddie mac with the fhlbanks fifth it could merge the gses with the federal housing administration and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae another issue that congress might wish to addre ss independent of any change in the status of fannie mae and freddie mac is dividing the gses into more than two second alternative to 2 possible new legal structures range from converting the gses to government corporations to breaking them into 10 or more competing entities

g18g158g155g140g145g138g156g142g501g561 the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 allows the gses to purchase mortgages made between july 1 2007 and december 31 2008 in high cost areas as long as the amount of the mortgage is 729750 or less this allows the gses to purchase these mortgages after december 31 2008 however provisions in fannie maes and freddie macs charters prevent them from purchasing mortgages that are more than one year old the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 allows the gses to purchase mortgages made on or after january 1 2009 subject to maximum which is the lesser of 115 of the median area house price or 150 of the national limit with the national conforming loan limit set at 417000 in 2009 the maximum limit in highcost areas is 625500

of mortgage loans their combined total was more than 14 trillion in 2007 that they finance by selling corporate bonds profiting from the difference between the interest earned on the portfolio and that paid out on the agencyrated bonds 3 they can also repackage the loans and sell them as mortgagebacked securities mbs earning guarantee fee in 2007 fannie mae and freddie mac had total of slightly more than 35 trillion in mbs outstanding4 the portfolios are principal source of the gses profits which creates an incentive to grow them further the implied or inferred government guarantee for their debt has allowed the gses to grow the portfolios without the limits that markets would impose on other financial corporations the gses maintain that the profitability of the portfolios allows them to better meet their housing mission goals see below proponents of new housing trust fund also see those profits as enabling new grant program for very lowincome housing carrying large portfolios however as opposed to dispersing mortgagebacked securities broadly through secondary market concentrates risk in the gses while that risk can be ameliorated through the use of hedges such as derivatives arguably it still represents greater systemic vulnerabilities than would broader distribution of mortgages as result the federal reserve with responsibility for overall stability of the financial sector has called for reducing the current size of the gses portfolios and limiting their future growth both in the interests of safety and soundness of the gses themselves and to prevent possible future systemic problems5 the act 3 ofheo report to congress 2008 p 116 available at httpwwwofheogovmediaannualreports reporttocongress2008pdf 4 ofheo p 116 5 gse portfolios systemic ri sk and

g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g501g561 benefits of single regulator for all the housing gses have been widely recognized in the academic and policy communities7 it was argued that single regulator is likely to be more prominent than the gse regulators it replaces and could provide more consistent regulation across the housing sector furthermore given th business differences between the fhlbanks on the one hand and fannie mae and freddie mac the enterprises on the other hand it was also argued that the risk that the regulators will be dominated by those they oversee sometimes called regulatory capture may be reduced changing the regulatory structure nevertheless involved important decisions on several institutional details there were significant differences in supervisory powers across the housing gse regulators that were folded into single regulator for instance the fhfboard oversaw both mission and safety and soundness for the fhlbanks while for fannie mae and freddie mac these functions were split between ofheo and hud the fhfboard could take enforcement actions based on any unsafe or unsound practice while ofheos regulatory responses were defined strictly in terms of capital adequacy requirements fhfboard had the authority to merge fhlbanks effectively liquidating one or more but ofheo could only appoint conservator based on the capital classification of an enterprise 8 the act authorized fhfa to appoint conservator or receiver for fannie mae or freddie mac which effectively gives fhfa the authority to liquidate fannie or freddie fhfa can require fhlbanks to merge g10g152g160g561g6g152g142g156g561g8g10g8g3g514g156g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561g5g152g150g153g138g155g142g561g157g152g561

fannie mae freddie mac and the fhlbanks unlike ofheo fhfas assessments are not subject to the congressional appropriations process this is similar to the appropriations process for federal bank regulators ofheo argued that being subject to congressiona l appropriations impaired its ability to conduct effective longterm planning and reduced its flexibility in resource management for instance

unable to respond quickly to important regulatory concerns without stretching thin its ability to conduct its primary safety and soundness responsibilities because of instances such as these ofheo consistently argued that were its budget and assessments exempt from the congressional appropriations process the agency could adapt more easily to changes in th enterprises activity and respond to

increase its assessments on the specific gse

economic recovery act of 2008 authorizes the fhfa to set riskbased and minimum capital standards unlike ofheo the fhfa has the authority to modify these standards by regulation which allows capital requirements to be adjusted to reflect changes in perceived risk

projects throughout the country the act allows the fhfa to set goals for the fhlbanks that are consistent with those set for fannie mae and freddie mac the gse housing mission goals currently remain in place for fannie mae and freddie mac despite their being under conservatorship g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g157g145g142g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158g151g141g501g561 at least three factorsthe value of the implied subsidy to fannie mae and freddie mac the failure of their percentofbusiness housing goals to put fannie mae and freddie mac ahead of the privatesector market in meeting the needs of lowincome households and the popularity and effectiveness of the fhlbanks giveaway housing goalshave been mentioned in conjunction with provisions in the act that create similar program for fannie mae and freddie mac the act requires fannie mae and freddie mac to annually contribute 42 basis points 0042 of the unpaid principal of mortgages purchased in each year to new housing trust fund in calendar year 2007 fannie mae and freddie mac purchased 12 trillion in mortgages which under the new rules would have jointly contributed 5008 million to the trust 10 the contributions can be suspended if they would cause severe financial problems for an enterprise in each year 25 of the contribution goes to support reserve fund for hope for homeowners bonds during the first three years decreasing percentage 100 50 25 of the other 75 will go for the hope program of this other 75 as adjusted in the first three years 65 goes to the housing trust fund 35 goes to capita l magnet fund to provide competitively awarded grants to support affordable housing for primar ily extremely low very low and lowincome families the fhfa has suspended fannie maes and freddie macs contributions to the trust fund while they are in conservatorship the differences between the sets of gses make direct replication of the fhlbank program problematic the fhlbanks for example have cooperative structureas opposed to the unitary publicly held form of fannie mae nd freddie macsuch that the fhlbank program necessarily operates through and not in competition with the primary lenders who are their memberowners the ability to deal with the resultant different incentives would depend on the extent to which the regulator as opposed to the gses themselves had authority to oversee the affordable housing programs the fhlbanks housing goal program is unchanged by the act g25g145g138g157g561g25g138g156g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g156g145g561g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g514g156g561g18g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g501g561 the
