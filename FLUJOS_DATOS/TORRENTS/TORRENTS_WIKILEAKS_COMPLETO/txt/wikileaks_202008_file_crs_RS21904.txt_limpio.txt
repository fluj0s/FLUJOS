step in the process toward full membership in fatf the fatf relies on combination of annual selfassessments and periodic mutual evaluations that are completed by team of fatf experts to provide information and to assess the compliance of its members to the fatf guidelines fatf has enforcement capability but can suspend member countries that fail to comply on timely basis with its guidelines the fatf is housed at the headquarters of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in paris and occasionally uses some oecd staff but the fatf is not part of the oecd the presidency of the fatf is oneyear appointed position currently held by mr frank swedlove of canada who will serve through june 30 2007 the fatf has operated under fiveyear mandate at the ministerial meeting on may 14 2004 the member countries renewed the fatfs mandate for an unprecedented eight years the mandate when it was established in 1989 the fatf was charged with examining money laundering techniques and trends reviewing the actions which had already been taken httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21904 and setting out the measures that still needed to be taken to combat money laundering in 1990 the fatf issued report containing set of forty recommendations which provided comprehensive plan of action to fight against money laundering in 2003 the fatf adopted the second revision to its original forty recommendations which now apply to money laundering and terrorist financing4 since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the fatf has redirected its efforts to focus on terrorist financing on october 31 2001 the fatf issued new set of guidelines and set of eight special recommendations on terrorist financing5 at that time the fatf indicated that it had broadened its mission beyond money laundering to focus on combating terrorist financing and that it was encouraging all countries to abide by the new set of guidelines ninth special recommendation was added in 2005 in 2005 the united nations security council adopted resolution 1617 urging all member states to implement the fatf forty recommendations on money laundering and the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing the fatf nine special recommendations are 2 continued organization for economic cooperation and development united nations office on drugs and crime and the world bank 3 to be admitted to the fatf country must 1 be fully committed at the political level to implement the forty recommendations within reasonable time frame three years and to undergo annual selfassessment exercises and two rounds of mutual evaluations 2 be full and active member of the relevant fatfstyle regional body 3 be strategically important country 4 have already made the laundering of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crimes criminal offense and 5 have already made it mandatory for financial institutions to identify their customers and to report unusual or suspicious transactions 4 for the forty recommendations see httpwww1oecdorgfatfpdf40recs2003_enpdf 5 fatf cracks down on terrorist financing washington fatf october 31 2001 p 1 crs3 1 ratify and implement the 1999 united nations international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism and security council resolution 1373 dealing with the prevention and suppression of the financing of terrorist acts 2 criminalize the financing of terrorism terrorist acts and terrorist organizations 3 freeze and confiscate funds or other assets of terrorists and adopt measures which allow authorities to seize and confiscate property 4 report funds that are believed to be linked or related to or are to be used for terrorism terrorist acts or by terrorist organizations 5 provide the widest possible range of assistance to other countries law enforcement and regulatory authorities in connection with criminal civil enforcement and administrative investigations 6 impose antimoney laundering requirements on alternative remittance systems 7 strengthen customer identification requirements on financial institutions for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21904 domestic and international wire transfers of funds 8 ensure that entities such as nonprofit organizations cannot be misused to finance terrorism 9 implement system for detecting physical crossborder transportation of currency and monetary instruments cash couriers including authority to stop or restrain currency or monetary instruments suspected of being related to money laundering or terrorist financing adopting sanctions for making false declarations and confiscating currency and monetary instruments that are related to money laundering or terrorist financing the fatf completed review of its mandate and proposed changes that were adopted at the may 2004 ministerial meeting the new mandate provides for the following five objectives 1 continue to establish the international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing 2 support global action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing including stronger cooperation with the imf and the world bank 3 increase membership in the fatf 4 enhance relationships between fatf and regional bodies and nonmember countries and 5 intensify its study of the techniques and trends in money laundering and terrorist financing6 progress to date an essential part of the fatf activities is assessing the progress of its members in complying with the fatf recommendations as previously indicated the fatf has attempted to accomplish this activity through assessments performed annually by the individual members and through mutual evaluations according to the 20052006 assessment provided by the fatf members the only country considered to be non cooperative country is myanmar the rest of the members are in full compliance or partial compliance on seven of the eight special recommendations on terrorist financing 6 httpwww1oecdorgfatfpdfpr20040514_enpdf crs4 part of the difficulty the fatf faces in determining how fully member countries are complying with the special recommendations is in reaching mutual understanding of what the recommendations mean and how country should judge its performance relative to the recommendations since the recommendations are periodically revised and new methodologies for analyzing money laundering and terrorist financing are adopted in addition number of the recommendations require changes in laws and other procedures that take time for member countries to implement to assist member countries in complying with the fatf recommendations fatf has issued various interpretative notes to clarify aspects of the recommendations and to further refine the obligations of member countries between 2002 and 2003 the international monetary fund imf and the world bank participated in yearlong pilot program to conduct assessments on money laundering and terrorist financing in various countries7 using the methodology developed by the fatf8 in march 2004 the imf and world bank agreed to make the program permanent part of their activities over the year the imf and the bank conducted assessments in 41 jurisdictions according to these assessments the fundbank reached number of conclusions regarding the overall compliance with the fatf 40 recommendations and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21904 the eight at that time special recommendations in particular they concluded that overall compliance was uneven across jurisdictions but that jurisdictions display higher level of compliance with the fatf 40 recommendations than they do with the eight special recommendations due to shortcomings in domestic legislation in general the fundbank concluded that compliance is higher among high and middle income countries than in low income countries the most common weaknesses identified by the imf and the world bank include poor coordination among government agencies especially among financial supervisors financial investigators the police public prosecutors and the public ineffective law enforcement due to lack of skills training or resources to investigate prosecute and adjudicate money laundering cases among police prosecutors or the courts weak supervision by financial supervisors due to understaffed or under trained supervisors who lacked the skills or capacity to monitor and enforce compliance with money laundering or terrorist financing requirements inadequate systems and controls among financial firms to identify and report suspicious activity or to ensure that adequate records were being maintained 7 this group of countries is not the same as those surveyed by the fatf although there is some overlap in coverage between the fatf and the imfworld bank assessments 8 this section is based on the imfbank report twelvemonth pilot program of antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism amlcft assessments joint report on the review of the pilot program the international monetary fund and the world bank march 10 2004 crs5 shortcomings in international cooperation due to strong secrecy provisions restrictions placed on counterparts use of information and the inability to share information unless criminal investigation was already underway or formal agreement was in place for each of the special recommendations the imf and the world bank offered additional conclusions 1 ratification and implementation of instruments almost onethird of the jurisdictions assessed by the imfworld bank failed to comply with this recommendation 2 criminalizing the financing of terrorism and associated money laundering this recommendation was one of the least observed by the jurisdictions reviewed 3 freezing and confiscating terrorist assets about one third of the jurisdictions that were assessed displayed serious deficiencies complying with this recommendation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21904 generally because there was lack of explicit legal provisions or other arrangements that would require the freezing of funds or assets of terrorists 4 reporting suspicious transactions related to terrorism forty percent of the assessed jurisdictions displayed lack of legal and institutional measures that would require making report to competent authorities when there is suspicion that funds are linked to terrorist financing 5 international cooperation this recommendation which covers mutual assistance and extradition in financing of terrorismrelated cases is one of the least observed recommendations where almost half of the relevant countries exhibited significant deficiencies 6 alternative remittance systems in most jurisdictions such remittances were judged to be irrelevant but of those jurisdictions that were considered onehalf were found to be deficient 7 wire transfers compliance was assessed inconsistently because there was ambiguity about whether the standard was in force those jurisdictions that were not in compliance generally lacked formal requirements that complete information be included in each transaction in february 2004 the fatf adopted revised version of the 40 recommendations that significantly broadens the scope and detail of the recommendations over previous versions also the fatf adopted new methodology to track and identify money laundering and terrorist financing that applies to both the 40 recommendations and the eight nine special recommendations as result of the significant length and additional detail of these new requirements the fatf decided that it will longer conduct selfassessment exercises based on the previous method but will initiate follow up reports to mutual evaluations crs6 in 2005 the fatf issued revised standards related to wire transfers of funds the new standards require financial institutions to include the name address and account number of the originator on all fund transfers the standards also lower the reporting threshold from 3000 to 1000 two fatfstyle regional bodies were also created the eurasian group and the middle east and north africa financial action task force the first round of mutual evaluations for these two bodies was scheduled for 2006 in 2007 the fatf adopted new measures to protect the international financial system from abuse including calling on iran to strengthen its moneylaundering and counterterrorist financing controls and new commitment to produce regular global threat assessment detailing key issues of concern related to criminal and terrorist financing issues for congress following the 911 attacks congress passed pl 10756 the usa patriot act to expand the ability of the treasury department to detect track and prosecute those involved in money laundering and terrorist financing in 2004 the 108th congress adopted pl 108458 which appropriated funds to combat financial crimes made technical corrections to pl 10756 and required the treasury department to report on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21904 the current state of us efforts to curtail the international financing of terrorism the experience of the financial action task force in tracking terrorist financing however indicates that there are significant national hurdles that remain to be overcome before there is seamless flow of information shared among nations while progress has been made domestic legal issues and established business practices especially those that govern the sharing of financial information across national borders continue to hamper efforts to track certain types of financial flows across national borders continued progress likely will depend on the success of member countries in changing their domestic laws to allow for greater sharing of financial information criminalizing certain types of activities and improving efforts to identify and track terroristrelated financial accounts the economic implications of money laundering and terrorist financing pose another set of issues that argue for gaining greater control over this type of activity according to the imf money laundering accounts for between 600 billion and 16 trillion in economic activity annually money launderers exploit differences among national anti money laundering systems and move funds into jurisdictions with weak or ineffective laws in such cases organized crime can become more entrenched and create full range of macroeconomic consequences including unpredictable changes in money demand risk to the soundness of financial institutions and the financial system contamination effects on legal financial transactions and increased volatility of capital flows and exchange rates due to unprecedented crossborder transfers9 9 the imf and the fight against money laundering and the financing of
