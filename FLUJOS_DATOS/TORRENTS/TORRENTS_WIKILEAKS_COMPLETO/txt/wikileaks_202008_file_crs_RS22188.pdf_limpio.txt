pocket vetoes an overview kevin r kosar analyst in american national government government and finance division summary the veto power vested in the president by article i section 7 of the constitution has proven to be an effective tool for the chief executive in his dealings with congress since the founding of the federal gove rnment in 1789 36 of 43 presidents have exercised their veto authority total of 2562 times congress has overridden these vetoes on 110 occasions 43 presidents have vetoed 82 appropriations bills and congress has overridden 12 146 of these vetoes this repor t will be updated as events warrant constitutional basis and importance the us constitution article i section 7 provides that for bill to become law it must be approved by both houses of congress and presented to the president for his approval and signature1 the president may sign bill into law within the 10day period excluding sundays provided in the constitution2 let it become law without his signature or veto it the constitution states that when the president vetoes bill he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated this type of action is called regular or ret urn veto if on the other hand congress has adjourned within the 10day period after presentation of the bill to the president thereby preventing the return of the bill to congre ss the president may simply withhold his signature and the bill does not become law practice that has been dubbed pocket veto3 the presidents veto authority is among his most significant tools in legislative dealings with congress illustrative of this point is the fact that presidents have vetoedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22188crs2 4 on these types of vetoes see crs report rl33635 item veto and expanded

senate procedures for considering vetoed bills see crs report rs22654 veto override procedure in the house and senate by elizabeth rybicki 7 although the constitution states that approv requires two thirds of that house congressional procedure tradition and judicial rulin gs have interpreted this requirement to mean twothirds of those members present and vo ting provided there is quorum present2562 bills since 1789 of these congress s overridden 110 43 moreover the veto also can be effective as threat sometimes forcing congress to modify legislation before presenting it to the president this report presents information on how congress can override regular vetoes the number of vetoes by each president and th use of vetoes in relation to appropriations bills the report does not address two other types of vetoes lineitem vetoes since the president has such power at present and legislative vetoes which are wielded by congress not the president4 it also does not address pr esidential signing statements5 overriding veto if bill is pocket vetoed while congress is out of session the only way for congress to override the veto is to reintroduce the gislation as new bill pass it through both houses and present it to the president agai n for his signature on the other hand congress may override regular veto without introducing new legislation according to article 1 section 7 of the constitution when the president chooses not to sign bill and instead returns it to the chamber that originated it the chamber enters the message of the president detailing the reasons for the veto into its journal and then proceeds to r econsider the bill because the constitution does not state exactly how congress should reconsider vetoed bill house and senate pro cedures govern the specific treatment of bills returned by the president6 passage by twothirds margin in both houses is required to override veto befo re the end of the congress in which the veto is received7 if twothirds vote is successful in the originating house that house informs the other of its decision to override the ve to by message neither house is under any constitutional legal or procedural obligation to schedule an override vote it is not unusual for congress to make effort to override the veto if congressional leaders do not believe they have sufficient votes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22188crs3 8 there have been 43 presidencies but only 42 persons have served as president grover cleveland was elected to two presidencies 9 president george hw bush attempted to poc ket veto two bills during intrasession recesses congress considered the two bills enacted into law because the president had not returned the legislation these two disputed vetoes are not included in table 1 president george w bush characterized his veto of hr 1585 as pocket veto since the 110th congress treated it as normal veto this report counts hr 1585 as normal veto 10 most of those vetoes prior to 1960 were of pr ivate bills ie legislation that would confer benefits upon single person or company and were almost never overridden in 1971 congress gave administrators more discretion to handle th claims of individuals thus the need for congressionally passed private bills has dropped dramatically from hundreds per annum to few dozen and therefore the opportunities for vetoes on private bills see crs report 98 628 private bills procedure in the house by richard s bethvetoes exercised and overridden pocket vetoes and returned vetoes table 1 shows that since the beginning of the federal government in 1789 36 of 438 presidents have exercised their veto aut hority on total of 2562 occasions of that number 1496 584 were regular vetoes that is the rejected legislation was returned to the congressional house of origin while it was in session with presidential message of explanation and 1066 416 were pocket vetoes or re jected while congress was adjourned9 congress has overridden 110 74 of the 1496 regular vetoes this percentage though is skewed downward by the enormous number of vetoes in administrations prior to the 87th congress which began in 196110 if one counts only the normal vetoes since 1961 the beginning of the kennedy administration one finds 231 vetoes and 37 overridden 16 george w bush was the first president since john
