board of governors referred the matter to the security council in february 2006 since then the council has adopted five resolutions the most recent of which resolution 1835 was adopted in september the security council has required iran to cooperate fully with the iaeas investigation of its nuclear activities suspend its uranium enrichment program suspend its construction of heavywater reactor and related projects and ratify the additional protocol to its iaea safeguards agreement however september 2008 report fr om iaea directorgeneral mohamed elbaradei to the agencys board of governors indicated that tehran has continued to defy the councils demands by continuing work on its uranium enrichment program and heavywater reactor program iran has signed but not ratified its additional protocol iran and the iaea agreed in august 2007 on work plan to clarify the outstanding questions regarding tehrans nuclear program most of these questions have essentially been resolved but elbaradei told the agencys board in june 2008 that the agency still has questions regarding possible military dimensions to irans nuclear programme september 2008 report from elbaradei stated that the

proliferation concern gas centrifuges rich uranium by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas at high speeds to increase the concentration of the uranium235 isotope such centrifuges can produce both lowenriched uranium leu which can be used in nuclear power reactors and highly enriched uranium heu which is one of th two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons heu can also be used as fuel in certain types of nuclear reactors iran also has uraniumconversion facility which converts uranium oxide into several compounds including uranium hexafluoride tehran claims that it wants to produce leu for its current and future power reactors irans construction of reactor moderated by heavy water has also been source of concern although tehran says that the reactor is intended for the production of medical isotopes it is proliferation concern because the reactors spent fuel will contain plutonium wellsuited for use in nuclear weapons in order to be used in nuclear weapons however plutonium must be separated from the spent fuela procedure called reprocessing iran has said that it will not engage in reprocessing 1 under the npt the five nuclearweapon states are china france

the outstanding questions regarding tehrans nuclear program3 most of these questions which had created suspicions that iran had been pursuing nuclear weapons program have essentially been resolved iaea directorgeneral mohamed elbaradei however told the iaea board june 2 2008 that there is one remaining major unresolved issue which concerns questions regarding possible military dimensions to irans nuclear programme september15 report4 from elbaradei to the security council and the iaea board states that the agency has not been able to make progress on these matters tehran has questioned the authenticity of some of the evidence underlying the agencys concerns and maintains that it has not done any work on nuclear weapons the government has also expressed concern to the iaea that resolving some of these issues would require agency inspectors to have access to sensitive information related to its conventional military and missile related activities the iaea according to elbaradeis report has stated its willingness to discuss with iran modalities that could enable iran to demonstrate credibly that the activities referred to in the documentation are not nuclear related as iran asserts while protecting sensitive information related to its conventional military activities indeed the agency says that it has made several specific proposals but tehran has not yet provided the requested information the most recent security council resolution 1835 adopted september 27 2008 requires iran to cooperate fully with the iaeas investigation of its nuclear activities suspend its uranium enrichment program suspend its construction of heavywater reactor and related projects and ratify the additional protocol to its iaea safeguards agreement 5 however elbaradeis september report indicated that tehran has continued to defy the councils demands by continuing work on its uranium enrichment program and heavywater reactor program iranian officials have repeatedly stated that iran will not suspend its enrichment program tehran has signed but not ratified its additional protocol g11g155g138g151g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g11g3g7g3g561 as noted above iran

monitoring of declared nuclear facilities the agencys inspections and monitoring authority in particular country are limited to facilities that have been declared by the government additional protocols to iaea comprehensive safeguards agreements increase the agencys ability to investigate clandestine nuclear facilities and activities by increasing the iaeas authority to inspect certain nuclearrelated facilities and demand information from memberstates 8 iran signed such protocol in december 2003 and agreed to implement the agreement pending ratification tehran stopped adhering to its additional protocol in 2006 the iaeas authority to investigate nuclearweaponsrelated activity is limited elbaradei explained in 2005 interview that we dont have an allencompassing mandate to look for every computer study on weaponization our mandate is to make sure that all nuclear materials in country are declared to us 9 similarly february 2006 report from elbaradei to the iaea board stated that absent some nexus to nuclear material the agencys legal authority to pursue the verification of possible nuclear weapons related activity is limited10 the current public controversy over irans nuclear program began in august 2002 when the national council of resistance on iran ncri an iranian exile group revealed information during press conference some of which later proved to be accurate that tehran had built nuclearrelated facilities that it had not revealed to the iaea the united states had been aware of at least some of these activities according to knowledgeable former officials 11 prior to the ncris revelations the iaea had expressed concerns that iran had not been providing the agency with all relevant information about its nuclear programs but had never found the country in violation of its safeguards agreement in fall 2002 the iaea began to investigate irans nuclear activities at the sites named by the ncri inspectors visited the sites the following february adopting its first resolution gov20036912 on the matter in september 2003 the iaea board called on tehran to increase its cooperation with the agencys investigation suspend its uranium enrichment activities and unconditionally sign ratify and fully implement an additional protocol in october 2003 iran concluded voluntary agreement with france germany and the united kingdom collectively known as the e3 to suspend its enrichment activities sign and implement an additional protocol to its iaea sa feguards agreement and comply fully with the iaeas investigation13 as result the agencys board decided to

additional protocol in december 2003 but has never ratified it ultimately the iaeas investigation as well as information iran provided after the october 2003 agreement revealed that iran had engaged in variety of clandestine nuclearrelated activities some of which violated the countrys safeguards agreement see appendix after october 2003 iran continued some of its enrichmentrelated activities but tehran and the e3 agreed in november 2004 to more detailed suspension agreement 14 however iran resumed uranium conversion in august 2005 under the leadership of president mahmoud ahmadinejad who had been elected two months earlier on september 24 2005 the iaea board of go vernors adopted resolution gov20057715 that for the first time found iran to be in noncompliance with its iaea safeguards agreement the board however did not refer iran to the security council choosing instead to give tehran additional time to comply with the boards demands the resolution urged iran to implement transparency measures including access to individuals documentation relating to procurement dual use equipment certain military owned workshops and research and development locations to reestablish full and sustained suspension of all enrichmentrelated activity to reconsider the construction of the research reactor moderated by heavy water to ratify promptly and implement in full the additional protocol to continue to act in accordance with the provisions of the additional protocol international legal obligations required tehran to take these steps but elbaradeis september 2008 report asserted that without iranian implementation of such transparency measures the iaea will not be in position to progress in its verification of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran iran announced in january 2006 that it would resume research and development on its centrifuges at natanz in response the iaea board adopted resolution gov200614 16 february 4 2006 referring the matter to the security council and reit erating its call for iran to take the measures specified in the september resolution two days later tehran announced that it would stop implementing its

noncompliance which it finds to have occurredas well as report the noncompliance to all members and to the security council and general assembly of the united nations in the case of iran the september 24 2005 iaea board resolution gov200577 stated that the board found that irans many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its npt safeguards agreement as detailed in gov200375 november 2003 report from elbaradei constitute non compliance in the context of article xiic of the agencys statute according to the resolution the board also found that the history of concealment of irans nuclear activities referred to in the director generals report gov200375 the nature of thes activities issues brought to light in the course of the agencys verification of declarations made by iran since september 2002 and the resulting absence of confidence that irans nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes have given rise to questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security elbaradei issued the report cited by the resolution gov200375 in november 200320 it described variety of iranian nuclear activities which are detailed in appendix that violated tehrans safeguards agreement elbaradei has since reported that iran has taken corrective measures to address these safeguards breaches as noted above the 2005 resolution called on iran to take variety of actions that tehran was not legally required to implement

describes the actions that the council may take in response to threats to the peace breaches of the peace and acts of aggression chapter vii of the charter contains three articles relevant to the iran

mandatory the suspension required by the iaea as noted earlier that resolution did not impose any sanctions on iran article 40 states that the security council may before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in article 39 of chapter vii call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable resolutions 1737 1747 and 1803 which did impose sanctions invoked article 41 of chapter vii according to article 41 the security council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions and it may call upon the members of the united nations to apply such measures these may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations as noted above security council resolution 1835 did not impose new sanctions but reaffirmed the previous resolutions and called on iran to comply with them the sanctions imposed by those resolutions remain in place the five permanent members of the council along with germany are continuing to discuss the matter it is worth noting that article 25 of the charter obligates members to accept and carry out the decisions of the security council

determining that stateparty has violated its obligations moreover there does not appear to be formal procedure for determining such violatio ns an npt review conference would however be one venue for npt statesparties to make such determination the security council has never declared iran to be in violation of the npt neither the council nor the general assembly has responsibility to adjudicate treaty violations however the lack of ruling by the council on irans compliance with the npt has apparently had little practical effect because as noted above the council has taken action in response to the iaea board of governors determination that iran has violated its safeguards agreement irans violations of its safeguards agreement appear to constitute violations of article iii which requires npt nonnuclearweapon statesparties to adhere to their safeguards agreements tehran may also have violated provisions of article ii which state that nonnuclearweapon statesparties shall not manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices as previously noted the iaea is continuing to investigate evidence of what elbaradei described in june 2008 as possible military dimensions to irans nuclear programme such activities may 22 portions of this section are

described above but the iaea has never reported that iran has attempted to develop nuclear weapons despite the lack of such an iaea conclusion 2005 state department report argued that the country had violated article ii of the npt the breadth of irans nuclear development ef forts the secrecy and deceptions with which they have been conducted for nearly 20 years its redundant and surreptitious procurement channels irans persistent failure to comply with its obligations to report to the iaea and to apply safeguards to such activities and the lack of reasonable economic justification for this program leads us to conclude that iran is pursuing an effort to manufacture nuclear weapons and has sought and received assistance in this effort in violation of article ii of the npt 23 the report also stated that irans weapons program combines elements of tehrans declared nuclear activities as well as suspected undeclared fuel cycle and other activities that may exist including those that may be run solely be the military the state departments reasoning appears to be based on an interpretation of the npt which holds that wide scope of nuclear activities could constitute violations of article ii the 2005 report states that assessments regarding article ii compliance must look at the totality of the facts including judgments as to statepartys purpose in undertaking the nuclear activities in question the report also includes list of activities which could constitute such non compliance 24 the 2005 state department report cites testimony from thenarms control and disarmament agency director william foster during 1968 senate foreign relations committee hearing25 foster stated that facts indicating that the purpose of particular activity was the acquisition of nuclear explosive device would tend to show noncompliance with article ii he gave two examples the construction of an experimental or prototype nuclear explosive device and the production of components which could only have relevance to such device however foster also noted that variety of other activities coul d also violate article ii adding that the united states believed it impossible to formulate comprehensive definition or interpretation november 2007 national intelligence estimate stated that until fall 2003 iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons26 this past program could be violation of article ii although the estimate does not provide any detail about the program 23 adherence to and compliance with arms control nonproliferation and disa rmament agreements and commitments department of state august 2005 available at httpwwwstategovdocumentsorganization52113pdf 24 according to the report such activities can include 1 th presence of undeclared nuclear facilities 2 procurement patterns inconsistent with civil nuclear program eg clandestine procurement networks possibly including the use of front companies false enduse information and fraudulent documentation 3 security measures beyond what would be appropriate for peaceful civil nuclear installatio ns 4 pattern of article iii safeguards violations suggestive not of mere mistake or incompetence but of willf ul violation andor systematic deception and denial efforts aimed at concealing nuclear activities from the iaea and 5 nuclear program with little or coherence

the september 2005 board resolution described as irans many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its safeguards agreement the report stated that iran has failed in number of instances over an extended period of time to meet its obligations under its safeguards agreement with respect to the reporting of nuclear material and its processing and use as well as the declaration of facilities where such material has been processed and stored the report detailed some of these failures and referenced other failures described in two earlier reports gov200340 and gov200363 from elbaradei to the iaea board28 according to gov200340 iran failed to declare the following activities to the agency the importation of natural uranium and its subsequent transfer for further processing the processing and use of the imported natural uranium including the production and loss of nuclear material and the production and transfer of resulting waste additionally iran failed to declare the facilities where nuclear material including the waste was received stored and processed provide in timely manner updated design information for research reactor located in tehran as well as provide in timely manner information on two waste storage sites gov200363 stated that iran failed to report uranium conversion experiments to the iaea according to gov200375 iran failed to report the following activities to the iaea the use of imported natural uranium hexafluoride for the testing of centrifuges as well as the subsequent production of enriched and depleted uranium the importation of natural uranium metal and its subsequent transfer for use in laser enrichment experiments including the production of enriched uranium the loss of nuclear material during these operations and the production and transfer of resulting waste the production of variety of nuclear compounds from several different imported nuclear materials and the production and transfer of resulting wastes 28 those reports

control and disarmament agency director william foster testified before the senate foreign relations committee about the npt in response to question regarding the type of nuclear activities prohibited by article ii of the treaty foster supplied the following statement extension of remarks by mr foster in response to question regarding nuclear explosive devices the treaty articles in question are article ii in which nonnuclearweapon parties undertake not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and article iv which provides that nothing in the treaty is to be interpreted as affecting the right of all parties to the treaty to develop research production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposesin conformity with articles i and ii of this treaty in the course of the negotiation of the treaty united states representatives were asked their views on what would constitute the manufacture of nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device under article ii of the draft treaty our reply was as follows while the general intent of this provision seems clear and its application to cases such as those discussed below should present little difficulty the united states believe sic it is not possible at this time to formulate comprehensive definition or interpretation there are many hypothetical situations which might be imagined and it is doubtful that any general definition or interpretation unrelated to specific fact situations could satisfactorily deal with all such situations some general observations can be made with respect to the question of whether or not specific activity constitutes prohibited manufacture under the proposed treaty for example facts indicating that the purpose of particular activity was the acquisition of nuclear explosive device would tend to show noncompliance thus the construction of an experimental or prototype nuclear explosive device would be covered by the term manufacture as would be the production of components which could only have relevance to nuclear explosive device again while the placing of particular activity under safeguards would not in and of itself settle the question of whether that activity was in compliance with the treaty it would of course be helpful in allaying any suspicion of noncompliance it may be useful to point out for illustrative purposes several activities which the united states would not consider per to be violations of the prohibitions in article ii neither uranium enrichment nor the stockpiling of fissionable ma terial in connection with peaceful program would violate article ii so long as these activities were safeguarded under article iii also clearly permitted would be the development under safeguards of plutonium fueled power reactors including research on the properties of metallic plutonium nor would article ii interfere with the development or use of fast breeder reactors under safeguards
