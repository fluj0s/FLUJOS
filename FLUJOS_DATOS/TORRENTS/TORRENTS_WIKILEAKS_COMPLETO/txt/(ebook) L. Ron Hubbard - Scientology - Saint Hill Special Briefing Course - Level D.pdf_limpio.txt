hat case sup hat ds of p hat ds of t hat staff member hat franchise issued may 1965 note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it all levels keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correctfour teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorse degraded novels self abnegation has filled the south east asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defence of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth ny wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselvesthus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that tune do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qed and aed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertake because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enrol who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeve rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrols consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe never permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let then quit fast if they enroled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in he eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humour her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead that incapablefitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practise our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten do them and well win l ron hubbard

auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use and delivery of dianetics and scientology is the answer to

word remimeo instructor replaced by supervisor all hats bpi safeguarding technology for some years we have had word squirreling it means altering scientology offbeat practices it is bad thing i have found way to explain why scientology is workable system this does not mean it is the best possible system or perfect system remember and use that definition scientology is workable system in fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone man never evolved workable system it is doubtful if in foreseeable history he will ever evolve another man is caught in huge and complex labyrinth to get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of scientology scientology will take him out of the labyrinth but only if he follows the exact markings in the tunnels it has taken third of century in this lifetime to tape this route out it has been proven that efforts by man to find different routes came to nothing it is also clear fact that the route called scientology does lead out of the labyrinth therefore it is workable system route that can be travelled what would you think of guide who because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to lost nowhere in the dark youd think he was pretty wishywashy guide what would you think of supervisor who let student depart from procedure the supervisor knew worked youd think he was pretty wishywashy supervisor what would happen in labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks youd think he was pretty heartless guide youd expect him to say at least miss those rocks may be pretty but the road out doesnt go that way all right how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his preclear eventually clear just because the preclear had cognition people have following the route mixed up with the right to have their own ideas anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitionsso long as these do not bar the route out for self and others scientology is workable system it white tapes the road out of the labyrinth if there were white tapes marking the right tunnels man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons darting off on wrong roads going in circles ending up in the sticky dark alonescientology exactly and correctly followed takes the person up and out of the mess so when you see somebody having ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals know he is pulling people off the route realize he is squirreling he isnt following the route scientology is new thing it is road out there has not been one not all the salesmanship in the world can make bad route proper route and an awful lot of bad routes are being sold their end product is further slavery more darkness more misery scientology is the only workable system man has it has already taken people toward higher iq better lives and all that other system has so realize that it has competitor scientology is workable system it has the route taped the search is done now the route only needs to be walked so put the feet of students and preclears on that route dont let them off of it matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them and move them on up and out squirreling is today destructive of workable system dont let your party down by whatever means keep them on the route and theyll be free if you dont they wont l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 2 july 1962 franchise repetitive rudiments how to get the rudiments in i am in hurry to get this bulletin to you and to get it into use for all except cch sessions for long time ive been urging you to get rudiments in for the past ten days i have been working hard to analyze and resolve why you sometimes cannot just as an emeter can go dead for the auditor in the presence of monstrous arc break i have found it can go gradiently dull in the presence of out rudiments if you fail to get one in then the outness of the next one reads faintly and if your tr1 is at all poor youll miss the rudiments outness and there goes your session to get over these difficulties i have developed model session that can be used in the rudiments as series of repetitive processes then with this ive developed repetitive rudiments the auditor at first does not consult the meter but asks the rudiments question of the pc until the pc says there is further answer at this point the auditor says i will check that on the meter and asks the question again if it reads the auditor uses the meter to steer the pc to the answer and when the pc finds the answer the auditor again lays the meter aside and asks the question of the pc as above until the pc has answer the auditor again says i will check that on the meter and does so the cycle is repeated over and over until the meter is clean of any instant read see hco bulletin of may 25 1962 for instant read the cycle 1 run the rudiment as repetitive process until pc has answer 2 consult meter for hidden answer 3 if meter reads use it to steer that that each time the meter flicks the pc to the answer 4 lay aside the meter and do 1 and 2 and 3 the process is flat when there is instant read to the question one does not bridge out or use two more commands when the meter test of the question gets instant read the auditor says do you agree that that is clean covertly looking at the needle as he or she says clean if the question really isnt clean there will be an instant read on do you agree the question is clean if there is such read do 1 2 and 3 again the trick here is the definition of in session if the pc is in session the meter will read if the pc is partially out the meter will read poorly and the rudiment will not register and therudiment will get missed but with the pc in session the meter will read well for the auditor thus you get the pc to talk to the auditor about his own case the definition of in session before consulting the meter by using the repetitive process what relief to the pc to have his rudiments in and goodbye arc breaks and auditing results use this system always on the beginning rudiments for every type of session use this system on the middle rudiments in havingness and sometimes on the prepcheck type of session but seldom on routine 3 goals type of session use this system always on the end rudiments of havingness session do not use it on the end rudiments of prepcheck or routine 3 type of session unless the session has been full of screaming pc which with this system it wont be havingness type session repetitive rudiments system on beginning middle and end rudiments prepcheck type session repetitive rudiments on beginning and sometimes middle rudiments ask end rudiments against meter as in step 2 and 3 of cycle fast checking see below routine 3 type session use repetitive rudiments on beginning rudiments use 2 and 3 only fast checking for middle and end rudiments unless session very rough so thats where repetitive auditing processes wind up addressed to rudiments tipyou can arc break session by overuse of middle rudiments on routine 3 processes never use the middle rudiments just because the pc is talking about his or her own case thats the definition of in session use middle rudiments in routine 3 when you have not had any meter needle response on three goals read three times not one goal read disturbed the needle then get your middle rudiments in and cover the first consecutive nul goal above the three that gave response dont use middle ruds just because 3 goals went nul only if reading of goal disturbed the needle for three goals in row also use middle ruds when the pc cant think of any more in listing of goals or items dont use every time you shift lists now only if the pc cant list more in prepchecking use middle ruds repetitively after 3 zero questions have each been nul on list of zeros and recheck those zeros if middle ruds were out use middle ruds after each what question was nulled and check the what question again and rework it if alive also check the zero questions if what went nul if zero advanced to what both what and zero must be checked for nullness and found nul before leaving them one middle rudiments use may suffice for both unless one was found still alive after the middle ruds were gotten in repair it and recheck if so fast checkinga fast check on the rudiments consists only of steps 2 and 3 of the cycle done over and over watching the meter the auditor asks the question takes up only what reads and careful not to q and clears it one does this as many times as is necessary to get clean needle but one still says do you agree that that is clean and catches up the disagreement by getting the additional answers when both the question and the agreement are seen to be clean the question is left in using fast checking never say that still reads thats flunk say theres another read here you cannot easily handle transistor type meter more sensitive than mark iv the needle would be so rapid in its swings you would find it nearly impossible to keep it centred therefore more sensitive meter was answer the tr 1 of many auditors lacks any great impingement and this is remediable only when altitude can also be remedied there had to be better answer to getting out rudiments to read better on meter for all auditors and all pcs repetitive rudiments is the best answer to this note i am indebted to mary sue when i was working on this problem for calling my attention back to this system which i originally developed for sec checking and where it worked well l ron hubbard lrh drcden copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 3 july ad 12 central orgs franchise repetitive prepchecking as the prepchecking we have been doing is complicated skill and as recent rudiments developments open the door to simplified handling of overts you may lay aside all versions of previous prepchecking and security checking and substitute the following this is in the interests of improvement of auditing and keeping pcs from being enturbulated by unskilled auditing the version herein is far easier to train students into as it uses the same actions as repetitive rudiments repetitive prepchecking we will still use the term prepchecking and do all prepchecking by repetitive command we will refer to the older version as prepchecking by the withhold system and abandon it as of this date as too complicated and too susceptible to restimulation of pcs in semi skilled hands the auditing procedure we handle any zero question exactly as in repetitive rudiments hco bulletin of july 2 1962 the session is started exactly as per model session hco bulletin june 23 1962 or as may be amended mark iv meter is used using earlier meters on prepchecking can mean disaster as they miss withholds the auditor then announces for the body of the session that prepcheck will be done on such and such subject or form the auditor then takes an already prepared form such as form 3 6a prepcheck mid ruds goals prepcheck form not yet released step one without now looking at the meter the auditor asks the form question repetitively until the preclear says thats all there are more answers step two the auditor then says i will check that on the meter and does so watching for the instant read hco bulletin may 25 1962 if it reads the auditor says that reads what was it and steers the pcs attention by calling each identical read that then occurs there that that until the pc spots it in his bank and gives the datumstep three the auditor then ignores the meter and repeats step one above then goes to step two etc step four when there is read on step two above the auditor says do you agree that that is nul the auditor watches for an instant read on this and if there is an instant read on it does step two above then step three this gives double check on the flatness of question this is all there is to repetitive prepchecking as system anything added in the way of more auditor questions is destructive to the session be sure not to q and hco bulletin of may 24 1962 be sure your tr4 is excellent in that you understand really fake what the pc is saying and acknowledge it really so the pc gets it and return the pc to session nothing is quite as destructive to this type of auditing as bad tr4 the zero questions time limiter there must be time limit on all zero questions although it says have you ever stolen anything the auditor must preface this with time limiter such as in this lifetime in auditing or whatever applies form 3 the joburg has to be prefaced with in this lifetime on every question form 6a as it speaks of preclears etc is already limited in time in prepchecking the middle ruds use in auditing before each question or other appropriate limitations the zero must not swing the pc down the whole track as middle rudiments then become unanswerable and fruitful source of missed withholds middle rudiments in repetitive prepchecking the middle rudiments can be fast checked hco bulletin of july 21962 using the package question in this session is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of if one of the four reads use it singly to clean it in the same worded question and do the remainder of the middle ruds singly in this session is there anything you have failed to reveal use the middle rudiments fast checked every time you clean zero question whether the pc had answers for it or not prepchecking the middle rudiments to begin or end series of sessions such as an intensive prepcheck also the middle rudiments in such prepchecking the middle ruds for havingness sessions the zeros are as follows since i have been auditing you is there anything you have suppressed since i have been auditing you is there anything you have invalidated since i have been auditing you isthere anything you have failed to reveal since i have been auditing you is there anything you have been careful of to these standards add in the same question form suggested failed to suggest revealed told any half truths told any untruths damaged anyone influenced the meter failed to answer question failed to answer command and since i have been auditing you have you shifted your attention flatten off with ow as below ow assists as prepcheck by form and even beginning rudiments are not calculated to handle pc who is very distraught before the start of session by reason of upsets in life howling ptps accompanied by misemotion or who is too ill physically to settle into auditing an earlier rudiment immediately after start of session can be used this is general ow overtwithhold what have you done what have you withheld these are run alternately this is never run on terminal ie what have you done to george etc only the general type command is now used when the pc is much better go into the usual rudiments note this is by the way the best repetitive process for an assist this is run to nul needle on both questions if either gives an instant read continue to run both until both are nul much as in steps one two three and four of repetitive prepchecking when used to flatten off prepcheck on the middle rudiments whether for prepchecking or for goals type or ordinary repetitive prepchecking the ow command wording is as follows since i have been auditing you what have you done since i have been auditing you what have you withheld both must be nul to conclude the process if either is found alive on the needle run both when used to begin session or when used to prepcheck the middle ruds ow must be followed by fast check of the mid ruds summary this type of prepcheckingrepetitive prepcheckingis more easily done and more thorough than prepchecking by the withhold system and its earlier forefather security checking it replaces both of these in view of the fact that the same system is used for repetitive rudiments hco bulletin of july 2 l962 by learning one the student also learns the other thus saving lot of time in study and training repetitive prepchecking replaces former auditing requirements for class iia and is the class ii skill it should be thoroughly instilled in the auditor that extra doingness by the auditor is detractive from the system and that every additive is liability not required in the system and liable to upset the pc it is must that the auditor be very capable with tr4 and that the auditormakes attempt to shut off routine pc originations as the intensity of in sessionness generated by modern model session used with repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking is such as to make the arc breaks quite shattering to the pc if tr4 is bad if repetitive prepchecking is run right with good metering the only remaining source of missed withholds is the inadvertent withhold caused by bad tr4 the pc said it but the auditor didnt understand it this bulletin culminates three years of exhaustive research into the formation of model session rudiments and the handling of overts and overcoming the limitations of the auditor and student in handling sessions this coming with the broad success of routine 3ga rounds out auditing from raw meat to clear for all cases capable of speech these techniques represent

only of question whereas the question thought major is actually nul pc can be checked on the end words of rudiments questions and the charge on those single words can be made known and the question turned around to avoid the last words charge example are you willing to talk to about your difficulties the word difficulties said to the pc by itself gives an instant read remedy test difficulties if it reads as itself then change the question to concerning your difficulties are you willing to talk to this will only react when the pc is unwilling to do so caution this trouble of end words reading by themselves occurs mainly in the presence of weak tr1 and failure to groove in the question to thought major with good tr1 the end words read only when the question is asked in practice you only investigate this when the pc insists strongly that the question is nul then test the end word for lone reaction and turn the question about to make it end with another end word question not to have words changed only shifted in order then groove it in and test it for instant read if it still reacts as question thought major then of course it is not nul and should be answered clean change hco bulletin july 3 1962 to read do not pay attention to any reaction consequent to asking do you agree that that is clean trying to handle reaction to this second question is too involved for ordinary handling if the main question reads nul ignore read on do you agree that is clean double cleaning cleaning rudiment that has already registered nul gives the pc missed withhold of nothingness his nothingness was not accepted the pc has answer missed noanswer then occurs this is quite serious once you see rudiment is clean let it go to ask again something already nul is to leave the pc

back to basics today in auditing the forerunners of practically everything done today can be found in dmsmh and dianetics the original thesis suddenly also we are back to repetitive processes which auditors have always had success with except for the question of whether the process is flat in the 17th acc lrh had just lectured on comm lags the next day he asked how you could tell whether the process was flat one could answer the difficulty is solved with this method of using repetitive questions they are flat at precise point ones troubles can come only from not reading the meter or not believing it either will bring about an upset pc model session repetitive per hcob 4jul62 bulletin changes significant change is havingness or the room rudiment being dropped from beginning rudiments although retained in end ruds see also hcob 23jun62 model session revised has all ruds except havingness as auditing questions to be handled repetitively you would think that slugging the pc with this many processes in one session would be catastrophic it is if done poorly if you overrun by one question the pc is in the soup likewise if you ask one question too few you get missed withholds so either never ask for ow or do it right you cant avoid the fact of missing withholds matter what you try you can miss withhold just by walking in the room so you cant just not ask questions and if you ask question you must ask exactly the right number of questions some cases one in twelve even think you should know everything they are thinking in these cases any question you ask shows that you didnt know so you miss the withhold see hcob 12jul62 motivatorish cases this is the theetieweetie case the way someone got in that state was too much pretended knowingness on the part of others plus overts against questions if this type of person exists or if many people get into this state and they do and if man keeps being active while being secretive which he will then it is inevitable that you will miss withholds an people so you must learn to run ow and repetitive processes perfectly not just fairly well it is rather easy to do repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking perfectly the only problem is that with some cases you have to add to another to the done question otherwise the pc will give motivatorish answers which spins him in and the question will never clear auditing is as successful as it is predictable to the pc auditors get spoiled by howling success following an unusual solution this includes lrh such success can hang an auditor up and get him stuck in the win the more we learn about the mind the fewer unusual solutions we need and the more textbook the solutions become this is measure of an auditors understanding of what he is doing if he wins with an unusual solution it wont give consistent wins as time goes by he may get so many loses that he ultimately stops auditing the closer we get to clearing the fewer unusual solutions we look for to clear everybody you have to know how everybodys mind works weve got that at this point we only need to modify the tech to make the result easier for all auditors to get two things monitor our tech 1 the results 2 the ease with which auditors can be trained up to where they can obtain the results the ease of application of the processes the problems are these pc is built like universe there is pride postulate on top of which mass accumulated human being is determined to be such merely by having human body doll has the same kind of bank as human the pcs bank is not native to thecorporeal self he is packing around as an identification card incidentally doll bodies rot drunk by inhaling alcohol vapors actually drinking would wreck the machinery we dramatize this nowadays with the brandy snifter any mass accumulated to the pc accumulates on his prime postulate the prime postulate is the basic purpose or goal of person there can be secondary prime postulate in any lifetime it is the alteration of the prime postulate that occurs in the course of trying to put it into effect that causes mass to accumulate from the shift of attention and direction that inhibits the persons ability to asis change of attention is change and energy is change there is lot to be understood about how mass evolves out of alterisness if something goes from point to point b with change point must be point b by introducing space you introduce via space is via that causes and necessitates change in or of anything occurring within it that is one of the first things that happens in the course of building universe once you have time shift of attention causes motionlessness in time accumulation dissipation interchanges of masses dislocations in space etc after awhile we get an individual who obsessively changes there are two things wrong with human personality 1 too much constancy 2 too much inconstancy auditors do these two things they resist change even when it is sensible and they obsessively introduce change when it is not required constancy without understanding without reason is simply characteristic of mest so is change one should understand why one is being constant before being constant one should also understand what he is undertaking before he introduces alteration unlike life oddly enough auditing does not necessarily bring about its own track and its own mass because it is short track and it is singularly deprived of duress it is not something to worry about unless done in knuckleheaded fashion which puts person beyond help that would be crime you could audit someone badly enough it would probably take auditing him on the wrong goal to kill him perhaps but it would take some doing in prepchecking we had problem there is problem of alteration and problem of too great constancy one of the problems is that an inconstancy of approach by the auditor causes more trouble than an unusual solution heals buttons can be wonderful in the right circumstances but if the auditor is inventing them intuiting what is needed they can improve the pcs case but they lower his confidence because he cant predict what the auditor will say next the pc keeps coming out of session with his attention on the auditor this violates the definition of insessionness if you have constancy that works the four midruds that takes lot of edge off the case there could be more but what you are trying to do with model session is to make the pc auditable and to cause him to continue to be auditable the virtue of model session lies not in its processing value but in its predictability value and in the fact that it takes the edge off the things most likely to distract the pc hidden in any case is basic purpose prime postulate and earlier prime postulates it is amazing that we even have processes like model session and prepchecking that do something for the case over the top of those goals it is incredible that these processes make the pc feel better all the auditor wants them to do is to smooth out the needle so that he can find the pcs goal the conflict of goals is the senior aberration on the case any alteration of goal adds mass to it and the bank it is amazing that you can handle handle case phenomena with other processes assists etc but you cant solve the case permanently without recourse to goalsit is difficult and sometimes impossible to help someone who has overts against that which is trying to help him you have to set the pc up by getting them off dont get spoiled by having good luck with one pc most require setup the other problem is metering you can ruin an emeters effectiveness on gradient by not quite really cleaning ruds as you hit them by neglecting instant reads an inexperienced auditor who overlooks the tiny reads that occur on ruds questions can easily and shortly get the pc into barely readable meter which only reads on the greatest of greats the auditor misses withholds from there on out that is the problem ending cycle too soon on ruds because of missing reads the other problem is being too careful and cleaning ruds that are already clean model session run strictly by the book is still not muzzled session the auditor still must maintain 2wc with the pc and can make sure the pc is content the rud is clean too many auditors withdraw from the session leaving model session to do the job and the pc wondering whether we are alive at all an advantage of repetitive rudiments is that only one skill is needed for repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking one of the problems is teaching number of technologies or procedures it is better to have one done superlatively than ten done indifferently repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking tend to get the pc talking to you cheerfully and happily blowing things and feeling better if they dont you are probably doing something unusual with them6207c10 shspec169 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part ii repetitive process is one that is run over and over with the pc answering and the auditor acknowledging it is run to precise flat point when used with ruds and prepchecking you run it to clean needle and further beginning ruds would always he done repetitive early in auditing you would also do middle and end rudiments repetitively it is kind of prepcheck in disguise thereafter you would run middle and end ruds as fast ruds you would normally run the random rudiment missed withhold as fast rudiment not as repetitive rudiment you may have to fish around for it be very sure you get it answered the repetitive rud approach was first used in sec checking where it was quite successful prepchecking using the withhold system running chains was too hard to teach auditors also this system is hard to use with poorly reading arc breaky pc it is not as successful as repetitive prepchecking the average auditor gets more done with repetitive prepchecking and the pc gets into session better with this method dont use more rudiments than you find in model session though you can make them understandable eg to child if you seem to need more rudiments you still have the solution the arc breaky pc comes to pieces on ow so ow is added to model session it can be used when the pc is so involved in some upset that he cant pay any attention to the rest of the session his attention is so fixated that any change of his attention will lead to arc breaks and upsets the other time ow is used is when pc is seriously ill too ill to be audited this situation is handled with general ow as the first rudiment general ow goes into model session right after start of session the commands are what have you done to another withheld from another it is not run against the meter it is run against the pc it can get his ta moving some pcs with highly automatic bank with everything grouped and all in motion will give you multiple picture reaction when you ask them one question the pc goes all over the time track this is not very common but when you run into it it is hard to control the pc and they cant run well on anything except ow the pc who complains of auditing result is likely to have an automatic bank you will find this out if you ask what is happening when you give the pc command however these pcs will respond to ow and get excellent ta so if you notice that you had gotten good ta on ow just move it into the body of the session otherwise run it until the pc feels much better and then do the ruds if you notice that you had gotten ta on ow when you never had much on anything else resume the ow you cant really run the ta out of it because of the breadth of the question if the pc comes into session arc broken all that would happen if you asked are you willing to talk to about your difficulties would be screams and snarls letting the pc commit overts against the auditor you dont ask what have you done to etc because you may be allergic on his terminal line besides this would be putting the pcs attention on the auditor but you can run general ow if the pc seems to be withholding things and having hard time you can use missed withhold as random rudiment thats what random means can be used at any time checked against the meter so you can use ow and the pc will eventually settle down and look calmer then go into your ruds if one of the questions may have read when you checked it and you are not sure dont pretend give the pc the rfactor that the read is equivocal and recheck ideally your metering should be so good that you use the ta to control the needle so that it is sitting exactly at set exactly at the end of your question not still bouncing back from somewhere else never try to read needle on fast rise always distrust fast rises goal doesnt have enough impulse to read down against fast rise it will show up as tiny slow if you see it read at all the needle that is flying around has inertia and slight read can get missed so be suspicious and dont hesitate to call read equivocal and recheck be sure it is clean before you call itclean or the pc will know that he is getting by the meter and will read less and less on the meter you will then have to go back over all your earlier zero questions and see that one gave tiny read dont miss it this time clean them all up and you will build the case back to reading well the only time in rudiments that you ask pc to amplify or reneat his answer is when you didnt understand it if you fake an understanding you are disturbing the knowingness button this button is the most serious one you can push in case dont fail to understand the pc while acting as though you do the onus of understanding and of making something understood is on the auditor tr4 is not q and you are asking for comprehension so that an asisness can take place you ask rudiment question until the pc has more answers without checking the meter if you get read on checking the question you use it to guide the pc who doesnt know what it was into seeing what was still there after getting the pcs answer you then leave the meter until the pc says again because he will now give you all the locks when it is clean ask do you agree that was clean and tr4 whatever he says dont go back to the rudiment if he says he doesnt agree the exact same procedure is used for repetitive prepchecking it depends on the mechanism of cycling on the track to pick up the basic pcs will stay in session quite cheerily with this it takes longer than using the withhold system but it is much easier and more certain as long as you clean all the reads you get the pc will be cheerful and easy to audit if you miss few the pc will become nattery and hard to audit by virtue of not reading well if you make the opposite mistake of asking the question again after it was clean hell hath arc breaks like the one you have thereby set up this is because thetan is closest to nothing and you have given him nothingness withhold missed withhold of nothing that is very upsetting to thetan because 1 there is nothing there so he cant spot it or asis it 2 he is closest to nothing himself so he feels as if he himself has been missed you didnt buy nothing so nothing is unacknowledged so therefore he is unacknowledged so dont try to clean read that is not there this system of repetitive rudiments and prepchecking has liability it pulls the pc thoroughly into session and builds up fantastic arc between the auditor and the pc then if the auditor speaks his mind inopportunely or goes on automatic the arc break will be magnitudinous just because of the degree to which the pc is in session this system was invented because due to the fact that pcs were not well in session auditors were having trouble getting pcs to read on the meter auditor tr1 also contributed to the problem commonly and in social context meter is inoperative the pc has to be in session to some degree for the meter to react at all social conversation wont activate meter the better arc you have with the pc the better the meter reads meters are not like lie detectors lie detector reads because of terror an emeter reads on arc the pc knows that it doesnt matter what overt he gets off you are not going to turn him in if you miss reads they operate as missed withholds and the pc ceases to read well the repetitive system gets the pc talking about his case before you read the meter so it will work where nothing else does6207c12 shspec174 meter reading scientific research follows certain laws and we have been rigorous in following those laws in scientology when you can get research problem down to one variable voila you are there during the last couple of months having observed that auditors werent uniformly getting unvarying results lrh took every variable out of technology that he could stripping it down and testing it to the point where we now have model session and repetitive prepchecking the meter once developed had to be refined and it was yet pcs were still wobbly at times so last night lrh watched three auditors to see what they were doing and found the one variable the meter read it works out this way all you have to do to louse up session is 1 clean one thing that is clean or 2 miss cleaning something that reacts there is little to choose as to which is the most serious person has certain knowingness matter how occluded and packed in he is the thetan always knows there is instinct as intuitiveness he knows you cant fool pc an auditor who tries is misguided pc knows when question is hot even if he doesnt know the answer he also knows when question is cold he has somethingnothing sensitivity he requires help to know what is there or to get high degree of certainty that there is nothing there his intuitive feelingness is not articulate and there is need to transfer it over into an analytical knowingness when you invalidate the knowingness of thetan you will get trouble the thetan can put up with this but he doesnt have to like it he doesnt like it even though he is used to it and has put up with got of it and been overwhelmed by it he has used it as pitch on others and to overwhelm others pcs arc breaks with his auditor are much more serious than his arc breaks with others you have heightened the pcs intuitive feelingness by putting him in session now if you tell him rud is out when it is in or in when he knows it is out he has long way to fall from his heightened insession awareness and elevated tone level it is severe shock and he gets an arc break he is now out of agreement with the auditor to the degree that he was formerly in agreement if youve got an agreement thats built as high as the empire state building the first scrap of disagreement will appear as high as that the pc will feel awful he is finally on the road to truth after all the trillenia and here is falsity it is very upsetting cleaning clean is the mistake that is most mysterious because the pc cant find what is wrong because it is nothing you can flub once on trs and still have the session going ok but if you leave one flubbed read your session will go to pot if you are accustomed to auditing with sloppy metering you have completely different idea of what auditing is like the things that are supposed to be in session arent there and auditing is basically protest not letting the auditor get too close auditing is as fast as pc is in session since the more he is in session the more easily he blows things pc is there to be audited and is very persistent as thetan thetan can he squashed and overwhelmed yet he never stops trying this is very noticeable in handling children thetan will keep reaching using disabilities to do so if all else fails if you set up perfect session and then and wild wrongness at some point you catch the pc offbalance and he goes into action reactively he is powerless to stop himself from acting it is as if you had the bank all stretched out like rubber band and someone suddenly let go of one end he is in mess he gets overwhelmed and starts dramatizing whatever is handy namely one of thousands of instances where he is still trying he will take such an incident and use it against the auditor this can get rather subtle the pc can convince the auditor that he has obtained results but then let someone else see that he hasnt made any progress he does this in such way that the auditor will find out about it it is good to know that meter reading is all that is wrong auditors have learned trs model session and repetitive prepchecking fine and we have taken havingness out of beginning ruds to eliminate that source of difficulty when we found that havingness takes the pcs attention off the bank and extroverts him which isnt good for putting the pc in session it is better to use ow to get his havingness up this also puts his attention on the bank your problems with pcs are the same old things communication control keeping the pcs attention on what he is doing getting your question answered etc you have mastered these things then sometimes had them deteriorate at which point you have been persuaded into unusual solutions q and doing something else getting anxious etc the pc is out of session its baffling what happens to cause this outofsessionness you missed meter read this wrongness may be missed by all the instructors and supervisors who see all the wrongnesses that follow from it and correct them to result lots of other wrongnesses may get located but they arent really what wrecks the session the ultimate session wrecker is the misread meter this arc breaks the pc all to hell he will start reading on arc breaks not reading because of arc breaks etc and you wind up with dogs breakfast this results from the calling of reads that arent there and missing the ones that are there the missed withholds and the missed withholds of nothing if this goes on for many sessions the pc goes on selfaudit because he doesnt trust the meter the pc cant have an auditor because he cant have the meter so he audits himself he gets anxious he keeps his own rudiments in like gopher sitting at the edge of his hole ready to duck the pc is running the session on himself purely because of bad meter calls so metering above all must be perfect there is tolerance whatever in it you must not miss single read meter reading must be perfect or you become dangerous auditor dangerous auditor is one who might miss read just one in session if read is equivocal say so and check again6207c12 shspec175 meter training auditors make mistakes reading meters while the basic reason for this is in their banks poor metering can be countered educationally the first requirement for accurate reading of meter is good eyesight the first thing we find wrong is that the auditor cant see it may he necessary for him to wear glasses unpopular though that is amongst scientologists when case assessment form on new pc we should take something with extremely small print like railway timetable or the stock market report in the newspaper and hold it as far from the pcs face as meter would be and have him read it if he can read it make note on the assessment form that his eyesight is good with glasses if that is true if he cant read it put down eyesight poor this will make ds of p and ds of t aware that his metering may be suspect when he starts to audit check eyesight again when doing practical sections on auditing courses since persons eyesight changes with auditing recheck the eyesight if as an auditor he gets crammed for gae lets assume that all auditors who goof have something wrong with metering how wide is present time this is the next area to look into one could have an awareness of present time as much as ten minutes wide lrh has this at least for movie and tv plots clear can tell fifty to hundred feet before an intersection whether there is anything coming he may find himself seeing the truck coming around the corner before it does he is not looking around corners he may think that it is new linear perception but it is not its just that pt has gotten bit wider than the instant that most people perceive he has wider fringe of knowingness really sharp athlete also has wider pt for instance sam snead can look from the point of driving the ball to the point where it lands and know where it lands as he hits it great athletes control both ends of broadened pt so you get holeinone perfectly placed serve etc they are always exterior and the axioms seem very obvious to them they dont think of their present time as continued motion motion doesnt happen randomly in their pt they think of it as continued control when they are doing something they are controlling all the motion in that present time because they are in that present time and they have the width of that present time to decide it is as if at the end of two seconds they could undecide what they decided at the beginning of the two seconds so they have tremendous judgment they know which decision is right because they saw it happen they can perceive both motion and stillness as total isness then theres the guy whose pt is one thousandth of second wide he is in continuous anxiety and regret it is always all wrong that is crazy mans present time he doesnt even know if the bed will continue to sit on the floor you only get the idea of continuance by perceiving across span of time not by comparing different times the less pt person has the more trouble he has with the perception of motion and stillness so you can run look around here and tell something you are absolutely certain will be here in one second and keep increasing the timespan you could drill the persons perception into broadening of pt you could also run look around here and find something thats having an effect on an effect or look around this room and find something thats having an effect on something else the latter will occasionally turn on very widened pt such processes are really drills rather than processes an auditor needs to have broader pt than most if he is to be able to spot speeded rise for instance reading meter is spotting motion nomotion and change of rate of motion when it exists this is beyond perception it is matter of consecutive awareness there are three moments that must be perceived to find out if needle is still 1 the moment before it wasnt moving 2 the moment it is still it isnt moving 3 the moment after it will not moveyou need comparison you are not just looking at one moment moving needle requires only two observations two moments of awareness thus it is easier to read than still needle for instance sitting pheasant is harder to see than moving pheasant not because motion attracts the eye or some such reason but because motion requires only two observations to perceive while stillness requires three motion takes part of the responsibility for directing attention whereas stillness takes responsibility for directing attention in perceiving motion all you have to do is to observe that something was in place and is now in place how narrowly can places and b be spaced and still have perceptible motion between them one tenth of the width of the tip of the needle apart the next question is what section of the present time you are in do you require to perceive an action or an inaction this opens the door to the solution of this problem broadening pt is best done by clearing but it wouldnt work to insist that auditors must be clear before they can clear someone actually clear raw meat with comprehension or reality on what has happened is enormously inferior to someone who has the data and goes clear training gives subjective reality on what it is like to wrestle with the problems of clearing someone trained individuals have capability to understand people while clear raw meat is likely to be very impatient with people raw clear will also ask the damndest questions he is very oddball and unpredictable this guy has been launched into the atmosphere and expected to fly without knowing that he is in plane it is better to go clear with the data you get more comprehending people that way because it takes more time to see stillness an individual has less tolerance for it hence person is impatient with observing stillnesses his continuance has to be too great stillnesses absorb time they give sense of foreverness something that moves does not have to have such continuance however the period of time required to perceive motion or stillness can be shortened until the person can observe in the tiniest narrowest pt three moments stillness or two moments motion of time you do this by practice and drill if persons span of pt is twentieth of second long he would need to be able to perceive an instant of time that is longer than sixtieth of second in order to be able to observe three moments in time in his pt and therefore to be able to perceive that the needle is still he must be able to perceive an isness that is only sixtieth of second long the amount of pt someone can observe can be tested with camera you could set the lens wide open and vary exposure time the less pt span they can observe the smaller the diameter of lens that they will be able to perceive at given speed suitable target would be to get to where we can perceive an isness in hundred and twenty fifth of second people can be drilled to get up to this speed without broadening their pt you could do it gradiently by flashing say slide of chair for one second over and over until the students can actually tell you all about the chair then cut it down to half second quarter of second etc until you reach hundred and twentyfifth of second the student will gradiently improve until he can get everything in the slide in hundred and twentyfifth of second the name for the viewing device is variable speed tachistoscope the navy used this system during world war ii for an aircraft identification drill it is now being used to teach reading and to improve reading speed even without these devices you can learn to read meter this is necessary and now we know that it will he done the result of the training should be an auditor who can tell that still needle is present given only twentieth to sixtieth of seconds observation time the old saw about the eye having shutter speed of about atwentyfifth of second is stupid lie there is thetan in back of the eye who has width of pt and who tends to fixate on what he considers an observable momenthubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco

order of importance of accurate nevermiss meter reading all bad auditing results have now been traced to inaccuracy in meter reading other aspects of session should be perfect but if the session even vaguely following pattern session comes to grief it is only meter reading accuracy that is at fault i have carefully ferreted this fact out there is only one constant error in sessions that produce results or poor results inaccurate meter reading this is also true for student and veteran auditors alike when an auditor starts using unusual solutions he or she was driven to them by the usual solution not working the usual solution always works unless the meter needle reading is inaccurate if an auditor is using unusual solutions then that auditors meter reading is inaccurate given this consequent arc breaks and failures drive the auditor to unusual solutions d of p who has to dish out unusual solutions has auditors who are missing meter reads meter reading must be perfect every session what is perfect 1 never try to clean read that is already clean 2 never miss an instant reaction of the needle if you try to clean clean rudiment the pc has the missed withhold of nothingness the auditor wont accept the origination or reply of nothingness this can cause huge arc break worse than missing somethingness nothingness is closer to thetan than somethingness if you miss an instant reaction you hang the pc with missed withhold and the results can be catastrophicif you fumble and have to ask two or three times the read damps out the meter can become inoperative on that pc for the session if you miss on one rudiment the next even if really hot can seem to be nul by reason of arc break meter goes nul on gradient scale of misses by the auditor the more misses the less the meter reads meter perfection means only accurate reading of the needle on instant reads it is easily attained an auditor should never miss on needle reaction to do so is the basis of all unsuccessful sessions whatever else was wrong with the session it began with bad meter reading other auditing actions are important and must be done well but they can all be overthrown by one mistake in metering 1 never clean clean needle 2 never miss read unless metering perfection is attained by an auditor he or she will continue to have trouble with preclears the source of all upset is the missed withhold the most fruitful source of missed withholds is poor metering the worst tr 4 is failure to see that there is nothing there or failing to find the something that is there on an emeter this is important field auditors academies and hgcs are all being deprived of the full benefit of processing results by the one read missed out of the 200 that were not missed it is that critical good pro by actual inspection is at this moment missing about eight or nine reads per session calling one that is clean read and failing to note read that read this is the 5 to 1 ratio noted between hgc auditing and my

exposed as the one point that must be done perfectly there is tr4 phenomenon connected with the meter the meter read wrong at all operates to throw tr4 out in the session the pc has an answer which the meter hasnt acknowledged as far as the pc can tell so he gets mad at the meter really but not knowing what to get mad at he misassigns the blame and his anger to something else the pc has had withhold missed or the auditor cleans clean he calls read where there isnt one and the meter starts reacting on the pcs arc break incidentally the wording of listing lines has been amended see p 259 for original wording on wantnot want the wording has to use the exact warding of the goal eg to catch cats not the goal to catch cats and on opposenot oppose it has to be the participial form eg catching cats precise english is very junior in importance to wording it as given by the pc in the metering errors mentioned above only one thing is occurring you are violating an old overlooked law that you mustnt acknowledge lie or accept lie as truth what is this about it is about prime postulate see the discussion of the first four postulates 3ga demonstrates the similarity of construction between reactive bank and universe universe is formed by prime postulate which then alterised makes matter energy space and time the pc has basic purpose or goal indistinguishable from prime postulate therefore prime postulate or the pcs basic goal or purpose is the basic building block of the reactive bank the prime prime postulate would be the basicbasic of the goal or purpose on which all else would be stuck cf expanded dianetics you wont get it on the first try you cant just date it on the meter and have it blow because it has occurred earlier and has gotten mingled in with later occurrences so dont worry about it just take what you get on goals list the keynote of the reactive bank with all its masses spaces and everything else in it is alter is which suppresses down into notis this forms the mest that is contained in the bank the same mechanism exactly applies to the formation of the physical universe thus the field of the mind is parallel to that of the physical universe but the mind came first and thus formed the universe it is fantastic for being to discover this because this discovery is in violation of the principle behind the formation of matter space etc this discovery reverses the downward spiral what starts the downward spiral and makes it denser is acceptance of alteris as fact this is something every thetan knows way down deep he must not do and what every thetan that ever got in trouble has done thetan gets nervous when he starts to suspect that he has been accepting alteris as fact if he accepts too many alter ises as fact he goes into an overwhelm he is overwhelmed by lies the priests of muggy muggy god made out of mud can make lots of converts using this principle if everyone protests muggy muggy the lie enough and if the priests can collect to themselves enough motivators in other words if they can can get the people to commit enough overts against muggy muggy muggy muggy overwhelms the people this is how you get zealots fanatics and atheists they all form chaotic mess resulting from fighting an alteris of the facts religious mechanisms have been the most powerful source of alterisness of mind and forms they get protested against most strongly and thetans get overwhelmed by them most easily the biggest alteris you could make is the misassignment of source of creation or alteris of thought these exist in the seventh and eighth dynamics the most fruitful source of lies and commotion is anything that has to do with creation false assignment of the source of creation produces randomity all out of proportion to the act of making the false assignment this act is in itself the father of all chaos being almost on the truth makes it very bad the most powerful protests follow the most extreme alterisnesses hence the violence of religious wars if you misassign the source of any part of cycle of action in fact you will get grossly disproportionate upset try going to museum during an exhibition of rembrandt andpointing out all the picassos people will argue with you and get very misemotional etc any chaos in the universe will be found to exist by reason of misassignment of who created it for instance george washington is thought to be one of the sources of of the us government yet the fact that he actually tore up the minutes of the constitutional convention is virtually unknown this is what is wrong with the us there is lot of missing data concerning its source we dont know what the basic purpose of the founding fathers was basic purpose alterised creates mass and degeneration of tone people who think lrh has alterised scientology and dianetics dont realize that we are operating on backwards track cutting into the most fundamental fundamental we can cut into regardless of the forward progress of time we are swimming against the timestream suddenly on isolation of importances we are back in the early fifties with basic purpose and prime postulate this is all book one stuff see p 270 above weve gone down some blind alleys like 3dxx if you do 3dxx line or prehav line you are listing wrong things which just adds more alteris to the bank 3dxx was the ridge that lrh found before prime purpose 3dxx was alterising the pcs goal we have gone forward on the time track and at the same time we have run the fundamentals back now we are at fundamental that runs out everything that we have put on the time track unless you follow some such pattern as this pattern of scientology research you cant backtrack the complexity of structure of mind or universe to simplicity sufficient to do something about it thats what we have done and we find to our great surprise that what is wrong with the pc is his prime postulate his goal thats unexpected thats weird complete whizzer george washington is not what is right with the us he is what is wrong with the us similarly pcs goal is what is wrong with the pc if the individual is longer able to adequately do something its probably his goal itll be the one thing that kinda makes you sigh and that you retreat from goal itself isnt really what is wrong with the person it is really the alteris of his goal departures from his goal line his inabilities to commit this goal to action that is what gives him his bank if he never altered his goal he would probably he all right the pcs goal was selfpostulated truth that never got acknowledged but all around him lies got acknowledged and this baffled him thats really all the thetan is protesting truth never gets acknowledged and lies always get acknowledged thats the basis of thetans misemotions all thetans operate on these same buttons so when you make it clear in session that you are not acknowledging or taking up truth the pc gets upset thats cleaning clean read when you say he has something he hasnt got he gets upset he also gets upset when you say he hasnt got something that he has got cleaning clean or missing read is an alteris and an acknowledgment of lie nothing upsets pc or thetan more than this so misreading the meter is betrayal that strikes at the heart of his thetanesque soul he will try from then on to get the truth of the matter across to you you dont have pc anymore you have crusader for truth armed and mounted we mustnt have more alteris than weve already dot because that is how we got in this mess in the first place an arc break is an abandonment of truth and an acknowledgment of lies in session you are running extreme truth and the pc knows it he can feel it every time you misread meter you have entered lie into the session this is the thetans favorite bogeyman you have just hit on the issue of the whole construction and destruction of universes and of his bank and he doesnt like it being that way you have made the session agree with all the slave tricks that have ever been pulled on him when he thought you were his friend getting him untrapped so put in lie misread the meter and all hell breaks loose thats why it is essential to read meter correctly every time it is doable so dont worry about not being able to learn howhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of

verify that condition and in central organization should have it observed by an hco area secretary any auditor obtaining free needle on all lines continuously the state of first goal clear should on the saint hill course demonstrate that condition to an instructor and in central organization to an hco area secretary an instructor or hco area secretary should make statement on the auditing report testifying to the fact and existence of the free needle in short there are two stages of observationthe first free needle obtained on one line and the state of continuous free needle on all lines verbal statement by an auditor not otherwise confirmed as above is to be given credence or be used to establish the condition of case the early observation on one line being difficult to maintain for observation is not mandatory but if not verified as above may not be claimed the state of first goal clear is established by 1 free needle on each line listed from the goal 2 reaction of the goal on the meter after final prepcheck on that goal as per hco policy letter 15 july 1962 3 tone arm near clear read free needle is not stage 4 needle or an inverted stage 4 it is floating and free in

someone he or she is clear when they are not we are on solid ground with technology and procedure lets keep it that way the goal has been sought on earth for 2500 years we have achieved 8 first goal

hcob 30ju162 smooth hgc 25 hour intensive ive just found way to use middle rudiments and make them double in brass and get the job done much better in prepchecking suppress suggest careful of invalidate and fail to reveal are powerful prepcheck buttons they should be used in the above order used in this order you have the midruds as complete prepcheck the middle rudiments were carefully sorted out of great number of buttons that could be used you could add another fifteen or twenty buttons the chart of attitudes see handbook for preclears has lot of them ruds are buttons that consist of just those things that can keep one of the other buttons from reading and which if present can keep goal or item from reading they are pretty powerful suppress if you got suppress off the case nearly everything would blow if suppress is alive you dont get read on the remainder of the buttons so run suppress before adding another series of anything suggest this button could be and sometimes has to be translated as isness that is evaluation per the auditors code 1 it says that something is it is powerful button because you say something is it will now read even though it wasnt reading before you say something reads which doesnt and the pc can jam on it and it will now read it will at least read on disagreement suggest neednt be used in midruds since auditors dont do it much save it for prepchecks invalidate if goal or item is invalidated it will read even when it is not the goal or item get the inval off and it will longer read suppress on top of inval keeps the inval from showing up that is why suppress goes first as button fail to reveal this button is off the line it gives you the dirty needle minute rockslam careful of this is another suppress with an added characteristic after the person has been having something little offbeat done for little while he can hang up in the thing if he becomes too careful of something or other he can also make an item read by reverse suppression by carefully not suppressing it ie by making sure it reads the order of the buttons would be suppress suggest careful of invalidate fail to reveal this is an optimum arrangement that puts the most important button last as far as session foulups are concerned this also gives you two cracks at suppression if these buttons are so strong they must have some value they make great prepcheck zero questions as lrh found more or less by accident while cleaning up pc who had been feeling poorlythe procedure for the problems intensive is as follows see also p 134 above and hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion as well as the current hcob of 30jul62 1 sort out the chief selfdetermined change the pc has made using assessment by elimination or greatest read for purposes of assessment each change should be expressed in few words plus date 2 get the confusion that preceded the change and date it keep the pc to the just prior confusion this should be anywhere from five minutes to two weeks earlier dont let the pc go way back on the track 3 go month earlier in case he didnt remember the overt that started the confusion 4 prepcheck since the above date when you use the above procedure pcs are very willing to tell you things they have suppressed somatics come off also dont also check midruds on the period you are prepchecking you might think that you wouldnt reach basic on any chain by using the above method of prepchecking but since you are taking up the buttons in this sequence and they seem like such innocent buttons they clear away lot of track without your having to worry about fundamentals and basic omitting the withhold system left us with way to get to basic it appears that with this system you dont have to bother you could start in all over again if the pc had given it shallow pass on the first time through and pick up deeper fundamentals however the hazard in doing so is that you might be cleaning clean also be very sure not to leave question unflat that is very important since in so doing you could give him missed withholds and he could blow or create big storm and feel terrible for fiftyhour intensive you could also do prepcheck in this lifetime this system gets the pcs withholds easily and voluntarily just be sure to follow the rules and dont be an idiot make sure the pc understands the question to audit small child you might have to reword it to get it to communicate on any pc you want to be sure to communicate know what you are trying to communicate if you find the pc unable to answer or with very few answers dont blame it on the pcs caginess or unwillingness you have to more the communication so it does bite if you do that the prepcheck will unstack the bank in its natural sequence which is always desirable in sec checking and prepchecking it is very repetitive action there is another way to use repetitive prepchecking 1 sort out by assessment the persons selfdetermined decisions get the most charged old time problems intensive style make sure it is selfdetermined 2 date the problem 3 date the confusion prior to the decision found in 1 the pc will slide away from the prior confusion if you dont keep him looking for it dont let him find one five years before it is justprior confusion 4 date the beginning of the prior confusion and go month earlier 5 prepcheck it since date found in 4 pc tends to see himself as pawn on the board of life the liability of taking an other determined chain is that you will get into chain of engrams this system doesnt handle engrams so watch it it is ok however to get sometimes coming off on dating the prior confusion if you let the date he few years earlier you will miss it the prior confusion is theperiod when he was creating the problem for which the decision is solution the sequence for this this mechanism is 1 the pc commits overts all over the place and has withholds missed on him like mad 2 this causes problem for him 3 he makes decision to solve the problem this is the selfdetermined change all this is part of an effort to make prepchecking beefier and more effective and farreaching you might feel shy of doing prepcheck if you werent pretty sure of getting good result somatics and conditions like postpartum depression will blow without your having to run engrams and getting the pc stuck in the incident the success you will have will depend on the excellence of your meter reading how thoroughly the pc is in session and how well you clean up each question prepchecking is relatively permissive system that gradiently lets the pc get himself into confrontable soup it doesnt overwhump the pc but it must be metered righthubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 30 july 1962 franchise smooth hgc 25 hour intensive here is the pattern for new problems intensive that can be given by hgc or field auditors and which will get them marvellous results on new or old pcs this arrangement makes prepchecking come into its own for if it is well done then the pc is fairly well set up for having his goal found this intensive is amazingly easy to run providing that the auditor does it pretty well muzzled and does not violate repetitive prepchecking drill of course if the auditors meter reading is not perfect and if the auditor is not cognizant of recent hco bulletins on the meter and if the auditor misses as many as two reads in session this whole result can wind up in fiasco if the pc doesnt feel better on this one then the auditor just didnt read the meter or miserably flubbed current drill of these two the d of p had better suspect the meter readings if anything goes wrong the first thing to do is complete the old case assessment form we do this in model session and check after each small section of it as to whether weve missed withhold on the pc we then assess the selfdetermined change list and dont goof and put other determined changes on the pcs change list or well be assessing engrams we find the most important most reacting change in the pcs life by the largest read this can also be done by elimination we then locate the prior confusion to that change in case will it be earlier than two weeks from the incident these confusions so often missed by the auditor take place from two weeks to five minutes before the actual decision to change having located the time of the prior confusion but not done anything else about it lists of names or anything like that we then go one month earlier in date this gives us an exact date for our questions let us say the selfdetermined change was june 1 1955 the prior confusion was may 20 1955 and the arbitrary month earlier was april 20 1955 we get the pc to spot this arbitrary date more or less to his own satisfaction we now form question as follows since date is there anything you have the endings are in this order suppressed suggested been careful of invalidated and failed to reveal the question with one end is completely cleaned by repetitive prepchecking one asks it off the meter until the pc says there is more then one checks it on the meter and steers the pc with any read and then continues the question off the meter etc etcin turn we clean each one of the buttons above this will take many hours in most cases it is vital not to clean anything thats clean or to miss cleaning read that reacts in other words do clean meter job of it all the way at sensitivity 16 when we have in turn cleaned each of the buttons above we do new assessment of the change list and get us new time just as before and handle that just as before when the second area is clean we assess for third frequently particularly if the needle gets dirty we ask for missed withholds indeed one can use all the middle rudiments at least once each session with expert needle reading that intensive will give the pc more gain per hour of auditing than anything else short of routine 3ga i wish you lots of success with it remember the more variables you introduce into such system the less confidence the pc will have in you good hunting l ron hubbard lrh drrd copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

are trying to clear people you should recognize that all processes are subordinate to this end to be clearable person has to be auditable if someone cant talk listen or respond he is unauditable you arent concerned with states of insanity as defined by kraepelin this is subject that is subordinate to scientology we have used the words sanity and insanity for pr purposes but actually we have nothing to do with either there is not person on earth who is sane they are all batty or they wouldnt be here someone who is sane is someone who resolves problems for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics that is sane action and definition of sanity very few people apply that rule people fall into gradient scale of auditability that is what you should study if you are concerned with states of man person who isnt clear wont resolve things for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics even first goal clear wont ordinarily there is processing short of clearing that is worth long arduous hours now that we have 3ga so we become interested in auditability the trick at the moment is to clear someone while he is clearing someone else the struggle for lrh is not to clear people it is to get people to clear people people in the ruds and havingness group are there not because they are unauditable but because they are not able to audit well enough to receive auditing person to be unauditable has to be pretty bad off his auditability is determined by how many overts he is secretly committing while being audited the lowest level of auditability is the person who can be cleaned up who will keep his snoot clean long enough for you to clean up his needle below that level is the pc who will never tell you who wont cooperate or be frank with you at this point auditing ceases to the degree that the auditor cant get the pc to communicate it isnt that the meter wont read though that would also debar auditing almost anybody if not auditable is preparable he is still auditable on cchs and thus he can be prepared for auditing this would also apply to someone who is bleeding to death or in coma the unauditable case will get new body sooner or later so you can get him later if the technology is still there the only case that cant be reached is the one that isnt there and will never hear of scientology dont spend more time than necessary to get the goals any case that can be forced into groove can be audited the case that breaks your heart though is the one that appears auditable but is not really preparable we dont have the tools to handle such case at present the auditability of people depends in large measure on the sphere of influence of the scientologist the sphere of action that will do the world the most good is that of auditable cases they may be nutty amnesic spinbin cases but if they are auditable they can be straightened out some people have nutty idea and know it is nutty others dont know the one who has some hope who knows he can get better can be audited the one who knows one can be helped and that it is all someone elses fault etc may be lot harder to audit the bugginess of their ideas makes difference persons goal could make him sound batty but they could still be audited there is nothing wrong with somebody except that he has upped and got himself basic purpose for reasons that are unknown to him then when his basic purpose is disobeyed or blocked off you get bank developed at this point lot of other purposes he doesnt want get hooked on to the first and he follows those and he doesnt know who he is and he gets body etc etc it is incredible that clearing process to unsnarl all this was developed previous efforts at clearing peeled the guy away from the gpm but it was still there so matter how good the pc felt the chance was there that it could key in again the pcs goal is random chance factor for instance in running repetitive processes eg help processes communication processes etc the goal could be never to communicate to anyone or never to help anyone the index of how much good it will do to find and clearthe pcs goal is the amount of case gain you can get on person who has had wrong goal found if you sit down with him on meter and handle that goal with the to be tiger drill reference hcob 29nov62 routines 2i2 321 and 3gaxx tiger drill for nulling by midruds see fig 10 clean it until all sensation and pain have gone gone off it you will see more case gain than you have seen for some time what is happening is that finding the wrong goal did keyin of what was there anyway it could have keyed in at any time now you clean it up and it has further effect on him this could lead to wild problems intensive 1 have the pc write list of all the problems that he has had this lifetime 2 ask him what decision would have solved the first second third problem etc etc dont date them they are really goals 3 dust them off lightly with the tiger drill it is little chunk of doing goals list and the pc will get phenomenal relief not that you would necessarily do this on someone it is workable because of the value of decision the bank is basic decision or purpose which has on top of it concatenation of purposes so every time he makes decision he adds look it is simpler though to just do 3ga in the first place and this is also faster and more to the point if you can clear somebody there is reason to do anything else what this means for this planet is quite amazing threequarters of asia became civilized just because of hope that this could be done the tiger drill small tiger

backwards he had to stay there and he mustnt stay there the result was that he was overwhelmed he got further orders to evacuate then to advance then to stay there then he caught the barrage his own artillery shelled him he decided then to evacuate but couldnt carry out the orders he is there now in highly charged agitation rockslamming rock slam is cant go cant stay cant come cant leave mustnt be it is highly charged agitation originally while addressing goals on the twentieth acc this was such strong phenomenon that ron used it in assessing to go down the chain to find the rock hence the name dirty needle is tiny persistent rock slam lrh has been spending the past week or so studying rock slams in depth he happened to get criminal on the meter one with known overts against him he saw rock slam turn on and off on this one fact this was very interesting of course the criminal was trapped too in this case however it wasnt goals phenomenon lrh found that you can clean rock slam off missed withhold on someone and end up with dirty needle this is because the pcs attention is on the large overt the rock slam not on the auditor it takes superb tr1 to get past the noread that results from the pcs elsewhereness this was the first evidence that rock slam and dirty needle are signs of overts until the overt is handled the needle wont register the mechanics of failed to reveal is the still point following confusion you should audit the confusion you could only get stuck picture to move by asking what about that picture could you take responsibility for this works because responsibility takes care of the overt stills do not exist without prior confusions except in the case of goals postulates for this reason you can also unstick stuck picture by spotting the prior confusion and the overt the person did the person usually settled the confusion with an overt culture will get stuck and fixed following good confusion too pc will get chronic somatic following an overt or more likely series of overts that involve motion these overts were way of settling confusion politics is an aberration caused by the collective overts of the citizenry you can forecast the next governmental form by looking at the overts the citizens are committing because the government will try to bake those overts legal thus lessening the overt for instance criminal has come to the conclusion that property belongs to nobody he has to come to this conclusion before the 1917 russian revolution the crime rate was very high so the russian government legalized the idea that property belongs to nobody weekness or omittedparticipation would be the prior overt in socialized state because in such state weakness is legal and rewarded in politics there is only opinion and aberration wisdom in research what usually happens is that lrh falls over something for awhile he bumps into it until way to use it occurs auditors have learned to go to failed to reveal when dirty needle shows up failed to reveal is subsequent to an overt there is little to gain by asking for overts though it is too strong but the failed to reveal skims the top tiger drill is effective until you run into persistent rock slam or dirty needle ow has been put in to remedy this it works as long as you get your question answered when it doesnt work it is because the pc is doing something else with the answers if he is technically answering but not giving overts keep clearing the commands the pc may be trying to solve problem with the auditing question lrh found that he could turn on rock slam at will in anyone on goals chain 3ga as it exists is totally workable and will do the job the only problem is doing it faster we have already cleared firstgoal clear who had wild rock slam goals got picked off the top of the gpm to the point where the rock slam showed up this guy has gotten caught in the front lines with bunch of overts and he is sitting in ridge that has enough confusion and enough overts behind it to make him unable to move anyplace so there he is it would be faster to find the first goal if you could just bypass the first three goals of the gpm and only have four or five to deal with that is the proposed speedup we have run people to an fn on goal and found that they had rock slam underlying the fn if you overlist for fifteen or twenty minutes beyond the fn you get rock slam as the pc goes on down the goals chain the track is laid out in cycles made up of series of lives or types of lives associated and allied highly variable in their time element it is prime postulate new goal that starts cycle this is not solution but new game the pc goes along with this eventually the steam goes out of it and the thetan finds himself with interest and ability to get into trouble he goes out the bottom then perks up bit and goes off with new basic postulate any further postulate is solution to problems caused by the first one that is cycle those are pieces of gpm with an interrelationship if you can get the earliest you can find cleaned up the later ones blow easily since the thetan had less power to make them for this reason it is worthwhile to get as early goal as you can find that still reads and has some reality for the pc and which he can still run if goal will rocket read you can list it after you have tiger drilled it clean if it rocket reads you can list it through to fn then find another etc etc as you go further back it would be easy to find later goals but useful to find earlier ones thetan never gets so messed up that he fails to leave flag out on his points of aberration in early work it was noticed that the key engram of the pcs current life leaves out tag the tag is an innocentseeming and seemingly meaningless picture that the pc is frequently aware of for instance it may be picture of grandfathers rocking chair when you explore this you find the key engram similarly the key goal has rock slam left on it one way of finding out what subject it is on is by nulling several hundred goals culling the rock slams writing them down and seeing what the subject matter is test overts on and see the rock slam turn on the rock slam may wear out on some of these subjects those are the locks the real goal will have rock slam that wont weer out the charge manifested by the rock slam can be imparted to associated subjects that wont hold up and that will confuse you any branch of the tree looks like the trunk eventually you will find the trunk you can use the rock slam to find the goals channel by assessing the eight dynamics to find one that has rock slam or dirty needle if there is dirty needle at first you can cause one by having the pc think of overts against each dynamic and picking out the dirtiest needle you have to be clever to ask these questions without causing missed withholds get the pc to tellyou few overts on the dynamic that reads dirtiest ask him what would represent that dynamic and get list of items assess by elimination looking for rock slam or the hottest item it is ok if at this point you dont get rock slam take that item and get the pc to list what goal might you have that would be an overt against eg the government write down any pain or sensation on the list keep listing as long as there is needle action when the needle smooths out the pcs goal is on the list if you are lucky if you are unlucky you will get nothing but pain sensation and stuck needle if so start with new dynamic assessment if you are getting cognitions that is good sign on some pcs this could be the only way to run goals on most it would be shortcutgoals listing lecture given on 9 august 1962 thank you well this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 9 august whats the year audience 1962 ad 12 ad 12 all right thank you what im going to talk to you about is technically just listing listing how to list in the beginning there was the model session now what do you do in listing that is different than any other auditing well you prepcheck the object of and the lines of the auditing command every session beginning with fast check got it and i think if you do that your number of items that you need to list out goal will materially diminish i think youll find it saves its time over and over and over and over so lets put in the rudimentsthe beginning rudimentsbangetybangetybang and say the pcs goal and tobeatiger it in other words get the middle ruds in on it fast get it to firing if we can of course we go just so far this thing is going to start firing latent and its going to expire one way or the other but after all it is our target and to run somebody endlessly with his goal suppressed and invalidated and all that sort of thing is liable to require large number of additional items and all kinds of other things in the session dont you see other things might go wrong you might even waste whole session and not even recognize that you have wasted one all right now the auditing command of course is the whowhat lines of which there are four now im not going to try to give you wording of the whowhat lines and say that it will forever and always be true first you have finding the goal in 3ga and proving it out and then you get to listing and in actual fact the first step of listing is to find lines that fit the goal now youve got picture that you must comply with and the picture is an outflow arrow and an inflow arrowarrows pointing at one another draw circle for the pc and then draw line going out from him and then the arrowends and then draw another line extending that one but its arrowends are in toward the first arrow and then you have the retarding arrow of the first line and then you have the retarding arrow of the second line and theyre just arrows alongside the other two arrowsgoing the opposite direction in other words you got four arrows here one is going out from the pc and one is going in toward the pc and then youve got the other pair of arrows further out the first one is in toward the pc and the other one is out away from the pc now the auditing command that you want simply matches up the four basic flows now you see there could be 16 flows listed there could be 32 flows listed there could be 128 flowslisted dont you see you could list and listoh wow but staying with four is the most economical as far as we know at this particular time but those four must be meaningful to the pc theyve got to make sense to the pc now we want to knowthe first line is who or what would have it want it have it i dont care which one you use thats as far as the goal is concerned then who or what would oppose it see thats your outer arrow pointing in toward the first arrow who or what would oppose it now weve got to have specifically who or what would keep you from performing it or doing it you see and then weve got to find out who or what would oppose its being opposed now how you get these words to go together is remarkable and so forth but they must fire now the goal has rocket read and then so must the lines youve got to have read on those lines and the read on these lines must exist not because youve made mistake on the line you recognize that you could write the wrong line and so forth do you know to date we have had three people one of whose clearing was held up and two that was loused up right here at saint hill because nobody paid enough attention to the wording and value of the wording of lines so this is not light subject this is very important subject and it is the auditors responsibility not the training director or somebody elses responsibility this is the auditors responsibility those lines are there and theyve got to fire in other words when you read this line who or what would want to catch catfish that thing has got to fire on that not because the goal is on the end but the line as major thought has got to fire thats got to fire now remember that the whole rash of free needles that we got out earlier this summer were all listed on this simplicity ill show you how simple it can be line one who or what would want to catch catfish lets say this is the goal line two who or what would oppose catching catfish line three who or what would not oppose catching catfish line four who or what would not want to catch catfish now those are the exact linesthe verb form changing on two of the lines to an ing and look even though they were reaching madly and having an awful time on line four and scrambling around on it most horribly they still made it see now it was only when on one and im not saying this just to be mean although the person who is going to hear it in moment will swear that i said it just to be meanthe introduction of your into the line unreported by the auditorinto one of the lines prevented that line from ever going to free needle till one day i caught the thing up and found out that this extra word existed in the line knocked the extra word out had it prepchecked little bit and wham all four lines went to free needle see there was one line in thereive forgotten which line it was but it was something on the order of who or what would oppose your catching catfish not who or what would oppose catching catfish see just the introduction of that your on one of the four lines see it wasnt on the other three and yet this was listed this way by three auditors see and the first auditor was completely exonerated on the matter because nobody had formulated the lines at that time to amount to anything and we were just at the beginning of this level and this auditor put them together as kind of what the pc thought they might be you see and there was your in it and that prevented those things from going to free needle so in other words the wording of the line can prevent or achieve free needle for that line it is the wording of the linenow our more modern version seems to hit people much closer and we have had at least one goal not go clear on the old four lines but be much easier to run and is running much more easilyand actually on the original four lines just went up to 60 as the ta and stuck right goal but it just went up and stuck because these lines were not adequate to describe the situation you see and started moving again the moment the wording was changed to these lines which we are now using line one who or what would want to catch catfish line two who or what would oppose catching catfish line three who or what would retard or pull back opposition to catching catfish and line four who or what would pull back what is it from catching catfish audience someone or something oh someone or something from catching catfish now someone or something could of course be on at least two of the lines or on more of the lines you understand but there is the pattern which we are using now its pull back and pull back or retard and pull back on lines three and four but the point is the line has got to fire you read the goal to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang all right that read transfers over onto all four lines and it is not true that it transfers onto just three of the lines and the other one isnt hot just now see its because that line that is not firing is not quite right see you should be able to put these four lines together and get them all to fire you say to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang to catch catfish bang who or what would want to catch catfish bang see theyve all got to fire that way now there are various oddball wordings which havent worked we run into the problem of the negative goal lets take the goal not to talk who or what would want not to talk thats perfectly fine isnt it who or what would oppose not to talk thats good isnt it thats fine were just going along fine there now lets get to line three on the old wording who or what would not oppose not to talk double negative enterprising auditor shift the double negative of course change it around so you dont have double negative thatd make it much bettershe never goes clear and line four who or what would not want not to talk thats really becoming garbage as far as the auditor can see pretty gruesome but what do you know interestingly enough its perfectly comprehensible to the pc double negativeso what doesnt mean anything to the pc the line means something to the pc but that it isnt grammatically something or other was not thing so that first wording was perfectly okay and was all right to remain just as it was if you had negative goal but this wording didnt work seedouble negative thats all right doesnt matter but this wording didnt work who or what would want the goal not to talk who or what would oppose the goal not to tally who or what would not oppose the goal not to talk for some cockeyed reason it ceases to make sense very soon see the goal the goal the goal makes it grammatical but apparently makes it unworkable now well get another one lets take the wing out of it who or what would oppose catching catfish see who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish now this one is important for you to know about because pcs will try to steer you into it it hasnt the least bearing on the situation it doesnt go clear apparently this one lays an egg but pc tells you thats real hot the pc will tell you thats real good and apparently it is for the birds see the difference its different meaning who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish of course is just dandy that sounds good doesnt it well it isnt the same meaning that you want on your list linewe dont care about opposing the goal to hell with the goalwhy keep it in that realm we want to know who would oppose catching catfish not oppose the goal to catch catfish its who or what would oppose catching catfish that clears the pc see thats the opposition its the opposition to action because remember these are flow lines when anybody tries to steer you away from wording which you think is proper and so forth in arguing it out with pc or figuring it out yourself or something just remember this these are actions these are actions now of course we get want the goal thats kind of an inflow isnt it and that has always kind of loused up i dont know quite why an inflow word like want works as an outflow action of the goal but it apparently keeps the goal in the items head that has got it see but hale as far as i know although i dont have too much data on thishave apparently works equally well apparently but its what fires that counts but what fires has got to be actions of the goal its got to be action because youre listing flow lines so this would be dead wrong who or what would oppose people who had the goal to catch catfish thats dead wrong you want to know who or what would oppose people well thats not the goal all right lets go little bit further afield here its after all catfish isnt it all right so who or what would oppose catfish youre practically listing two lines at once thats what messes up there because anybody whos trying to catch catfish is opposing catfish too and anybody whos opposing catfish is also opposing catfish and youve got opposition anyplace so you might as well just do the one line for the two dont you see and there we come into the liability of listing lines now believe this is quite problem because youre liable to make this horrible mistake unless forewarned the pc is given four commands but actually only lists three lines now look at the mess this gets him into he lists twice as many items on one line and he lists items on another line and an equal number on the remaining two lines in other words he overlists one line and doesnt list another line at all and the pc is going to go round the bend see hes really going to get cooked with this one next thing you know your tone arm is stuck and youll be saying its the wrong goal and everything is all upset well the pc through his own interpretation can do this just fine so the best way to handle this is have pcs draw you pictures now you want to draw the pc picture of the one i just gave you and present this as problem to the pc of how youre going to word this thing of course youre going to word this thing with current wording if absolutely impossible youre going to change it but youre going to try to word it with current wording but you want to show the pc this thing and its this arrow that comes in toward him and this arrow that goes out that faces the other arrow and then this arrow that pulls back and then this arrow that goes out parallel to the other one you want to show him those four arrows and youre going to say thats oppose thats opposed to doing your goal and this is doing your goal see and this is keeping you from doing your goal dont you see and thats retarding the other tom being opposed but at the same time we dont want this fourth line here to be the second line up here do you see how that could be see who would oppose you doing your goal and who would not want you to do your goal ooooh those things are getting awful ghostly close together arent they you got to have wording here that means these four flows with regard to the action of this goal now goals are action situations even being hound dog as goal to be hound dog seerequires an action the action is at least to be thats not much action but its still enough action to be action and it causes dow you say who would want to be hound dog andof course now youve got it pretty well made of course theres some action little bit added in there and not want to be hound dog see you could get these things you see but theyre still actions oppose being hound dog thats guaranteeing action you see and retard opposition to being hound dog these are very hard for pcs to wrap their wits around very often particularly when theyre lying at the bottom of the gpm there they lie nobody has disturbed them on this subject for millennia you see or triennia nobodys even breathed it at them or mentioned it to them and you all of sudden come along and propound the philosophic principle of whether or not theyre going to oppose or not oppose being hound dog you know theyve just never considered it theyll be in this kind of state they know that everybody opposes being hound dog and that is the truth that isnt fact you see thats the truth the truth of life life opposes being hound dog now you introduce brandnew idea you say who would want to be hound dog want to be hound dog good heavens nobodys thought of that you see well factually they havent thought of it for ages see and these other actions the other three actions so they very readily steer themselves over onto one groove if they possibly can and itll be the flow they happen to be stuck on at the moment you get them to figure it out so their advice is worse than useless but you want to find out whether or not they can answer it thats what you want to know thats why you consult them you dont take their wording but you want to find out if they can answer it and then you juggle the wording around or do anything you have to do to the wording so that you can clear you know invalidation mistake wrong word anything like that that you want to clear on this thing and after this line is cleaned up with fast check on the mid ruds like tobeatiger drill after this line is cleaned up brrrrp seeyou say that line and you get pow you get read see you say the line you get read you say the line you get read dandy here we go thats fine see now you want to get the next one so that when you say that line you get read say the line get read prepcheck it out in other words you midrud the thing you see you get those mid ruds in on the line and then test it youd be surprised how busy they are sometimes in invalidating lines and all that straightenout so frankly ive opened up subject to you you possibly havent looked at very intimately and that is the wording of line to be listed but that second to the goal is the most important source from which all clearing flowsis that line and now keeping an even balance amongst those lines as they list all right now so much for this wording of the line your next step is to make sure that as you list you list in model session your rudiments are in without antagonizing the pc unduly because you see you can put the rudiments in so often that it amounts to auditing and then the rudiments go out see so your basic action is dont list too long on one line how long is too long ill tell you exactly how long you should list line exactly how long as long as the flow in that direction persists yeah how are you going to know that well short of an oscilloscope youre not an oscilloscope will show you the flow line so you just pays your money and you takes your chance but ill give you an indicator this would be slightly overlisting line but would be safe this is slightly overlisting the line by an item or two but its very safe as soon as the pc says uh and uhhhh change your lines go to the next line why youve hit the null pointyou see dont be under the delusion that the pc is thinking up these items dont make that mistake he thinks hes thinking he thinks hes talking he thinks its all going off but actually hes just woundup doll see hes just firing off he couldnt help it he practically couldnt help but give you the items because theyre being dealt see because theyre stacked in the gpm in that way he doesnt think of any of them now if pc is groping for the right wording youve overlisted i mean uh i mean uh uh mm oh that isnt the right word uh uh uh big big uh big big huge uh uh gargantuan uh trtruh lets see tremendously that isnt uh tremendously large oh man you overlisted long way back you should have quit see now that item will spew onto the paper bang just without any trouble from the pc and long times in listing sessions without many items coming onto the page is all caused by the auditor not judging the flows right comm lag of the pc eats up session and if you keep the pc out of that comm lagyou just list in rotation one two three four one two three four one two three four and dont let the pc comm lag or shut off an automaticity isnt that neat you mustnt shut off pcs automaticity hes saying tiger waterbuck water buffalo uh big snakes pythons uh mindoro uh natives pygmies uh pygmies pygmies uh uh well the funny part of it is is you mustnt have shut him off at water buffalo because itd suppress the nest two items he cant help but say them dont you see theyre just being dealt off the top of the deck onetwothreefour see theyre just coming right on up one twothreefourfivesixseveneightnineteneleven trtranunnun and then uh shift lines now ill tell you when youve listed too long slightly but not to the other degree i cant get the right word for it i dont know what oh youre way overdue man you missed the 515 you missed the 620 see you missed the midnight express heres the one the pc says thats not it youve gone over youve gone over right now hes invalidating the item he is giving you why is he invalidating the item he has given you because the other flow line is now meeting the direction of his attention and is overwhelming his attention so that any item he thinks up is of course being overwhelmed by the other flow line coming to him just like that heh its very neat and you just listen to him as he goes along on listing and he says water buffalo tiger mindoro native pygmy uh uh uh uh appython auhum uh uha deer thats not it um uh buck buck uhno um buck uh not anotnotnot anot buck deer uh um lets see now um well i ccacant really think of the name of the thing uh uh big uh buck uh uh uh v very lar uh its certain kind of deer they have down in mindoro uh dak or u u oh man you missed the 615 the 830 the 1025 theyve all gone by see thats the whole gamut you have run the lot now see your first indicator was and uh well out of courtesy you could let him give it to you hell say uh buck and you say all right thank you very much thank you so much now all right were going to start on the next line and here we go weve shifted gears and were now listing on something else thats really the way to get away from the pin fast and your pc doesnt get suppressions and you dont have to put in the mid ruds all the time and all that sort of thing just catch it on that first ahh and its just handed to you on silver platterhe tells you this line has run as far as its going to go and is now in an eddy area and is about to turn around and go the opposite direction thats what he tells you with that ahh with the invalidation he tells you it has already turned around and is going in the opposite direction and anything i think of is being overwhelmed and invalidated by the line which is now coming the other way see and when he cant think of it at all hes just totally overwhumped now the line is really racing at him but similarlylet make this point againit is high crime to shut off an automaticity because he wont be able to get it again this thing is firing off and you put suppression right on the middle of the thing hes going to tell you all of sudden thirty items brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and you say well thats enough he says bubu brrrbbrrbrrrr and you put in the mid ruds at that point you find it was all suppressed the pc feels kind of loused up he feels kind of betrayed and so on so there are the basic tricks of listing 1 at the beginning of the session get in your rudiments 2 get your goal fastchecked 3 now theres two ways you could go about this one is simply to fastcheck the first line you do and then when you get to the next line give it fast check when you get to the nest line give it fast checkfirst time you ask it you see you get to the fourth line give it fast check and then dont check them anymore just see if it fires thats the only thing you want its very fast see that could be done that way or you could take all five of these thingsthe goal and the linesand just read them all off to see if they all fire see if there are any suppressions on them you know and clean them up bangbang get them all firing bong and then go on to your session two ways you could go about this find out which one is best for you now you center his attention on the lines of course too solidly in prepchecking the things and hell start giving you answers then youre already in session so that has some liability connected with it now your next action is to get the pc to list the first line down to point where he says and uh uh let see let him see by all means but if he sees for more than few seconds you say well all right thats fine well get that one the next time we come around now lets start on this next line see lets not leave him in thin air and just list to the comm lag go straight along down the line list to the comm lag list to the comm lag list to the comm lag now youre going to get in trouble sooner or later because your lines are going to get ragged if you list to the comm lag and thats liable to upset you so you take one of those times when hes feeling very very easy and catch up few items and its nice balance which you do but if its straining him to think of any more items just to make you catch up you abandon catching up you got it because its not quantitative process after all its the amount of now see its the amount of now that were interested in not the number of items and number of items is merely an approximation of keeping them level that is sloppy index of how much flow has been gotten off any one of these lines as far as checking the mid ruds is concerned every time you turn around you wont have to do it if you list this way which makes for very fast listing but if you make yourself bunch of mistakesthis is really when to use the mid ruds fast check of the mid ruds not repetitive check if you make big mistake and this pc is going brrrrrr and you say thank you thank you thank you very much yeah thank you yeah thank you yeah well i got that now is there any other item thata person or being there that would want to catch catfish and the pc is sitting there looking blanched you know hes been struck dead hes halfway through an automaticity and he cant get it outactually recognize whats happened to him youve suppressed thirty or forty items just like that bang you didnt quite see what you were doing you know you didnt realize he was running off an automaticity and it was just tearing right on down the line and you all of sudden gave him nice tone 40 acknowledgment see brought him into present time put him into the session crash you see all that sort of thing and you just smell the rubber burning you make goof like that dont let him yap or get upset about it just get in your mid ruds suppressman that is really going to be hot you made him suppress the lot get the idea or if you were kind of sleepy and it was summer afternoon and you suddenly wake up to realize that the pc for five minutes has been sitting there saying various things like this is it large large tiger veryno tiger stri striped i cant quite get the word for this tiger with horns that would not be right and so forth and you wake up suddenly the pc has been going on like this for about five minutesbe an awfully good thing to get in the mid ruds in other words the mid ruds are something with which you pick up goofs and if youre really smooth auditor you dont goof now how many items does it take per line to list goal out how many items what an interesting question its almost philosophic in its impulse it has lot to do with how smoothly it was done oddly enough and the less smoothness it was done the less insessionness it was done with the more items you are going to have so therefore you cant say how many items should appear on list as just fait accompli how many items bang you see you cant say that but you sure can say that it isnt going to be ten or fifteen ten or fifteen hundred now were getting more into the zone and order of magnitude but speaking then were only speaking for the first goal how many is it for second goal how many is it for third goal how many is it for fourth goal well these things become shorter and shorter these lines do so how many clears the goal well as many as you write down well and expertly to point where the needle goes free thats how many it is and it certainly is not going to be less than thousand i dont think weve got the third goal i think youre still within that order of magnitude but im just guessing there the first goal seven thousand items on each line i wouldnt worry too much about it unless the ta has gone up and stuck and has been stuck for long time or something like this you see i wouldnt worry about the number of items ill tell you what to worry about in minute but the number of items isnt something to worry about you understand too fewgod help us that now of course you dont ever null these items and the pc is going to ask you why are we writing them down it would be an interesting question why are we writing the items down well my answer to that is writing them down is better acknowledgment and its much better way to keep tabs on your lists and theres various reasons for writing them down but amongst them isnt nulling we dont ever do anything with these items i dont know anything to do with them your pc at first will be rather puzzled as to which one it is well of course thats the joke it isnt which one hes been going long piece of track on that goals problem mass man hes had an opportunity to collect an awful lot of identities and the identities which he personally has picked up has had the opportunity to collect an awful lot of enemies and he himself has collected an awful lot of things which oppose enemies and he himself has had very interesting taste for things which prevented him from doing his goal hell begin to wonderafter while what possessed him and all of these things combined make quantity and the quantity is large all right now lets talk about how long line is listed it is listed exactly to free needle it is not listed one item beyond free needle hear now not one item beyond the free needle not even one needle was free now the proper conduct of an auditor when observing free needle on line should be professional he should not suddenly get hold of one of his favorite valences of rodeo performer start bucking about in the chair and trying to put quirt to the emeter free needle haha heyhey haha hathats enough its free needle hey do you want to come around and see this that is not optimum auditor conduct its all right because we can run the suppressions off but youll feel like that when you first see one you go to the next line and list it to free needle or if it doesnt go to free needle until the flow runs out as usual sometimes one of them goes free and three of them will stick for while some of them then youve got two free and the other two are sticking and then sometimes youve got three free and one is all hung up and then eventually it goes free well the way to do that is you keep going one two three four see this thing is stuck this line is sticky its not free come back here to your next line in sequence see and put one two three free needle see now your needle is free when you go to your next line your next line doesnt upset it at all now i cant lay down rule absolutely here because it may not make the least bit of difference but if you said the line to the pc and you get needle reaction of any kind whatsoever and nothing happens to the needle it might be very foolish to list it so we go to the next line and we read the thing off and theres needle reaction of any kind to it you see and the needle is still free and we come to the line we had that was sticky in the first place and its still sticky now we list that thing on down until we get to comm lag and its still stuck well now which line do we come back to next because nothing is cooling this thing down well youd better check them hadnt you now it wont upset anybody if you put one item on each one of these lines now were into completely questionable area of what is the right thing to do experience will tell what is the right thing to do i cant give you packaged answer but i can tell you this is dont list beyond free needle because its quite upsetting its something like asking for rudiment answer when there isnt one see and if i were to lay down an operating rule for myself on this as something i would now be guided by i would wade myself through this i would read these other lines and see if i could get stick or fall see something and id get an item and then id walk back to the line that was stuck and i would list it till i got comm lag you get the idea and id walk myself through this and if i had three lines all of which were giving free needle i wouldnt test all three in rotation every time id test one after the other in other words id take the sticky line id list on it to comm lag and then id choose another one of these linesnot the one in rotation id skip rotation seeand then id list some more sticky needle and then id choose the third one that was free and test it now you know id just walk my way through this sort of like on eggs you get the idea and i wouldnt list those lines my instinct would be agin it if i couldnt get fall or stick or any needle misbehavior on it i dont think i would touch them id ask the pc if he had any items on these lines but my auditing command would not be whoorwhatwouldwantto catchcatfish can you think of anything right now thatanything anybody want to catchcatfish you cant all right thank you huhhuh that isthats fine thank you very much get off of there see pc said yeah i just thought uh game wardens catch catfish every now and then and then youve set it down see all right he just gave you that gratuitously thats to keep from missing withholds youre at touchy end of the case and obviously to you it isnt touchy end of the case at all because the pc is now practically clear and clear can stand anything that might be your reason if the needle is this free why doesnt matter how we treat the pc does it well thats the wrong kind of thinking because right at that stage of the game it is rather edgy because you could take one of these freeneedle lines and you could list it right on into hole in other words you could stick it all up again its already happened here dont think im just dealing on theory only overlisting has occurred all right thats enough for that you can certainly list through to free needle on four lines now if one line consistently and continually hangs up and you cant make it go free then you investigate the living daylights out of what is wrong with that particular line and see if you can find anything wrong with it at all and see if you can get any variation of wording of that line to fire nicely and neatly and continue listing on that new wording and that line will go clean okay thats in case of emergency because there might have been throughout something wrong with that one line see you might have missed it already been done here so it can happen three lines went free one didnt well when that happened before your was in the fourth line that your was enough to keep that line from going free and an examination of itonly took couple three sessions of listing after that and all four lines were free just like that see so suspect that if you get too much an inequality of this and its hanging on too long dont let it go for months look into it okay all right now what are the dangers of listing number one listing is auditing it is auditing and must be treated as such it is the only therapeutic action undertaken to free goalis merely listing the pi does not give out these answers analytically matter how bright and alert the pc might act theyre all being dealt off the bottom of the deck all out of the reactive mind and you must not worry as to whether the pc is inventing answers or dreaming them up or thinking of them analytically or anything else just be calm about this look there are enough things to worry about in auditing without inventing things just take what the pc gives you man keep the session going and relax see all right now as you are starting in with the goal you have period of danger and this period of danger begins at the moment of finding the goal and is over when you have proved beyond doubt that this goal while being listed on all four lines turns on pain on line one sensation on line two little more sensation than pain on line three and little more pain than sensation on line four and when youve proven that to your own complete satisfaction well look youre looking at as though i should detail this more but figure it out for yourself man figure it out for yourself lines one and three belong to the pc and lines two and four belong to the enemy and the enemy is sensation and the pc is pain thats easy and unless you get that optimum condition of affairs that goal is wrong and you better get off of that hotter than hot and faster than fast line oneheres what makes goal wrong line one turns on sensation who or what would want to catch catfish dizzy misemotional groggy uhuuhhhohhh see pressureswho or what would oppose catching catfish ouch oh what terrible pain went through my head oh what an awful pain in my back oh dear dear dear ohrrarr ohh myouch see its the wrong line that should be turning on sensation its turning on pain and we get to line three which is the pcs own line again since its an allied line and the person says nyoomm oh dear still very dizzy and so on so on and so on and so on and so on very dizzy and theres this little tiny pain in my ear but that doesnt amount to much sure makes you dizzy doesnt it and he gets to line four who or what would pull back your goalyou see thats the enemy manand ouch urp pain went through the back there what was that now look that condition as purity seldom exists it wont exist for very long if you continue to list this it all becomes sen everything gets to be sen but if you go too far on this everything goes sen the bank starts to become hard beefy lumpy the person wakes up in the morning and the ridges he usually had are now really ridges were getting an exaggeration of the situation that bank is becoming heavy its like running creative processing without having the goal to create and the pc will wake up in the morning actually and hell feel like theres board going through his head see something like this and hes and it all turns into sensation its all dizzy groggy pressures nausea misemotion starts to feel like after while he didnt do anything to high blood pressure probably but he starts to feel like high blood pressure would be much more comfortable you see all four lines go to sen thats an interesting item isnt it now if all four lines went to pn i wouldnt worry but if they all went to sen to hell with it get out of there youre wrong i dont care what you think youre wrong you got it i dont care what the pc says thats the wrong goal yeah it read yeah its fine yeah it checked out we had three instructors and the governor of australia check it out i dont care about all those arguments the line is wrong because that is the final proof of goal you got it you havent got goal until you have listed it two or three hundred items on each line as the auditor and that will save your bacon of course if it checks out beautifully pc got pain on it bang and so forth youre pretty sure arent you but the final test of any pudding is the listing you go two three hundred items deep on this thing if its turning on pain in the right places and sen on the right places and that sort of thing oh boy youre in go for broke now the only thing could happen wrong is you start listing with the rudiments out something crazy goes on in the pcs life hes got ptps like mad or rudiments are wildly out or something of the sort you see and in minor wayyou see checking the goal out every time is just way of speeding this up it wont prevent clearing and checking the lines out wont prevent clearing by listing they just blow it down but wrong line will wrong line will prevent clearing who or what would try awfully hard to oppose catching catfish and the next line to it is who or what would not want to catch catfish you see and the next line down the lineall out of position see all misworded it would be too cruel an experimenti have seen this in actual action but you can take four lines check them out and then throw one now it will fire on suggestion and an invalidation see and mistake you can get it to fire of course just like you can get goal to fire and now insist on listing that line who or what would know he had to have to catch catfish and then put all the other ones down correctlythe action of doing something like that is to bring the ta up to stick its almost exactly 45 to 60 almost always i havent ever seen tone arm on misworded line or mislisting or arcbroke sessions or overlisting in sessionsthe errors you can make in other words that on goals listing didnt go up to 45 and 50 im quite prepared to see one go up to 60 or to 70 or 375 im quite prepared to you understand but it just happens that every one ive seen have gone from 45 to 50 and then stick theyll stick at 45 or theyll stick at 50 and more have stuck at 50 than at 45 so when your tone arm starts lingering around 50 for session and next session lingers around 50 dont be surprised if the third session your pc all of sudden says well i was awfully dizzy i was walking down the street and i saw the buildings sort of reel youre doing something weird something wild is going on here somethings happened you got to straighten it out now what straightens out how do you straighten one of these things out well you locate whats wrong you better check out the goal and get it to fire again if you possibly can check out the lines one after the other see if theres any disagreement from the pc on these lines or these wordings thats quite important youre not going to change them around just because he disagrees with them but youre going to sure make its answerable if you can check out your sessioning in general which isnt really enough to keep it all hung up and just straighten this thing out and get it to rolling again thats what youre going to do now look if you cant straighten the goal out after youve listed couple of hundred if it ceases to fire after two or three hundred items on each one of four lists its sort of which way did they go what happened you got to get it back to firing again of course if you cant get it back to firing again it was probably the wrong goal in the first place the method were using to find goals right now rather makes it very difficult to get wrong goal that makes it pretty difficult for you to get wrong goal or run wrong goal thats the beauty of it and why i love that method ease of auditing and positiveness of finding the goal were enough to have this and thats not why im happy about it it used to be that only an instructor or somebody who was specially trained in that little tiny technique of checkoutwe could absolutely rely on the fact that it was the right goal now any of you guys if youre good enough to do nulling by mid ruds down to point where you find goal youre so used to checking them out that checking out goal doesnt phase you anymore youll be able to actually look at goal and say well boom lets check it out brrr brrr to be tiger tzaltupub bang thud bang yeah it doesnt fire see thatd be all there was to it you know lets see is there suppression on there that goal been suppressed that isnt goal see positiveness enters into the picture and thats going to save an awful lot of bacons so preventing the wrong goal from being found has been quite campaign ive had to engage on here for quite while and actually what was marvelous is that this new nulling by mid ruds not just for its value for the auditor but to prevent wrong goals from being found is worth its weight in planets man and its pretty heavy now this idea of finding goal finding it firing and saying that is the persons goal or agreeing that it as the persons goalthats perfectly all right because it can be run out its an assertion see thats all right but when the pc keeps saying it isnt my goal and the auditor keeps saying yes it is your goal ridge is built up which is pretty hard to take apart and it will keep goal firing so dont argue over somebodys goal or youll make it fire and fire and fire and its not his goal you get the suppressions invalidations off it hell agree with it if its his goal and if it isnt his goal he wont you could find an opposition goal this is the other thing that could be wrong you could find an opposition goal now i dont know that by nulling by mid ruds you will find an opposition goal i dont know too much about finding opposition goals as distinct from finding goals icant give you much data on this actually because ive never seen an opposition goal that would fire after it has been prepchecked and nulled by mid ruds you understand so theres always the possibility that opposition goals actually only fired because they were invalidations of the goal or something you get the idea and they might not have had rocket reads on them at all you see and somebody the other day came up with reverse rocket read on goal and immediately proposed it was probably an opposition goal which i thought was very interesting so if you see that sort of thing let know but i dont know that you can get rocket read on an opposition goal i dont know that it isnt just the invalidation of the goal that makes the opposition goal fire well youre fairly secure if you have found the goal and checked it out but dont be too cocky until youve got two hundred on line and if you found goal and then turned it over to somebody to list remember to reach out by the time they got three hundred on each line or something like that and say to the pc how are you doing how do you feel all right when they ask you soandso and soandso where does the somatic come and the person says well its so and so on now what kind of somatic is it is it sensation or is it painful or what is it and what line is it on and check it all out yourself you got the idea you know dont read the auditors report thats good prevention otherwise than that you realize that somebody who is trained to hca level could be quite competent in listing and listing is the longest part of clearing so if you had somebody helping you in auditing and you kept your eye on the situation person with less training than is necessary to find goals could list goals and because he was doing this sort of thing and doing some prepchecking and so forth as he went along he would actually get up to point where he could locate goals so its good training school listing is see now that lengthens the number of people you could clear by three or four times see now you got to know all about listing and you should list somebody to clear just to see how it looks and get the experience and that sort of thing but i dont expect you to list every goal to clear that you find itd be much more economic situation for you to find the goal and then keep your eagle eye beagled on the somebody who is listing it out now how about autolisting well there is telling i wont say that autolisting is impossible i dont believe that it is possible or impossible at this particular stage of the game i believe that it would be better than nothing let put it that way but to tell somebody to go home and list on four lists and you will look into it in couple of weeks it seems to like its sort of taking his life in your hands you know i wouldnt be sure about this at all but i would say thisi would say this that if you were on desert island and you knew your goal and you knew exactly what the goal is and itd been expertly checked out and there was absolutely way under the sun for you to get clear any other way i would say that you should pick up pencil and piece of palm bark but we would know more about that in due course now these are the various ramifications to listing clearing itself consists of the cycle of finding goal and then listing it until you have free needle on each of four lines finding another goal and listing it on each of four lines ending another goal and listing it on each of four lines and the state of case is regulated by the number of goals the person has which have not been found and listed those are damping factors now here at saint hill its fairly simple to make firstgoal clearnot simple but with heroic activities let us put it that way we can make firstgoal clearnow to find second goal on pc and list that one out this is getting much more difficult we have just now found and checked out second goal on jean and that was very very good news that i was very happy about and at least it was stated to in so many words that it was checked out today was it female voice hmhm yeah all right thats second goal okay now shes got little time to list on this second goal and i think they possibly even may list it out because the listing very possibly is much shorter than first goal but we know more about that in due course shes already starting to depart from the standard state of clear or such person is already starting to depart from what we have considered clear theyre starting to move up into theta clear or something like that and its an adventure from there on out because these various states now of course are not regulated in any way by different processes to different conditions its gradient scale of the same condition all the way of course now i cant even tell you how many goals it is to ot see or how long itd take you to find and list each one of these goals i was very happy to find today that the second goal would fire so nicely nice i was told they had good rocket reads on the thing see i was very happy about that somewhere up the line why the goals are not going to stay in theyre going to start blowing but how far do you have to keep the goals not blowing to get ot see but that is the road that we are on basically and its repetition of the same action the only improvement which i see in auditing which is coming immediately up and so on is mechanical improvement that is to say persistency of readdevices to make read more persistent and therefore more observable by an auditor i dont see any changes to amount to anything on clearing as such i do see some dodges one could do to probably shorten up finding goal and i see some frills one could add onto listing that would possibly shorten the thing up one way or the other but i dont look for any fabulous advance from along that line i dont because there are certain limitations that you hit and the limitation is that the person has got just that much case and they have to sit there just that long and they can talk just that fast get the idea all right and maybe when were all ot why maybe well look back over the whole thing again and well say it would have been much easier had we done it this way and i hope that were in that condition and dont have to do it some other way those are the improvements i look for in clearing i really dont look for many other improvements but i do look for improvements thatll take little shortcutslittle faster something that is more valuable to do this than to do that you know little things along the line and we may carve it down we may carve it down considerably we may use various systems of auditing just given you one tonight you find the goal let am hpa list it see under your eye therefore youve lost two hundred hours of auditing just like that various other mechanisms of this character can be fine and we can step it up into quantitative clearing our problem now is quantitative clearing my immediate problem is to get some of you to read an emeter better well im solving that with drills and attention and various things and im also doublesolving it by making sure that persistentread emeter comes into existence in the very near future that can be hooked up to mark iv and red lights go on and pinballs dials go around when you hit read see and it stays on until you do something about it or something like thatbut i have actually quarrelno real quarrel with your drills real quarrel with your auditing presence real quarrel with these things i see just this metering thats being problem and well get that licked i have problem of how many of you can i push on through to firstgoal clears in space of time when the fellow alongside of you cant read an emeter and neither can you you know some of you are in that condition and thats worrying i got these various problems but i havent got any technical problems now i havent got any im not even worrying about whats in the guts of this meter i just told them well what we need is an idiot meter you have an onandoff switch and red light when you say something to the pc the red light goes on or it doesnt go on and if it goes on you clean it up see and if it doesnt go on you dont clean it up idiot meter these things well have these things well have i can undoubtedly find where we can best expect the goal to appear on list and therefore cut down the number of goals we have to null in order to find the goal you know do various other tricks of this character but as far as technology is concerned we got it made and youre doing it and the only thing some of you are doing wrong is youre missing few reads see well thats all i got to cure so thats easy thats that thank you very muchhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 august ad12 magazine franchise how it feels to go clear jean kennedy of bulawayo southern rhodesia wrote note after her first goal was cleared she had been cleared once on routine 3 and was cleared again on the same goal at saint hill with routine 3ga her subjective reality on these two processes is of great value to all scientologists these are in actual fact two notes i give you both with her permission she has now had her second goal found and is listing on it and will soon be the first 3ga 2nd goal clear she graduates this week from the saint hill course with honours dear ron i feel tip top at the moment and really couldnt have asked for more out of auditing if this was as far as one could go it would be enough i must say there are two big basic differences in the way i feel now and the way i felt after the 3rd sa acc 1 this time i have bigger certainty and very comfortable feeling and while r3 processed you up to more confidence each session i found on r3ga just before the lines went free that i had never felt so stripped bare and at one stage i didnt know who i was or where i was going until i realized that i had to do things not wait for something else to do them so all in all listing on the goal was fun pictures and track recall were very vivid and i sailed right back to the beginning of body moulding but the biggest thrill of all was the basic cognition where i thought i was going to find the answer to why i decided to be that wayand guess what there wasnt any reason jean on receipt of the above i asked her for permission to issue and she wrote the following expansion this is the basic difference between r3 and r3ga being run on r3 had limiting effect inasmuch as you didnt run with enough depth and could never really get at the reason why you chose to be the way you are it processed you towards greater confidence each session and finally left you feeling tip top massless but still real answerand one was always little vulnerable if you knew the right button pictures and cognitions were also limited now r3ga was very different and had much more punch behind it and you could get at things you would never have got at on r3 at the start of listing everything seemed innocent enough and i couldnt see any difference between the two and suddenly the track opened up and vivid pictures and recall in detail on the track came from all directions cognitions shot off the body in little spark forms and one could feel the masses just exploding all around at times making the rings so hot on my hands they had to be taken off there was steady feeling of cycling backwards to the start of body moulding and ones habit patterns fixed ideas and attitudes just went flying by the most fascinating part was the lines transferring over and viewpoints changing totallythe worst part comes just before the end two days before the needle went free i dug my heels in and refused to give another itemwhy because i didnt know who i was where i was and least of all why i made that postulate i have never felt so stripped bare of everything and suddenly realized that nothing was automatically going to swing into place and do things for i would have to do them my auditor gently coaxed into more items and then at the bottom i found the answer i have been looking for for so longnothinghow foolish can thetan be but what certainty jean kennedy l ron hubbard lrhjwbh copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6208c14 shspec185 world clearing the subject of this lecture is forwarding scientology on worldwide clearing basis the activity of worldwide clearing is now understood but there will have to be an agreedupon and workable plan to deliver the goods hpahca is presently neglected sphere prepchecking is not an adequate tool to turn people loose with by itself we also have the very effective form of auditing with great therapeutic value that is goals listing not necessarily goals finding if someone is upset just get them to write goals list with some astronomical number of goals on it preserve it carefully for later use this sort of goals assistance will shortly be part of hpahca training along with prepchecking if the pc could also list items for goals he would shortly be in shape to learn to find goals alternatively st hill graduate in an organization could find the goals of everyone around once they had been set up by the hpahca item listing takes long time there could be 2500 per list so policy letter has gone out forbidding st hill graduates from doing anything except to find goals hcopl 13aug62 clearing that way the org can do clearing the staff could coaudit on getting goals and items listed and the st hill staff staff auditor could find the goals this would get staffs cleared now on to world clearing say you have fifty people paying certain amount per week they all want to be clear form them into coaudits three nights week or whatever get goals listed get items listed st hill graduates would find the goal and put the person back into coaudit within year they would all be clear second goals could be found next have them study the practical actions and get to look like auditors coauditing under good supervision the fee charged should be more than adequate to support the center or whatever what damage could this do the instructor would have to make sure that withholds got missed that could cause pcs to blow you will have to do some training at first at the same time get the goals lists made so that some progress is evident from the start you could take the persons auditing skill count for points towards their getting their goal found you might think that this would cut people off from getting trained not so at all people will decide to go get trained while waiting to have their goal found at the end of the year you will have fifty firstgoal clears the only limiting factor on the expansion of clearing by this system is the number who can go through st hill and that number can be increased there are lots of oldtime scientologists around the world lrh is now getting their names so that he can write them and send them to the nearest franchise holder this will give semitrained assistants people who will join in the coaudit etc finite auditing period four to five hours of auditing and several hours of training per day are required to accomplish this program that is the basic worldclearing activity central organizations have always existed for training and dissemination of information with auditing of pcs mostly for demonstration purposes now when pcs come in they can be handled with coaudit andor preparatory actions the trouble in any central org or any coaudit will be to keep up the quality of auditing and not to let it get slipshod that is always fight because green auditors can think up more interesting ways to do things and have more problems you can find what portion of central org the public is impinging on most because that will be the most scrambled and muckedup and off line the main danger with small staff is that the public will shove the timescheduling out you have to be mean on that point because the area the public is most messed up on is time time is the single source of aberration there would be aberration were it not for time keeping time controlled for the group with regard to course hours etc will actually result in your giving wins dont let guy sneak in late greet him loudly this results in less aberration and enturbulation in the group let them know you think scheduling is important and other factors will fall into place this is method of controlling people who are otherwiseunruly lrh would never let himself be pushed into auditing more than five to five and half hours per day you also have to save time by having administrative people to handle the phone mail etc the people on the coaudit will string out in time depending on how much bank is in the way of their understanding the bank is composed of time at all so they get into its timelessness and have time to do anything people have different periods of time that it takes them to register the same recognition they have different reaction times they have different rates on different subjects and on different dynamics etc these rates are determined by where the goal sits that gets in the way of your meter reading some people are aberrated on the subject of meters and cant see the read on the needle though they may read books etc well very sane person has fantastic quantities of time lrh once flabbergasted someone by outlining program for this part of the universe that extended 5000 years into the future ive seen billion years planned out down to the smallest detail if there were time there would be motion havingness matter etc the more bank person has the less time he has for the longest period rock can sit there without any recognition at all for few trillenia speed of recognition depends on how much time person has pt varies from thousandth of second to more normal value of second or two expanded to ten minutes this would be frightening the number of mistakes person makes is inversely proportional to the amount of pt they have the saner and the freer person is the more pt he has the guy whose pt is thousandth of second never foresees the difficulty of doing anything and does the most impulsive and stupid things you ever heard of foresight is not really brightness but width of pt nothing beats looking your way out of things if you think being able to foretell the future thousand years ahead with accuracy would be boring how come you can only get excitement by being stupid anyway this gives you fast index on pcs coaudits etc this index is the amount of time it takes him to register to find out that something is there the length of time it takes him to absorb auditing information is the length of time it takes him to be reliable if you pair up co audit teams on the basis of their recognition periods they will stay happy it will seem reasonable to both of them methods could easily be developed to measure recognition period how much should you teach your coauditors lrh would demand perfection in any co audit the amount of gain is to some degree proportional to the amount of responsibility the instructor is taking for those people it is not very dependent on what process you are running you have problems of comparable magnitude ptp process responsibility processing use some processes that avoid ow your best bet though is to put them onto listing goals and items so they had better be started out on prepchecks and prepchecking if you have to keep them busy give them something to study listing for example utilize the available time in the most productive possible way it is not very tenable to singlehand project like this it is harder on you than you would think since you lack datum of comparable magnitude the communication channel falls off to the degree that an individual feels that he is outside the organization this makes the development of city offices rather than franchises good idea city office is similar to franchise but it is under the administrative direction of the central scientology organization via an hco area secretary it is set up by the hco continental sec the intention is that it will ultimately grow up into central organization see oec volume vii pp 154 158 162163 165 there is necessity to make everything neat since it will blow up anyway it might as well be done neatly so that it can be put together again after it falls apart when expansion hits when increased comm hits network of comm lines it is not surprising if the seams leak so you have to be skilled in putting the line back again not in trying to hold itany central organization putting together clearing coaudit should do it perfectly then put it all back together again when it blows up you hold the fort with time good discipline etc and you realize that world clearing is done on the basis of somehow making it not as juggernaut rolling down the highway there hasnt been road you follow policy as far as you can and then you make it work from then on just dont scant technology dont fail to deliver the goods and make clears6208c21 shspec188 basics of auditing auditors keep asking lrh for rules and more rules then they goof in session and ask for more it is strange that fundamentals usually come at high levels of training here is what an auditor should be able to do he should be able to get another being to be interested in his own case and willing to talk to him rules tricks rudiments and various other types of upset preventers are all contributive to getting this to occur the emeter is only contributive insofar as it applies to rudiments it is vital for assessing in rudiments you are trying to do with rules and the meter something that you cannot do yourself this wont work some auditors have only to sit down in the chair to have the pc arc break this is more true now than ever the difficulties the auditor encounters are his own difficulties and the mechanics he uses force the pc into session with an auditor who doesnt want the pc in session or who doesnt understand that the pc should be in session or why the pc should be in session the mechanics of rudiments and rules have made auditing so powerful that the pc is put into state where he is interested in his case and wants to talk to the auditor but the auditor thinks he is supposed to do something else and drives the pc out of session again so the pc arc breaks the auditor looks like an auditor and the rules trick the pc into session then the pc finds that the auditor doesnt want to hear what he is saying the auditor is auditing by some set of rules in fact there is auditor but the technology has created pc this drives the pc around the bend the pc doesnt know what is wrong but he feels that something is wrong we have been blaming meter reading missing reads this is just another technical rule someone who understood the basics of auditing and used them could miss reads and clean cleans and still have pc happily in session but someone who cleans cleans and misses reads must be auditing not by basics but by rules that force pc into session if there is auditor but only rules and meter the rules may be right and the meter wrong there is nothing else holding the pc in session so he gets upset if the auditor is not there and he misses something it is curtains so it is very necessary to know what the basics of auditing are the remedy for the above situation is that people are going to learn to prepcheck and to put ruds in without meters and to do this accurately this will make auditors they can do it because they will learn the basics of auditing why does auditing exist at all there are two articles in certainty magazine 1958 that take apart what psychoanalysis did wrong anyone that went into session in analysis did so accidentally basically the analysand never had an auditor he was also never brought back to pt at the end of session the basics of auditing include the mechanics of blowing something the reason why auditing works axiom 51 one underlying thread is the principle that after session pc should feel better even an awful goals assessment session that missed the goal should end up with the pc feeling better secondly the auditor must get off the pcs withholds the earliest part of auditing is the roughest part since all the missed withholds of life are still sitting there unrelieved it takes far better auditor to handle such case than to handle someone who has come up the line ways scientologists are not really harder to audit than raw meat especially raw meat that hasnt ever reached for anything you would be surprised though at who can go into session and who can be audited once in detroit the cops seized some tapes fourteen cops listened to them and twelve resigned from the force an auditor should be able to handle the pcs problems and to get clean needle so that the pc can be assessed and made to feel better an auditor should audit to get things done in session not just to audit auditing consists of getting something done by series of little accomplishments not by going through the motionsyou should be able to get pc into session without meter rules or anything some people have gift for this an auditor should be able to let the pc blow something by talking to him you would be surprised how rare this is you should also be able to get done what the pc wants done without q and people have trouble differentiating between tr4 and q and an auditor must be able to make this distinction he must handle the session and do things the pc wants done without q and you have to work at it to get in trouble with this q and is simple 1 not accepting the pcs answer questioning the pcs answer auditing isnt done by rules but by understanding people who q and dont want the pc to talk to them they use remark comment or request for more information to prevent the pc from just saying something and blowing the charge or the auditor doesnt acknowledge this is defensive mechanism 2 doing something every time the pc says something an auditor who always does what the pc says will drive the pc crazy an auditor who audits strictly by rules and not by understanding will never do anything pc says matter how reasonable or sensible it is which also drives the pc crazy there are two things that pcs do 1 they ask auditors to do things such that if the auditor doesnt do them the session will go around the bend 2 they originate auditors who are having hard time with pcs never differentiate between these two situations they dont evaluate importances they try to follow all the rules instead of helping the pc you dont take up the process that the pc wants run or the goal which the pc asserts but which doesnt check out on the other hand you dont ignore it when the pc says this room is so hot that i am melting open the damn window there is substitute for understanding and feeling of humanness obnose why does auditing work it bothers someone to be the only one who knows something he feels better when someone else can see it too he doesnt like to have only his attention on something it bothers him to have to keep it from other people when he puts something out and lets someone else see it and the person says that he has seen it and nothing else happens axiom 10 hasnt fired the catastrophic effect he expected hasnt been produced auditing of withholds blows the pcs certainty of consequences he gets off gross overt that he knew would kill him if anyone else ever found out about it and there is consequence the only thing that happened was ventilation having gotten off the withhold the pc finds himself with his attention freed up from that subject before it was stuck on keeping it withheld so he drops it like hot potato without going into the mechanics of asising we can say this if the horrible consequences that the pc expected on getting off withhold dont materialize his previously fixed attention is freed up auditors have interesting methods of preventing pcs from blowing things they use the meter they do something every time the pc originates if the auditor always does something or asks another question about it the pc isnt allowed to blow anything auditing works because the pc blows things if he isnt allowed to blow things he will blow up the point is to audit the pc not to go through drill auditors should be able to clean up dirty needle they should be able to prepcheck simply using pc indicators to establish cleanness of the question but dont try to assess goals without one if rules get in your way you probably dont understand the rules the reason for this emphasis is that 3ga requires superb auditor if it is to be done rapidlyhubbard

lines one through eight are vital by listing four items at time on the first eight lines or the first sixteen lines the case stays balanced the goal can be kept firing and clearing is speeded so use eight or sixteen lines on goal listing as regards pain it can occur on any line in listing the only dangerous indication is if pain occurs on any line only sensation which indicates that rudiments are out or that the goal is wrong pain can even occur on lines two and four and sensation on lines one and three and all still be okay lrhdrh l ron hubbard copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights

checking far better than any previous security checking has emerged nothing in this bulletin of course detracts in any way from the value of missed withholds pulling missed withholds or handling missed withholds on preclears or other persons in the organisation if the following questions are asked of person on meter it can be at once established whether or not this person will inadvertently covertly or unknowingly attempt to ruin wreck stop and otherwise interfere with an organisation scientology or an auditor the questions are as follows consider committing overts against scientology consider committing overts against ron consider committing overts against the organisation consider committing overts against the auditor it will be found that such person has goal which the person considers to be impossible to achieve so long as any one of the above four exist therefore destructive actions will at all times be manifested matter how constructive they appear the rock slam produced must be wide rock slam to be decisive by wide rock slam is meant quarter of dial rock slam to full dial rock slam the action which should be taken if this condition is found to exist is to suspend the person or otherwise put the person away from communication lines until such time as the persons dynamic item and goal are found sometimes it is almost enough merely to find the item as the foolishness of the conclusion that scientology stands immediately and directly in their road will appear to the preclear at that time by goal which is an overt against scientology is meant something which the pc considers to be goal which is an overt against when you finally see such goals appear they will not be apparent to the auditor as overts however the pc so interprets them for instance pc may have fixed idea against any spiritual activity interpreting it as harsh activity which forbids dancing and the pc may have goal to dance however the persons item lying above the goal to dance will be found to be spiritual group and this of course would make scientology appear to the person to be highly antipathetic to the goal to dance i cannot too strongly urge the fact that when the above occurs possible good will result until the dynamic item and goal are found therefore this should be expedited all care should be taken not to punish the person unduly but to carry on because often the person is unaware of the destructiveness of his or her own actionsin marriage if the husband were to place the wife on an emeter and ask the question consider committing overts against and find wide rock slam immediately results he will be then in total possession of what has been wrong with his marriage similarly wife finding this manifestation on husband would also be informed the remedy in such case is not to sack somebody to shoot somebody to divorce somebody or take some drastic final action because we now have all the answer we need to resolve this and it will be found that as soon as the persons goal has been found the condition of hostility will cease the rock slam produced must be at sensitivity 16 on the meter if dirty needle occurs it is necessary to pull the persons missed withholds because these obviously exist this should not be neglected by dirty needle is meant quarter of an inch agitation of the needle as an instant response to the asking of the above questions this is the new security programme any person responsible for maintaining security in an organisation or home should perform the above tests and take the remedial action i cannot too strongly urge that while this is absolute or near as it can be and positive in its diagnosis it is not permanent because we can now clear and clearing consists of doing away with the rock slam and not the offending

argument reach for an emeter to straighten out arguments put the person or persons on meter pull missed withholds on nattery person just sit him or her down as though natter had occurred and ask what have we failed to find out about you what have i failed to find out about you in this session have i missed withhold on you etc when you use an emeter get something done you can do great deal with it so use it to get somewhere the rules of auditing are to keep you from doing ineffective things men have been talking to men for thousands of years and the general result of these discussions has been nil how can we use talking in auditing to get something to happen the rules by which you audit are the rules of an effective path to an accomplishment of reaching someone bettering someone reaching an agreement and improving existence but it is highly circumscribed path there have been almost numberless efforts in the past to cure people or make them better almost all schools of healing have involved talking or listening there is an effort to reach axiom 10 applies throughout we can now make this same talk effective auditing has to do with the comm formula this is the most fundamental fundamental of scientology when someone says something and someone acknowledges it if the statement is true and the acknowledgment is received mental charge can blow deintensify eraser be eradicated it is on this fact alone that auditing works it isnt what is said it is axiom 10 the cycle of auditing follows this pattern 1 the auditors question or command directs the pcs attention to certain area of bank causing momentary restim 2 the pc perceiving the area of bank that has been restimulated responds by verbalizing 3 when he is acknowledged and receives the acknowledgment he knows that he has responded 4 that area of the bank blows most auditing rules exist to maintain the purity of the auditing cycle the tech exists to determine what should be restimulated in what sequence if you have done the auditing cycle right and you know what buttons should be hit and what responses should be given then you only need add repetitive question and response and the proper sequence of questions each followed by the same cycle to obtain the state of release clear theta clear or ot that formula is the only reason anyone gets out there can be numberless departures from the auditing cycle other activities like selling and teaching have their own cycles which are different from the auditing cycle if the auditor has spent lifetimes being salesman he may use the wrong sort of comm cycle and end up selling the pc an engram or you may get someone who thinks forgiveness of sins makes people better this person wont use the proper auditing comm cycle he will do something else auditing is basically cycle of command that operates as an attentiondirector eliciting response from the pc and getting the pc to asis the restimulated area the pc knows he has done so when he receives an acknowledgment from the auditor that it has occurred that cycle all by itself is sufficiently powerful to get gains matter what words or process is used the mere fact of directed attention and the acknowledgment that the pc has directed his attention that fact by itself is therapeutic there need be significance in the command the repetitive action adds duplication to the formula this increases the effectiveness of the communication the person will become aware of the existence of another being he will become aware of mass and of whether his attention is easy or hard to shift his awareness will increase and his attention will become freer in essence those are your cchs it is the nonsignificance of directed attention the cchs present different ways of directing the pcs attention with minimal significance your worstoff pc does well on these because he discovers that there is matter energy space time and another being in the universe this can be great shock to him how does the great criminal live with himself by knowing that he is the only one that there is one else in the universe you cant tell someone in that condition to think of the significance of this or that because the significance would never arrive he cant duplicate it he can duplicate the fairly non significant action of simply directed attention this is new idea in the communication cycle communication without significance beyond the significance of what the pcs attention is directed to linguistic analysts refer to the performance aspect of language apart from the mere significance of the words many an activity has directed attention but has not done so duplicatively that is one of the secrets of scientology processing and why it works this was not discovered before scientology because earlier practitioners couldnt duplicate you could run duplicative process on one object but two is better because it makes space and adds duplication you need to have two things to use you need two to make space we live in twopole universe you cant make space with just one spot you also need two things to have duplication this applies to op pro by dup the two points book and bottle give you space i dont care how you run op pro by dup run it you could direct attention repetitively in duplicative fashion or in almost any fashion and achieve renewed awareness on the part of another being of yourself and the world around him theres further significance than that and that is the whole result of the process this increased awareness improves iq alertness etc wherever you have communication line set up you have some kind of response system on this line and it will go through some kind of cycle knowing that different cycles of action exist you will see that the auditing comm cycle is unique and you will realize that the question or command directs the pcs attention by pulling his bank up around his ears the auditing comm cycle operates independent of the intention of the pc it is more responsive to the practitioner than it is to the pc any outsider has more control over the persons reactive bank than the person himself its on that fact that auditing is based the common denominator of the reactive bank is otherdeterminism so auditing requires an auditor separate from the pc to be very effective and when the auditor isnt following through the cycle of action of auditing then nobody else will adjust the bank for the pc an auditor who wont help the pc out by adjusting the bank for him is leaving him in the soup the auditor must control the pcs attention if the pc is to be able to asis anything in the bank otherwise the pc obeys the bank and auditing is not occurring there are good pcs and bad pcs there are only good and bad auditors the good ones know and keep in the cycle of auditing if the auditing cycle isnt followed auditing doesnt occur pc whose attention cannot be controlled cannot be directed into areas of significance that reactively dont want any attention directed there say the pc has goal never to look if you cant control the pcs attention you will never find it because the bank has more authority over the pc than the auditor does all goals lists contain goals of this character if you look over the goals list of pc whose goal is being easily found you will find an absence of those goals that command the pcs attention to go the other way you will find never to look or to be silent these goals cause trouble until they are located the pc whose attention can be directed by the auditor on the other hand will have great many of these there are good or bad pcs only auditors who do or dont use the auditing comm cycle and get it executed sometimes an auditor has to work harder than at other times thats all you should look over your auditing with the question is the pcs attention being directed by and can i count upon the fact that it is if you do this you will learn lot about your auditing and what is going on with that pc and the relationship between your auditing and what is going on with the pctape 6209c19 shtvd 14a tiger drill part 1 is not currently available the editorhubbard communications office saint hill manor east

with the wording consider committing overts against _______ this hcob points the way to resolved case and to peace and quiet while we get cases cleared for long time we have tried to find out what made some people nervous obsessed and prone to revolt and cutting their own throats we have wondered if there was some international group that was closely opposed to the advance of scientology the answer is communism has some goals which would make you nervous if you knew about them such as the goal to take away everything of yours this leads to total games condition socialism is also nutty it rewards people for not working it says if you are working real hard you should share with people who wont help you another antipathetic philosophy is that of the south american division into ricos and pobres capitalism has one small group owning everything democracy goes like this take bunch of uninformed people and take the mean of their opinion and say that it is valid and therefore disregard it and then do things and tell them its their fault its the perfect mechanism to prevent revolt better one has ever been invented its selfperpetuating machine that is pure idiocy you are given choice of voting between two goons you wouldnt let clean your chicken coop and then if everything goes wrong it is your fault all government is merely substitute for the disabilities of the individuals in the population in an absence of understanding of the human mind you inevitably have government and you have as much government as you have crime until the whole government is crime there is nothing government does that has not been done privately at one time this includes fire departments police etc police forces that are part of government have nothing in common with public safety the more government you have the less liberty you will have because government is nonproducer the laws that the government passes against crime apply to you who are in theory honest hired men next thing you know you havent even got yourself anymore but there is international group that faces and opposes dianetics and scientology except to the degree that aberration opposes sanity mediumgood auditor gets chewed up from time to time an excellent auditor never gets chewed up the only enemy of man is his aberration you just need to audit thats all if people attack you it is because you are not auditing them what they want is relief from their own misery and agony and you are giving them auditing once you have embarked on this sort of thing you are in for it if you dont carry through with it in the past when we have not executed our commitments we have been in trouble you have to make some kind of arrangement whereby auditing can occur pc who has screaming arc break can be smoothed out just by auditing him smoothly and well though true enough he has missed withholds for you to clean up pcs arc break over auditing auditing can also be conducted so as to amount to auditing of any kind making auditing occur and making it possible is an even stronger action than pulling missed withholds although that is necessary too auditing is pure magic the pretense of auditing without auditing is pure poison it is dangerous to be almost an auditor going through the motions of auditing without really listening to the pc etc pc will put up with relatively poor auditor but not with pretended auditor all the things you are having trouble with are resolvable with auditing therefore you must not fall short as an auditor in last nights tvd it turned out that the pc had set up the room in such way that the meter wasnt secure it bounced around and had to be fixed when it was fixed the pcs needle cleaned up the above truth applies regardless of the dynamic you are addressing you cant counterfeit the intention to audit if you have that you will win if you dont you wont even if the pcdoesnt perceive the intention you should handle the situation by auditing put in the hope factor and the rfactor and audit what causes the apparent revolt against dianetics and scientology when it occurs it is particular sort of missed withhold missed dynamic item or goal it doesnt much matter what it is the person is thetan who is basically good an appeal directly to the thetan bypasses all the garbage and secures his cooperation if you truly intend to audit him all the crimes wars and insanity in the world are not caused by the individual himself they are caused by the misapprehensions of that individual the greatest misapprehensions of all are his considerations of the dynamic and item as result of his carelessly postulated goal we are dealing here with human behavior if an individual exists and can be reached anything wrong he does thereafter is the result of his not being reached or audited here is what makes him tough to reach 1 his goal 2 his item which is his pet antipathy 3 his dynamic in which he has included all the badness of existence hes fighting against shadows which are quite real to him persons goal may commit scientology to the status of being in his consideration his oppterm whether it makes any sense or not to you the scientologist you cant predict this just from knowing the goal it involves the pcs interpretation of the goal and his track experience you match up to his oppterms in his universe rockslamming case is one who would get rock slam on consider committing overts against 1 scientology 2 ron 3 the organization 4 the auditor if you get rock slam on any of those four commands the person considers you an enemy he is not unauditable but the meter behaves oddly it is rockslammers who have made things unpeaceful for the last twelve years not governments psychiatrists or some international organization these people make up not more than twenty percent of an organization if psychiatrists or psychologists had come up with results like ours they would have published our case histories with graphs and all nevertheless they would undoubtedly rock slam because they have basic disagreement with what we are doing the psychologist has agreed that man is an animal meat robot there is an earlier fundamental that makes this lie psychology means study of the psyche if you talk to psychologist dont get into discussion about whether man is an animal talk about the derivation of psychology their fundamental name you will thereby blow off their disagreement with us and clear up something that was definitely antipathetic to themselves the individual existed before the goal the goal is less fundamental than the individual it is only the antipathetic goal that gives you trouble cf expanded dianetics evil purposes dont reward the rebel put him on the meter and check the four commands given above if someone rockslams on one of those dont hire him or enrol him on coaudit you could enrol him on subcoaudit hang the rock slam around his neck and he wont cause any trouble because you have asised the fact that he is rockslammer rockslammers will dramatize in 11 manner if you dont get them audited you get an emergency telephone call and they write down the message for you then as they leave the room their coat brushes it off into thewastebasket you dont see it but later on they can prove that they wrote it down for you they will also agree with you about doing all the silly things you mention and they will dissuade you somehow from doing all the right things knowing these principles you can understand human behavior much better in an organization clearing coaudit marriage or any other group you have surefire way of testing for the person who has to be straightened out it is the person who rockslams when the group or person is mentioned in consider committing overts against _______ it is not one bad act that makes rock slam it takes long accumulation of overts the thing that person rockslams on may be so suppressed that it has to be thoroughly tiger drilled see p 295a before it rockslams find and handle rockslammers neither snuff them nor let them foul up the nonrockslammers we are in the weird situation that if we lose everybody loses while if we win everybody wins so it is an overt act for an auditor not to pick up and pay attention to rockslammer because if he omits to do this he is letting the person lose and making it possible for everybody to lose the rockslammer will only win if you do something only finding goal will make rockslammer go straight6210c09 shspec200 future org trends if scientology organizations did nothing cohesive and had central control but only had people doing processing and if combined with this situation there were other people with vested interest in making slaves we could get thrown on the dung heap and scientology could end up being practiced with electric shock by governments on the other side we could have completely different picture wellunified scientology with sufficient international esteem and force to overcome any attempt to use it wrongly buddhism for lack of plan ended up being an enslaver of people some thought needs to be given to scientologys future to make sure that scientology doesnt end up like buddhism in buddhism nirvana became like gpm look at picture of nirvana sometime it looks like someone surrounded with valences gpm lamaism with more ghosts and devils became like another gpm zen buddhism was based on the idea that if you are hit you know much of it is dramatization of axiom 10 the indian rope trick is mass hypnotism the east never had technology that did anybody any good they knew few answers but they all wound up in the soup so this is the first time on this planet and maybe in this universe when sentient beings could better themselves without worsening someone else we are looking at tremendous force not as in bullets but force of knowingness theta force in this universe one is used to seeing good people being squashed it starts to look like goodness is weak not force and that evil is strong that is this universes lesson but it is not true the reverse is true even though this universe would like us to believe otherwise and seems to provide numerous proofs to the contrary if you block theta comm line and tap it you can suck certain power off it that is residual in it but it will explode in very short order the way an organization gets in bad shape is by individuation an org commits overts against other orgs and gets into games condition with them then starts considering itself strange and different then it cant communicate anymore or function anymore this cycle is an interesting phenomenon which one can see every day overts are followed by the still after the confusion the withhold the quiet moment on the battlefield is the one that sticks so the stable datum is likely to be whatever someone thought after the fight was over this is not necessarily what holds it still at all one dramatizes the withhold it is not the overt but the withhold that is the source of action for instance bill shoots joe and doesnt tell the police he fires joe falls bill feels remorse and says i mustnt tell the police and that not the shooting is what he dramatizes as time goes on he is longer sure what he mustnt tell to get rid of the source of pronouncement of his guilt he commits more overts against the police his i mustnt tell the police equates to individuation from the police he also mustnt be joe the victim that is another individuation he might be able to tell you the withhold i mustnt tell the police but he will probably not be able to spot or asis the prior overt since it is at the level of action committing an overt results in an individuation the more separate we are the less we can communicate and the less we can understand if you want laugh get someone to explain something to you in an area that he has overts on using symbolic logic where instead of numbers you are using meanings all mathematics can be derived from arc in the absence of arc ie when there are many overts there is understanding or knowledge overts lower which lowers the other two r and c someone who is totally stupid in an area has overts in that area in the absence of arc there can by definition be knowledge you can always apply these mechanics backwards you can make someone feel that he has done something if he has withhold about it if we tell someone that we will burn him in the electric chair he will dream up crime to fit the punishment even if he continues to protest hisinnocence cf the jews in german concentration camps who felt they must have somehow betrayed their fatherland also if you tell someone not to touch something enough times he will start to believe that it is dangerous whether it is or not this is because you have told him not to communicate with it and the definition of dangerousness is not to be communicated with logic is twopoled there are two sides to an equation the mind also operates on two poled basis thus when describing scientology to someone if you keep on saying that it isnt like this that or another thing he will get the idea that it simply isnt you have to dream up something scientology is just like so there will be datum of comparable magnitude you will find that the more arc he has towards the thing you compare scientology with the better he will understand scientology so the best strategy is to compare scientology to himself his highest arc terminal this will intrigue him at least you want things better right so does scientology you probably have lot of basic wisdom about life some buried but really there you have observed things scientology ia like you you like to be free scientology wants that you would be surprised how effective even so crude an argument could be with people it doesnt even matter if his understanding of scientology is correct or not he will get some r and c in the absence of any arc you have observation and knowledge of the object or thing something you feel something about have tiny reality on and have communicated slightly to the vicinity of that thing would be something that you would understand only slightly but you would know it existed there is an understanding that goes along with each step of the tone scale up to total arc which is total understanding this leads up to being part of everything which is the booby trap of nirvana the reverse of individuation is enforced association one can obsessively become something there is cycle here overts first lead to individuation then goes on through the cycle to obsessive identification with the thing overted against pcs associate themselves with their own oppterms in varying degrees this phenomenon occurs throughout existence what you resist you become is here more accurately stated as that against which you have overts you become one becomes more and more individual and individuated up to limit at which point the harder one tries to individuate the more one becomes sort of fake version of that against which one has overts this shows up in dynamic assessment and clearly shows up with the item this is how the person rockslams if an organization overts against another one it becomes more and more individuated until it becomes lowerlevel beingness thetan will run whole cycle this way that is why you get the dead thetan at 20 he is obsessively being what he was once part of we must keep the above mechanism of individuation in mind and look at the organizational plan that says that one scientologist is field auditor and another is staff member this plan gives us source of inadvertent withholds if we are planning anything broad in the way of organizations we have to eliminate any incipient individuation or we will get fake scientology scientology must be single org in which the members freely participate yet scientology orgs must never individuate from scientology they must never be allowed unhandled overts or scientology will crash like every other attempt to help man the hco 10 tends to further individuation since it makes hco different from the org philosophers say that every organizations ethic is strongest at its inception but actually there ia reason why its ethic shouldnt get much higher to accomplish this you must set it up such that organizations are not made different from each other in order to avoid the incipient inadvertent withhold which would lead to true scientology being in existence here lrh goes into describing at some length an ideal scene for lower level scientology organizations6210c09 shspec201 instructors bugbear an auditor clears as fast as he is bright and as he delivers good quality auditing and he clears as slowly as he flubs if all is not going well look to what is wrong with the auditor not the pc there is nothing wrong with pcs some pcs require more cleverness on the part of the auditor than others apparently the individuality of life was all attained by goals that doesnt mean people are individuals because of goals it means that they are odd individuals because of goals goal is symptom of individuation so each person acts differently in processing but there is goal too difficult to be found if you can discover goal never to be discovered why you have damned good technology auditing quality is not associated with sternness or immovability or with being able to repeat the auditing command or the idea that the auditor must always be right an instructor watching half dozen auditors may think that he needs half dozen new rules to overcome these students peculiar difficulties actually all he needs is tremendous ability to detect variation from the standard rule this variation is sometimes so clever and well hidden that one never spots it an auditor can leave the session on the forward track by leaving the pc at time point and progressing to point g as fast as possible the auditor is actually leaving the session by way of the future time track instead of the door the auditor is running the session process and the pc is still stuck in the first rud that the auditor couldnt confront and therefore didnt handle in an effort to avoid facing the confusion in session the auditor unwittingly refuses to set up session he ignores and evades some part of the session that he has had trouble with now the pc is trying to get into session while the auditor tries to run from the session the pcs who give you the most trouble are the ones who do the least they dont explode at you they dont walk out they are just never in session and auditing never bites they make forward progress the good pc is produced by an auditor who never gets the pc into session enough to arc break them everything is all sort of shallow dusted off but not investigated etc there was communication and understanding present the auditor was trying to avoid arc breaks so there was arc at the outset and the whole session was an arc break standard auditing is the cycle of asking the auditing question of that pc who is sitting in that chair getting response or answer from that pc which is then understood by the auditor and is acknowledged by the auditor in such way that the pc knows he did properly answer when this is interfered with weirdnesses creep in it is terribly simple cycle and terribly simple people such as myself dont seem to have too much trouble with it more brilliant people figure their way through and arrive at some kind of mutated answer to it that produces noauditing situation and how they manage to do this is the subject of an instructor this is the instructors nightmare the instructor must observe the departure from the simple comm cycle and get the auditor to see what he is doing the instructor has to point out to students their errors in such way that they realize that they are not doing what they should be doing where do all these oddball considerations come from apart from goals which is source that we already know about man can rise above his aberrations anyway he doesnt have to dramatize his aberrations to the full it is not good enough to say that his goal and his item oppose his being good auditor even though he will perhaps never be fully expert until these are out of the way there is another element however the auditor has fixed idea left over from some group or philosophy or activity about what is supposed to happen or what he is supposed to do to make something happen when he audits for instance he may have been part of society which supposed that there was reason why you couldnt decide to be anything you wanted to be and immediately become it according to this view all men were evil because they couldnt do this thats rather familiar one on the track this is weird way of making nothing out of thetans an auditor with this kind of background operates on the basis that the pc is weak because he doesnt just make up his mind to go clear and do itanother oddball consideration is why should you ask anybody question they already know and they know you know wait minute those are the people who think that everybody knows all about them to whom every minute is missed withhold this is the consideration well that is obvious to so it should be obvious to him then there is the consideration that the auditor has to control the session and that that means never let the pc originate or never confess that you didnt understand the answer or never check anything the pc tells you is out like rud so this auditor is doing basic notis of auditing the whole time he is auditing and it will be found that he has never examined his fixed idea with this auditor the instructor must 1 find the fixed idea 2 get the auditor to look at it person can get the impression of knowing from an impact so if you have committed fantastic number of overts against thing you conceive that you know something about it but its an inverted knowingness its the total cycle of individuation and the pc returns on the reverse curve of inversion back to the center of impact see pp 242242a for more detailed description of this cycle at this point he knows that he knows but ask him say psychiatrist what he knows and he cant tell you anything that he knows if you kept it up things would get very interesting because you would deindividuate him out of an obsessed interiorization into whatever hes doing you would be reversing the cycle until he again knows he doesnt know when you try to teach such an individual something to know that room has already been rented it has occupants you cant because he already knowsat the level of impact and obsessive interiorization so you have to reverse that cycle and convince him that there is something he doesnt know this is the guy who greets everything you tell him with yes i know so you say to him everybody hates you and you will get yes i know 0h now wait minute well i knew if i knocked long enough somebody would open that door hello if you press such an auditor long and well enough as an instructor he will eventually cognite either that he knows or that he doesnt know and new piece of certainty will be added to his auditing dont leave these fixed ideas uninspected by the auditor just ask him to inspect his own considerations about why he is doing must do or should do what he is doing wrong take his cockeyed memorized answers acknowledge and then give the question again break down his machinery and he will finally see some screwy alteris that he has added into what he really should be doing ask him what puzzles you in session and you will get an item of alteris and confusion it is usually something he has added which wasnt taught all additives occur in the absence of understanding or the presence of misunderstanding idiocy equals all additives and understanding understanding is the reason for additives misunderstanding is the reason for additives know this misunderstandings get picked up on meters as disagreement nocomprehension of education by disagreement is fascinating approach hence while word clearing on meter you dont ask on spotting read what didnt you understand there you ask for the symptom of the lack of understanding what is the disagreement there in life with respect to knowledge disagreement occurs after the misunderstanding get the auditor to spot his disagreements and you will find his misunderstoods if you get him to give you twelve things in that bulletin you agree with you will inevitably get the twelve things they disagree witha person cannot do what he does not understand increase persons understanding arc of what he is doing and he will do it better an auditor is not evil there is something he misunderstands or doesnt understand about the function of the auditor or the cycle of auditing action you cant understand psychiatrists because you dont realize that they havent any goals they arent doing anything that you would think they should be doing goofing auditor can get really wild in his computations you have to spot it and get him to spot it for instance you could get computation like this 1 im trying to straighten out this pcs mind 2 therefore i have to correct the things that they think 3 the only way to correct anything is to change it 4 so to change the pc i have to correct him 5 so i have to tell the pc something different every time he says something if you do not understand what is going on in session you wont be able to handle that session at the bottom of all error is misunderstanding you restore understanding of something by deleting the disagreement with it then you can study it and do things with it etctape

routine 3ga listing the reason some pcs go to clear on listing and the reason some dont at once lies entirely with the auditor the dominant rules are two 1 dont force the pc to list more items than he

asking it again when the pc has comm lagged leaves amongst other things an unanswered auditing question the line is asked the pc answers until he or she comm lags the auditor then acks and goes instantly to next line if the pc says he has more on the old line the auditor says sorry and takes them line is run to first comm lag how long is comm lag it is the pause before the strained grope pcs

onward the auditor is at fault right at the end of 2 the auditor acks and gives the pc the next line the auditor takes only the bright easily gotten flows if the pc goes fumbling and groggy the auditor is at fault and is doing wronglisting is rapid action the way to keep it rapid is to deftly see that the pc has given all and then get out of there auditors whose pcs dope and grope will soon have pcs that mope the auditor avoids q and the auditor never repeats an item back to the pc or asks if it fits on the line the auditors role is permissive with good presence if the auditor does not understand an item he or she says so but does not include any repeat of the item in saying so thats evaluation listing is slightly contrary to early auditing philosophy then if the pc protested the auditor forced the pc to answer in listing this is never done then if the pc comm lagged the auditor flattened it in listing one never flattens comm lag one shifts the moment the first comm lag appears but without startling the pc listing auditing is different the pc is always right in listing if you trick pc into more items and prevent the pc from giving those items he has readily to hand the whole case may have to be patched up before it will clear it is so easy to list right as an auditor that many will fumble all over the place before they get the knack and almost all errors will be additive errors listing is the biggest barrier to clear now that we can find goals other listing methods may appear but these will only alter what lines nothing is going to alter the above so you

orgs franchise auditor failure to understand if pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough_____ or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit the highest advance of 19th century psychology was machine to drive people crazy all it did was repeat after the person everything the person said children also do this to annoy but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of it further dont gesture to find out to say pointing you mean this item then is not only an evaluation but nearly hypnotic command and the pc feels he must reject very strongly dont tell the pc what the pc said and dont gesture to find what the pc meant just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again thats the correct action driving in anchor pointsalso do not shove things at pc or throw things to pc dont gesture toward pc it drives in anchor points and makes the pc reject the auditor rock slammer the reason person who rock slams on scientology or auditors or the like cant audit well is that they are wary of pc and feel they must repeat after the pc correct the pc or gesture toward the pc but rock slammer or not any new auditor may fall into these bad habits and they should be broken fast summary very high percentage of arc breaks occur because of failure to understand the pc dont prove

withhold lrh enumerates the many bulletins that have come out on missed withholds starting in february 1962 in spite of all this the subject has not been duplicated by students people keep picking up withholds instead of missed withholds all arc breaks stem from missed withholds i dont know exactly how to get this across to you except to be brave squint up your eyes and plunge get the missed withhold missed withhold is withhold that people nearly found out about but didnt you want to find out what people almost found out withhold is something pc did and isnt talking about it is not missed unless someone nearly found out about it the missed withhold has nothing to do with what the pc did or is doing its not the pcs action it is the other persons action and the pcs wonder about it it often shows up as recurring withhold one which the pc keeps giving you the charge keeps coming up because of the restimulation as yet unlocated of someone possibly finding out missed withhold has nothing to do with the pc it is another persons action and the pcs wonder about it forget that it is even withhold you are looking for exact moments in the lifetime of this pc when somebody almost found out and hes never been sure since whether they did or they didnt we dont care what they almost found out we only care that they almost found out something that is the address to missed withhold its an otherpersonthanthepcs action its an other persons action the pc is stuck in the unknownness of the uncertainty as to whether someone else knew this blows when the pc spots it missed withhold is an overt and withhold plus mystery the magnitude of the overt has nothing to do with its evaporation the degree of mystery is what holds it in place if you want to know what is sticking thetan to something look for the mystery sandwich even overts themselves wind up in the mystery of whether you should have done it this causes withholding of further action all things boil down to right conduct so when you ask the pc for missed withholds be alert for whether the pc is giving you withholds or missed withholds the number of withholds person has on the whole track is undoubtedly staggering you dont need to get them all to clear somebody the whole anatomy of game is ow you gather energies by the mechanism of ow which result in solidmass terminals making game possible etc in spite of all that you dont have time enough to run nut all the pcs overts even for one lifetime general ow does have its uses it is useful for getting the pc into session and smoothing things out but it is generally too lengthy so to see case go sproing ask the pc for nearlyfoundouts when i tell you to pick up pcs missed withhold i want you to pick up another persons action not the pcs and it is best characterized as nearly found out you are running the almost discovered track youll never see anybody quite so upset as somebody who has been just barely missed look at pedestrian who was not hit or bear that is biting at bullet that just missed him or an exam that you failed by one or two points its the nearness of the miss that counts it is misestimation of effort or thought thetans main attention is on estimation of thought effort and look he wants to know how much look is look his certainties are all based on proper estimation of thought effort look etc when an error is made here it is upsetting how much knowledge is knowingness that is an estimation how much emotion does it take to be emotional enough to create the desired effect what is proper symbol etc you can estimate everything except how much mystery constitutes mystery because that is mystery you are now into the noestimation band and it is all mysterious the not knowingness of it is upsetting notknowingness that is probably known is especially painful because of the multiple notknow flows involved take notknowingness and play with it both ways they knew but they didnt or couldnt have known you know they knew but you know they didnt know the fourway flows of missed withhold are painful to thetan this is the stuff of which insanity is made insanity in the effort band of the know to mystery scale is cant reachmust reach insanity in the mystery band is diddidnt mustmustntknow that is what missed withhold is and what it is doing to the pc its just pure mystery mucilage and the thetan will stick right to it getting just the overt and withhold off when there is an added mystery of missed withhold doesnt produce an asisness of the section of track where the pc is stuck because the pc is not stuck with the overt or the withhold the pc is stuck with the almost found out so of course nothing asises if you only get the ows and you get recurring withhold you could get remarkable results running get the idea of people nearly finding out about you you could run this on three flows this process would free up track that the pc had never seen before but which had been right in front of his nose so when pulling missed withholds it is not what the pc did which is of interest when pulling withholds get the name rank and serial number of the person who missed it i couldnt care less what was missed i dont want the pcs action i want the pcs guess about the other guy get who the pc thinks might know etc etc if you have gotten off his overts on something and he still feels bit weird about it you are apt to think that he must have more overts so you keep after him for more this will send him around the bend since you are essentially cleaning clean you have to find 1 who nearly discovered the overt 2 when 3 how often this is what is needed to complete the cycle that was started when the overt was almost discovered just as far as time is concerned it is mystery sandwich the thetan is wondering whether certain punitive track is going to happen it doesnt so that time doesnt exist the result in the creation of mockedup track that never actually appears on the track and therefore hangs up in time not dropping the other shoe is like producing missed withhold so you dont ask what have we failed to find out about you ask what have we nearly found out about you and when did we nearly find it out the first gets withholds the second gets missed withholds the worst type of missed withhold is where the pc is asking himself which one of my crimes did he maybe discover 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth it is very difficult to go around remembering all the time you get stuck pontius pilate asked what is truth truth is very near ultimate in its most severe interpretation lots of people have stated what truth is without realizing that they are putting an absolute where there is actually maybe truth is relative commodity the best approach to truth is contained in the mathematics used in connecting telephone switchboards they dont select out subscribers with arithmetical truth arithmetic is theoretical truth it is only theoretical because there is commodity connected with it it is truth of symbols errors only turn up when people say the symbols mean something in reality two apples minus two apples equals apples is magicians trick noapple is relative thing there is still something of an apple you can say well there are apples on the table after you take two apples off that is true as long as you accept time as truth which is adventurous the statement is only true for one particular time and place yet it passes as truth it is truth but relative one thetan since apples came into existence has utterly asised an apple so two apples minus two apples equals apples is only relative unless it presupposes some kind of magic we have become used to accepting such things as true the abstract 220 is true but it is true only because we have set it up that way the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desperateness it is an adventurous step philosopher who seeks to discover and teach truth is taking his life in his hands as well as the lives of many others therein lies his responsibility it is adventurous because it is the only track you have to go the whole way on there is short stop on the way to truth you have to walk to the end of the road otherwise all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you there is such thing as relative philosophical truth that is safe if it doesnt approach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses if you address the subject of the physical universe through the physical sciences you will find weird things in your path the savants of these sciences use the phrase exact science with great impudence considering the complete difference between what is given as truth in two different fields like chemistry and physics there is an article in the encyclopedia britannica at the turn of the century that wisely said that people wouldnt find out much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis that preceded time and space physics has gotten the world in trouble by building weapons that can be used by men who arent sane there are workable truths which gives the exact sciences bloated notion of themselves because they deal in workable truths in the field of the study of man people try to use as workable truth the notion that one can do anything about man because he is merely an animal this idea started as revolt against religions control of mens faith psychology is study that is peculiarly religious and was so until 1879 when wundt theorized that man has soul up to that point psychology had been religious study looking at the will reason etc somebody moved in on it in the spirit of revolt just as the advances of the exact sciences have here and there down the track blown up religion so the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in total falsehood concerning the mind at the same time they have developed an unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the road to truth and not going towards truth gautama siddhartha discovered how to exteriorize without discovering the laws governing it or how to let someone else exteriorize at will how many hundred million people did he condemn to slavery by not walking all the way down that road because halftruths have been used and misused ever since knowing this it takes brave man to go in that direction he knows that the traps and upsets of existence are composed of halftruths and that all efforts to enlighten can be employed to enslave and entrap by the fact of twoway flow aesops fables originally had morals they were just amusing storiesthis is pertinent to what you are doing because in the microcosm of single person you have the macrocosm of the universe the universe proceeds from basic postulates you can go on from these basic postulates to spot the goals of gold and lead and the methods of livelihood of quartz and schist they arent alive but they follow behavior pattern all flies wash their faces in the same way it is wonderful the way some postulates stick moss or man you are looking at the same cumulative structure based on some intentions and dedications you could reanalyze the world of chemistry or physics on the basis of postulates and intentions one of the booby traps of studying science is the sort of statement typified by nobody knows what electricity is this is in fact just remark not even postulate but everyone takes it as truth so they go into agreement with it and therefore are debarred from discovering more truth people have been telling other people for long time that they cant find out about truth the idea of the unknowable has some use but only to let people see that you dont have to know all about something before you start to find out about it emmanuel kant used the concept of the unknowable differently he said that the unknowable would never be known by anybody well how did he find out about it even by philosophic examination it is preposterous if you cant experience it at all how can you know it exists to be notknown there are some roads that are agreed to be closed for instance there is an idea that it is bad to know about the human mind some things it is better not to know if you are alive you know something about the human mind what is really dangerous is to find out nothing more about it in the last few days the cobalt60 was close to spreading across the steppes of russia and the plains of the us because of what because it is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree but they recognize what is really dangerous if you know of the existence of something it is dangerous not to know all about it people concede that they dont know anything at all about it that is an idiotic premise in the field of the mind they are already aware of the existence of figure think calculate in other beings so they are already started on the road to knowledge of the human mind it is very dangerous to go further so the search for truth isnt the province of few everyone has started to know something about it but not to know more about it than they do will cause them to die that doesnt even seem startling it is so accepted if group decides to go all the way on the road to truth the more they know the less dangerous it is what is really dangerous is to suppose that people think and to know nothing more about it than that it is also very dangerous to be spotted as one who is walking towards truth unless you go the whole way it is booby trapped everyone is very suspicious of anything being known because people who have jumped up and said something was known have often lied if they pretended to know more then others they have committed overts if they found some partial truth and never got any further but instead spread bricabrac in all directions as the true wisdom they have committed the overt of consigning perhaps billions of people to slavery so there is substitute for walking the track lrh has never doubted that he would bring off this study though he has often wondered whether or not the time factor would upset things we needed few clear years if you have reputation for knowing you enter into mechanism called the missed withhold if you seem to have the gift of knowing about the mind people think you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves first dynamic truth this includes their own aberrations their ideas about rightness of conduct etc so you run into missed withholds scientist wants to get away from right and wrong because he is blind to the possibility that there could be an exact right conduct the idea of right conduct has been particular concern of eastern philosophers it has been ignored in the west all considerations of behavior and the ow mechanism are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct in back of the ow mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist this is the saving grace of any race of beings survival is the monitoring factor of rightness of conduct the behaviorist would try to tell you that right conduct is first dynamic matter that it is not survival but selfpreservation this misses the boat person commits overts not because of selfpreservation but because of survival that is his rightness of conduct the difference is that in fact one acts out of more than one dynamic right conduct is always group activity not an individual one matter how much person speaks of integrity to himself his ideas of his own rightness arebased on the concepts of the group to which he belongs so we get third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all ow and missed withholds the only thing senior to ow is the pure mechanics of existence as given in the early axioms those early axioms are very close to absolute truth thought absolutes are unattainable because the only absolute is static and that is nothing hence it is unattainable because it cannot be had the aberrations person engages in are his efforts to discover right conduct with the handicap that mores change from group to group and lifetime to lifetime so there is road to truth on the subject of right conduct if you realize that thetans aberrated condition results from 1 search for right conduct 2 an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct 3 the breaking of codes of right conduct then you are walking the road to truth moral statements are the entrance of arbitraries into conduct not truths this fact is unknown to legislators who always try to say that their laws are true but in making the laws they longer even consult the customs of the people but instead try to reverse the social order however laws which dont evolve from the customs of the people 1 operate as total tyranny 2 are totally unenforceable prohibition was good example of this fact this concerns you because you are in the business of determining truth from right conduct or nowimsupposedtos people think that right conduct is truth they think they have some data when they dont your period of peril is past there was time when taking you as unit of truth there was question whether or not your state of understanding of yourself could be materially improved by study and processing however it is now clear that if anyone will sit still and if the auditor does the right processing this will occur we started out with everyone stupid as hell on the subject including lrh originally now we have gotten to the point where someone can know all about where he has been what he has done and where the axioms look to him like clearlystated obvious things we are essentially in the business of individuals dont forget that matter what you are trying to do or handle whether it is world government or whatever it is you will never in your whole history handle more than sn individual if you fail to handle an individual then you will have to set up all sorts of groups and laws to do it the raison detre of most earth organizations is the fact that they could not handle an individual this brought about their construction not their demise this isnt true of all third dynamics only the aberrated ones here on earth this is actually an inverted third dynamic they couldnt handle the first dynamic so they developed an organization not to have to do it despite that scientology is the one activity on this planet that doesnt follow this rule there still tends to be an organization that gets pulled in and grows up around lrh at times this organization fails to deliver service due to shortage of time or material or personnel but on the whole we are handling the individual russia shoots individuals and loves the masses this is aberrated you can handle the individual if everything you do is individually tailored to serve his needs so he is not overlooked whenever you fail to handle an individual you set up an upset so you will set up an organization laws and all sorts of ow to do it we are probably the only organization today going in the direction of clear third dynamic we use ow only to park an individual until we can handle him there is truth in the mass of things and truth in moral codes truth isnt to be found there only agreements there is truth apart from the individual if there is any truth you are it if there is any truth to be known you will know it when someone almost caves in because you have confronted him and made him wonder what you do know ie when you have missed withhold on him your only mistake is not to reach him as truth you are at thatmoment confronting the road to truth and you have got to travel it because you have already started to there will be many pc that you will start to process many person that you will tell about scientology of whom you will say why did i get up this morning if someone says i heard that ron doesnt believe in god the wrong thing to do is to unload jump off the road you handle it all your disasters anyplace will stem from the instant you backed off turned around did something else and set up an organization to handle this jerk you will only fail when you dont try because if you make some stab at it he wont go away you will be surprised to find that you will pick him up somewhere down the track many times you will think you have failed when you havent the only mistake is to try to go backwards on the road to truth that is dangerous if you fail to stand up to someone who is mad at you because of his missed withholds or to the guy in the pe course who says it cant be true because ron doesnt believe in god that is when you fail catastrophes occur people get mad at you you cave in but that can be changed or handled if you fail to handle an individual you end up setting up an org to handle masses but not individuals individuals only stand up and yap in order to be handled there is truth to be found and there is road to truth you have that in you and every time you look at human being you see it in him rut you dont find truth in the mass of things and in moral codes since you understand what human nature is about the more you know and understand it the less these factors like having to handle banky individual will trouble you but every little fellow has started on the road to truth his only stupidity is not to keep going we are almost there the main road and the thorns are behind us we only retreat from our position to the degree that we dont realize that you cant start case you cant embark on clearing planet or an individual and do it diffidently without to some degree seeing it through to final conclusion your only disasters will stem from failure to follow that road all the way throughhubbard

auditors whether classed or not if an auditor is found to have found wrong goal make him or her pass this hco bulletin again if wrong goal has been found on pc and has been confirmed as correct but later refuted that goal must be big tiger drilled out of existence all pain and sensation and meter reaction off at once if wrong goal has been found on pc checked out as correct and listed that wrong goal must be prepchecked out of existence and all pain sensation and reaction on the meter removed and immediately these are first primary important and mandatory actions they must be done at once on the discovery of the wrongness of goal other action may be done until the above is done and the above must be done right now not next month when we have an auditor available and poetically it should be done by the person who found the goal if immediately available and should be done in addition to that persons regular auditing even finding the right goal does not straighten out the found wrong ones if more than one wrong goal has been found and listed or not the wrong goals must be eradicated chronologically the first wrong goal found is the first one to be done the above rules apply as to whether the goal was listed or not in other words what is to be done with each wrong goal is governed by the first two paragraphs of this hco bulletin now these rules are not because of policy they are technical and the technical is extreme in its validity and so this hco bulletin becomes policy because it has such heavy technical validity finding and running wrong goals is very destructive and very dangerous to pcs life and health the most effective treatment pc who has had wrong goal found or run can have is the eradication of the goal by big tiger or prepcheck the pc will get gain beyond mere repair in the presence of wrong goal found or found and run other processes will work ie problems intensive or general ow or missed whs the presence of wrong goal found or found and run will develop ptp that stops all further progress an auditor will just make headway on case that has had wrong goal found or found and run until one or the other of the first two paragraphs of this hco bulletin has been done properly symptoms of right goal listed wrongly 1 ta getting high and sticky 45 or 5 and nothing brings it down or ta staying below 2 and nothing brings it up2 pc looking bad old grey weight increasing 3 pc acting blowy 4 more sen than pain on pc symptoms of wrong or improperly cleaned goal unlisted 1 doesnt rocket read and prepcheck can make it rocket read even once out of three times 2 checking it gives pc sen only and pain during checkout 3 pc blowy 4 pc says or feels goal is overwhelming 5 pc cant wrap his or her wits around goal 6 its not something pc really wanted

4 pc relaxed during checkout cooperative but not selling the goal particularly 5 pc gets cognitions on the goal 6 tiger drilling prepchecking or checking gives pc pain 7 if sen is on cleanup wipes it off and turns it to pain 8 pain never wholly vanishes handling goal doesnt wipe out all its pain for very long pain always returns even when briefly departed 9 goal goes out and in sometimes does sometimes doesnt read 10 right goal reads are different wrong goal reads are very constant and rarely rocket after maybe once or twice when found 11 rocket read can always be recovered on right goal even when it has vanished right up to the time it vanishes and the pc goes clear the rocket read gets shorter gets early or late but it doesnt vanish entirely until the goal is blown 12 pc looked better after goal was found 13 rudiments easier to keep in 14 pc cooperative it is hard for an auditor to get reality on goal until he or she has found goal for experience the auditor tends to hope his or her way through and trust that even if it doesnt read the pc will be disappointed or the auditor feels he or she would look bad to our shame auditors have faked goal to pc or instructor also an auditor who is green tends tothrow the burden on the checker and do job thats good enough for check only the right goal reading properly is good enough for check an auditor who finds goal and doesnt get it to read properly before check or who finds goal and doesnt get it checked by another auditor who is expert is irresponsible and an auditor who will not immediately sweat to clean up wrong goal or work overtime and on his own time too to clean up wrong goal thats been listed is just not worthy of the name wrong goals are dynamite prevent them by being properly trained and by doing good job with goals processing in our hands we can deliver results greater than any ever achieved before anywhere thus such powerful weapon must also be respected and used right lrhgljh l ron hubbard copyright

twentyone steps finding goals i have been doing considerable research auditing and case inspection and have worked out the following method of clearing the twentyone steps the first reliable clearing method 3ga is to be found improved in 321 carrying the pc who can be handled this way all the way to ot goal by goal for the difficult pc it is only varied in step 4 below which is changed on difficult pcs to 3ga xx or variations of it clearing has been improved by the advent of tiger drilling and goals prepchecking and by new data on finding goals and on listing the greatest holdup in clearing was lack of an adequate prehav level finding system i have now developed this in hco bulletin 7 november issue iii this will be of enormous help both in finding rock slams to find goals and running out goals when found there is however substitute for well trained accurate auditor out to help the pc this is fully understood requisite to this method the method is briefly as follows 1 tiger drill or prepcheck out of the way any earlier found goals in accordance with hco bulletin 7 november ad12 issue i 2 prepare the pc with problems intensive new style 3 have pc do goals list 850 long 4 tiger drill goals from goal 1 on forward do not preselect goals to be tdd ever on any list just do the list stop at that goal which wont go out by td and which can be made to rocket read occasionally only this step 4 is changed on tougher pc when it includes different goal finding methods 5 prepcheck that goal until it rocket reads with consistency 6 take the basic four lines 1 who or what would want______________________ 2 who or what would not want _________________ 3 who or what would oppose_________________ing 4 who or what would not oppose ____________ingand list and nul each one to an item do list of around 100 do routine assessment on each if more than one stay in take the one that reads best as the item if the pcs early lists on pc whose goal has been found for some time are missing or unavailable do this step just as above otherwise use old written lists as in footnote below 7 repeat 6 above 8 when pcs tone arm ceases to be active with all rudiments in and goal firing on 6 and 7 do roll your own prehav assessment see next hco bulletin on the goal 9 use the lines 1 who or what would goal level 2 who or what would goal not level 3 who or what would level goal 4 who or what would not level goal and do written list for each and assess as in 6 above the lines must make sense to the auditor as well as the pc and be answerable without distorting goal if the ph secondary level is changed in prefix or suffix or tense make sure it reads as well as the original 10 when ta ceases to move on 9 do new roll your own prehav and repeat 9 11 continue as in 9 and 10 until pc is having trouble whatever in spotting and blowing items 12 when last ph level has taken all motion out of ta by 9 10 and 11 is evident get new roll your own prehav and proceed using the lines of 9 but longer writing down items using the pages of composition book and four slant marks with fifth crossing them out as tally 13 when neither old nor new prehav levels can any longer be made to react on the goal and the needle is free prepcheck the auditing on the goal 14 when the auditing is clean prepcheck the goal 15 test all previous prehav levels for the goal and have somebody qualified inspect and attest the absence of goal read and the freeness of the needle this is first goal clear 16 repeat all above steps for the second goal 17 repeat steps 1 to 15 for the third goal as feasible 18 repeat steps 1 to 15 for the fourth goal as feasible 19 repeat steps 1 to 15 for the fifth goal as feasible 20 repeat steps 1 to 15 for the sixth goal as feasible21 find consecutive goals as feasible and run them out tips the cardinal rule of listing is to never demand more than the pc has and never prevent the pc from giving items he or she does have keep the pc in session but dont use the mid ruds to punish the pc every time the pc originates if the pc gets very arc breaky and missed whs dont cure it then in step 4 you have passed the pcs goal in the last page or two so get suppress and protest clean and redo them in tiger drilling the goal is always ahead of you never behind you you leave nothing behind you on the goals list keep careful record of the ph primary and secondary levels run or used in any way treat pcs goals and items lists like jewelry dont lose them above we have highly standard clearing procedure the best of everything that has worked only the four lines in 6 and 9 are subject to change on the easy case this is the best rundown for finding goals and clearing more difficult cases are characterized by two thingsa pcs needle is occasionally very dirty or b goals go out hard on tiger drilling these are the only two guiding points which dictate change even so only step 4 above is changed finding the goal even if some other method than step 4 is used to attain the goal the rest of the above is still followed i surmise that on less easy pcs only the first goal will require other goal finding than step 4 and that the above holds good for all second goals onward for all pcs this however is only surmise and other means than step 4 may be needed on some second goals therefore today we have variation from the above except in actually finding the goal further about 50 at guess of ones pcs require variation from the above to find or run goal as more data becomes available some of the above can be expected to be modified in the interests of speed and positive results but the twentyone steps are based on vast quantities of experience and data note where pc has had his goal found some time ago and written lists exist for the first four lines recover these lists and take them in consecutive sections of 100 and nul them by usual means to an item then again in rotation take the next 100 and nul each to an item the lists however must be from the correct wording of the goal not an earlier variation as they then would not apply in the latter case do only the steps as above rock slamming itemsnote items in the twentyone steps which rock slam when found in listing the goal may have to be opposed or otherwise handled to discharge them see forthcoming hco bulletins on 3ga xx lrh jwrd l ron hubbard copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights

on how to do prehav assessment roll your own prehav assessment has been developed to avoid lengthy prehav assessments b to get much more accurate levels for the pc for use in both finding and listing out goals and c to enter the rock slam channel easily the assessment is done on any available or special prehav scale for the purpose of the assessment for instance the 1st 65 levels of the auxiliary prehave scale the assessment follows the exact steps below how to do one it is very easy to do prehav assessment it is not so easy to do completely accurate one when clearing is going hard the most likely source of error is the prehav assessment it is ridiculously easy for an auditor to make bad one the preclears attention hangs up on button he tells himself isnt it and the invalidation makes it stay in and voila you have wrong assessment like goals prehav assessment must be kept clean of tiger drill buttons you get wrong assessment if the pc has invalidated or protested button or if he or she has suppressed the right one also if too many levels are staying in or too many are going out the mid ruds are out prehav assessment requires careful auditing only experience can give an auditor the full data terms prehav scale any scale giving degrees of doingness or not doingness level any doingness or not doingness on the scale any word in the scale itself assessment any method of discovering level on the scale for given pc read any reaction of the needle different from its regular action for the pc occurring during or slightly after level has been called mid ruds the middle rudiments of the current model session tiger drill that series of buttons which are capable of preventing right goal or level from reading or making wrong level read combined in an appropriate exercisethe most accurate assessment realize that the most accurate assessment of prehav scale would be by the tiger drilling of each level in turn by average on rough pc this would require about one minute per level this would be three hours for 180 level scale unless scales are shorter assessment by elimination would normally be faster if done with due care but tiger drilling scale to find level cannot be ruled out as means of finding the real level with superb accuracy doing the assessment one puts the pc in session gets the mid ruds in takes prehav scale and calls out each level once noting its reaction on the meter if the auditor was not sure or didnt see it the level is called second or third time if too many levels go out consecutively there is suppress if too many levels are staying in there is another mid rud out one marks only those that read those that do not read are not marked pc has his own prehav scale mimeo copy in his folder this is used over and over the pcs name and date of the first assessment is written at the top of the mimeo sheet new symbol is used for each consecutive assessment and the level found on the mimeo sheet and that symbol is marked at the top at the end of the assessment the list is covered once those that read are marked in the mid ruds for the session are put in at the end of the first nulling the list is covered again but only those that stayed in the first time are now read if they read again they are again marked in using the same symbol the list is covered third time but only those that stayed in the second time are read and marked in using the same symbol when the list has not more than eight on rough pc and not less than three levels left in the remaining levels are tiger drilled one level will remainor will react better than the others take this as the primary level and mark it in at the top of the mimeo sheet with its symbol roll your own in times past this primary level would have been enough but using the prehav to locate the rock slam channel or to list out goals requires secondary level to roll your own is to get the pc to give you secondary scale that is in its turn assessedthis is done as follows take the primary level found as above put it in the sentence if somebody were fixated on or wanted to or intended to or wished to_______ primary level what would that person do or use the sentence what would ________primary level represent to you the sentence must cause the pc to give doingness otherwise it must be changed using the primary level so that the pc does give doingness the auditor as in any assessment lists down the pcs answers on 13 foolscap or legal sheet with the pcs name the date and the question at the top of it when the pc says thats all the auditor puts in the mid ruds and lists the question against the meter if the meter reads on the question the list is incomplete and must be completed when the question gives read with mid ruds in the list is complete this list is now handled exactly as the original scale above the resulting level is the pcs level and is used for finding items in 3gaxx or in listing out goals the primary level is not otherwise used the secondary list is not used again new primary assessment is done for the next full operation only these secondary levels are actually used in auditing various primary prehav scales may from time to time be developed for various purposes lrhglbh copyright 1962 l ron hubbard by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 november ad 12 cenocon franchise somatics how to tell terminals and opposition terminals it is important that clearing auditor be able to distinguish pain from sensation terminals from opposition terminals and to have the data at the level of instant knowledge to understand it less is to invite serious errors in clearing failure to sort terminals from opposition terminals can confuse the pc or even degrade the case all pcs somatics deformities and distortions proceed from terminals opposition terminals and combination terminals thus they are of vast importance to the pc and the auditor definitions somatics this is general word for uncomfortable physical perceptions coming from the reactive mind its genus is early dianetics and it is general common package word used by scientologists to denote pain or sensation with difference made between them to understand the source of these feelings one should have knowledge of engrams ridges and other parts of the reactive bank to the scientologist anything is somatic if it emanates from the various parts of the reactive mind and produces an awareness of reactivity symbol som pain pain is composed of heat cold electrical and the combined effect of sharp hurting if one stuck fork in his arm he would experience pain when one uses pain in connection with clearing one means awareness of heat cold electrical or hurting stemming from the reactive mind according to experiments done at harvard if one were to make grid with heated tubes going vertical and chilled tubes going horizontal and were to place small current of electricity through the lot the device touched to body would produce the feeling of pain it need not be composed of anything very hot or cold or of any high voltage to produce very intense feeling of pain therefore what we call pain is itself heat cold and electrical if pc experiences one or more of these from his reactive mind we say he is experiencing pain electrical is the bridge between sensation and pain and is difficult to classify as either pain or sensation when it exists alone symbol pn sensation all other uncomfortable perceptions stemming from the reactive mind are called sensation these are basically pressure motion dizziness sexual sensation and emotion and misemotion there are others definite in themselves but definable in these five general categories if one took the fork in the pain definition above and pressed it against the arm that would be pressure motion is just that feeling of being in motion when one is not motion includes the winds of space feeling of being blown upon especially from in front of the face dizziness is feeling of disorientation and includes spinniness as well as an outofbalance feeling sexual sensation means any feeling pleasant or unpleasant commonly experienced during sexual restimulation or action emotion and misemotion include all levels of the complete tone scale except pain emotion and misemotion are closely allied to motion being only finer particle action bank solidity is form of pressure and when the sensation of increasing solidity of masses in the mindoccurs we say the bank is beefing up all these are classified as sensation symbol sen terminal an item or identity the pc has actually been sometime in the past or present is called terminal it is the pcs own valence at that time in the goals problem mass the black masses of the reactive mind those identities which when contacted produce pain tell us at once that they are terminals the person could feel pain only as himself thetan plus body and therefore identities he has been produce pain when their mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing symbol term opposition terminal an item or identity the pc has actually opposed fought been an enemy of sometime in the past or present is called an opposition terminal as the person identified himself as not it he could experience from it only sensation an opposition terminal when its mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing produces only sensation never pain symbol oppterm combined terminal an item or identity the pc has both been and opposed produces therefore both pain and sensation when it is late on the track which is to say after the fact of many terminals and opposition terminals the combination terminal is the closure between terminal and opposition terminal lines which possesses attributes of both and the clarity of neither it signifies period toward the end of game it is found most commonly when the pcs case is only shallowly entered they exist on all cases but are fewer than terminals and opposition terminals symbol coterm item any terminal opposition terminal combination terminal significance or idea but not doingness which is called level appearing on list derived from the pc symbol it reliable item any item that rock slams well on being found and at session end and which was the last item still in after assessing the list can be terminal an opposition terminal combination terminal or significance provided only that it was the item found on list and rock slammed symbol ri rock slam that needle agitation which erratically covers more than three quarters of an inch on the emeter dial rock slam is the response of an emeter to the conflict between terminals and opposition terminals it indicates fight an effort to individuate an extreme games condition which in the absence of auditing would seek unsuccessfully to separate while attacking as the pcs attention is guided to the items involved the games condition activates and is expressed on the meter as ragged frantic response the wider the response the more recognizable to the pc is the reality of the games condition and the violence of the conflict the rock slam channel is that hypothetical course between series of pairs consisting of terminals and opposition terminals if the conflict is too great for the pcs reality rock slam results later in auditing as the pcs confronting rises items which did not react earlier in auditing now begin to be real and so express themselves on meter as rock slam the pc with the lowest reality level is the hardest to attain rock slam on but in contradiction pc who has the least control over himself in certain zones of life has the largest rock slams the rock slam vanishes under suppression and activates on invalidate or withhold or on other prehav levels this is the most difficult needle response to find or attain or preserve and it is the most valuable in clearingall rock slams result from pair of items in opposition one of which is terminal the other being an opposition terminal it can exist in present time where the pc is the terminal and what the pc is faced with is the opposition terminal symbol rs instant rock slam that rock slam which begins at the end of the major thought of any item symbol irs dirty needle that erratic agitation of the needle which covers less than quarter of an inch of the emeter dial and tends to be persistent symbol dn dirty read that more or less instant response of the needle which is agitated by major thought it is an instant tiny less than quarter of an inch agitation of the needle and is in fact very small cousin of rock slam but is not rock slam it does not persist symbol dr testing the method of testing for the character of an item whether term oppterm or coterm is extremely simple if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on pain in the pcs body it is terminal if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on sensation around or in the pcs body it is an opposition terminal if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on both pain and sensation in or around the pcs body it is combination terminal ways of asking the rule is give the terminal cause the opposition terminal effect in any listing wording or use the simplest form is of course just chanting the item at the pc few times this is not always workable the simplest but not always workable form is for terminal would a__________commit overts for an opposition terminal consider committing overts against__________ using ph level instead of committing overts the prehav level by which the reliable item was found is normally used for terminal would a_____________item____________ph level or consider a______________item_______________ing ph level for an opposition terminal consider_______________ing ph level a_______________item using td buttonsthe above sentences may also be used or their rough approximation with tiger drill or prepcheck button and if rock slam is present it may develop matter what method is being used in saying the item being tested to find out if it is terminal opposition terminal or combination terminal the rules of sensation and pain apply sensation means oppterm pain means terminal it is important to know if an item is term oppterm or coterm as its character as one of the three determines the listing question the same rule for testing applies in listing if it is terminal it prehav levels if it is an opposition terminal it is prehav leveled example for terminal waterbuck prehav level snort proper listing question who or what would waterbuck snort at example for an oppterm tiger prehav level snort who or what would snort at tiger of course the reverse can be listed but is rarely necessary except to get longer list when the pc stalls the line plot line plot must be made up for any pc for his 3gaxx or the listing the goal steps of routine 321 steps 6 7 8 9 10 and ii of 21 steps this consists of heavy blue 13 foolscap or legal sheet of paper kept in the pcs folder and kept up to date every time reliable item or even last item in is found on this line plot one column the lefthand one is reserved for oppterms the right hand column is reserved for terms and lines indicate whenever terms or oppterms are derived from each other reliable item is designated as such on this line plot with the symbol ri nonreliable items are not designated the date each line plot item was found is added after the item so it can be found again in the auditors reports without scramble the full behaviour and character of any item found is written into the auditors report of that session in which it was found the width of the instant rock slam in inches whether the slam turned on every time the item was read what wording turned it on and whether it would still rs by session end are all made part of the auditors report about 20 or 25 of the cases that appear for clearing can have reliable items found on them at once by exploring the words scientology scientology organization an auditor the auditor ron or the head of the local scientology organization by name these are considered to be oppterms by any pc whose realization of his goal would be interfered with he or she feels by scientology it does not matter what wording see above turns on the rs so long as it can be consistently turned on for bit if it is at first only dirty read it is tiger drilled to try to make it rock slam only in this peculiar instance is the person called rock slammer or is considered security risk everyone alive rss on something in any event if items such as those in this paragraph turn on rock slam they are put on the line plot as reliable items and used in handling the case the above material is in actual fact partial anatomy of the goals problems mass its identification in auditing and the behaviour of an emeter towards itas it has never before been viewed by any practice mental science or religion it has to have special terminology the terminology has been stably in use for quite some time in scientology i have made the definitions more precise in this hco bulletin anyone working in clearing should have this hco bulletin data at his instant call without referral to the hco bulletin with very few additions this is the track one walks in clearing and going clear know it l ron hubbard lrh glrd copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6211c13 shspec210 the difficult case problems intensive is apparently capable of producing book one mest clear if it is done right it has done so on couple of pcs if this is not happening elsewhere than at st hill it may be that people elsewhere dont know what free needle is peoples tas have been gotten to clear read with mention of fn so pay some attention to this it could be that it was happening without being reported the aspect of case depends on the way the case is handled generally how the case is handled has great deal to do with how rough the case looks say case and case b are similarly tough cases if case gets lot of usual actions good hope factor good r factor and case b gets unusualness and wrong actions case will run easily and case b will run rough and break anybodys heart psychiatric classification behavior in life etc have bearing on how hard or easy the case will be to handle the same goes for scientology classification schemes we make our own tough cases the black v theetieweetie etc it doesnt matter the length of time to handle the case doesnt compare to the state of the case all cases are hard actually some are made more difficult by preconceptions and classifications that dont really apply the technology has bypassed the difficulties the case that you will have trouble with is always spook and surprise to you it is not the psychiatric disaster case the tough ones are the ones who look sane and able and lie like hell because they dont do the commands they get upset if you keep at them to see if they did the command that just makes them feel accused and they get harder to audit you can spot this kind of case by observing that after short period of modern auditing the case hasnt recovered this case either 1 hasnt done your commands or 2 you havent audited the case this case interrupts the auditing cycle the most extreme example of this kind of case is the individual who cant communicate at all or the case that cant hear or that has command of the language that you are using but that is simple you recognize the outofcommunication state that he is in and know that you would get nowhere with subjective process like straightwire but you miss the case who ostensibly speaks and understands english but never answers the question or executes the commands there is actually gradient of this which at its top level includes every case sooner or later any case wont do the command the spook is the one who never does the command and always does something else what is happening is that he is on circuit he is being wired set of valences the pc is out there somewhere and has nothing to do with the auditing at all dont let your pc sit there in sort of comfortable relaxed puzzle find out what is going on but dont chop up the pc auditors sometimes sense that the pc isnt executing the command and they start harassing the pc chopping him up because they know something is wrong they dont feel in good 2wc with the pc so you move in and get insistent with the pc then the ta moves even less this case is the last one in the world to admit that he is not doing the command he could even get ta say he is running the command through an electronic incident because he knows that if it changes he is better how do you handle this case you watch the ta while you are running the pcs right havingness process or you can run another process that has something to do with the physical universe like op pro by dup scs or cchs if you get good ta with that flatten that the reason you dont notice the ta is that the pc is off the meter but if the pc gets lot of ta in the rudiments and little in the body of the session you know at once that the pc never does theauditing command it is selfevident that this is the true state of affairs if you run the pt environment eg with look at the _______ and the ta moves while problems intensive gives zilch ta here you will see that the pc can get ta such people have short span into the past reality on what went on in the world ceases five minutes to five days ago or so in the body of the session you are trying to send him out of pt if all pcs were like this tough case we would clear people with ruds since ta action gives direct index of case change if you dont get as much ta action in the body of the session as you do in running the rudiments please realize that the process is not running ta motion mirrors directly and immediately the amount of change which is being secured it is direct index of how much bank is changing or shifting so you handle the difficult case by giving ruds and havingness sessions case with good reality on the bank wouldnt get good ta on ruds ta on havingness or any cch or contact process means that the pc is becoming aware of the walls of the room what wall indeed his concept of mass is being shifted by confronting his environment it is not bank mass that is giving ta it is the mass of the walls of the room the pc is in shape to be audited because where is he going to be audited from furthermore he doesnt have the stability of pt to audit against so any attempt on your part to get him to address the track throws him into confusion he cant answer the auditing question because he has point of reference cases are audited against the reference point of pt oddly enough the memory of eight million years ago totally depends on knowing it was sight million years from specific time eg pt guy who is stuck in an electronic incident of three million years ago will get ta when you get him to look at his immediate vicinity otherwise hs will run problems intensive from point three million years ago which is an unstable point so you are running confusion against an instability but two confusions never made stability case that is wildly out of pt seldom answers the auditing command or executes it and auditing depends exclusively on getting the command executed the auditing cycle must occur every time the auditor opens his mouth on recall time you communicated if the time he commed is up the track from where he is stuck he cant recall it because it hasnt happened yet so he has to do something else so for instance he mocks up psychoanalyst against the auditor or he holds the two back corners of the room he does these things because he doesnt want to wasts the auditors time ta action on ruds and on the body of the session is the only reliable indication of this type of case in this situation it becomes important to prepare case dont try to plow the ground with cadillac it is the wrong vehicle if the pc isnt doing the command dont harass him do objective processes when the motion goes out of the ta do the body of the session with subjective processes the gradient scale of toughness of cases is proportional to the amount of ta they get on pt or nearpt processes ruds and havingness to get good reality on this point take pc who has been having an awful time with 3gaxx and run some ptps or some such and watch the ta fly first mentioned in tape 6210c23 shspec202a 3gaxx also mentioned in tape 6210c23 3gaxx following the rock slam and 6210c25 shspec209 3gaxx secondary prehav scale these tapes are confidential the process lists and handles some types of implants it unburdens the case and locates goals see also pp 332335 below and hcobs 8nov62 listing pack ii and 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases for more on 3gaxx running the pc must be there before you audit him the auditing cycle requires the presence of the pc so give him lots of ruds and havingness and problems intensive on closetopt problem he can confront this type of pc will get sensation on list all right because he would get sensation from two days ago it is that unreal he has sensation because he is in the middle of confusion with referral point pt how do you expect him to be anywhere but in confusion thats what sensation basically is the pc in confusion give him pt then you can run him6211c15 shspec212 terminals there is an item on the bulletin board about nixon we really clobbered him i hit him because he hit mary sue he was using the us secret service as sort of private gestapo all over washington which didnt seem right you will notice that after country has defeated country b customs of country b will show up in almost anyone will take on the color of his oppterm this is horrible but true people tend to think of themselves as the cowboy in the white hat and the oppterm as the cowboy in the black hat however the only real to tell whether you are dealing with terminal or an oppterm is whether it turns on pain or sensation pain shows that it is terminal sensation shows that it is an oppterm some people get tangled up because they consider themselves to be the guys in the black hat if you get terminal on the oppterm side or vice versa the consequence is great confusion such an item combination terminal turns on pain and sensation this is deteriorated package mark it in the center of the line plot its legitimate it is new terminal that has attributes of both terminal and oppterm sort of end of the road combination terminal which is lock on both the terminal chain and the oppterm chain in national life you get succeeding generations of politicians performing as combination terminals the us defeats germany then somewhere up the track there is tendency towards democratic fascism in the us it is ok for democracy to exist as long as we can also operate gestapo its that sort of thing that i tend to keep an eye on you may not realize it but you are all members of secret society you have been for very long time it is the spg you can enlist anyone there are dues only performance is required it is the society for the prevention of government it is interesting that man hasnt yet realized that government is the cause of his wars pure government attacks an sp government thus producing combination terminal the pure government henceforth isnt so pure keep this up and you will get what we have in the way of government lrh recently received an invitation to be part of group that is supposed to figure out what should be done with governments and man and atom bombs all the group is doing is meeting in the hope that someone will come up with solution all they are doing is to get people in communication they havent approached governments the reason why government occupies so much of peoples attention is that governments have spokesmen and salesmen while individuals do not democracy is highly publicized but in democracy everything is the peoples fault so the head of the government has responsibility but the people have real choice this is real mess with salesmen you get more and more government individuals become less and less the end of this process is totalitarianism the only reason you collide with government is that you are selling the idea of the individual you see that bettering things by handling the individual is workable system so you push it this puts you up against the government because it is for the government this makes you revolutionary in totalitarian world whether you intend to revolt or not the perfect reply to communist is to tell him that you are an anarchist that is the one thing that he cannot handle he is claiming that communism wants to do away with the state and you force him to say that government is necessary thus you turn him into conservative anarchy has always been rampant in countries just before the communists took over anarchy is the one thing that the communist fears he has so many overts on anarchists that they have almost become sacred to him similarly the us government is becoming more and more communistic eg with its tax laws things wont get straightened out in the political arena they will just get more and more confused you can predict the politics of the future by looking at the opposing sides and combining the least desirable characteristics of both combination terminals in politics occur because the least admired characteristics tend to persistthat which is least admired tends to persist we are going to get the worst of russia and the us combined into super state unless we stop it this is also the fate of any individual livingness alone will not lead to new highly desirable state because the above mechanism will occur in the course of handling cases you will get look at the eventual fate of any individual you process in the absence of further processing suppose you could locate the chief terminal and the chief oppterm in an individual without in any way relieving them you could take the least desirable characteristics of both and get the combination terminal the person would become in few generations those terminals and oppterms that are near the top will produce new pair but first they will produce new single terminal the new combination terminal as the gpm flies off you will see that this had been taking place the freedom that is there to be freed is fantastic because all cases are in very deteriorated state when we first discovered the tremendous power that the basic postulate of an individual could exert over him in the course of creating the sections of the gpm we tended to see it as something brand new despite the fact that it is mentioned in the definition of the first dynamic in dianetics the original thesisi the dynamic of self consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual to obtain pleasure as an individual and to avoid pain it covers the general field of food clothing and shelter personal ambition and general individual purpose p 31 see also advanced procedures and axioms p 42 and p 270 above thetan does various basic things following the laws governing theta as formulated in the axioms however he also splinters off and postulates some portion or specialization of them he tries to go forward with this specialization as an individual purpose and trying to effect this purpose moves on with lot of accumulated mass and things like terminals oppterms combination terminals items upsets etc thus the thetan builds up section of the gpm then he postulates something else and builds up another section of the gpm that dwindles out it gets blown up thoroughly and the thetan gets sort of out of it he forgets it utterly then he makes up new individual purpose actually all these purposes are in controversion to the basic laws of this universe theta and the purposes of thetans and if there is any reason why it builds up mass it is that it is an alteris of the axioms the thetan is an individual already in games condition with his fellows and the universe then he decides to be even more individual and makes basic postulate it is this basic postulate that we are dragging up as goal this postulate is counter to the agreements on the structure of the universe as contained in the axioms so the thetan is now individuated out to the degree that he has pitted himself against the whole lot what we are finding out as we find items turn on somatics and clear the individual is that he hasnt gotten away with it there is the gpm and it is killing him he cant even execute his individual purpose or goal because it fights his own more basic agreements postulates etc he has called himself liar by violating these agreements eg the axioms and thus he has departed into superindividuality as the individual goes forth postulating new goal he is flying in the teeth of all his former agreements so now he gets to point where he explodes out of the bank then he postulates new individuation new basic purpose he lives this one out when he finally gets out of it he adds it to the old stuff that he has accumulated each new purpose gets messed up faster and faster he finds more and more things he cant do and that he can longer confront eventually he wont even explode out of the mass anymore one day he says row come its all black and he wont get out of the gpm again this is hell an oblivion of total pain and sensation whats hell in religions theyll have some metaphorical method of trying to communicate but if they were talking about hell this is hell they recognize there is something waiting for them in the future and they try to shorten it up and say its the next life and this time youll die and youll go to it well thats just enthusiasmthe only alternative to this grisly picture is scientology but people have been saved before too many times on the track eg by the autodafe of the inquisition thats why they are decidedly reluctant to be saved by scientology someone who gets mad at scientology and refuses further processing is fool he isnt aware of his future of total pain and sensation which is hell but thetans have long history of being sold pieinthesky so they are likely to be skeptical about what scientology has to offer someone who has been sold on heaven and hasnt found it and who knows that hell is possible begins to regard the idea of freedom with some doubt he has been straightened out before and has been cheated this area of betrayal comes up in the course of clearing someone the offer of help restimulates this area and the pc will fight help all the way until he gets reality on what is happening the kindest way to handle him is to give him fast reality on the fact that you mean business do something for him subjectively so that he will realize that he is on some kind of real road to truth the pc whose trust level is shot alterises commands doesnt answer etc the auditor can feel uncomfortable about this the healing sciences havent helped with their general ineffectiveness in most things wonder the pcs trust level is so low this is the main thing that gets in the way of dissemination the individual has fought the physical universe and the laws of the physical universe after agreeing to them he now alterises them since those laws concern matter energy space and time he starts accumulating mest that is what puts mest in his bank then he makes an individual purpose that has nothing to do with these other purposes he tries to go up against these other purposes with this individual purpose that causes lot of mass to accumulate then he does this again and again etc all this is true but this activity must have been based on very low level of confidence and trust anyway to have gone to all this trouble with all the individuation etc the thetan must have had very low level of trust and confidence he must have thought that what was going on was detrimental or he wouldnt have taken all this trouble to individuate from it most pcs are mad at the physical universe to some degree now here is something ive never told you before but it follows from the sixtyfour lectures of the 1952 philadelphia lectures the physical universe will stay there for the individual until the individual gets back to the first individuating goal that he made after agreeing to the axioms at this point you would think that the pc would hit total ot but he wont he still has to handle the axioms you will now have to back up through the axioms the pc at this point in processing would start telling you about the axioms even if he had never heard of them they are getting ready to blow the individuals agreement to the axioms his contribution to the axioms to that degree is in all probability his first basic trust you may have to go back to the axioms and run them sooner or later the pc will collide with them going backward the purposes that you will run into at first are all purposes that are individuations from the basic purpose you have to go long way back to pick up more than the first dynamic even today the fellow is generally on an inversion of the first you will find that there are seven dynamics that will invert on you you must reverse the inversion process before the pc gets to straight first dynamic he then has to go quite ways before he gets sight of the other dynamics that is what you are tackling in every pc there is deteriorated trust in everything not only in his fellow man but also in organizations group activities and any effort to do something for him he starts to get nervous when you start to do anything for him because he knows that that has always been dangerous for him you are reversing his experiential track so he is going back into areas that he thinks are dangerous and thinking these areas are dangerous he is nervous this applies to every pc what is important is your skill as an auditor the smoothness of your model session the positiveness of what you are doing the fact that you can produce result in the pc inwhich he has reality these things make him realize that you are going in the direction of freedom the pc may be so downscale that when he sees that he is going towards freedom he cant have it because it looks too good and you get into another wrigglewraggle you can add to the above phenomenon the idea that if you existed and if you freed man and did things for the physical universe then this person couldnt execute the first goal you will run into in processing him this goal one is not the first goal that the pc made it is the first one you find with this addition youve got rockslammer his distrust is not built just on goal one it goes earlier and is built on the quicksand that everybody is made of to handle him you have to find the oppterm to what he is rockslamming on then it tends to blow up his whole viewpoint on the subject of scientology will shift see hcob 23nov62 urgent routine 212 opening procedure by rockslam an hparca skill this bulletin gives r212 procedure at this point r212 is also known as 3gaxx for rock slammers evidently it is form of 3gaxx that can be done by lower than class iv auditor many other bulletins and tapes on r212 follow soon as your auditing is less than perfect you rekindle or permit to remain all the morass of distrust that has been generated down the track all the betrayals of promises of heaven all his experience of hell you can flub little but if you let the case drift too far out without win and you will key in the whole background of there is heaven and you will pay the price the individuals reality on hell is much greater than his reality on heaven thus the longer you take to produce result on pc the harder it is to get the result because of the distrust factor you cant say positively that person isnt rockslammer because he may have to be processed awhile before it shows up some rockslammers are below being rockslammers at first the pc may at first simply be nattery and then you have to rely on intuition there is absolute test of absolution except persistent case progress rockslamming relates to the degree of overting in your direction and his belief that if you did not exist he could achieve his basic goal once you discover and he discovers that he is rockslammer the discovery of it tends to pull its teeth all you have to do is to list the oppose list to the thing on which he is rockslamming and it will blow up in smoke if its an auditor write an opposition list to an auditor and get the first pt package capable auditor should be able to straighten this out in two or three hours you can list goal against any terminal or oppterm that rockslams sometimes you will wind up with the persons goal if so opposition it unhandled rockslammers will frequently become combination terminals squirrels for instance combine scientology with something else because they realize that they are as crazy as loon to be attacking it6211c15 shspec213 clearing technology we are pretty well there technologically although things can still be sorted out and neatened up more data keeps appearing of course when you are on top of the mountain you can see alternate routes up just dont forget the way you got there and could get others up one reason you dont like to see long goals lists is that you dont like having to tiger drill every goal it takes an average of minute per goal even when the case is running well if the case is not wellprepared the pc will have persistent dirty needle we used to call this the pcs needle pattern it means that ruds are out and it is not ok this dirty needle that you see on goals lists wont clean up with midruds persistent dirty needle and dirty read an instant read that goes bzzzt on the needle are not the same thing if ruds are in and the pc is wellprepared dirty needle means the list is incomplete or you could have listed from the wrong question eg the wrong prehav question actually if you use the right question and the item is on the list even if it is the pcs first list when you null it the dirty needle if any disappears after pc is prepared the only reason thereafter that dirty needle occurs and midruds dont handle it is that the list is not complete the item is the missed withhold that dirties the needle therefore assuming prepared pc there are two variables that cause dirty needle on nulling 1 wrong question 2 list incomplete this makes it little more difficult you may have to use trial and error to discover what it is details on assessing goals there is new experimental process you can assess the long list of goals then only tiger drill the ones that stay in after the single assessment the pc should let the auditor know if pain turns on pain goes deeper than the meter and it may indicate the presence of the item when felt or few items earlier on the list you can get the pc to list goals from terminals and oppterms using the commands what goals would terminal have and if you were oppterm what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve just having the pc write out goals list is very therapeutic even on raw meat reading something once has minimal restimulation beyond three times you have started running process so you can go over goals list once and the only thing hot enough to give the pc somatics will be the goal so watch for the somatic while on that assessment another method of goals finding is known as the prepcheck you will get an early mest clear with enough use of the method described in hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what lot of people sit around not looking they do not look that is their motto problem that has shown up is that after two or three problems intensives the pc keeps saying that such and such is his goal and he wants to know what to do about it in other words you tiger drill the pc until his goal reads the vital part is to assess the right problem if you run the right one smoothly run it dont q and keep ruds in the pc will tend to go mest clear and the goal floats into view it could take four or five problems intensives this would be very simple way to do it it may not work on all oases maybe if we added routine 2 button or two to the problems intensives using roll your own prehav against problems intensive we might find the goal this way the only thing wrong with problems intensive is to find truly selfdetermined change on the queen elizabeth reg thorpe was auditing lrh and lrh only found two real self determined changes this lifetime so we can assume that most pcs are answering fallaciously we should realize that there is trick built into the problems intensive you get the pc to give you change that he believes to have been selfdetermined then you find the prior confusion and the determination for that change so there is probably something wrong with thequestion there shouldnt be trick to it you should just use change not selfdetermined change we formerly asked for selfdetermined changes so as not to have him give engrams however the prepcheck buttons are powerful enough to run the pc through engrams he wont get stuck in an engram anyway if he doesnt have missed withhold that is what sometimes makes pcs curl up in ball and go into an engram while you are tiger drilling the missed withhold pull the missed withhold and he will come right out of the dramatization the pcs effort to withhold is what pulls him back into the incident because he cant be in pt so you could ask for times you decided to change then the pc doesnt have to tell you lie to answer bad assessment can give you ta so in handling problems intensives keep your eye on the ta you should get ta in the first twenty minutes on the first button if not drop the first change and do new assessmenttape 6211c20 shsbc 214 the gpm is not currently available the editor6211c20 shspec215 fundamentals of auditing there are probably thousands of rules you could go by in auditing but the way to audit has only few fundamental basic rules without which auditing does not occur these are the senior data of auditing 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you violate those and you have had it matter how many other rules you are following never neglect those few little fundamentals an auditor can forget about communication and sit there as an individuated island in this case matter what is right about what he does he wont be auditing the pc dont be first dynamic using communication to audit book or nothing if the auditor and the pc are group and if they are in communication and the auditor is auditing the pc in front of him then auditing will occur and results will be obtained one day all of sudden long blue spark hits you and you say to yourself maybe if i ask the pc i can find out and communication starts to occur what st hill graduate misses when he gets back into the field is any feeling that auditing can happen people dont know that there is right way to audit also st hill graduates have gotten over being nervous or selfconscious about auditing if you overlook these few little fundamentals of auditing you then need thousands of rules to handle whatever comes up there is right way to audit described above relatively muzzled auditing uniformity of sessions these are desirable if an auditor is going to add bunch of nonsense into the lineup but muzzled auditing is just curative measure to prevent people who dont know the above basics from adding nonsense that has nothing to do with auditing the other part of the situation is that the human race knows nothing of third dynamic activities or communication what passes for communication in the wog world is unduplicatable there are completed cycles of communication and communication consists exclusively of dispersed mishmash of invalidation and evaluation the rules about q and tr4 and host of others are to keep these aberrated habits out of the session if you didnt have tr4 the green auditor would slip right into thinkthink figurefigure evaluation invalidation etc none of these have anything to do with the communication cycle compute should not be part of the doingness of the auditor cf the old definition of an auditor one who listens and computes in hcob 26may59 man who invented scientology the answer to the pcs origination that black is white is thank you it is not oh it isnt or thats neat thought or whatever every time the pc asks you to do something it is because you have done instead of acknowledged when the pc originated the pc has begun to control you you have driven him out of session and into thoughts about the pt environment by not letting communication cycle occur to the degree that you break down the communication cycle you break down the third dynamic activity you individuate the pc and after that he starts running the session he has gone on selfaudit you will have trouble with the pc in direct ratio to the number of times you have not permitted the pc to originate because the pc is aberrated it is very easy to individuate him it is quite trick to keep the pc from individuating and going on selfaudit as the pc gets better he is less susceptible to individuation his thinkingness should get more under the auditors control as he goes along if the pc gets interrupted by the auditor such that his communication cycle keeps getting messed up his thinkingness will get less and less under auditor control the number of times that you have to get the midruds in is direct index of the amount of thinkingness that pcindividuated from the session has been engaging in that is how the auditing third dynamic gets broken down into two first dynamics two first dynamics do not make third dynamic they make games condition an auditors perception is not the perception of an individual looking at another individual it is third dynamic perception there is knowingness about whether the pc is in session or not that an auditor will have when he is genuinely perceptive or intuitive an auditors perceptivity is bad to the degree that he departs from the third dynamic back to the first dynamic thetans communicate on the same wavelengths used in space opera you can spot an arc break before the pc knows he has it if you are attuned to this form of communication you used to know and recognize other thetans by their feeling or wavelength and not by their bodies dolls know each other despite not having names as rule it is done by direct perception you can forge passport but try to forge wavelength this is not mest communication and it doesnt require or use mest or even wavelengths as via esp investigators like rhine err by testing esp against mest and by entering proof into the computations proof is one of the most aberrative buttons on the track if you walk through forest with gun concealed in your pocket you will not see bird or squirrel why because you are emanating menace as long as you have the gun and the game gets the communication even if the scientist doesnt the animals dont have to see the gun some thetans evidently emanate more than other thetans this is also true of pcs you apparently get more of relay from some than from others this is fascinating subject as long as you dont pull it down into mest through the button called proof we tried to process people along this line the biggest indication we have that it exists is the effect of auditing on unaudited third parties say pc is having trouble with person b we process he doesnt have any communication with b yet the problem with b evaporates furthermore frequently b often then tries to communicate with this is so true that you could legitimately chew out as auditor for not having solved bs problem with similarly an ri will always produce trouble for you if you are deathly afraid of oil companies rest assured that you will get bum stock short changed etc process the pc and the oil company will stop giving the pc hard time there is then perception factor but when the individual is in games condition on the third or fourth dynamic say with women he cant perceive perception cant bridge across games gap so the auditor makes mess of it every time he audits women ones perception in such case inverts and one reads good wave as bad one or vice versa the auditor cant perceive what is happening so he dubs it in he writes script in session he thinks and figures etc the pc is an enemy and therefore the auditor doesnt dare to confront or read him the more the auditor is in this state the less reliable perception there is and the more substitute perception you will find taking the form of think think substitute perception look dont think direct perception only gets invalidated by those who are to some degree in games condition with what they are trying to audit or perceive they cant confront so they cant perceive so they do think instead of look they figure it all out you have to figure out the way the gpm goes it is complicated and aberration doesnt emanate so you need the meter as an aid but as far as the pc is concerned you should be able to read him pretty directly but if you cant confront him if you dont want to if you dont want anything to do with him you are going to get substitute in there and that substitute is think and youre going to go into consideration of what is going on and you get script writing at its worst the auditor sees an arc break when there isnt one he doesnt see one when it is present etctension and complicatedness in session divides the auditors attention and cuts down auditor perception thereby impairing his performance if the auditor takes some weird action you know that his perception dropped out the session will be as clumsy as with the sort of limitation of perception that occurs when one gives demonstration session and has ones attention split up lrh has experienced that he flubs in tv demonstrations more often than normally so that gives him some reality on what less perceptive auditor lives with when you dont acknowledge the pcs origination he will cut down his transmission power which will make it that much harder for you to perceive him he will also go off on self audit so you get two individuals conducting disrelated activity one fellow is busy nulling the list and the other fellow is trying to keep his rudiments in the pc tends to individuate to the degree that you q and with him and prevent him from blowing something by not just letting him get it off and acknowledging lot of auditors think that if the pc mentions something it means that you have to do something about it so that the pc can blow it the fact that you say or do something in response to pcs origination or anybodys origination tells him that he hasnt gotten it off he hasnt blown it it is all communication activity when something is fully communicated and the communication cycle is complete it is blown the degree that pc cant blow things is the degree that he has been q and ad with after you have and ad three or four times in the session what is the use of trying to patch it up now you have to have rules to cure the arc break what the hell were you doing getting an arc break in the first place the rules for getting out of swamps are lrhs and with auditors who got into them through not knowing fundamentals an arc break occurs fifteen to ninety minutes before most auditors perceive it and then they try to clean up the arc break that has just happened which is the wrong one to be cleaning up it is inexcusable for the pc to find out that he has an arc break before the auditor does where is the auditor what is wrong with the auditors perception when the pc mired as he is in the bank can perceive better than the alert auditor the pc never forgives this because it proves to him conclusively that the auditor has individuated and that he is not in third dynamic situation and doesnt have an auditor it is unforgivable because the pc doesnt forgive it if that is what your auditing is like you wont have sessions you will have dogs breakfasts but if you are alert you will find out ages before the pc does that something is wrong dont harass the pc when there is nothing wrong but if your own perception is up and the pc doesnt feel right to you just get in 2wc with him to find out how it is going and persist enough to be sure without badgering him there is nothing wrong with making mistake in session the only thing that is unforgivable is for the pc to catch it before you do perception then comes above technical perfection because you can always handle mistake if you find out about it before the pc does eg the auditor says is something going on there just light 2wc the pc says auditor well did you have thought of some kind there pc i well actually yes you used the wrong command that is ok because you spotted it first before it turned into an arc break that the pc incidently would have attributed to something later in the session if you hadnt spotted it at its inception if the pc could be relied on to spot the correct source of an arc break by himself he wouldnt need an auditor at all because he would just blow his arc breaks by inspection if he has got one he has misassigned it qed the degree of the apparent arc break is related to the number of unobserved arc breaks that have preceded it the first arc break in session is always quite previous to where the pc thinks it is this is true of lists where the pain turns on before the pc notices it the pc is always late because the bank is instantaneous and he isnt he wrongly attributes what is happening to ask him to think anything at all is miraculous if he knew what was going on he wouldnt need an auditor the communication cycle of homo sapiens consists of1 i originate 2 you invalidate 3 i notis an auditing session is based on far simpler communication cycle than homo sapiens imagines you have to audit the pc in front of you not the meter the final step of matching up the items must be done by the pc not the meter if you go on the basis of if the pc said it it isnt true you are again being homo sap there are some things on which the pc isnt right he is never right on misemotional point but on what the score is and on whether it is the right item yes he can tell you that correctly you could assess list without the meter if you did it very carefully asking the pc where the pain was there is substitute for putting the pc in session and auditing him if you get tangled up in all the rules it is just that many rules between you and the pc that are forbidding auditing if those rules are used to prevent third dynamic to interrupt or upset communication cycle or to get out of auditing the pc in front of you then those rules are not for that session there are many styles of auditing but there is substitute for auditing what is auditing to the pc it is alleviation of his upsets and reaching his basic purposes and doing down the gpm he wont let you near his bank and he wont forgive you if you dont run it out nevertheless if he is making gains and getting someplace the pc will take anything off of you on the other hand your auditing could be the last word in technical perfection but if you are not using it to get somewhere with the pc he will be arc broken all the way there is right way to audit it is directly straightforwardly the good auditor uses the tools that he has to get something done the bad auditor doesnt know that there is right way but thinks that there are thousands of right ways and that he has to dream up new one in session that is just another way to figurefigure your way out of giving session the more you add to the basics of auditing the less it will work the auditor who audits smoothly by pattern gets the most done rules are valid but should never interferes with the three basics discussed in this lecture 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of

straighten up the head of the medical association with it its that powerful it undercuts all the reasons why it must be done on all students and also every hgc pc unfortunately the solution is similar to routine 3 process but theres nothing for it but hpashcas must learn the steps in this hco bulletin if we are to survive for these skills encompass more than 50 of the cases in some areas up to 80

interest whether person is any variety of rock slammer or not before it and other security measures were only of administrative interest now it is question of whether or not the case will ever improve thus we have to have broadened definition for rock slammer b an easy method of detecting one and c quick procedures to remedy the condition we have all these now definitiona rock slammer is preclear who rock slams on present time gpm item in his or her immediate environment until this item is located and opposed the rock slammer will make slow gains or gains in clearing the routine 212 method of discharging the influence of rock slamming item is actually taken from 3ga criss cross 3gaxx and is specialized routine from routine 3 we will however since it does not touch goals designate it as routine 2 this routine will have to be learned by all hpashcas and used by all staff auditors it does not include clearing it includes only item assessment by labelling it routine 2 it comes within the reach of all trained auditors routine twotwelve 1 make or use list of scientology items this includes scientology scientology organizations an auditor clearing auditing scientologists session an emeter practitioner the auditors name ron other scientology persons parts of scientology past auditors etc see hco bulletin november 24 and subsequent hco bulletins for scientology lists the list need not be endless as it will be easy to catch trace of the gpm if the person is rock slammer the list is composed by the auditor not the pc 2 assess the list calling each item once or until auditor is sure of the read eliminate down to the last 3 or 4 items 3 tiger drill the items still in select the one with the biggest dirty read or the last one to go out or the one that went out hardest matter how faintly or sporadically the item found now reads if the last one in stayed in at all use it for step 4 below if however the item found in this step produced good rock slam reliable item omit steps 4 5 and 6 below and do the tests in step 7 and continue with the remaining steps if two ris are found in this first step oppose each one as in steps 7 onward 4 using the item selected list list from the line question who or what does the item found in 3 represent to you it can happen that steps 4 5 and 6 are unnecessary if the item in step 3 consistently rock slammed third of dial to dial wide and kept on doing it when the auditor said consider committing overts against _____the item found use it instead of doing the step 4 list if this rock slam is on and then vanishes even with suppress clean do step 4 using the item that so slammed but vanished indoing listing beware of stopping listing while the needle is still dirty or stopping just because the pc says the last item was it the real rs item you want usually comes after the pc says the last one he put on was it if the pc stops or refuses to go on get in your mid ruds and continue to list until there is dirty needle or rs when pc thinks of items before saying them to the auditor mark every item that rsed or dred on listing while listing keep the meter at about sens 8 and keep an eye on it to note rss and drs 5 nul the list saying each item on it once or more if the auditor didnt catch the read be sure the mid ruds are in if dirty needle turns on while nulling add to the list get the mid ruds in and test the question for reaction if needle reacts to question the list is incomplete or the pc is protesting the question leave any item in that reacts eliminate all but the last 3 or 4 items 6 tiger drill the last items in select one item with the biggest needle reaction or rock slam two items can appear on any list if they both rock slam equally and neither goes out you have found two items in which case you must do the following steps to each 7 find out if item turned on pain or sensation when being tiger drilled or say it to the pc and find out if pain say to pc consider_____item committing overts if sensation say consider committing overts against _____ this should turn on rock slam if it isnt on already whenever the item was said or tiger drilled this is called reliable item if it rock slammed the rock slam is very touchy sometimes and has to be tiger drilled back on if an item slammed while being nulled it is probably it those that rs while being listed do not have to rs flicker at all while being nulled and usually dont 8 if the reliable item found turned on pain list who or what would_____the reliable item oppose if it turned on sensation list who or what would oppose_____the reliable item complete the list as in any listing dont stop just because the pc nattered or wept get the mid ruds in and get list which gives dirty needle not dirty reads theres difference while nulling in case of coterm test to see if theres more pn than sen or sen than pn and classify accordingly if you cant decide list both as opposed and oppose and nul as one list 9 nul the list saying each item once down to 3 or 4 items 10 tiger drill the last 3 or 4 that were left in select the last one left in 11 test and turn on the rock slam on the last one in as in step 7 above be sure to properly determine which is term and which is oppterm get pc to examine and align the package for correctness and any bonus package and put on the pcs line plot 12 go over the list used in step 1 to see if there are any more dirty reads or traces of reads on the scientology list if so repeat the above eleven steps on the pc if not make list for the step 1a etc using questions given further on in this hco bulletin note only the scientology list is tested again other lists for step i are used only once this is the only action known in auditing which will undercut the bank of slow moving or nongain pc every such pc is rock slammer why is this well these two items terminal and oppterm of the gpm make present time problem the pc is obsessively trying to solve this problem not trying to get well or go clear the pc wont come off trying to solve this subsurface problem he or she doesnt even know about it so theres the auditor trying to make somebody well but the pc is trying todie to prove scientology doesnt work or to get sick to make my boss realize what hes done to etc etc its pathetic in the largest percentage of cases the auditor is opening the door to the next two hundred trillion years and the pc is reactively trying to get even with grasshoppers this disagreement between auditor and pc brings about the upsets and gains other technique known will get at this key problem or problems this technique doesnt try to diagnose the problem indeed the problem wont be known to the pc or the auditor until the action is complete and then the auditor doesnt even have to ask for it or about it what do you do with these two items well this will prove to be the third biggest source of falls from grace in using routine 212 you dont do anything with the items except establish which is the terminal and which is the oppterm and put them on the pcs line plot the thing that could be done with them would be to get represent lists from them to find more items you can ask for missed whs saying when did oppterm found nearly find out about you but its best to leave the rs on for goal finder as the goal finder will want to use them in 3gaxx step 4aroutine 321 so dont spoil the rs the pc will cognite all over the place and thats the benefit and the pc wont be trying to chop up auditors and orgs and should respond very well to cchs and prepchecking after the two items are found the biggest error that will be made is trying to do r212 with the rudiments out and conversely putting the mid ruds in every time pc originates sure way to ruin pc the second biggest source of error is making incomplete lists these go out hard and give dirty needle and result in item the unschooled auditor will usually chicken out whenever the pc says thats all or ive just put it on the list that last item is it at which the auditor stops listing and the item that will rock slam is never put on the list and so is never found and the auditor is left fighting dirty needle and trying to read through it the rule is while nulling if simple question what did you want to say fails to smooth out suddenly dirty needle the list is incomplete complete it and then put in mid ruds the average list runs 80 or more items get the precise difference between dirty needle and dirty read in hco bulletin november 8 ad 12 questions for the second pair if you have found pair of reliable items and cant find anything now on the basic list of step one and you want to continue routine 212 the following questions will produce lists on which reliable items can be found you ask the pc the question and write down whatever he says you never correct the pc or refuse an item you only use one of these questions at time for full coverage with all 12 steps lists list r2121 the basic scientology list as given in step 1 it is essential not to omit it as the first action in routine 212 it may be done again and should be after other lists are used to get reliable items after other items have been found list 1 may come alive again as pcs case unburdens list r2121a special list for pcs environment general question in present time who or what have you been upset about this whatever the question must get things likewife husband marriage job home myself my case police this country machines etc etc it is an effort to locate pt items that keep the gpm keyed in use only after list 1 pc gives the items for this list list r2121b general question who or what would you prefer not to associate with listed from pc this list heading was developed for pcs who wont say they have enemies it can be used on any pc use only what pc lists be sure list is complete list r2121c general question who or what have you detested use only what the pc gives be sure list is complete list r2121d general question who or what isnt part of existence use only what pc gives be sure list is complete list r2121e general question what problem have you had use only what pc gives be sure list is complete list r2121f general question who or what have you had to be careful of use only what pc gives be sure list is complete list r2121g general question who or what have you invalidated use only what pc gives be sure list is complete list r2121h general question who or what has nearly found out about you use only what pc gives be very very very sure that list is complete or youll have missed withhold on the pc the above lists are numbered and lettered for proper sequence in use on the preclear in other words you could do routine 212 many times plus doing step 1 on the scientology list more than once on preclear but always do the first step with scientology items as many times as you can get one of its items to react and youll never miss it is this first list of scientology items which holds up cases so it must be used for all 12 steps again and again further questions can be had from prehav assessments the rule is if you get reliable item always get its opposing item then you will never get bypassed item the thing that hangs up cases in getting any reliable items and their opposition you are of course cleaning up the gpm and therefore clearing the pc so this is road to clear items have many other uses so never fake one and never fail to record one on the line plot occasionally you get bonus package off one list in addition to the item you are looking for sometimes two rsing items will show up on the same list opposing each other and blow they oppose each other not what youre listing point this out to the pc when found and put these also on the line plot marked bp bonus package one as terminal and one as an opposition terminal and go on and find your regular item routine 212 coupled with problems intensives and cchs gives the hcahpa full kit that can handle the worst cases knock out the nogain cases and can clear so i havent forgotten the hcahpa dont try to cover up the fact that somebody has rock slam or dirty read on scientology etc youll have set him or her up to never have gains skills required to accomplish 3gaxx for rock slammers an auditor needs to be drilled and thoroughly examined on the following 1 the emeter and what is dirty read dirty needle and rock slam practical 2 hco bulletin november 8 ad12 somatics theory 3 any future hco bulletins on assessment for rock slamming items theory and practical 4 tiger drilling theory and practical 5 this bulletin theory and practical if the auditor cant do 3gaxx for rock slammers it will be because he did not know or was badly examined on the five things above theres neither difficulty nor mystery about the above 12 steps so study up and dont miss this but routine 3 process is declared an hpahca skill if an auditor cant do it hell have slow go or nowin on about eighty per cent of all cases with the above properly studied and well drilled there will be great success on anybody who can be persuaded to begin session and also this must be done on every case that hasnt gone clear already even after their goal has been found its certainty that such case is bypassing at least one side of present time problem that is part of and suppressing the whole gpm this is the pcs biggest missed withhold of all note there are variations on the order of steps or actions above one doesnt sometimes do this sometimes that this is very rote procedure note on some very very rough cases this system may not work fully until some regular 3gaxx is run by class iv auditor in any event case on 3gaxx should be tested again as above after every 6 or 8 ris are found note and just to clear up any possible misunderstanding you do r212 on all pcs first and you never vary its steps or sequence note preclear will achieve lasting case gain with overts on scientology and allied items free needle will stay free in the presence of these overts routine 212 removes the unwanted valences that commit such overts rather than endlessly sec checking the pc the most insidious bypassed items are those that remain in present time prompting the pc to commitsenseless overts to the dismay of his good sense and the peril of his case condition he will make fast gain until the scientology list is worked over and over for any reaction fast step resume 1 use or compile list 1 1 1 b etc 2 assess list 3 tiger drill the last 3 or 4 items left in take the one with largest or any remaining action if item found is an ri omit steps 4 and 5 4 using item in 3

package and any bonus package with pc make sure which is term and oppterm and if they oppose each other and put on line plot 12 do all above steps again on scientology list until it has ghost of reaction then do 1a 1b etc each on all steps note this is primary training skill do not give students more than instruction on the check sheet of class iib before turning them loose on routine iib as heavy time auditing activity they will learn little or nothing before being clean on r212 put comm course and other instruction after r212 and the student will have chance to learn it give the student further heavy instruction on r212 toward course end classify only on the end of course repass of the iib check sheet the point is dont waste instruction on basic scientology until the student is cleaned up on routine 212 particularly the scientology list i dont care how this is accomplished in the academy or in the hgc just get it done l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all

actions of routine 321 are then followed of which the goals prepcheck is part so long as the auditing is done under the supervision of class iv auditor it is very bad action to just take the pcs goal

training x unit the biggest hole in student auditing is the inability to clean up needle students who try to do assessments fail to get results when they attempt to null with needle that is already filthy it is rather easy to clean needle and the results on the pc are highly beneficial the basis of an inability to read meter is state of case this is remedied by r2 12s list one cleaning when list one is burnished bright the student will be able to read meter in v unit the auditing is heavily supervised and the students reality is raised by accurate r212 or r210 in x unit therefore the first indicated step is to teach the student to use the mid ruds this is done by havingness by mid ruds the pattern of the session is goal finders model session the purpose of the x unit sessions is to clean needle and to demonstrate that needle can be cleaned the auditor notes the pcs can squeeze before session start the session is started with the usual goal finders pattern the rudiments are put in by big mid ruds since the last time i audited you or since the last time you were audited if this is the auditors first session or since you decided to be audited for raw meat the general missed whs of the pc are pulled in the body of the early sessions when this has been done remaining sessions are devoted to havingness the pcs havingness process is tested for and found or is run the body of the session is closed the big ruds for the session are then put in the pc is then asked with meter at sens 16 in this session was the room all right and this is cleaned the can squeeze test is then made with sens 1 goals and gains are taken up and the session is ended by end of session the needle should be without pattern and the pc should be cheerful lrhjwcden l ron hubbard copyright 1962 by l

hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 january ad13 central orgs academy curriculum how to teach auditing and routine 2 introduction with the placing of clearing technology into hcahpa hands we must revise our concept of training routine 212 is complicated and exact but as it is the only thing known which cracks all cases we have choice in the matter we can and must learn it well it must not be indifferently learned but as it is not going to change as is well proven time and effort can be spent upon it and must be we must rise to the occasion we must use all we know to learn and teach all we have to teach to get routine 2 done check sheets there are two distinctly different series of check sheets for doing routine 2 processes and auditing these are those that apply to routine 2 the gpm and data listing nulling and case errors and repair b those that apply to auditing its basics skills the meter although these associate and interlock they are two separate subjects of study for years we have faced the arbitrary that those whose cases got in the road of their auditing yet had to assimilate auditing theory and practice routine 2 well done removes with some rapidity these case barriers to auditing therefore there are several phases desirable in studying auditing and routine 2 v unit class 0 first phase for new student doing routine 210 precedes study of auditing and routine 2 this is done under close supervision on coaudit basis with the coaudit supervisor taking hand on cases checking out items correcting cases etc this is done until the student has found in another and has had found in himself 2 or 3 packages accuracy is the essence of this first step otherwise the wasted time and wrong items will give the whole action the tone of despair only good results are stressed not the form of how they are achieved in this first phase we want the student to see that routine 2 produces changes for the better in himself and the pc and is worth learning this is what were trying to showwe remove if the routine 2 is good the barriers to learning auditing and scientology all we want then from the first phase is reality on the benefits of the process and auditing and b removal of the barriers to being good auditor w unit class ia second phase this phase actually starts the training of scientologist he or she however should have started its check sheets in the v unit we teach the basics of scientology its history the auditors code axioms the arc triangle and tone scale out of the old notes on lectures booklet in practical and auditing we teach and do objective processes op pro by dup and the cchs we wish to accomplish this in this phase reality that scientology is real subject and very precise not mixture of indian philosophy and cute tricks and give the student solid grounding on pure scientology basics disrelated from auditing and b get the student capable of repetition of commands and unafraid in actual physical handling of other bodies x unit class ib third phase we now enter the student upon phase of formal auditing consisting of theory and practical using all the basics of auditing the trs the meter fine points this phase should specialize in basic auditing skills very precisely applicable to handling an auditing session meter meter drills anti q and trs 04 model session mid ruds missed withholds etc and we get the student to run formal processes on the meter until he or she understands meter these processes consist only of arc straight wire comm processes nothing that will disturb 212 or run out rockslams the idea of this auditing is to get the student used to handling session with competence from this phase we expect the basics of auditing in theory and practical and b confidence in confronting bank and handling pc on meter with good form unit class iia fourth phase in the fourth phase our interest is in prepchecking as an action and prelude to lists in the form of problems intensivein theory and practical we teach how to do problems intensive advanced metering how to detect case changes better sessioning more trs 04 more basics of scientology such as axioms and logics in auditing the student does problems intensive and receives one the stress is on good sessioning and results from this phase we expect good command of problems intensive theory and practical how to detect case changes and b the ability to actually audit to good result and keep mid ruds in and clean needle z unit class iib fifth phase this is theory and practical phase for routine 212 the student also audits routine 212 under supervision the whole check sheet for routine 212 is thrown at the student the long hco bulletins are segmented into page or two and thereby made into several passes the student studies and is examined on them in segments in auditing the student is permitted to do full 212 and the stress is on results with accurate routine 212 pg unitclass ii sixth phase this is postgraduate phase on routine 212 it was formerly known as interne the theory and practical are all on the stress of case repair and how to supervise routine 2 the student is used to help supervise v unit students as his auditing activity with stress on case errors the remainder of the students time is taken up with preparation for examination for his hcahpa the student may be used for charity cases and what was formerly interne work summary this is about three months course if steamed through if it takes longer then the v unit was flubbed if student hangs up longer than reasonable time in any upper phase he is returned to the v unit and is required to do and receive routine 2 while continuing to try to pass upper level check sheets so as not to hold him up students are of course expected to study evenings and weekendsthe three section course plan is adhered to of theory practical and auditing auditing in the auditing section is done for results not to teach auditing practical is where they practise students are progressively assigned to their units and are reclassed as they pass out of unit the model of this course is saint hill but it may not be so advertised the chief difference of course is the necessary reintroduction of student body tape programme such as in the old days the last hour of the day is used for this sequence of about 75 tapes mainly of general historical or auditing interest are played to the whole student body assembled in the main assembly hall one tape each day regardless of the students classification they are given quizzes on these tapes very brief other tape use is made in an academy there are headphone recorders if tape play speakers are not good the students wont learn anything from the tapes when tapes are omitted as whole class activity the whole direction meaning and ethic of scientology goes sour in an area and the students havent clue what scientology is for and you find them idling about driving off pcs with nutty chatter this academy curriculum requires d of t and two instructors to this can be added training admin who is also extension course the d of t becomes auditing supervisor the other two instructors are the theory supervisor and practical supervisor the classes are awarded on the completion of the phase and designate the check sheets students get canceled out of units but not off check sheets the only things that can keep students from passing through this course rapidly are failure to schedule precisely b failure to demand and obtain auditing results in all units c local noncomprehension of r212 d capricious and unreal theory and practical examinations and failure to enforce the course regulations full academy will attend to all these things an empty one will have ignored them it is real to do lousy job of auditing it is terrible crime to do bad job of training and dissemination because then theres nothing left to pick the cases up in this life or the next every bad auditor we turn out costs us hundred preclears every good one puts us closer to our objectives an academy class ii should be good enough to go to work at once as an hgc auditor without causing the hgc moments worry it can be done because it must be lrhjwrd l ron hubbard copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 3 january ad13 central orgs franchise routine 2 important opposition lists right and wrong oppose most pt terminals and oppterms look more like coterms than clean terminals or opposition terminals when first contacted they become more definite terms or oppterms after they have been listed page while you should be able to make the right choice in most cases by the usual test given in the 212 steps you can err your lists will become endless and unnullable and your pc will go downhill if you oppose an ri wrong way to therefore while listing carefully observe the needle and the pc the ta is meaningless in this test the indications for testing right way oppose and wrong way oppose are the subject of this bulletin in opposing reliable item you can consider it terminal because pc said it gave pain and list who or what would catfish oppose whereas in actual fact it was an oppterm and should have been listed who or what would oppose catfish or vice versa sad consequences follow wrong choice potential miscalling an ri even the best auditor can make mistake in calling an ri hes gotten terminal or an oppterm the pc is foggy as to whats pain or sensation the ri may have both sometimes terminals are so covered with sen there is pain at first sometimes the hidden terminal is so hard down on the oppterm ri it seems like terminal further you can be doing an opposition to an ri list expecting terminal to come up and get in fact another oppterm this is fine accept it if the list only rsed once on nulling but the opposing terminal is still hidden and must be gotten pcs you see often put terms and oppterms on the same list stable datum always regard the identity of an ri as term or oppterm as potentially wrong until listed and tested as per this hco bulletin do the best you can with usual tests to tell what it is before you start listing and choose your oppose question accordingly but be ready to find that what was terminal is really an oppterm or vice versa and should have been opposed the other way around you have only two list questions to use in opposing reliable item these are who or what would oppose a____ and who or what would ____oppose for every reliableitem there is only one of the above that is right the other is wrong there are true cotermsthey only seem to be both terminal pain and an oppterm sensation when it comes to listing you will benefit the pc only by listing the right way the other oppose question then is the wrong way if you list the wrong way using the wrong question youll get an endless list that never completes and wont nul you therefore have choice of two questions and one of them is right and the other wrong always if you choose the right one and list it the pc benefits if you choose the wrong one and list it the pc will get worse rapidly right in the session before your eyes it often happens that you start listing the wrong way this is because you failed to find out correctly if the ri you were about to list an opposition list to was terminal pain or an opposition terminal sensation the pc said he had sen but actually felt pain or the pc did have sen and the pain appeared afterward in short because pt terminals look like coterms very often neither the pc nor the auditor can tell on some ris this happens to some ris on every case the solution to the dilemma is to test by listing page or two there are certain definite signs of wrong way opposition they can be seen with half an eye there is need to go on until your pc is caved in and you have 99 pages of items to find out you cant nul and should have opposed the other way around list right way to or wrong way to will rockslam so thats test in itself the tests five in number are little more delicate aside from original tests for term or oppterm how to tell if an oppose list is right way to right way indications 1 in listing needle is loose and gets looser 2 pcs skin tone gets progressively better as he or she lists 3 masses move out off pc 4 pc gives items easily 5 list completes easily wrong way oppose indications if list is wrong way oppose which is to say the wording is reversed such as who or what would oppose catfish as different from who or what would catfish oppose these things will always happen 1 in listing the needle gets tighter stiff and tends to jerk it goes in cycles dr rs dr clean dr rs dr clean etc 2 the pcs skin tone gets progressively worse darker and off colour and the pc looks older3 masses move into the pc and make him feel more or less squashed 4 pc gives items with some small difficulty and tends to invalidate them and ri being listed from 5 list doesnt ever complete you may be able to nul while but the needle will dirty up and amount of mid ruds will clean it whether your list is right way oppose or wrong way oppose the pc may get pain and sensation even nausea indeed be worried only if the pc doesnt these dont count pain and sensation are used for the first test you make in selection but arent used beyond that test given in the steps of 212 its the darkening colour of the pc and his or her apparent age that count your tests above are visual not getting data from the pc pcs will list wrong way to and plow themselves right on in with complaint if you start listing wrong way to and then turn it around the pc will have trouble giving right way to items for bit and then they come at rapid easy flow and you get all the above 5 things for the right way list unless you change around to the right way and continue to list the wrong way you will continue to get the 5 indications given for wrong lists sometimes an ri is so fouled up you have to test by listing one way then the other and then back to the first way again little experience is solid gold for you begin to see the 5 indications for right lists and the 5 indications for wrong lists and recognize them more quickly when you have opposed wrongly and then in opposing right way to you get complete list you never bother to nul the wrong way list you just abandon it the ri wont be on it you only nul the right way oppose list rule never nul lists taken from wrong sources just abandon list ever went to 50 pages that was right way to right way oppose lists that can be completed are probably all below 500 items the usual being around 250 items wrong way oppose is the chief source of difficulty for any opposition list rivalled only by incomplete lists as trouble maker in routine 2 wrong way oppose list is of course wrong source as one is using catfish as terminal instead of catfish as an oppterm or vice versa endless lists also come from just continuing to list on and on and on the pcs needle being dirty by protest this is just silly some supervisor may develop as stable datum if the needle is dirty just continue listing and this is wrong needle does get clean when right way oppose list is completed but wrong way oppose or mid ruds out can also make needle dirty on an oppose list if needle is dirty three main things can be wrong 1 list is right way oppose but incomplete remedy complete it to one rs only seen on nulling 2 list is wrong way oppose remedy oppose it the other way and watch the signs above until youre sure then go on and complete 3 mid ruds are outpc protesting the session or overlistingwrong source opposing wrong item can mess up pc also but whyd you take an item from an incomplete or wrong way list in the first place and then oppose it the remedy of this one lies before the fact of wrong way oppose so is not the subject of this hco bulletin l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6301c08 shspec226 r210 and r212 part of the data in this lecture is also found in hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 2 12 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance in august i wrote jerk named kennedy this latest adornment of the russian victory parade was offered help in the space race straightening up iq etc this lighthouse has twice asked for presentations of scientology weve granted them and they have done weird things like fire the guy who asked for them time rolled along the fda started sniffing around the government organized smear campaign in the press and they raided church seized philosophic texts and emeters how did they do this they lied to the court they didnt tell the court who the warrant was for and they didnt mention books the warrant was signed by the president so ads are being placed in newspapers in the bible belt and there will be delay in the court hearing i frankly was getting worried wed been ignored too long we neednt waste time fighting the government it is its own oppterm what should happen when you find an item if you give the pc the wrong item he will have markedly more mass than he had minute before if the list is incomplete the pc will also arc break in the next few minutes and you will be unable to get him out of it except by completing the list with right item mass diminishes pc knows whether or not it is his item you are only auditing up to the pcs knowingness so if he doesnt know whether it is his item you know it isnt he has to be certain that it is right also when you package the item the pc must know that it is package if there is any queasiness about it it is out the pcs knowingness is paramount in getting the right item well done listing should produce an item that brings in vvvgis not just agreement routine 2 has little miracle to offer done this way the masses go pffft against each other the rock slams cancel out wrongly done r2 delivers more mass done right the pc has less mass it is question of havingness the wrong item has mass because 1 though it does have its own mass it is not the fundamental mass 2 you have told lie about it by saying that it is the fundamental mass more data on running routine 2 some day on routine 2 you will have the bad luck to have very suppressed pc he will suppress the item as he puts it on the list you will miss the rock slam and you will know you goofed and have to do something extraordinary the pc may arc break very thoroughly and auditing with ruds missed withholds etc wont handle it only routine 2 will fix it get him to extend the list get the item and the arc break will be gone the more unnecessary arbitraries you introduce into how something is done the more trouble you will have with it r212 began to handle rockslamming r212 can be done at several levels there are lot of results to be had even doing it wrong auditors have had more trouble with it than lrh expected there are three sources for the first list in r212 1 the pcs immediate session environment 2 the environment the pc lives in more generally 3 the various parts of existence if you already have the pcs goal you can ask who or what in pt would your goal influence to get rockslamming item you could get life and livingness sources by asking what is part of your life and livingness in pt and what isnot part of it each could be complete list if one doesnt rockslam the other will often both will we have to find something that isnt rockslamming to get list when you are after part or consist of list because you only oppose rockslamming items if the pc rockslams on your life dont list in pt ww does your life consist of test the source of list to make sure that it doesnt rockslam you can even tiger drill sources to be sure if source does rockslam skip it for represent list also dont oppose some outoftheblue rockslamming item rockslamming source for list is always out of context of another incomplete list that you dont necessarily know the heading of rockslamming item is therefore not necessarily an ri it is not totally destructive to oppose such an item just dicey sometimes the lists you get when you do this wont complete or you will get lots of coterms if you found scientology rockslamming you could just oppose it as security measure but there is liability to doing this so avoid the sourceless rock slam as something to list from if scientology rockslams find something else to list from that gets at the same thing you cant do represent you have to find some way of saying scientology so you are not representing scientology eg rons work or mental activities or some such say four dynamics rockslammed therefore the source is an incomplete list you have to complete it but how you find something about scientology or the dynamics that is broad and embracive like mental activity or what isisnt part of existence then you get an item and oppose it your success is monitored by this do routine 2 right and repair it with routine 2 little routine 2 and lot of general auditing wont give much result r2 is more powerful because it is hitting at the pcs ptp and hidden standard he doesnt know what they are until you direct his attention to them you could ask what would some healing process have to do to you in order for you to know you were better the pc will consult with circuit and give you his hidden standard if you tried to list this pcs goals all you would get would be the goals of those circuits this is another reason why you cannot get the pc clear with these circuits and hidden standards in the way after routine 2 you will begin to get the pcs goals instead of circuits goals get few packages off and out of the way and the pc will give you his goal then you can run him on goals process and clear him but you have to clear up the pt environment first6301c08 shspec227 case repair if you did the pure form of listing and opposing described in the last lecture you get less mass as result if you start seeing more rock slams than before and there is more mass on the pc you have been goofing the best visual indicator is the pcs skin tone if mass is increasing the pcs skin goes green or yellow or grey or black the eyes are also an indicator although they are somewhat less reliable because going through period of sen will make the eyes look seny but do note the pcs skin tone at the start of the session so that you can compare this with its later appearance age is another symptom the pc should look younger half way through the session even hair color will change it will get grayer or less gray weight will also change over the course of two to three sessions in the direction of optimum weight the meter should also behave better it should be more responsive there should be cleaner needle routine 2 doesnt do much for the ta position the needle is more indicative the pcs ta can sit at five with the pc getting better and better if the ta remains motionless throughout listing thats fine after awhile there should be some change it is not in the course of one session but after several eventually there should be improvement in high or low ta or the mass hasnt been cleaned up persistent low ta is worrisome seeing change in ta look for 1 wrong source or 2 list that should be completed you should be especially concerned if the pc was at 15 and didnt change after couple of packages had been found listing wrong way to makes the needle stiff and jerky on right list the needle should free up get clean and stay clean list can go clean needle before the item is on it so avoid short lists superlong list say twentyfive pages is from wrong source or wrong way to five to six pages should do the wronger you are the longer it takes the right way goes fast when nulling list dont tell the pc that an item rockslammed until you have finished nulling then watch his indicators to be sure that it is his item dont shift his attention after telling him the item if he arc breaks when you have given him the item it is wrong and you had better get him to go on he wont mind if it was the wrong item if he knows it is his item and you try to make him go on he will arc break when do you repair case when it wont run right the commonest error in routine 2 is wrong source and the commonest source of that is an item taken from an incomplete list any item is viewed as coming from list even if it was never before listed the three areas that you have available to get items from are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence so if the pc has several rock slams on list one you know at once that list one is an incomplete list this gives you the problem of regress you are always starting from list that hasnt been written the auditors responsibility is to make sure that the list source question doesnt rockslam since if it does it is obviously part of list so he cant use it for represent or consist of list all lists start with represent list just because something slams you dont necessarily oppose it you might try to find out what the item is from by asking what list question would _______ be an answer to if you have been listing from something which when you check it now slams it is wrong source it is not that it is getting unsuppressed so what you want to do is to find nonrockslamming list question that produces rock slams there must be rock slam anywhere in the list questionif you list from nonrockslamming source and dont get rock slams you can always use the negative version what doesnt _______ consist of if you dont get anything on parts of existence try what isnt part of existence you can also do this with list one if pc has his interest stuck on an item find what list that item was on and complete the list once you have got rockslamming item from complete list you can go ahead and oppose it what about case that has been run long time on wrong sources wrong way to and has lots of wrong items this is pretty sad but the case will still have been improved just repair it by finding the first incomplete list on the case even suppositional one or list one or whatever get list question of some sort that doesnt rockslam add to the list and try to tiger drill alive what originally rockslammed if you get rock slam while extending watch to see whether you keep getting them if you do it shows wrong source or wrong way to try it the other way around if it still wont clean up it is wrong source complete all such incomplete lists where you get ris oppose them and the bricabrac will blow off when repairing lists just examine the genus of the list and see if it needs completing get it completed to its proper item oppose it and package it up before this is done the pc will be interested in the item afterwards he will have interest in the item it erases he will cognite on it the pc may have trouble remembering right items wrong ones will be memorable because the pcs attention is still stuck there the purpose of routine 2 is to clear away chronic ptps and hidden standards so you can find and run the pcs goal having found his goal you may still need to use routine 2 to wipe out restimulated terminals when the pc caves in while running the goal you can use what does pt consist ofnot consist of or what does auditing consist ofnot consist of everything said here about lists also applies to goals clearing lists routine 321 for more data about r3 21 see pp 332 and 356 above more data is also available in confidential hcobs 7nov62ii routine 321 the twentyone steps finding goals and 17nov62 routine 321 one of the hardest things you will use to get rockslamming item from is goals list goals lists almost never run out of slams when they do though they behave like any other list remember that rocket read is senior to rock slam and that in other respects you trust it the same if you find rocket reading items on therefore incomplete list complete it to one rocketreading item the frequency of rock slam test is senior to the stickier needle test on wrongwayto having found an ri pcs needle may be fine but the wrongwaytoness of it will beef it up do it the other way if it still doesnt clean up and give one rock slam on nulling the source item must have been from an incomplete list so complete it be prepared to be wrong and straighten it out straighten up routine 2 thoroughly fix up auditing briefly you could also find one rockslamming item that never got opposed so oppose it you could take list one and ask what question would complete list one and complete it this would handle most problems6301c10 shspec229 how to audit for years we have had the problem of finding some pc who even when run on proper processes tears up the neighborhood this is the problem of the missed withhold that is all it is the biggest missed withhold you can have is the missing answer to the auditing question he didnt give you the answer he didnt put the item on the list this is such big missed withhold that if you always got it right you could virtually omit pulling missed withholds but you cant totally omit pulling missed withholds heres why among the manifestations of missed withholds are dopeoff and boiloff dopeoff and boiloff are only caused by missed withholds not by anaten contained in gpms anaten is contained in list but only acts on the pc when there is an actual nearlyfoundout in pt you have to keep the little missed withholds cleaned up because they are the ones that make the pc groggy and dopey not the missing items it is pt nearlyfoundout that makes the pc go under on an item or list it doesnt happen just from the list r212 pulls withholds by the carload on track if you miss package it is giant missed withhold and screaming arc break but if you see pc go even slightly groggy dopey slumping down and shutting his eyes etc on nulling pull up right there and get the nearlyfoundouts you are after regular pttype missed withholds because missing item on list doesnt give the same dopeoff symptom having missed an item will give this other phenomenon body see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for the fifteen signs of missed withholds the expected behavior of the pc during l and n and receiving or thinking of items is wide awake though the pc could have his eyes closed this is terribly important during nulling when you are depending on the item rockslamming it wont happen if the pc is anaten meters dont rockslam when the pc is anaten meter will tick but you cant depend on it rockslamming when there is insufficient attention present to charge up an item the same is true for rocket reads in goal checkouts boiloff anaten etc were discovered in 1952 to be flow running too long in one direction missed withhold is restrained flow any effort to outflow by pc who has missed withhold is blocked and only causes further inflow the pc has stuck flow if the pc has missed withhold hes inflowed as far as he can go and hes very very prone to boiloff he is holding back flow so he gets stuck flow very quickly sometimes missed withhold from out of session is keyed in by withhold in session then the pc boils off in this case you have to run the outofsession missed withhold that is why missed withhold stays in as random rudiment it gets you out of more trouble than it gets you into if you broaden the missed withhold question to include the track then you will get the restimulated ones too for instance you might ask in the past week has withhold been missed do this when you cant wake the pc not all missed withholds are on the second dynamic if you start steering missed withholds by dynamics you will start more incomplete lists keep the question general the nearlyfoundout is lefthand button suppressortype button which doesnt necessarily read on the meter if you pull session missed withhold but the pc goes dopey fifteen minutes later prepcheck the nearlyfoundout button with or without time limiter left hand buttons are those that prevent things from reading eg suppress fail to reveal anxious about careful of nearly found out right hand buttons make things read eg mistake been made suggested decided protested invalidated protested follows on the heels of nearlyfoundout thus it is point where left and right hand buttons meet in coaudit watch for dopeoff and put in the random rud yourself dont try to get students to do it take for granted that it is something out of session that keyed in you can use is there anything we nearly found out about you the we limits the question or get thestudent to run the random rudiment muzzled and repetitive until the pc looks desperate and about to arc break then go back to listing which model session should one use as much as necessary more model session has these elements 1 adjust the pcs chair 2 get can squeeze 3 give the rfactor for the session 4 give tone 40 start of session 5 find out if the session has started for the pc 6 have the pc set goals for life and livingness and the session what you do next depends on whether you are going to list or null today dont worry about ruds in listing session who cares what the needle is doing dirty needle can best be cleaned up by listing the dirty needle is probably being caused by thoughts about doing the list if the list is complete the pcs list will be clean in this case it is noauditing to do anything other than to null the list take chance on betweensessions outruds only get worried if the pc starts to boiloff get off missed withholds if possible if it is not possible the list is incomplete so extend it in listing session get goals set and go right into listing that is more effective in cleaning up the needle and having the pc in session then anything else if the pc wont sit there and list that is different if the pc stops listing it is either suppress or inval forget the rest of the ruds take any items the pc gives you on these buttons put them on the list and go right back into listing that was the purpose of the rud after all at the end of the session discuss where you and the pc have gotten to and where in general you are going close off the body of the session then check endruds at sensitivity 64 get the pc out of the auditing environment with in this session was the run all right get your question answered but dont grind the pc to death check protest if this looks necessary refer to scientology 88008 it talks about thetan in the physical universe all the thetan is doing is stacking himself up against the physical universe and batting around like bluebottle fly in cage if you want to free the pc from the session ask if the room was ok then you have got the thetan and the physical universe straightened up if the pc starts inventing answers or seems nerved up it is probably missed withhold you wont do anything about it then get can squeeze asking about whether the run was all right usually gets his havingness back up but if he is down on havingness dont work over ruds run some havingness for few commands to restore the can squeeze not to run the bank the best havingness processes are 1 feel that _______ 2 touch that _______ 3 notice that _______ only use few commands not more than twelve this is also good way to get the pc back in sessionthen take up session goals not life and livingness goals take down whatever gains the pc mentions get asksay answer question if he has one dont start handling what comes up you are ending session dont press for more give the pc tone 40 end of session and have him tell you that you are longer auditing him give him an altered visual aspect also to keep him from going on running his case look more cheerful and natural ask for cigarette or something this is routine 2 model session using more than this minimum can get you into trouble for nulling session you can show the pc the list and ask for any major thoughts that he has had about it this practice lets the pc get off outruds on the list then you dont have to ask for them if the pc gets agitated in routine 2 session the first thing to assume is that there is something wrong with the routine 2 if the pc gets selfauditish or interrupts to get his ruds in just give cheery acknowledgment and go on dont let the pc obscure reads while listing if you are nulling just go down the list going bark bark bark if the needle gets dirty dont assume that it is outruds it is more likely that the list is wrong way to or from wrong source especially if your nulling was too brisk to give the pc time to think even more likely than the above is that the item is not on the list if list is incomplete pc wont register protest on the meter when you ask for more items even if he is protesting verbally you could also list for pages beyond where the list was complete then the needle can go dirty on protest but all other crimes fall short of not completing the list r321 requires more midruds than routine 2 see p 371 above for r321 as soon as you have ptps out of the road the case is ready for r321 find his goals nice as you please it is safer for an expert auditor to do goals on case than to do routine 2 an inexpert auditor is safer with routine 2 the list in pt who or what are you upset about would probably run more easily on pc simply in the form who or what does present time consist of cf expanded dianetics pt environment list this is the basic model but you could use who or what are you in contact with in pt on missed withholds realize that you can list whichever area is of most interest to the pc if you pick the wrong one of the three session life and livingness parts of existence to do first it can react like missed withhold make sure you get the universe where the problem lies6301c15 shspec231 r212 nevers never represent rockslamming item ie anything that ever rockslammed because rockslamming item comes from some source and if you dont know what the source is it could be wrong an arbitrary source is dangerous this is the most dangerous point in r212 never use an arbitrary list dont try to oppose some rockslamming word that just comes from nowhere never abandon r212 nothing else will patch up r212 if it gets fouled up r212 is an ultimate process ie process that repairs itself never try to patch up r212 with something else because it will fail never let someone lose records or keep records inaccurately there is way to straighten out case whose records are lost however using the meter find when the pcs case caved in the session in which it occurred and put midruds in on that session this will get the pcs memory improved to the point where he can give you data about the list or whatever but this is very arduous approach never attribute violent arc break to anything but wrong item or an incomplete list it is not caused by missed withhold except in the sense that the missed item is the withhold this datum applies in the workaday world as well as it does in session somebody has missed an item on the us government probably the arc break is from noauditing and missing all their items never run pc darker and massier he wont get lighter come off it at once never give pc an item and then do something else at once this is very distracting to the pc and if it is wrong item the arc break will be compounded you must allow minute or two of observation just put the meter aside and make little routine of it and say well apparently your item is _______ watch him like hawk does his face get dark does mass come in if so dont let it go any longer tell the pc that you want to continue listing never lead pc to believe that you are giving him an item when you are not there can be funny condition where all the indicators look right but after the pc cognites the rock slam will vanish as the lock blows after which the wrongitem indicators start to show up so dont shift the pcs attention this will save lots of trouble the longer you let pc keep wrong item the more trouble it will be to patch it up never persist with wrong action that is worsening the case just because you dont know what to do it is far better to end off or take break to straighten things out it is good sense to know what you are doing before you do it this does not mean somatics thats not sign of the pcs getting worse at all never let case errors accumulate or multiply when you are aware of an error on the case fix it without forgetting that it is an error to fail to complete cycle of action on the case but also dont interrupt pc that is doing well if the case isnt running ok repair earlier mistakes all lists stem from some arbitrary point it cant be helped the three universes from which you list are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence each of these can be listed positive or negative oppterm or and terminal or thus you have twelve sources one way to make auditing with these less risky is when clearing the command to test it for rock slams this can include testing words or segments within thecommand for rock slams never represent it if it rockslams clear the command and vary it around until it makes sense to the pc until its real to him never try to list list question that the pc cannot answer ie clear it with him and get his agreement to answer it choosing the wrong universe to list will get you missed withhold phenomena including arc breaks because the pcs attention is fixated on the universe that you are not asking him about never in your anxiety to clear someone or pacify someone fail to get his ptps and hidden standards out of the way that is all in general that has been wrong with clearing6301c16 shspec232 tr0 the original tr0 was to teach the auditor to be there and to be aware however in doing tr 0 students have begun to confront with that definition the original definition and tr0 are still valid additives have arisen you can make someone confront with professional attitude an auditing attitude an interested attitude good coaching depends on spotting what the student is doing and running it out flunking it without either flunking so much that the student goes into apathy nor so little that the student never improves the purpose of tro is to enable the studentto stand up to the duress of auditing it disturbs pc to have an auditor whose confront is very unnatural and who shatters under an upset in session upsets are often assignable to faulty tr4 an auditor who q and as gives pcs withholds by not simply acknowledging one q and equals one missed withhold the pcs statement has not been acknowledged just acknowledged the reason some auditors take long time to learn not to q and isnt really outtr4 it is outtr0 the auditor cant stand up to the session whenever something in the session looks odd the auditor retreats tr0 is out the coach must have considerable perception to coach tr0 on useful gradient he has to see confront go out look at something the student is doing and punch the button lrh has noticed auditors who q and in the presence of an arc break because there is too much there to confront this is as disastrous as it is likely to happen coaching gradient on this would start with the coach shaking his hand in front of the students eyes somewhere on the gradient the student will demonstrate his ability to dodge flying emeter cans while still confronting for an auditor to freeze and go totally silent is worse for the pc than auditor q and it is noauditing situation we should give at least fifty percent of our coaching time to the fellow who goes into wood good coach can recognize the difference between someone confronting and someone going into solid granite the next worst thing to going wooden is fleeing this amounts to the same thing dont think someone is doing tr0 because he has gone into apathy you can add aliveness to being aware this point is easy for coach to miss someone whose tr0 is granite wont be able to handle what comes up in session because he is not really confronting when you find an auditor who is having trouble with tr0 you know what kind of response he is getting in auditing because when something happens in session the auditor flees good auditing as opposed to bad auditing will show up most clearly under duress tr0 is the first thing to go the auditor will start making mistakes which is one thing you cant afford to do if the auditors tr0 is poor the auditor will make wrong judgments matter how well he is taught there is gradient of bad tr0 consisting of three grades 1 tr0 of doing the drill not associated with anything 2 the person who clams up and cant act 3 obsessive motion as form of and all three of these must be cured with coaching there is something else you could do different from tr1 or tr2 talking confront you see if the student can go on counting while you throw the cans at him or whether he loses countauditors must be trained to expect arc breaks and to keep going because auditors get arc breaks as well as getting wins and results lrh was aware recently of thinking less swiftly when pc arc broke he analyzed the phenomenon as his not wanting to confront it because it was counter to his intention for the session so he experienced small impulse not to confront it this gave lrh subjective reality on how an auditor could go from there to not thinking and making goof r212 arc breaks can be sudden violent and apparently inexplicable so tr0 must be beefed up in order to cope with this how much and how long should you run tr0 until the student comes to the independent conclusion that he can do tr0 and has the ability to do tr0 while doing all the other trs and until he can maintain tr0 when everything is going wrong and there is lots of duress bad tr0 leads to and lack of comprehension of what is going on and noauditing for the pc it takes awhile for someone to learn r212 if he is learning his trs at the same time you are liable to have mess on your hands coaudit with r210 see p 359 above can be done but only because guidance is very stringent and they dont have very much responsibility for tr1 go get good recording of lion roaring and then play it with the student putting intention into the middle of the speaker the degree of arc breaks the pc will have on r212 is proportional to the outness of the auditors trs bad trs lead to bad judgment if the auditors trs are perfect he will never have them tested by violently arc broken pc psychiatrists are trying to make the third dynamic safe by protecting it from the first dynamic ie from the patient he is curing motion he is totally sold on the idea that insanity equals motion he tries to get the patient into quietness into apathy6302c13 shtvd16 shspec237 xunit ruds and havingness demo tape of ruds and havingness 6302c13 shspec238 discussion by lrh of xunit ruds and havingness tvd there are two reasons why session doesnt start 1 there is something wrong with the room 2 the pc has something to say and is holding it back waiting for the session to start so that he can say somethinghubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 february 1963 central orgs franchise r2r3 listing rules an idiocy of long long lists can creep into routine 2 and routine 3 this is not as harmful as underlisting but it can make pcs pretty green or black and certainly holds up auditing you must realize that listing to still tone arm takes several things for granted 1 that the auditor has his sensitivity at about 4 mark iv about 6 during listing 2 that the auditor does not adjust the ta for surges cognitions etc 3 that the ta is adjusted only when it has to be to get the needle into readable position 4 that the pc is answering the auditing question and not varying it or running havingness on himself 5 that the rudiments are reasonably in particularly suppress invalidate protest and decide 6 that the pc is capable of being in session 7 that the pc isnt fiddling with the cans yawning stretching etc in other words if an auditor has his pc under calm control the ta rule applies as the control of the pc diminishes the ta rule grows less workable but even so all is not lost ta shifts because of body motion yawning asking questions and particularly because of protests do not count in reading ta position the ta position that must be steady is for the list so if you read it ta position for the list must be motionless you have it absolutely correct the ta will also read for other attention positions such as on the auditor on the room on the body the pc shifts his attention from the list and you get ta motion the thing we want to know is did the ta go right back to list position when the pc put his attention back on the list or with the pcs attention on the list did the ta now move if so thats ta motion for the list and the list is incomplete its really very easy even if the pc is out of session to find motionless ta on the list understand this and youll stop endless listing ta action out is however not the first rule of complete list the rules of complete list for r2 or r3 are 1 two items rr and rs are not firing when the list rr and rs items are read back to the pc 2 only one item rses or rrs on the list when rrs and rss noted during listing are read back to the pc the others do not read 3 the list has the reliable item on it in routine 2 these rules apply4 on completed r2 source list one rsing item only will rs when read back to the pc 5 on completed r2 list taken by opposing either way rockslamming item the reliable item will be the last rockslamming item on the list if it is not the item being opposed is wrong or the opposition wording is wrong way to or the list is incomplete in routine 3 these rules apply 7 on completed r3 source list one rocket reading item only will rr when read back to the pc rs or other rr on the list should now read 8 on completed r3 list taken by opposing either way rockslamming item the reliable item will be the last rocket reading item on the list if it is not the item being opposed is wrong or the opposition wording is wrong way to or the list is incomplete 9 an item or goal which was seen to rocket read when being written down but which rses when read back to the pc will rocket read again if given brief big mid ruds prepcheck the above are the rules which must apply as some variability can result in various auditors interpretation of still ta and in how good session the auditor can run the ta rule is secondary it still applies it is still valid but pc on protest varies his ta all over the place and an auditor that cant handle pc with few deft mid ruds or get his question answered will get ta action when the list is flat when you get the hang of it you will see that listing to motionless ta is valid but that of course is in an auditing session on one of these overlong lists you can tell if its overlong by seeing if you have gone 50 items 25 items opposing rr ris past the last rs or rr making sure that you dont get two items on the list that fire and thus find your reliable item its finding ris that counts not how long can we list also avoid buying pcs hard sell on an item or condition if it follows the above rules buy it if not just ack and go on auditors with low sales resistance need not apply often the pc says its terminal when its an oppterm apply the tests and do decent test list before you make up your mind pcs dont really knowris have an aberrative value you knowso why buy dramatized sales talk the auditor is necessary because an auditor isnt in the ri and can think so an auditor who buys sales talk isnt an auditor get it audit r2 and r3 by the rules if

well prepchecked and is well under auditor control an auditor in routine 2 or routine 3 session may omit rudiments in model session using only goals for session and havingness goals and gains at end and general ow mid ruds and random ruds where needed in the session this salvages about an hours auditing time per day start and end of session commands are used just rudiments general ow may be found necessary on some pcs at session start in lieu of rudiments to get cleaner needle this does not apply to rudiments and havingness sessions or prepcheck sessions and problems intensives for pc who is well smoothed out by staff auditors then and who is well under the goal finders control the following may be used particularly with mark v meter start of sessionis it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session at this point in the session there are two actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but those symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running ow if it is alright with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is alright with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed this is always done by the repetitive system since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated since the last time i audited you has anything been suggested since the last time i audited you is there anything you failed to revealsince the last time i audited you is there anything you have been careful of these latter four rudiments are done by fast check the in this session mid ruds can be used to straighten up session that has completely gone out of the auditors control after he has gotten in the random rudiment on this list mid ruds particularly with suppressed or invalidated can be used to get pc to continue listing running the random rudiment in this session have i missed withhold on you in this session is there anything i failed to find out about you in this session have you thought said or done anything i failed to find out in this session have i nearly found out something about you any of the above versions may be used the random rudiment is always run repetitively end of session is it alright with you if we end off now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do so end of if the pc from the auditors observation is very agitated or upset the auditor would run general ow as given above if the session has been an extremely difficult session with the pc having been arc broken badly and frequently one would get in the in this session mid ruds in order to clean up the auditing even though the pc may now be alright have you made any part of your goals for this session have you made any other gains in this session that you would care to mention after adjusting the meter please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not alright the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session is it alright with you if i end this session now here it is end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session bulletin done by mary sue hubbard after we worked it out lrhdrbh l

when one persists simply because one doesnt know what else to do one is doing the unusual what you are trying to do with gpm is to run it out not just to find ris the goal built the gpm so you have to

drill early in practical add to all check sheets some day you will be awfully glad you read and learned this hco bulletin the only things that can ruin the future of r2 and r3 are 1 arc breaks because of bad r2 and r3 and 2 the sad effect the arc break there is nothing more nerveracking to an auditor than an r2 or r3 arc break they are not like other arc breaks from common missed withhold they are nerveshattering and far reaching in consequence if you cant handle an r2 or r3 arc break you have business using the techniques as youll wrap more than one pc around telephone pole the only real damage r2 and r3 can do to case is when one fails to handle an r2 or r3 arc break good r2 or r3 repairs bad r2 or r3 but one sometimes has to be awfully clever to repair case once the auditor has let an arc break go by indeed so important is the arc break in r2 and r3 that it is actually used as one means of testing the correctness of the r2 or r3 cause of arc breaks the untried auditor is always sure the r2 or r3 arc break happens because of auditing blunders mid ruds etc failure to pull ordinary missed withholds or auditor auditing goofs this is not true the truth is that r2 and r3 arc breaks are caused by mistake in goals items or gpms and thats the whole cause the pc however unable to grasp this turns his reasoning upon the auditor and blames the auditing therefore this rule must be thoroughly learned and experienced by the auditor before he or she is safe in auditing r2 and r3 arc break rule in r2 and r3 when the pc criticizes or attacks the auditor or goes into grief or apathy an r2 or r3 error has just occurred theauditor must ignore the pcs statements as to the cause of the arc break and quickly remedy the r2 or r3 and do nothing else there are exceptions to this rule in r2 and r3 the auditor having goofed in some other way is liable to see reason in what the pc is saying do something like missed withholds or mid ruds and drive the arc break into heights that can make the pc much more upset mid rud rule in an r2 or r3 arc break missed withholds and mid ruds are used if at all only after the arc break has been healed by correcting the r2 and r3 if an auditor tries to get in his mid ruds or pull missed withholds in the face of an arc break in an r2 or r3 session the pc is likely to be driven down to the sad effect which is harder to salvage the sad effect we could call this tearaculi apathia magnus and everyone would be in great awe of it but i see reason to follow the latinated nonsense of yesterdays failured sciences call it something simple and the auditor will feel he can do something about it and even the pc will cheer up bit so its the sad effect this is state of great sadness apathy misery and desire for suicide and death i have been on the trail of the causes of this condition for about 20 years like nearly everything else in scientology this is new high point in achievement we have the highest state ot and we have the lowest states of being recognized and know the roads to them rule neglect or overwhelm an r2 or r3 arc break pc anger or antagonism and you will cause the pc to drop into the sad effect the sad effect is caused by neglecting or overwhelming an r2 or r3 arc break and the state will continue until remedied by correcting the r2 or r3 all pcs who are sad hopeless etc have had their r2 or r3 mishandled by life or auditing arc break cause rule all r2 or r3 arc breaks stem from wrong items or goals incomplete lists wrong way to oppose or auditing all these are in essence missed withholds of the greatest possible magnitude and therefore cause arc breaks of the greatest possible magnitude bad auditing only serves to key in an existing r2 or r3 errorin actual fact missed withhold can amount to whole section of the gpm goal error or leaving the gpm section before it is clean wrong goal wrong item wrong way to item or of lesser degree not finding an item the common denominator of all r2 r3 arc breaks consists of missed or wrongly designated gpm goal or reliable item there are other sources of r2 or r3 arc break bad sessioning poor auditing ordinary life missed withholds are only contributive to r2 and r3 arc breaks and are incapable of doing more than keying in and intensifying the magnitude of the arc break which has already been caused by errors in r2 and r3 the fifteen principal causes the fifteen principal causes of arc break in r2 and r3 are 1 failure to complete list 2 bypassing an item 3 giving the pc wrong item 3a opposing an item wrong way to 4 giving the pc an item with altered wording 5 giving the pc item 6 failure to complete goals list 7 bypassing the pcs goal 8 giving the pc wrong goal 9 giving the pc goal with altered wording 10 giving the pc goal 11 failure to complete gpm before going to the next 12 bypassing gpm 13 getting the pc into the wrong gpm 14 going too far into gpm without finding goal 15 auditing the fifteen apply to both r2 and r3 all of them they can be made up into an assessment list shortly to be issued which list assessed by elimination will give you the exact cause of the arc break which i think is pretty clever of and permit you to heal it rapidly while you will feel on occasion that the assessment result is more easily interpreted then fortune telling you will find that it is always right it spots the missed r2r3 missed withhold if it comes up bypassed item youll have scramble trying to find it but you at least know why the pc arc broke and the pc will permit you to look even while screaming at you the cycle of the arc break stage onethe arc break starts always in the same way the pc finds something wrong with the auditor the subject or tools of auditing or the auditing room he does this in varying intensity arc break to arc break stage two this is followed by misemotion also directed at the auditor subject tools or room stage three if the auditor continues on with auditing the pc will drop into grief sadness or apathy this is an inevitable cycle and may be followed by the pc with greater or lesser intensity of emotion or loudness or lack of response skilled auditor will recognize and stop it at stage one above it is sometimes not possible to stop the cycle because it enters the stages and completes them too swiftly but it must be cared for and further r2 or r3 may be done until the r2 or r3 is corrected the auditors view the auditor must realize that the arc break is caused by an error which has just occurredwithin seconds or minutes and must not go back half dozen sessions unless the pc has been pretty upset all along something has just happened usually that is wrong r2 or r3 the auditor must stop all forward action and must not do anything except correct what has already happened do not continue on do not get in mid ruds do not pull missed withholds or do anything else but correct the r2 and r3 do not do new lists or new approaches or new actions until the old action is straightened up to continue is to produce the sad effect if the pc is already in the sad effect at session start treat it as an arc break with the drill given the pc does not realize that anything has been missed he or she thinks its the auditor the subject or the tools and will target only these the fact of the arc break must be noted and the substance of the criticism must be ignored by the auditor if the pc knew what had been missed there would be arc break the missed withhold of the item or whatever is not only missed by the auditor but by the pc the pc wont ever spot it left on his own its up to the auditor the auditor only must make up his or her mind as to whats wrong the directions of the pc even skilled scientologist as pc are nearly always wrong the auditor is there to listen and compute as its the pcs bank the pc cant compute on his or her own case taking the pcs directions will always involve and prolong the arc break what really caused it will be occluded to the pc dont always do something different than what the pc says by averages the pc might have accidentally hit on it just do what is necessary to straighten out the r2 and r3 just dont depend on the pc to tell you know your r2 and r3 you the auditor are the only one present who can think clearly thats what youre for the d of ps view the d of p has different view of an arc break it is by sessions according to auditors reportsto get case going again that has gone into stage three examine yesterdays reports look for change in pcs goals and gains and correct the session before the one in which they changed when an auditing supervisor becomes an auditor he or she carries this habit forward into auditing and presented with an arc breaking pc in session tends to look to yesterday but in session the arc breaking action usually occurs only seconds or minutes before the arc break look there when auditing the drill this drill is to be used in all practical sections before the student is turned loose on r2 or r3 designation r2 and r3 drill one purpose to prevent errors in r2 and r3 and to prevent upsets in the pcs case theory the effort of pc at the start of an arc break is to stop the auditor the pcs effort is aimed at the auditors skill person the subject auditing tools or the room the comments are critical whether jocular or misemotional when this effort fails to stop the auditor and the auditor presses on with auditing the pc is overwhelmed and goes rapidly down tone scale in severe r2 or r3 arc break the pc will stay down scale for minutes hours days weeks or months until the arc break is repaired by correcting the r2 or r3 error made immediately before the arc break the correct action is to prevent all possibility of the auditor becoming too enturbulated to think prevent all engagement in refutation of the pcs accusations give the auditor time and calm to correct the r2 or r3 test the correction by seeing if it stops the arc break and only then recommence the session the key is that even the most startled auditor seeing an arc break begin can associate it with the word break the drill is always used in actual sessions even when the auditor thinks he knows the reason for it drill auditor list the items in this room coach privately makes up his mind which of the arc break points is wrong does auditing command briefly and then unexpectedly criticizes with greater or lesser violence auditor room tools subject or self or drops into simulated tears or apathy auditor thank you we will now take short break gathers papers and leaves room shuffles papers and returns into room auditor i would like to do short assessment on you auditor does actual emeter assessment from standard hco bulletin question list which will be provided from time to time based on the principal causes of r2r3 arc breaks finds the one the coach was hiding by actual meter reaction auditor i find we have gives cause found and we will now locate it is that all right with you coach okay auditor the session is resumed coach thats itin actual practice the auditor would have examined the papers of the pc to come to some conclusion about the case in private and seen what was wrong or seen the d of p or somebody else for help and then would have confirmed it by assessment history developed at saint hill by l ron hubbard in march ad 13 to prevent severe upsets

franchise r2r3 important data dont force the pc never force pc to list when doing r2 12 or 3m especially 3m if the pc has difficulty listing three things may be wrong 1 the item being listed is wrong way to 2 it may be wrong item even from another gpm 3 it may be an item from some other gpm pc actually cant help but list easily if its the right item that the list is coming from in the usual case listing from right item requires only the most occasional giving of the auditing question by the auditor once at the start of the list once after each interruption to check something between the pc just gives items in steady flow occasionally the pc asks for the question if the auditor has to give question for each item he gets man theres one of the above 3 wrong wrong way to mass moves in on wrong way to list question its being given who or what would loud voices oppose and it should be who or what would oppose loud voices if its wrong 1 the mass moves in 2 the pc starts to discolor 3 the pc has to continuously repeat the question to himself 4 the pc cant wrap his mind around the question 5 the pc discolors or darkens 6 the tone arm goes unreasonably high above 5 in some cases 7 the pc may arc break if in the presence of such symptoms the auditor forces the pc to go on listing real trouble can then develop as the mass caves in on the body body vs thetan to understand this trouble we have to review what we have known for years about bodies and thetans the thetan is not the body the bank belongs to the thetan not to the body you are running thetan and his bank while helped and hindered by the body the body helps the auditor because it provides communication relay to thetan who cannot yet speak hear or act without body the emeter cans are held by the bodys hands the bodys voice box magnifies the thetans speech and body lips larynx etc add diction theears magnify the auditors voice the body relays various senses and somatics to the thetan the body discolors when mass from the bank is brought in on it further because he is in body you can tell if the pc is sitting in the pcs chair joke the body hinders the auditor by being fragile life long before auditing has been keying the thetans masses in on this body in auditing masses are released off the body and out of the thetans bank the body accustomed after all to masses keying in on it in life can still survive lot of bad auditing but why as you go earlier and earlier in the bank the power of the thetans mockups increases earlier on the track the thetan was more powerful and made more formidable mockups thus the earlier the gpm you are addressing certainly beyond the 3rd the more care you have to use not to pull masses in on the body which is to say the more accurate you have to be now as the thetan by clearing gpms becomes more and more able to handle and recognize goals and items the auditor tends to more and more abandon the safety points of r3 m these are testing the goal making the opptermterminal test for each ri watching the tendency of the needle to tighten watching for pcs darkening abandoning these the auditor tends to race on finding more gpms goals and ris cleaning up nothing behind him this is wrong test the goal after every ri you find test every ri you find for terminal or oppterm really stay alert for the tightening needle and high ta that shows an error watch carefully for pc darkening the more advanced the gpm the more careful you have to be of the body dont go plunging on after an arc break find why by the arc break assessment and straighten it up when you complete gpm go about 2 items deep into the next one find its goal and then go back and put in the bmrs on every item in the former line plot and give the gone goal an 18 button prepcheck only then proceed on into the next gpm whose goal has been found items get easier to find as you advance into new gpms lists get shorter but the ris are harder and harder on the body when done wrong so be sure and then proceed and if the pc wont list for any reason even his own balkiness find out whats wrong before the current action and be sure that was it before proceeding its easier to lose session time in looking for former errors than in trying to revive pc or heal screaming arc break even the most accurate auditing gives the pc heavy somatics thats ok just dont force the pc beyond where he can easily go the real howling arc breaks only come after you have forced the pc onward after something has gone wrong if you have howling arc breaks with pc you have forced the pc into channel where the pc cannot easily go wrong itemlisting completely wrong item which did not fire or which did can happen in number of ways if you list an ri wrong way to you will get high ta and fewer rrs on the list further you may just run out of rrs on the next list or one or two lists down and real catastrophe you can find on wrong way oppose an item out of an adjacent gpm for which you have found goal the item you find wont fit the goal of the gpm you are supposed to be running best thing to do is abandon it but put on the plot and go back and find which ri behind you was wrong way oppose it will tick or fire put in the bmrs on it and list it the other way to on later gpms the pc will easily overlist and list beyond the one you are trying for and get the next in line the way to tell is test the listing question for clean every five items the pc gives the moment its clean stop listing for instance in the 4th gpm you are listing somebody who cant whisper line plot hco bulletin of march 13 and you overlist you will get loud voices on the list but you will find whisperer as the last rring item which will read then if you omit the term oppterm test and assume whisperer is an oppterm you will do wrong way oppose and may get into another gpm entirely however especially after bmr on it whisperer wrong way opposed will now fire again with an rr but the pc still arc breaks why you overshot on the somebody who cant whisper oppose list and you have bypassed ri loud voices bmr the rrs earlier on the somebody who cant whisper oppose list and youll find loud voices probably fires now or do it by pcs recognition but the item recognized has to fire with an rr or when you do whisperer right way oppose youll also get loud voices auditing on 3m is like threading through mine field with the pc ready to explode if you stray experience will let you relax travelling rr in listing the rr travels down the list it comes from the goal charge therefore it can travel you can sometimes bring it back up list with enough bmr to an earlier rr seen on listing the most weird thing in 3m is the goal as an ri behaviour on mar 13 hco bulletin to scream as an ri bottom of plot page 2 as you list it as an ri in its proper sequence on the plot not as goal oppose it behaves as an ri oppose list not as source list on it the pc will put usually the goal of the next gpm on it will usually be found as the last rr item on the list happy people but the goal of the next gpm on that list will not rr when said to pc not until you take all the goals off the ri oppose list and nul them as goals list then the goal of the next gpm will fire and prove out in short only the last rr seen on nulling on an ri oppose list will fire with an rrthis does not mean the remaining items seen to rr while listing are not ris in their own right it only means that on any list the rr travels to the last rring item seen on listing when the list is complete items which rred on listing will not fire as part of the list but taken off the list and known by the pc to be off the list and called as themselves will rr when you get pc into the 5th gpm this becomes very invariable and gets vastly in your road as you can bypass the next ri you should get and find the one after that or you can lose the next gpms goal as it doesnt rr on the ri oppose list from the last goal while still on that list its okay if you know it can happen it will help you cure an ailing line plot or goals list in hurry rrs travel on 3m lists down to the last rr and if it has travelled the earlier rrs items or goals on an ri list seen on listing will not rr until they have been taken off that list and are called in their own right wrong wording always be sure you have the right wording for an item or goal slightly wrong wording for goal will cause it to rs and fizzle out get the pc to change the wording on it and it may rr on and on if pc arc breaks on goals list you had and passed the goal or you had the goal with slightly wrong wording the pc still arc breaks on wrong wording as its missed withhold pcs usually put down varied wordings on goals lists encourage it even though its representing an rring item if goal fires rses fizzles vanishes get other wordings for it and it may rr beautifully example to succeed on checking rred six times blew ta down rsed madly rsed dwindled and then ticked auditor went on pc arc broke auditor went back over list got wording for to succeed as to be successful goal rred beautifully arc break onward bound into next gpm items with the article or the omitted or added or plural for singular will not fire well or at all example item listed sensation checked out as sensation fire pc recalls it should be sensation item fires and is an ri accuracy of listing exactly what the pc said is important he usually said it right the first time say it back and check it out the same way sometimes pc wants to change word in an item being called always let him but check both versions the one listed and the one changed the one listed is usually right if recorded right by the auditor item from another gpm stray ri is an ri from gpm of another goal than the one being workedyou can get goal or item from another gpm by backwards oppose or overlisting in finding the goal of another gpm than the one you want to enter this is easy it fires very badly ticks and fools around an ri from another gpm on the other hand fires well when you do the how does the goal relate to step and the pc cant relate it or mass appears when he tries watch it you probably have backwards oppose behind you or have bypassed an ri by overlisting or underlisting or more probably both what to do put the stray ri on the plot marked as stray and locate the wrong way oppose or bypass on your line plot and correct it will do harm to 4 way package the stray ri but it probably wont do any good either two gpms later you suddenly find it as new ri the pc will probably arc break at this time but the reason for the arc break lies in an earlier wrong way oppose or bypassed ri or ris use the stray ri as signal that wrong way oppose exists behind you or an ri has been bypassed the proper order of actions if the above happens is to 1 locate the bypassed item 2 use it to continue your ri oppose spiral staircase 3 ignore the wrong way oppose item dont instantly right way oppose it and any stray ri letting them come up in their proper sequence matter how much later that is minimize goal oppose lists only do goal oppose list at the start of the first gpm and thats it you dont need any more if you go right youll go into gpms in proper sequence on the spiral staircase with further goal oppose lists for any goal you will find however that the goal as an ri see to scream as an ri page 2 hco bulletin march 13 1963 operates as an ri oppose list and will be done in its proper time and place this is not source list and behaves as an ri oppose list take the goals off it to another list and nul them for the next gpm only one goal oppose list is needed for case after that always use the last ri that still fires with an rr as your source for ri oppose lists clear test you dont need to do clear test it might mess up the bank natural free needle without prepcheck begins to appear around the fifth gpm check out first goal clear by his or her line plot if it compares in all respects to that of hco bulletin march 13 and the goal is clean saying it to the pc call it first goal cleara bracelet clear would be actually theta clear and would emerge after the 5th to 8th gpm had been cleaned up by present calculation free needle totally stable theta clear emerges after the 8th gpm has been run calculation on operating thetan exists at this moment but at guess its well beyond the 8th gpm up to the 6th gpm clear test is liable to foul up the case little so save it for later and really send up rockets in celebration thetans have done lot of living routine 3m is complex and

gets cleaned up because you pick up all the thoughts of the pc thats wrong needle cleans up because the pc has more arc and more confidence in the auditor it isnt cleaned up on the significance of what the pc says so in ruds and havingness session the primary purpose of the session is to build arc with the pc by reason of auditing it is not what you do it is how you do it you are smoothing out his needle pcs arc determines his reads on the meter it is based on smooth basic auditing the first requisite of all auditing is to be able to give pc smooth session on ruds and havingness session which ends up with the pc in better arc the needle cleaner if you can do that the pc will have confidence in you the pc has to be able to confront his auditor before he can confront his bank the effect scale is at work here if you are smooth basic auditor you can run any process ruds and havingness arent just practice they raise the pcs arc if they are done righthubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 23 march ad13 franchise clear ot dont try to make an ot before you make clear one of the enduring observations which has arisen in clearing and which will always remain true is summed up in this line dont try to make an ot before you make clear stressing this conclusion is vitally important and will always be important why in their understandable enthusiasm to do the most for the pc and obtain the highest gain auditors tend to get as many ris and goals as possible the face acquired in making third goal clear also operates on the part of the pc there is always some pc pressure to get on with it find more ris find more goals there is also face im 3rd goal clear the auditor in his own enthusiasm for more gpms heeds the pcs protest against case repair and prepchecks and commits the following crime without making first goal attempts to make an ot he does this in gradients without making an actual first goal clear the auditor with the pcs full insistence makes third goal clear this law takes over in the face of such press on tactics rule you cannot have an any goal clear without clearing the goal and all its gpm to do this it is necessary to observe this rule rule goal is not clear until all rocket reading items in that goal have been found properly aligned and discharged and the goal has been fully prepchecked the next goal is available and easily found ris in the next gpm are readily found there seems to be reason to waste auditing time by cleaning up the last gpm this is true of any next gpm however just going on and on carries its penalties if we persist in failing to fully clear each gpm we can expect general bog down in all of scientology why because we will all become subject to the very real penalties of failing to clear gpms before going onit is alright to find 2 ris into the next gpm and to find its goal that is as it should be but it is not alright not to go back and fully polish up the gpm just left this is true for all gpms you havent got first goal clear if you havent cleared the first gpm and goal so dont announce first goal clears if you havent cleared fully the first goal having the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th etc goals and some ris in each still doesnt make first goal clear the following liabilities occur when the gpm just left is not fully cleaned up 1 the pc drags mass from the last gpm into the next gpm 2 accuracy of ri finding in the next gpm is diminished 3 the pc being more subject to errors in auditing is far more likely to heavily arc break 4 body mass weight does not diminish 5 pcs reality on the next gpm ris is diminished 6 feeling of lassitude shadow of the sad effect comes over the pc and he or she does his own work in life with less enthusiasm 7 the pcs health and actions are better but one does not see what one expects from clearing therefore clearing is downgraded by the auditor and pc and others 8 the actual soaring gains of clearing are not observed since the gpm and its goal are not actually cleared but only deintensified clear tests which will be issued from time to time should be scrupulously passed before going on to the actual running of the next bank if these simple precautions are observed clearing is formidable to behold if they are not observed then clearing wont be observedbecause it hasnt been done dont try to make an operating thetan before you make clear the results will be far far below that of just first goal clear lot of time and agony went into discovering these things i hope you will benefit by them l ron hubbard

definitions in this bulletin if it is not so coach reads definition and has student repeat it coach take phrase from the bulletin say it to and observe the meter when the student has done this coach asks the following questions 1 did you get needle reaction what was it where was it 2 did you get rudiment instant read what was it 3 did you get an instant read what was it training stress coach needs to keep control of the coaching session he should not depart from the above questions if student is in any doubt at any time coach asks for definition of whatever is being handled example student im not sure if i had reaction coach define needle reaction when student has done so coach repeats question did you get needle reaction and continues thus until student gives definite answerany hesitancy or any failure on the part of the student to observe read is queried with what happened occasionally ask student how are you doing this drill needs to be coached exactly as outlined above student is very likely to start blowing confusion dont q with it flunks evaluation or invalidation history developed by reg sharpe from the materials of l ron hubbard at saint hill april 1963 to improve emeter reading rapidly and without student being invalidated by another student who does not know how to read meter l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6304c30 shspec261 directive listing part ii finding the pattern of the gpm has been pure slaughter you have to hunt and punch around among various banks stirring everything up lrh was horrified in the past to find so many items he wondered if some were locks now it is all shaken out it is mysterious that the noun form declines into ity forms then the goal as an oppterm the goal declines through the same pattern all the way down through absolute and perfect into the ivities then you get to the end of the goal which doesnt decline mysteriously body weight and machinery get knocked around sometimes when doing directive listing it is the unrun items which slamming into the body increase the bodys mass this is one of the oldest findings in havingness processing like mockups being shoved into the body increasing the bodys weight partiallyrun gpm being in restimulation impinges on the body more than it did so you get more body weight mental mass and physical mass are the same stuff but mental mass is thinner gpm mass looks like steel shell or is sphere covered with black or grey cloud the mass on halfdischarged bank looks like grey cottonwool it has finite dimensions the mass alternates black banks and grey banks going back down the track black bank partly discharged turns greyish and murkybrown while there are still some items it shakes and shivers and tries to fall apart the best items are those that turn on little mass the first items off take off proportionally more charge than the later ones however leaving lower ris undischarged is dangerous because the lower items hold it all together and it will charge up again the top items are uncomfortable and upsetting but not that important the lowest oppterm is the keystone that keeps the bank in its channel because it is cross between the failed goal of the next gpm down and the one you are in that is how the goals stay in sequence what keeps the bank charged up is the goal when you reach the goal as an ri you cant just leave it you have to list what would oppose it but dont let the pc start to run what comes up as the item because it is the next bank and before going into it the pc has to come up to pt acknowledge it very thoroughly dont null the list go back to the top of the first bank you ran and find its goal find the opposite oppose and go on to pt it is always harder to go the other way going later rather than earlier but that is the way to do it the reason is that you are trying to clear the pc by obtaining for the pc the greatest possible auditing gains per unit of time it is mechanically true that the more items you get off the more banks you run the more charge you discharge the more the pc will cognite but we are running the pc under special conditions that you as scientologist recognize as special but that one else would see as out of the ordinary you are running thetan in body that just about ruins ninety percent of the things you could do you are auditing bank with frail human body interposed between the bank and the pc but you need the pcs body to hold onto the cans that is what has given lrh trouble in research the pc is put into danger in that you cant audit dead body end if the pc dropped his body half way through bank he would probably be sufficiently restimulated so that he would have trouble picking up new body he would keyout but he would feel betrayed because the hope factor was way up so auditing is monitored by the consideration of what gains you can achieve in spite of the fact that the pc has body between himself and the bank this is real problem the bank is capable of influencing the body that is why the emeter can be used the meter is not connected up to the auditor but the auditor can accidentally start looking at or into his own bank to figure out the pc and kick in some restimulation the auditors bank and the pcs are on different wavelengths so they dont collide mest has wavelengths also someone whose wavelength is near to yours is someone you feel very close to soul mate you can influence each other more than average being both more pleasing and more irritating there is also the possibility of having known the other person before so there is thetan plus body plus bank the bank consists of free track that hasnt been drawn into the gpms all the goals all the gpms all the locks secondaries engrams and circuits then there is the thetan the body and the physical universe with all its ptps so in sense in auditing the pc you are auditing the whole physical universe and everything init it is seldom necessary for the auditor to handle the pcs environment except when handling very neurotic or psychotic pc or pc with psychotic family if you were auditing thetan with body you could run him back to his earliest bank knock it out and then run off the later ones more easily the body gets in the way of this because when the thetan made his earliest bank he didnt have body and his adventures were more strenuous than body could take so you can make someone quite ill by chasing them down into early banks and badly handling them the body is useful adjunct though nuisance in some ways so you should safeguard it by staying with standard procedures whatever you come up with to run run it well with minimum of stress on the body what could you do to overstress the body you could fail to clear the bank you are working on and go off into other banks you could not run banks closer to pt before going earlier you could not try as far as possible to run bank from its extreme top to the bottom you could keep auditing the pc over and over finding nothing and not discharging the bank you could find wrong items and run wrong goals you could fail to follow the pattern but assume that your pc is different your pc simply wont rocket read well on some parts of the gpm it is just charge that prevents the right item from firing just as the pc has many goals and many banks he has many ris in one gpm instead of worrying about all the gpms there are to run you should be worrying about cleaning up the ris you have your hands on just as if you halfran half of the pcs banks so if you halfrun half the ris in bank the pc will sooner or later feel queasy the monitoring consideration is that you should audit what you have your hands on dont run r3 on pc audit the pc with r3 that goes for every auditing skill we have i never sec check pc i audit the pc with sec checking i dont find goals on pc i audit pc with goals finding if you keep that frame of reference you will win all the way with routine 3 it is almost possible to audit the pc with scarcely somatic if you use everything you are doing at the moment you are doing it to clear the pc of what you have your hands on it will go something like this the first ri takes 2 12 hours the next thirty ris take half an hour apiece the next thirty ris take twenty minutes apiece the next thirty take fifteen minutes apiece the next bank takes you 45 minutes to get your first rl half an hour each for the next halfdozen fifteen minutes each for the next thirty etc etc this happens because you are building on gradient scale the thetans confidence and leaving nothing behind you to worry about this state of affairs is attainable if you follow some rules say you have spent two sessions trying to get the top oppterm to fire youve still got the whole bottom of the gpm and various points to cut in where the pc can get rocket reads by auditing the lower parts of the gpm you could unburden the case and then progress forward you should be aware that you can always go down in bank matter how hard you try to list upward your first interest is to get charge off if you get charge off the pc can confront more now he can find that missing top oppterm youve got countless locks which will fire when you first enter bank any part of the goal anything will fire because you are looking at the whole mass and it is so crosscharged that anything will fire that makes the top oppterm the hardest to find after you have taken some charge off all these weird combinations dont fire the more bank the more things will fire and the more restimulated the pc will be in life details on directive listing procedure some pcs will have to be taught the language if they dont understand the words in the pattern eventually they will get the wordshubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 april 1963 central orgs academies modernized training drills using permissive coaching much of the difficulty experienced in teaching the trs and getting students proficient in the trs is due to bad coaching this bulletin is issued to overcome this difficulty it is in fact an amendment of hco bulletin of april 17 1961 which as itself remains valid the essence of this bulletin is that the drills do not permit the coach to flunk student instead an exact patter is laid down for the coach and instructors should ensure that the coach keeps to the patter tr 0 has been subdivided into 4 parts one new drill is introducedthe coaches drill the trs are important because 1 the auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his trs 2 flubs in trs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit 3 if the trs are not well learned early in the hpahca bscnhcs courses the balance of the course will fail and instructors at upper levels will be teaching not their subjects but trs 4 almost all confusions on meter model sessions and sop goals stem directly from inability to do the trs 5 student who has not mastered his trs will not master anything further 6 sop goals will not function in the presence of bad trs the preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to tr flubs without arc breaks academies were tough on trs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften comm courses are not tea party these trs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training in academy and hgc and in the future should never be relaxed seven weeks on comm course until he does the trs perfectly lets the student receive at least one weeks training in the eight poor comm course in one week can wipe out the whole eight weeks number tr 0 revised 1961 and 1963 name confronting preclear commands none position student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apart about three feet student has an emeterpurpose to train student to confront preclear with auditing only or with nothing the whole idea is to get the student able to hold position three feet in front of preclear to be there and not do anything else but be there training stress have student and coach sit facing each other neither making any conversation or effort to be interesting have them sit and look at each other and say and do nothing for some hours student must not speak fidget giggle or be embarrassed or anaten it will be found the student tends to confront with body part rather than just confront or to use system of confronting rather than just be there the drill is misnamed if confront means to do something to the pc the whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of preclear without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self after student has become able to just sit there for two hours bull baiting can begin anything added to being there is queried by the coach with what happened twitches blinks sighs fidgets anything except just being there is promptly queried with the reason why if necessary tr 0 has been divided into four parts each part is drilled for about 15 minutes in turn and then begun over again and again tr 0 this is exactly as given above except that bull baiting is omitted whenever student speaks fidgets giggles is embarrassed or goes anaten coach says thats it what happened coach listens carefully to what student has to say acknowledges and says start in fact coach will do the foregoing whenever he sees any physical action or change however small manifested by the student it is also desirable from time to time that the coach says thats it how are you doing listens carefully to what student says acknowledges and then says start flunks invalidation or validation other than giving win from time to time as merited tr 0 b exactly as tr 0 with the addition that student is required by coach to answer the following questions which are given alternately what can you see about that you like what can you see about that you dont like coach acknowledges each answer without invalidation validation or evaluation coach asks what happened whenever there is any physical manifestation on the part of the student or whenever there is an overlong comm lag coach also asks from time to time how are you doing tr 0 c in this part bull baiting is introduced otherwise it is exactly as tr 0 patter as confronted subject the coach may say anything or do anything except leave the chair the students buttons can be found and tromped on hard any words not coaching words may receive response from the student if the student responds the coach is instantly coach see patter above instructors should have coaches let students have some wins coach does not mention these and then by gradient stress get the coaches to start in on the student to invite flunks this is bull baiting the student is queried each time he or she reacts matter how minutely to being baitedtr 0 d this drill has been designed to put the finishing touches to tr 0 it needs to be done very thoroughly and with plenty of interest on the part of the coach it is run as follows 1 coach says to student define good auditing attitude he accepts students definition 2 coach says show good auditing attitude 3 after few minutes coach asks the following questions did you show good auditing attitude b what did you do c what happened 4 actions 2 and 3 are repeated two or three times then start over again at 1 5 when the good auditing attitude is being done well substitute an interested attitude or professional attitude or an understanding attitude all these attitudes should be drilled thoroughly further coach should take any attitude the student presents eg if student uses in his definition the words its being there coach makes mental note to use it later example define being there attitude show being there attitude the whole of tr 0 should be taught roughroughrough and not left until the student can do it training is considered satisfactory at this level only if the student can be three feet in front of person without flinching concentrating or confronting with regardless of what the confronted person says or does history developed by l ron hubbard in washington in march 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be interesting revised by l ron hubbard april 1961 on finding that sop goals required for its success much higher level of technical skill than earlier processes revised 1963 by reg sharpe number tr 1 revised 1961 and 1963 name dear alice purpose to train the student to deliver command newly and in new unit of time to preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using via commands phrase with the he saids omitted is picked out of the book alice in wonderland and read to the coach position student and coach are seated facing each other comfortable distance apart student has an emeter training stress the command goes from the book to the student and as his own to the coach it must not go from book to coach it must sound natural not artificial diction and elocution have part in it loudness may have when student has delivered phrase coach asks student the following 1 did you own the phrase 2 did you deliver it in new unit of time 3 where did the communication start from4 where did the communication land if student is in difficulty or confused by the drill coach reads the purpose of the drill and the training stress and has student clear the purpose and the training stress b after short while the following is introduced coach tells student create the space of the coaching session by locating 4 points in front of you and four points behind you this is done on gradient scale until student is doing the drill comfortably coach just asks did you do that then above is reintroduced and the coach asking from time to time did you create the space if student has difficulty coach goes back to getting student to locate the four points in front and the four points behind this drill is passed only when the student can put across command naturally without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly history developed by l ron hubbard in london april 1956 to teach the communication formula to new students revised by l ron hubbard 1961 to increase auditing ability revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard number tr 2 revised 1961 and 1963 name acknowledgments purpose to teach student that an acknowledgment is method of controlling preclear communication and that an acknowledgment is full stop also that an acknowledgment lets pc know that he has answered an auditing command commands the coach reads lines from alice in wonderland omitting he saids and the student thoroughly acknowledges them position student and coach are seated facing each other at comfortable distance apart student with an emeter training stress to teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knows it was heard to ask student from time to time what was said to curb over and under acknowledgment to teach him that an acknowledgment is stop not beginning of new cycle of communication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on to teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgment across or can fail to stop pc with an acknowledgment or can take pcs head off with an acknowledgment patter the coach says start reads line and says after student has acknowledged 1 what did i say 2 did you understand it 3 did your acknowledgment let know i had originated something 4 did it end cycle 5 where did the acknowledgment start from 6 where did the acknowledgment land 7 did you own the space in questions 5 and 6 student must indicate as in tr 1 ask what happened as required in previous trs coach checks carefully are you really satisfied that you are giving goodacknowledgments he reads the purpose of the tr and the training stress for the student to check over history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach new students that an acknowledgment ends communication cycle and period of time that new command begins new period of time revised 1961 by l ron hubbard revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard number tr 3 revised 1961 and 1963 name duplicative question purpose to teach student to duplicate without variation an auditing question each time newly in its own unit of time not as blur with other questions and to acknowledge it to teach that one never asks second question until he has received an answer to the one asked commands do fish swim or do birds fly position student and coach seated comfortable distance apart student has an emeter training stress one question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before the student must learn to give and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time the student should not fail to get an answer to the question asked or fail to repeat the exact question coach instructs student to run the command do birds fly or do fish swim etc student is required to acknowledge in such way that the coach knows he has answered the command and if he doesnt answer the command to repeat the command letting the coach know it is repeat coach just answers the command to start patter is as follows s do birds fly c yes s good c did i answer the command s yes c did you feel that you had let know that i had answered the command s or yes c ok start again this patter is repeated over and over until student has certainty that he is doing the drill then coach starts giving commands which are not answers these communications must all be directed at the student ie something to do with the pcs attitude appearance private life real or imaginary example of patter s do birds fly c your breath stinks s ill repeat the question do birds fly c thats it did i answer the questions c did you let know i hadnt s by not acknowledging repeating the command c ok start and so on coach continues until student is easily doing the drill and with great certainty coach can use such originations always directly concerned with the student personally and if he finds button he continues until the student is tolerating it quite happily if student breaks up or becomes misemotional coach merely asks what happened flunks evaluation invalidation or validation ask what happened as required when the question is not answered the student must say gently ill repeat the auditing question and do so until he gets an answer anything except commands acknowledgment and as needed the repeat statement is queried unnecessary use of the repeat statement is queried poor command is queried poor acknowledgment is queried student misemotion or confusion is queried student failure to utter the next command without long comm lag is queried choppy or premature acknowledgment is queried lack of an acknowledgment or with distinct comm lag is queried start flunk good and thats it may not be used to fluster or trap the student any other statement under the sun may be the coach may try to leave his chair in this tr if he succeeds it is queried the coach should not use introverted statements such as i just had cognition coach divertive statements should all concern the student and should be designed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing the students job is to keep session going in spite of anything using only command the repeat statement or the acknowledgment the student may use his or her hands to prevent blow leaving of the coach if the student does anything else than the above it is queried by queried is meant coach asks student what happened history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions revised 1961 and 1963 by l ron hubbard the old tr had comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in model session and is longer needed at this level auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered this tr was redesigned to improve that frailty number tr 4 revised 1961 and 1963 name preclear originations purpose to teach student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination commands the student runs do fish swim or do birds fly on coach coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from prepared list given by instructor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach position student and coach sit facing each other at comfortable distance apart training stress the student is taught to hear originations and do three things 1 understand it 2 acknowledge it and 3 return preclear to session if the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension he corrects the coach into better handling patter all originations concern the coach his ideas reactions or difficulties none concern the auditor otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier trs the students patter is governed by 1 clarifying and understanding the origin 2 acknowledging the origin 3 giving the repeat statement ill repeat the auditing command and then giving it anything else is queried the auditor must be taught to prevent arc breaks and differentiate between vital problem that concerns the pc and mere effort to blow session tr 3 revised if the student does more than 1 understand 2 acknowledge 3 return pc to session he is in error coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on tr 3 students failure to differentiate between these by trying to handle them and remarks aimed only at the student is queried students failure to persist is always queried in any tr but here more so coach should not always read from list to originate and not always look at student when about to comment by originate is meant statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case by comment is meant statement or remark aimed only at student or room originations are handled comments are disregarded by the student tr 4 and antiq is what bothers auditors the most q aing is fault which causes arc breaks and therefore throws the pc out of session the reason is that when you q the pc is not permitted to let go of an origination and is therefore left with missed withhold q missed withholds arc breaks coach starts by asking student to define tr 4 if student doesnt know it then coach gives the definition as follows tr 4 is to hear an origination to understand it to acknowledge it and return pc to session similarly coach asks for definition of q which is double questioning changing because pc changed following pcs instruction coach then tells student to run the process do birds fly or do fish swim coach frequently introduces an origination when student has dealt with origination or has tried to deal with it coach asks searchingly the following questions 1 were you tonguetied startled thrown off session 2 did you hear origination 3 did you understand it 4 did you acknowledge it 5 did you return to session 6 did you double question 7 did you change because i had changed 8 did you follow my instruction 9 what did you do 10what happened question 10 can be asked randomly throughout the drill whenever coach sees or hears something that indicates student is in trouble of any sortcoach is permitted to lead student up the garden path for little while before asking the above question this drill needs to be done very thoroughly if coach notices that student is using method or pattern coach can add in the question are you using method or pattern in this drill the drill is continued over and over until student is doing it comfortably and happily history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out revised by l ron hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing arc breaks revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard coaches drill coach and student who is in this case the student coach seated as in the normal tr drills coach has the copy of the drill in front of him he tells student to coach tr whenever student departs from the script coach says thats it the correct question there should be_____ the correct action there should be_____ this is continued until student coach is thoroughly conversant with the script coach keeps student on the drill and at the end of each cycle asks student did you notice any physical changes on my part what were they did you ask what happened each time drill is continued with each tr in turn until student is administering all the trs efficiently interestedly and competently ask what happened as required history developed by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard in april 1963 at saint hill to teach students how to coach the trs training note it is better to go through these trs several times getting tougher each time than to hang up on one tr forever or to be so tough at start student goes into decline l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 may ad13 central orgs franchise the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 1 it has been so many years since engram running was familiar tool of the auditor that it is hard to know where to begin to teach this skill all over again actually millions of words have been written or spoken on the subject of running engrams however oddly enough there was not one condensed summary hco bulletin on the subject engram running developed was never then summated i will therefore attempt to remedy the matter engram running simplified recapitulation or summation of materials was ever done on engram running therefore while all lectures and books on it are true not one contains final survey of engram running including everything vital to this skill and the laws which govern it the material in books and tapes should be reviewed but the material in these hco bulletins should be learned thoroughly as it takes precedence over all earlier material why people have trouble running engrams i have gotten very impatient with the constant plea for rote set of commands to run engrams the need for such commands is testimony to the auditors lack of knowledge of the mechanics of the time track and the pcs behavior during an engram running session an auditor must know the basic laws and mechanics of the time track in order to run engrams there is rote procedure and never will be that will be successful on all cases in absence of knowledge of what time track is there is substitute for knowing what engrams are and what they do knowing that you can run engrams not knowing that there is nothing that will take the place of such knowledge you have to know the behavior of and data about engrams there is royal road that avoids such knowledge if you know all about engrams you can run them if you dont youll make mess regardless of the commands given for use therefore the essence of engram running is knowledge of the character and behavior of engrams this is not vast subject however these three things stand in the way of learning about engrams 1 engrams contain pain and unconsciousness fear of pain or inflicting pain causes the auditor not to confront the pcs engrams and unconsciousness is after all not knowing condition and 2 the auditor is so accustomed to projectionists reeling off movies and tv programs for him or her that the auditor tends to just sit while the action rolls forward acting like spectator not the projectionist 3 failure to handle time in incidentson 1 you can remedy this just by knowing about it and realizing it and surmounting it and on 2 you can remedy the attitude by realizing that the auditor not the pc or some installed movie projectionist is operating the pcs bank 3 is covered later take pocket movie projector and any bit of reel of film and wind it back and forth for while and youll see you are moving it then give command and move the film and youll have what youre doing as an auditor many drills can be developed using such equipment and 2 will be overcome 1 requires just understanding and the will to rise superior to it the time track the endless record called the time track complete with 52 perceptions of the pcs entire past is available to the auditor and his or her auditing commands the rules are the time track obeys the auditor the time track does not obey preclear early in auditing the time track is very accurate record of the pcs past very accurately timed very obedient to the auditor if motion picture film were 3d had 52 perceptions and could fully react upon the observer the time track could be called motion picture film it is at least 350000000000000 years long probably much longer with scene about every 125 of second definitions that part of the time track that is free of pain and misadventure is called simply the free track in that the pc doesnt freeze up on it any mental picture that is unknowingly created and part of the time track is called facsimile whether an engram secondary lock or pleasure moment any knowingly created mental picture that is not part of time track is called mock up any unknowingly created mental picture that appears to have been record of the physical universe but is in fact only an altered copy of the time track is called dubin those parts of the time track that contain moments of pain and unconsciousness are called engrams those parts of the time track which contain misemotion based on earlier engramic experience are called secondaries those parts of the time track which contain the first moment an earlier engram is restimulated are called keyins those parts of the time track which contain moments the pc associates with keyins are called locks series of similar engrams or of similar locks are called chains basic is the first incident engram lock overt act on any chain basic basic is the first engram on the whole time track incidents are not in piles or files they are simply part of the consecutive time trackby incident is meant the recording of an experience simple or complex related by the same subject location or people understood to take place in short and finite time period such as minutes or hours or days chain of incidents makes up whole adventure or activity related by the same subject general location or people understood to take place in long time period weeks months years or even billions or trillions of years an incident can be an engram secondary keyin or lock chain of incidents can therefore be chain of experiences which are engrams secondaries keyins and locks chain of incidents has only one basic its basic is the earliest engram received from or overt act committed against the subject location or beings which make it chain the influence of the time track shakespeare said all life was play he was right in so far as the time track is 3d 52 perception movie which is whole series of plays concerning the preclear but the influence of it upon the preclear removes it from the class of pretense and play it is not only very real it is what contains whatever it is that depresses the pc to what he is today its savageness relieved the preclear can recover and only then there is other valid workable road there are valences circuits and machinery in the reactive mind as well as reliable items and goals but these all have their place on the time track and are part of the time track the preclear as thetan is the effect of all this recorded experience almost all of it is unknown to him there are other influencing agencies for the preclear than the time track and present time and present time moment later is part of the time track the creation of the time track the preclear makes the time track as time rolls forward he does this as an obsessive create on subawareness level it is done by an involuntary intention not under the pcs awareness or control the road to clear by making the preclear take over the creating of the time track was long explored and proved completely valueless and chancy the road to clear by making the preclear leave the time track exteriorization lasts only for minutes hours or days and has proven valueless the road to clear proven over 13 years of intense research and vast numbers of auditing hours and cases lies only in an auditor handling the time track and removing from it by means governed by the auditors code the material both motivators and overts which recorded on it is out of the control of the pc and holds the pc at effect listing for goals and reliable items engram running prepchecking sec checking recall processes and assists all handle the time track successfully and are therefore the basis of all modern processing apparent faults in the time track there are faults in the recording of the time track there are only snarls caused by groupers and unavailability and lack of perception of the time tracka grouper is anything which pulls the time track into bunch at one or more points when the grouper is gone the time track is perceived to be straight unavailability is caused by the pcs inability to confront or bouncers and denyers bouncer throws the pc backward forward up or down from the track and so makes it apparently unavailable denyer obscures part of track by implying it is not there or elsewhere misdirector or should not be viewed groupers bouncers and denyers are material matter energy space and time in the form of effort force mass delusion etc or command phrases statements that group bounce or deny when grouper bouncer or denyer are enforced by both material and command phrases they become most effective making the time track unavailable to the pc unless the time track is made available it cannot be asised by the pc and so remains aberrative the time track is actual in that it is made of matter energy space and time as well as thought those who cannot confront mest think it is composed only of thought grouper can make pc fat and bouncer thin if the pc is chronically stuck in them or if the track is grouped or made unavailable through bad auditing the origin of the time track through great deal of study not entirely complete the following surmises can be made about the time track the physical universe and the pc the tendency of the physical universe is condensation and solidification at least this is the effect produced on the thetan continued dwelling in it without rehabilitation causes the thetan to become less reaching smaller and more solid thetan being static may become convinced he cannot duplicate matter energy space or time or certain intentions and so succumbs to the influence of this universe this influence in itself would be negligible unless recorded by the thetan stored and made reactive upon the thetan as time track and then maliciously used to trap the thetan recent researches i have done in the field of aesthetics tend to indicate that rhythm is the source of present time the thetan is carried along both by his own desire to have do or be and by having been overwhelmed in the distant past by continuous minute rhythm this is possible explanation of thetans continuous presence in present time present time then can be defined as response to the continuous rhythm of the physical universe resulting in hereness in nowness in response to this rhythm undoubtedly assisted by overts and implants and convictions of the need of recording the thetan began to respond to the physical universe in his creations and eventually obsessively created by means of restimulatable involuntary intentions the passing moments of the physical universe but only when he began to consider these pictures important could they be used to aberrate him these are only partly permanently created other moments of the past become recreated only when the thetans intention is directed to them on which these parts spontaneously appear the thetan not voluntarily creating them this forms the time track some parts of it then are permanently in state of creation and the majority of it becoming created when the thetans attention is directed to them the permanently created portions are those times of overwhelm and indecision which almost entirely submerged the thetans own will and awarenesssuch parts are found in implants and great stresses these parts are in permanent restimulation the mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause balance which does not respond to current time and remains timeless such phenomena as the overt actmotivator sequence the problem postulate counter postulate tend to hold certain portions of the time track in permanent creation and cause them to continue to exist in present time as unresolved masses energies spaces times and significances the intention of the physical universe and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends is to make thetan solid immobile and decisionless the fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid mobile or immobile at will and capable of decision this in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of trap the mechanism of the time track can then be said to be the primary action in making thetan solid immobile and decisionless for without record of the past accumulating and forming gradient of solidification of the thetan the entrapment potential of the physical universe would be negligible and the havingness which it offers might be quite therapeutic it probably requires more than just living in the physical universe to become aberrated the main method of causing aberration and entrapment is therefore found in actions which create or confuse the time track thetan has things beyond matter energy space and time which can deteriorate his power of choice his ability to keep two locations separate his belief in self and his ethical standards are independent of material things but these can be recorded in the time track as well and one sees them recover when longer influenced by the time track as the thetan himself makes his own time track even if under compulsion and commits his own overts even on provocation it can be said then that the thetan aberrates himself but he is assisted by mammoth betrayals and his necessity to combat them and he is guilty of aberrating his fellows it is doubtful if another type of being built the physical universe and still lurks within it to trap further but older beings already degraded have continuously been about to help newer beings to go downhill each thetan had his own home universe and these colliding or made to collide probably are the physical universe but of this origin and these intentions we are not at this time certain it is enough for us to resolve the problem of the aberrative nature of this universe and provide technology which assuages that aberration and keeps one abreast of it this is practical and we can already do it further insight into the problem will be further bonus and further data is already in view lrh drrd l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6305c16 shspec265 the time track some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 15may63 the time track and engram rum ing by chains bulletin i and hcob 8jun63 bulletin ii handling the time track one basic tenet has never changed you have never successfully audited anything but the time track there is nothing to audit but the time track there is grand key to the release of things but the time track locks valences machinery etc are all phenomena of the time track the time track is the continuous record of time of the individual from the first moment he began to experience on through until now an interrupted threed fiftytwo perception movie things happen to that movie it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons eg his inability to confront the fact that it can get grouped etc all that auditing ever does is to straighten out the time track make it available and asis it the track gets collapsed and looped by chains which consist of related incidents until you get solid wad of experience which is unavailable to the pc and thus has command value over him there are only two classes of things involved in the time track 1 the mechanical things the matter energy space and time that is the time track 2 the significance of it people who cant confront the track at all eg psychologists and psychiatrists conceive it to consist of thought only the time track is not imaginary and shouldnt be treated as imaginary it has mass in the physical universe brick wall is the product of various people and forces where it all come from neednt be investigated for practical purposes the time track has remained undiscovered and undescribed by mental health practitioners because they have lacked the confront to get past certain mechanisms that make it unavailable nothing is holy to scientologist there is nothing that should not be investigated nothing is unavailable although psychiatrists think so they dont know that the time track is real they have fallen for the first trick that the time track employs to make itself unavailable the idea that there is nothing in the mind but thought that is trick of debarment the consideration is anybody who says that he is looking at brick building in the mind isnt looking as brick building and it must therefore be imaginary so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion so therefore he must be slightly mad insane people must be mad because they are seeing things says the psychiatrist then he compounds the insanity by saying you are not seeing these things he makes the time track less available the direction of sanity lies in the capability of confronting the time track and the pt environment for any individual existence consists of the physical universe pt and everything that is in it at this exact precise pt instant and the time track which consists of everything that has been and that is the total isness as far as this thing called reality is concerned archeology studies suppositional reality but it is not outlawed for that reason you can take some ruin and say what has it been but that is not the isness it is suppositional reality subject to error however archeology is not outlawed as science for that reason furthermore all futures are suppositional if they are suppositional enough they come true lrh used to tell fortunes by looking at persons facsimiles and mocking something up the future is always enforceable with altitude and authority this is just trick method of making postulate stick it is still suppositional reality there is isness and there is suppositional isness the time track often gives people the feeling that the was can return it can be quite solid when there is extra awareness jammed into particular momentyou also have to look at borderline phenomenon creating someone says he will build building and he does his saying he will nearly puts it there but creation is suppositional reality until it is actually created at which point it becomes an isness and remains an isness for whatever period of time it endures part of the thought of reality is the adjudication of whether it is good bad or whatever thought is not separate from reality it is woven solidly into reality and is part of the isness of reality one can establish the isness of reality at time by asking about it some people cant even confront that here lrh recounts an anecdote about the cia or the police following students and pcs around for weeks as they ran union station an outdoor objective process command was you invent way of destroying that indicated person see hcob 6feb58 hgc clear procedure outline of february 6 the process was done to take over destructive automaticities they were trying to find out what the scientologists were doing without ever taking the trouble to ask it never occurred to them to establish an isness they couldnt even view the thought in the isness this is even worse than only being able to view the thought in the isness so there is descending gradient of ability to confront an isness 1 able to confront or view an isness 2 able to confront or view only the thought in an isness 3 unable to confront or view the thought in an isness or even to ask about it opinions are there are thoughts and opinions abroad in the world that we may not agree with but which are part of the isness wrought iron fence is thought woven into the physical universe as to some degree is all else when someone creates something in the physical universe part of its isness is the expression of his thought thought is expressed by the formation of the mest so thought is to some degree part of the physical universe likewise the time track is composed of matter energy space time and thought so both the physical universe and the time track are composed of mest and thought added onto these are many complexities such as suppositional isnesses befores and afters purposes and aesthetics the degree that an individual is on suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingness how much suppositional isness is added to actual isness critic says the artist should have the should have measures the amount of nonconfront the critic is doing this is also true of pcs who typically say well it looks as if there might have been there could possibly have been wreck of some kind here at one time or another maybe i think it was an airplane it turns out that it was building the pc is very suppositional he doesnt give the isness of it someone who criticizes anything is doing supposition about how something should be they are not confronting the isness the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of isness confronted by the pc and that is how sane and capable he gets it is measured directly by the amount of isness the individual is able to confront in view of the fact that he pcs track is in terrible condition there are two factors at work 1 the pcs own feelings of incompetence 2 the unrecognizableness of the track these combine to give you cats breakfast an extreme form of this problem is seen in the pc who supposes all sorts of horrible things who thinks it is so uncomfortable that he doesnt even show up for session thetans state is not really pinned mechanically by anything he is not made less of thetan or more by mest but when you surround him as intimately as the time track does with tremendous amount of suppositional unconfrontability he is enforced into state of lowmorale where he doesnt think that he can do anything and the isness then is that he cant the pc supposes that the time track is not confrontable that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it that he wont be able to handle it etc all the time hes supposing hes not confronting he knows what will happen he has had all these unconfrontable experiences and his attention is still fixed on something and he knows he mustnt take his attention off of it he also knows that if he doesnt take his attention off of it he will go to pieces then he has forgotten that he has his attention on it he feels degraded by all this in addition the state of his track is horrible it is scrambled shredded snarled up the thetan in the middle of it all is convinced that if he moves or looks at any of it something horrible will happen all of it has command value over him yet at the same time it is valuable to him it has become his havingness its all the old tin cans hes got its all his knowingness hes like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed he cant even find out his own name rank and serial number without it that dependency and the why of it is also in the record department the great savants who have remained ignorant of the time track have just q and ad with its unconsciousness by remaining unconscious of it and unwilling to approach its pain the time track is unavailable to the being so the savant supposes that it is unavailable to him but the auditor mustnt do this q and the only real tragedy of life i suppose is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unobtainable the fact that thetan cant remember at first what happened in an engram doesnt mean that he was unconscious at the time if absolute unconsciousness and unknowingness were possible we would probably be all right dont underestimate the violence that is there on the time track and dont force the pc into it but if you get the earliest moment of the earliest gpm it runs like hot butter even though theres as much charge on it as there is on later one the difficulty you hit with the later one is that it has the charge of all the earlier ones in addition to its own so it is far harder for the pc to confront it is important not to give the pc loses early on you should know the mechanics of engrams and the time track be sure your commands mean what you intend them to mean through the incident does not mean through the incident to the end and if you just say move to the end the pc wont go through the incident the bank follows the you think you are there so you are there mechanism of the thetan so the difference between to and through is very important use to in scouting and through in running engrams and dont mix them up lrh found that some pcs cant run gpms until they have run an early engram also if you can run the overt engram that relates to these gpms as an engram fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves and they will run like hot butter here is datum that particular implanting outfit was located down towards the center of this galaxy and was founded 52863010 654079 years ago it was destroyed 38932690862933 years ago by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet it was wildcat activity they used to drag magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy let them follow lines of force and come over system and then send planes in with speakers the place would be caved in for thousands of years as result of radioactive clouds you are not likely to find any implant earlier then or even near 52 trillion years ago or closer to pt than 359 trillion years ago any other kind of implant is different kind or dramatization of it someplace else the helatrobus implanter had the dream of everyone in the universe being good they used the ice cube see history of man pp 645 this

here is the new routine 3 model session as outlined in hco bulletin may 13 ad13 all other model sessions are canceled herewith this form is to be used in all auditing in the future session preliminaries all auditing sessions have the following preliminaries done in this order l seat the pc and adjust his or her chair 2 clear the auditing room with is it all right to audit in this room not metered 3 can squeeze squeeze the cans please and note that pc registers by the squeeze on the meter and note the level of the pcs havingness dont run hav here 4 put in r factor by telling pc briefly what you are going to do in the session start of session 5 is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the sessionrunning ow if it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttons here is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds has anything been suppressed is there anything you have been careful of is there anything you have failed to reveal has anything been invalidated has anything been suggested has any mistake been made is there anything you have been anxious about has anything been protested has anything been decided has anything been asserted in using the first three buttons suppressed careful of and failed to reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds use since the last time you were audited has withhold been missed on you since the last time you were audited is there anything someone failed to find out about yousince the last time you were audited has someone nearly found out something about you any of the above versions may be used they are always run repetitively they can also be used without the time limiter eg is there anything someone failed to find out about you body of session 8 now go into the body of the session end body of session 9 is it all right with you if we end off now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do so end of smooth out session 10 smooth out any roughness in the session if there has been any favouring suppress failed to reveal protest decide overts assert using prefix in this session goals gains 11 have you made any part of your goals for this session have you made any other gains in this session that you would care to mention havingness 12 after adjusting the meter please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not all right the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response ending session 13 is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session 14 is it all right with you if i end this session now 15 here it is end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast but it is all necessary the random rudiment here is what happenedsession mid ruds are simply protest assert and decide ri rudiments are suppress and invalidate arc break handling is in accordance with hco bulletin of march 14 1963 dont continue session until you find out why the arc break lrhjwrd l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6305c23 shspec268 state of ot there isnt government on earth that has the right to permit our survival as an organization cognition the only reason you have present time problem is that you dont have enough time the helatrobus implants you can call them the heaven implants had big effect on thetans with their cold energy or frozen energy the helatrobus government had gold crosses on their aircraft one could find out who they were they couldnt find out who was behind and actually doing the implanting the implants were based on cold energy with significance placed in it the implants tended to talk the helatrobites had figured out something that looked to everyone else like natural phenomenon the magellanic radioactive clouds with which they surrounded planetary systems the stars in galaxy tend to be collected towards the center of the galactic wheel when you look at the milky way you are looking towards the center of this galaxy in the opposite direction you see other galaxies we are awfully far out from the center of this galaxy our sun is rim star galaxies are condensations of radioactive clouds into suns and planets planets sometimes shatter to become belt of asteroids suns range from dead suns to red yellow white and blue suns as they get hotter and brighter bodies could exist that are suited for conditions on other planets some science fiction writers have very good memories but have fallen victim to the implants that reverse time such that the past equals the future the boogie man is standard mechanism for keeping people from going places and looking at things confronting for instance the phoenicians spread seamonster rumors to prevent competition with england in the tin trade scare stories about terrible beings are quite standard they are used to keep people out of things that others want to keep hidden most planets run by animal forms have classifiable types of forms similar from system to system depending on the environment someone built for jupitertype conditions would look perhaps eskimoish you could become very disheartened and caved in about this universe and see it as trap until you recognize that the thetan is helped all the time by mest it gives him location consecutive scenery and persistent structure of matter this universe has solved lot of problems for the thetan when he gets too far down on the tone scale therefore he gets on stuck oneway help flow with respect to the physical universe the thetan doesnt help the universe you could run him on how could you help the physical universe and he would feel better about it degraded beings come to the conclusion because of the above situation that the trouble with this universe is that it has free beings in it they feel that the universe is too good for free beings so every now and then someone decides to make it evil if thetan is that degraded what he sees as wrong with the physical universe is that it has free beings in it so he tries to make them unfree the origin of the physical universe in the first place is probably collision of home universes the problem of why everybody stays in single present time was one of the more fantastic problems the why is response to vibration there is one underlying vibration that the universe your bank and you are vibrating at the only variation in that vibration relates to the progression of time therefore you can move someone on the time track one overwhelmed others with vibration very minute vibration the size of the vibration of light particle the time track is formed by an involuntary intention in studying the power of an operating thetan lrh has had pauses in thinking although intellectually such power is conceivable recently lrh has been exploring the actual potentialities of an ot the problem of an ot may be analogous to the problem that one encounters if one tries to pick up the cellophane wrapper from pack of cigarettes without denting it at all you could only do this if youcould estimate or measure the exact force necessary to pick it up without denting it this is probably the basic problem of an ot and it may give him his time track the power of thetan is such that if he were to pick up steel cylinder capable of resisting pressure of several thousand pounds per square inch it would be like you with the cellophane wrapper the problem is how to touch something without crushing it the thetan is being careful in handling mest he seeks another method of handling he feels that he is quite destructive people who have lost their ot abilities and strength will try and did try on the time track to convince free thetans that they were dangerous people who havent that level of action would believe that free thetan was destructive and would trap him with the idea by causing him to use new trick doing things by intention instead of directly we have always thought of intention as primary but it is secondary the postulate and action through postulates is secondary to action through energy you should be able to do both but it is more natural for thetan to just pick something up than to pick it up by an intention or postulate that it be up it is great downgrade intention is unnatural it would be natural to just move things however this is hard to do if the thetan is afraid that he will destroy the thing in the process instead he develops the safer method of operation by intention alone he can do this but it enforces great restraint on him it is like putting yourself on terrific withhold of self the thetan trains intention to become involuntary it is not imaginary it is like involuntary nerves or muscles that work automatically mest is fragile recently in new york or melbourne when they started running the goal to forget in coaudit the emeter got fused the pc melted the lines some involuntary intention was triggered in him and zap unless you understand this as too great power within the ethical limits of the individual you wont understand the problems of an ot thetan is stronger than the fragility with which he is surrounded and he compensates by reducing his power this was the wrong solution he developed an automatic action eg the phone rings he doesnt touch it it springs into the air and he talks the postulate does things without his having to intend them there is difference between an involuntary intention to act and an involuntary intention to duplicate and an involuntary intention to create and thats where the time track comes from this is an hypothesis to account for the time track then someone gives the thetan things for the automatic machinery to mock up which would be bad for the thetan or someone jams the machinery and makes the thetan fight his own automatic intention the next thing you know he has messedup time track he goes solid he picks up meat body the withhold begins with the steel cellophane rational solution would have been not to make everything so damned fragile withholding all the time has all sorts of ill effects including putting engrams on your track these matters have lot to do with scientology organizations seeing the character of an ot we see that these matters could be upsetting in various directions we have some responsibilities to start things out right if we are going to make ots early on conceiving that free thetans were very dangerous and should be shot down people like the helatrobites started laying in implants and weakening people working with great industry before these implants planets were suddenly surrounded with radioactive cloud masses from the center of the galaxy waves of black and grey clouds would sweep over the planet engulfing it in radioactivity the dark horse nebula in orion is one huge radioactive cloud like this this could go on for million years universes have lines of force vectors like spokes which were used by the helatrobus group to move magellanic clouds they just set them loose one found out that it was being done by someone it was all explained as natural phenomenon because of these theories one thought to look for anyone doing itat least hundred years after system had been engulfed helatrobus would send capturing troops in ships with little orangecolored electronic bombs that would talk speech was frozen into electronic capsules the clouds would talk hark hark look out etc it sounded like fun house its unbelievability made detection of its origin all but impossible it confused the thetans all to hell for some reason the symbol of airplanes goes through this this symbol goes earlier to implants at 80 trillion years ago where aircraft symbolized needing machine to get you off planet so for some years after years of radioactivity the clouds were there with speech in them containing contradictory commands like come here cant come go mustnt go it was doubletalk the helatrobites put traction beams on thetans eventually after many incidents of resisting it the thetan got sucked up into small capsules via bubbles and thence into spaceships all of this assaulted his credulity he couldnt understand what was going on this had never happened before then in one to six months the helatrobites would get him into an implant area fix him on post wobbled him around ran him through an implant of goals on little monowheel pole trap with the effigy of body on it he had body at that time eventually he would get home then he would get picked up again and put through more series of implants probably the helatrobites knew who had been implanted already because we find implants in pairs of two and four never three or one once this started the planet would be in turmoil and revolt and things got very insane the heaven implants then were preceded by tremendous periods of unrest with radioactive clouds orange bombs warfare wild anarchy etc it was chaos rather like twentieth century earth it was hitlerlike stuff it got more and more crazy and out of control they were very worried thetans before the clouds came there would be occasional thetatrapping etc but things were generally pretty peaceful it was only when the free thetans were threatened that they became restive and ungovernable free thetans in themselves are easy to put up with in pi radioactive fallout is key restimulator of this whole scene but how does partlyfreed thetan feel when he sees the old situation seeming to repeat itself with all the symbols from the track it makes him mad at fallout government wars etc earth is in for period of chaos which scientology can render less extreme than it would otherwise be but we cant entirely eliminate the chaos since some earlier chaos will be restimulated but the planet is doomed if we dont operate lrhs attention is therefore on organizational concerns how do we move through such period the scientology organization is set up to handle this period of chaos as long as thetans have rage in their hearts about the situation their power is curtailed this is safety factor if we just let chaos happen we will slow our forward progress sooner or later there will be the rest of the galaxy to deal with earth has already blasted off into meat body space opera which may not be appreciated by someone out there earth people get hysterical when they think that there is an invasion from space so it represents real threat not something people think is unreal or impossible orson wells radio broadcast of the war of the worlds resulted in ecuador in the radio station that broadcast it being torn down by enraged ecuadorians they knew about space opera even though they didnt have science fiction to educate them with things as they are several factors confront us if we handle things as they are we may be able to have things as we would

of arc breaks lucky is the pc whose auditor has understood this hco bulletin and lucky is the auditor may his own case run well i have just narrowed the reason for arc breaks in auditing actions down to only one source rule all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge rule to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge charge can be bypassed by 1 going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic example looking for the pcs first automobile accident finding the fifth instead and trying to run the fifth accident as the first accident which it isnt the by passed charge here is the first accident and all succeeding accidents up to the one selected by the auditor as the first one or the one to run to greater or lesser degree depending on the amount the earlier material was restimulated the pc will then arc break or feel low or in low morale one can run later incident on chain briefly but only to unburden earlier incidents and the pc must know this 2 unknowingly ignoring the possibility of more basic or earlier incident of the same nature as that being run after the pc has been restimulated on it or bluntly refusing to admit the existence of or let the pc at an earlier incident 3 cleanly missing gpm as one between two goals run consecutively in the belief they are consecutive 4 missing an earlier gpm and settling down to the assertion there are earlier ones 5 cleanly missing one or more ris not even calling them 6 failing to discharge an ri and going on past it 7 accidentally missing whole block of ris as in resuming session and not noticing pc has skipped commoner than youd think 8 accepting wrong goal missing the right one similarly worded 9 accepting wrong ri not getting the plot ri to fire 10 misinterpreting or not understanding data given to you by the pc andor acting on wrong data11 misinforming the pc as to what has or has not fired and discharged 12 locating the wrong bypassed charge and saying it is the source of the arc break 13 failing to follow the cycle of communication in auditing these and any other way charge can be restimulated and left prior to where the auditor is working can cause an arc break charge left after later nearer pt than where the auditor is working hardly ever causes an arc break the burden of skilled auditing then is to get ris and gpms and incidents discharged as close to basic first incident as possible and always be prowling for something earlier in contradiction of this is that any gpm fairly well discharged by rrs unburdens the case arc break or arc breaks and any incident partially discharged lets one go earlier the pc never knows why the arc break he may think he does and disclaim about it but the moment the actual reason is spotted the real missed area the arc break ceases if you know youve missed goal or ri just saying so prevents any arc break an arc breaky pc can always be told what has been missed and will almost always settle down at once example pc refuses to come to session auditor on telephone says theres more basic incident or ri or gpm pc comes to session the auditor who is most likely to develop arc breaks in the pc will have greater difficulty putting this hco bulletin into practice perhaps i can help this such an auditor qs and as by action responses not acknowledgments after understanding action can be on an automaticity in the session so this hco bulletin may erroneously be interpreted to mean if the pc arc breaks do something earlier if this were true then the only thing left to run would be basic basicwithout the pc being unburdened enough to have any reality on it drill and many drills can be compiled on this would be to have lineal picture of time track the coach indicates late incident on it with pointer and says pc arc break the student must give competent and informative statement that indicates the earlier charge without pointing since you cant point inside the reactive bank of pc with pointer drawn time tracks showing gpm series of engrams along free track series of gpms all plotted against time would serve the purpose of the drill and give the student graphic arc break experience the trick is to find and indicate the right bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it it is not do that heals the arc break but pointing toward the correct charge rule finding and indicating an incorrect bypassed charge will not turn off an arc break an automaticity as covered later in this hco bulletin is rendered discharged by indicating the area of charge onlythis is an elementary example pc says i suppressed that auditor says on this incident has anything been suppressed pc arc breaks auditor indicates charge by saying im sorry moment ago i didnt acknowledge your suppression arc break ceases why because the source of its charge that triggered an automaticity of above the pcs tone was itself discharged by being indicated example auditor asks for joburg overt pc gives it auditor consults meter at once asking question again which is protested giving new read pc arc breaks auditor says i did not acknowledge the overt you gave i acknowledge it arc break ceases example auditor asks for ri 173 on first series line plot pc arc breaks giving various reasons why such as auditors personality auditor asks meter have i missed an item on you gets read says to pc ive missed an item arc break ceases whether the missing item is looked for or not is immaterial to this hco bulletin which concerns handling arc breaks if an auditor always does in response to an arc break such as instantly looking for specific earlier items that auditor has missed the point of this hco bulletin and will just pile up more arc breaks not heal them dont be driven by arc breaks into unwise actions as all you have to do is find and indicate the missing charge that was bypassed that is what takes care of an arc break not taking the pcs orders if the arc break does not cease the wrong bypassed charge has been indicated the sweetest running pc in the world can be turned into tiger by an auditor who always qs and as never indicates charge and goes on with the session plan some qs and as would be source of laughter if not so deadly here is q and artist at work and an arc breaky pc will soon develop and this auditor will soon cease to audit because its so unpleasant example auditor have you ever shot anyone pc yes i shot dog auditor what about dog pc it was my mothers auditor what about your mother pc i hated her auditor what about hating people pc i think im aberrated auditor have you worried about being aberrated pc why did the pc arc break because the charge has never been permitted to come off shooting dog his mother hating people and being aberrated and thats enough bypassed charge to blow house apart this pc will become as this keeps up unauditable by reason of charge missed in sessions and his resulting session dramatizations as overts find and indicate the actual charge bypassed sometimes you cant miss it it has just happened sometimes you need simple meter question since what you are doing is obvious sometimes you need dress parade assessment from list but however you get it find out the exact bypassed charge and then indicate it to the pc the violence of an arc break makes it seem incredible that simple statement will vanquish it but it will you dont have to run another earlier engram to cure an arc break you merely have to say it is thereand if it is the bypassed charge that arc break will vanish example pc i think theres an incident earlier that turned off my emotion auditor wed better run this one again pc arc breaks auditor consults meter is there an earlierincident that turns off emotion gets read say what you just said is correct thank you there is an earlier incident that turns off emotion thank you now lets run this one few more times pcs arc break ends at once dont go around shivering in terror of arc breaks thats like the modern systems of government which tear up their whole constitution and honor just because some hired demonstrators howl soon they wont be government at all they bend to every arc break arc breaks are inevitable they will happen the crime is not to have pc arc break the crime is not to be able to handle one fast when it happens you must be able to handle an arc break since they are inevitable which means you must know the mechanism of one as given here how to find bypassed charge and how to smoothly indicate it to leave pc in an arc break more than two or three minutes is just inept and be welldrilled enough that your own responding rancor and surprise doesnt take charge and youll have pleasant auditing arc break processes we had several arc break processes these were repetitive processes the most effective arc break process is locating and indicating the bypassed charge that really cures arc breaks repetitive command arc break process based on this discovery i just made would possibly be what communication was not received expanding this we get new arc straight wire what attitude was not received what reality was not perceived seen what communication was not acknowledged this process is not used to handle session arc breaks but only to clean up auditing or the track if the pc arc breaks dont use process find the missed charge indeed this process may be more valuable than at first believed as one could put in auditing on the front of each one and straighten up sessions and perhaps you could even run an engram with it the last has not been tested in auditing the three questions was wonderful on test 2 div ta in each 10 mins on very high ta case arc break straight wire of 1958 laid open implants like band saw which is what attracted my attention to it again many routine prefixes such as in an organization or on engrams or on past lives could be used to clear up past attitudes and overts we need some repetitive processes today cases too queasy to face the past cases messed up by offbeat processes cases who have overts on auditing or scientology or orgs cases pinned by session overts the bmrs run inside an engram tend to make it go mushy and class i auditors are without an effective repetitive process on modern technology this is it repetitive process even though not looking for basic implies that the process will be run until the charge is off and therefore creates arc breaks unless left unflat therefore the process is safe if flattenedrudiments nothing is more detested by some pcs than rudiments on session or gpm or ri why the same rule about arc breaks applies the charge has been bypassed how consider the session is later than the incident naturally ask for the suppress in the session you miss the suppress in the incident earlier by far result pc arc breaks thats all there is to arc breaks caused by session bmrs or mid ruds example scrambleable eggs wont rr auditor says on this item has anything been suppressed pc eventually gets anxious or arc breaks why suppress read yes but where was the suppress it was in the incident containing the ri the pc looked for it in the session and thereby missed the suppress charge in the incident of the ri which being bypassed charge unseen by pc and auditor caused the arc break remedy get the suppress in the incident not the session the ri rrs also the more ruds you use the more you restimulate when doing routine 3 because the suppress in the incident is not basic on suppress and if you clean just one clean even to test bang there goes the charge being missed on suppress and bang bang arc break lightly auditor lightly q and arc breaks q and causes arc breaks by bypassing charge how the pc says something the auditor does not understand or acknowledge therefore the pcs utterance becomes bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release as the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it the original utterances charge is built up and up finally the pc will start issuing orders in frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge this is the source of pc orders to the auditor understand and acknowledge the pc take the pcs data dont pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data when the pc goes to where the auditor commands dont say are you there now as his going is thereby not acknowledged and the going built up charge always assume the pc obeyed until its obvious the pc did not echo metering the pc says you missed suppress its and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for suppress that leaves the pcs offering an undischarged charge never ask the meter after pc volunteers button example youve declared suppress clean pc gives you another suppress take it and dont ask suppress again thats echo metering if pc puts his own ruds in dont at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in that makes all his offerings missed charge echo metering is miserable auditingmissed withholds needless to say this matter of bypassed charge is the explanation for the violence of missed withholds the auditor is capable of finding out so the pcs undisclosed overts react solely because the auditor doesnt ask for them this doesnt wipe out all technology about missed withholds it explains why they exist and how they operate indication is almost as good as disclosure have you ever had somebody calm down when you said youve got missed withholds well its crude but it has worked better is some auditor failed to locate some charge on your case or we must have missed your goal but only meter assessment and statement of what has been found would operate short of actually pulling the missed withholds apparent bad morale there is one other factor on bad morale that should be remarked we know so much we often discard what we know in scientology but way back in book one and several times after notably 880 we had tone scale up which the pc climbed as he was processed we meet up with this again running the helatrobus implants as whole track fact the pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale he or she comes up to degradation up to apathy and it often feels horrible and unlike an arc break and the sad effect is not cured except by more of the same processing people complain of their emotionlessness well they come up long ways before they even reach emotion then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad they even come up to feeling pain and all that is gain they dont confuse this too much with arc breaks but they blame processing and then one day they realize that they can feel apathy and its win amongst wins before it was just wood and this has an important bearing on arc breaks everything on the whole know to mystery scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect these are all on automatic therefore the pc in an arc break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident now fully on automatic the pcs anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc but the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor none is more amazed at himself or herself than the pc in the grip of the arc break emotion the pc is helpless rag being shaken furiously by the emotions he or she felt in the incidenttherefore never discipline or q and with an arc broken pc dont join hands with his bank to punish him just find the bypassed charge and the automaticity will shut off at once to everyones relief running routine 3 is only unpleasant and unhappy to the degree that the auditor fails to quickly spot and announce bypassed charge if he fails to understand this and recognize this his pcs will arc break as surely as ball falls when dropped if an auditor has arc breaky pcs only one thing is basically wrongthat auditor consistently misses charge or consistently fails to anticipate missed charge one doesnt always have to run the earliest but one had better not ignore the consequences of not pointing it out one doesnt have to discharge every erg from an ri always but one had better not hide the fact from the pc the adroit auditor is one who can spot earlier charge or anticipate arc breaks by seeing where charge is getting missed and taking it up with the pc that auditors pcs have only the discomfort of the gradually rising tone and not the mess of arc breaks it is possible to run almost wholly without arc breaks and possible to stop them in seconds all by following the rule dont bypass charge unknown to the pc lrh jwrd l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6305c25 shspec269 handling arc breaks some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 27may63 cause of arc breaks lrh has discovered the common denominator to all arc breaks bypassed charge an arc break is defined as the pcs transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor charge that has been restimulated in session may provide background booster for session upset when you drag the pcs attention to the auditor the charge that has been deliberately restimulated in the session doesnt get asised and the pc arc breaks thus something that outside the session could not cause an arc break may and will cause an arc break if it happens in session the arc break is not caused by social faux pas it is caused by the sudden shift of attention the unleashing of charge that was held back by the fact that the pcs attention was on it as long as the pc has his attention on the bank he is cause over its charge the moment his attention is flicked off of it he is the effect of that charge and the pc then dramatizes it any tone level or knowtomystery scale level that is higher than the chronic tone of the pc being higher than the pc is cause over the pc and is therefore dramatized it should be noted that apathy is high tone for pc the tone level contained in the incident is what the pc unintentionally dramatizes he could dramatize anything eg boredom effort eg breaking chair or manic and the auditor is good target the pc himself is helpless to restrain himself from dramatizing he will be surprised at himself amazed to react that way etc an arc break comes about whenever charge is bypassed that then puts the pc at its effect point the pc dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed this charge is unknown to him and can therefore affect him adversely the remedy is to locate and indicate the exact bypassed charge at which point the arc break ceases that is the mechanics of it you dont have to go into do and run the arc break and run all engrams connected with it etc you only have to indicate bypassed charge the remedy is not continuous auditing you know now how to turn off someones anger by saying that someone missed his withholds that often works but when it doesnt it is because you indicated the wrong bypassed charge you could assess number of possibilities eg missed gpm missed goal missed ri he will stop being arc broken when you get the right one in session only few charges can be missed goals ris engrams refutation of reality rejection of affinity more basic incident failure to acknowledge that pretty well covers it these things occur in life also rage is an automaticity in such delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip neurosis is actually hard to maintain that explains the simple effectiveness of correctly locating and indicating bypassed charge the psychiatrists failure comes about from two sources 1 lack of technology 2 an interest in insanitys being very hard to solve arc breaks are not hard to handle if you know the cause and handling of them dont back off or fear them just develop the skill to find and indicate the right bpc or you will get loses in auditing and eventually give up temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor 0r just get out of the auditing chair so i want you to get confidence that you can find the bpc and then by indicating it to the pc realize the tool that is in your power that pc arc breaks is guarantee that the pc is in poor case shape or difficult to get gains on just indicating the correct bpc turns off the arc break you may find that the charge was bypassed two sessions ago or the arc break doesnt get handled because you cant find what it was until somewhat later then when you indicate itthe pc calms down but you shouldnt let an arc break last more than two or three minutes because arc breaks multiply on steep curve governments these days are run by riot because they are so scared of arc breaks englands matteroffact handling of the ban the bomb movement is an exception to this rule like an auditor who doesnt get thrown by or governed by arc breaks governments have also been run by fear of assassination this is just dramatization of the helatrobus implants you as an auditor could be governed by arc breaks if you cant handle them you are never governed by that which you can handle with ease so learn to handle arc breaks until arc breaks become just another phenomenon like runny nose your attitude on arc breaks must never be one whereby you are driven by the arc break because you will be driven then into not getting the items clean into taking the pcs orders which are the direct result of dramatizations the orders are the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of the bpc dont for instance as registrar get reasonable in the face of dramatization hunt and peck around for bypassed charge the rage is an automaticity psychosis is very tenuous and easy to break number of arc breaks is not correlated with the success of auditing arc breaks multiply as the square of time the greater the facility with which you handle arc breaks the less you are governed by them pcs who are continually arc broken in session can be run on the threeway arc break process this process however is not for use every time the pc arc breaks for instance for an auditor messed up with arc breaky pcs you could run the following in auditing what attitude has been refused in auditing what reality has been rejected in auditing what communication has not been acknowledged this works better than midruds it is the successor to arc break straightwire which in 1958 could go into engrams and even implants it works because what it does is directly to locate and indicate bpc if you let the arc broken pc control you you will be taking his orders because he is dramatizing not only the emotion but also the significance contained in the bpc this is dangerous to the pc so you should 1 learn to handle arc breaks 2 be good enough as an auditor never to bypass charge you can bypass charge by not finding any you press on with the session in the teeth of pc who is dramatizing apathy then the pc gives you wrong goal and you take it thereby bypassing more charge the harder you are driven by arc breaks into doing bad job the more charge you bypass it wont run well bypassed charge is always prior to the charge on what you are doing so the arc break is blessing in disguise since it tells you that there is more charge which you have bypassed it is more accurate than the meter in this case arc breaks are cumulative in their effects you do still have to peel enough charge from later incidents to get to the earlier ones but the pc wont arc break if you indicate to the pc as an rfactor what you are doing if you tell the pc that there is basic on the chain he wont arc break even if you dont run the basic because you have indicated the earlier charge indicating that there is earlier charge also makes it possible for the pc to run the later stuffthe pc can arc break in the rudiments because he has outruds in the incident that is just bpc and you can indicate it so when you chicken out of cleaning an rl because the pc is protesty and arc broken you have set yourself up for more arc breaks on subsequent items dont buy an ri that doesnt rocket read full dial if it wont there is bpc to clean up bypass the charge keep it secret you will get an arc break dont bypass charge6305c29 shspec270 programming cases part 1 the subject of programming cases is almost as old as the discovery of the engram programming is the overall action taken to resolve the case regulated by the state of the case and the necessary steps if guy stubs his toe and you decide to give him an assist that is programming the assist is auditing the two are not the same these are the things to be adjudicated in programming 1 time how much is available 2 what will the case accept stand for or tolerate as auditing 3 what will the case progress on as auditing 4 order of actions this comes back to time 1 5 when you will start auditing you cant leave out any of these adjudications you need good grip on programming before you can actually make clears even if you have technique that works on everybody because programming is easy to do lrh has never put it out as itself so it has been missed as factor in getting all cases to run well programming is easy unless you dont do it programming is based on some fundamental principles it is based on 1 the behavior of the time track 2 the abilities and disabilities of the pc related to the time track the time track is the worlds longest movie in 3d included in the movie are things which apparently destroy some of the movie so between say reel 16 and reel 80 everything is missing with improper programming you will never find that section and you can audit reel 80 and reel 16 and everything beyond reel 80 and though the pc gets lots of auditing nothing happens to his case because what is wrong with him is what is between reel 16 and reel 80 this film has total effect on the pc he lives it as you run it you can only be effective if you run the parts that are personal to the pc that is running the reality of the pc there are things you can run that are unreal to him but that nevertheless affect him eg the helatrobus implant but dont exceed the pcs reality by too much the program is not monitored by what the pc has reality on before you audit him it is monitored by what the pc can obtain reality on during auditing after all you want to increase his reality dont omit pc change and volition in your calculations and remember his reality might exceed yours if you dont try to increase the pcs reality you neglect his capacity to change it does the pc good to audit him farther than where he is at yesterdays mental sciences made this mistake continually they treated patients only from and on the viewpoint of their own reality then denied the patients capacity to change programming is based 100 on the following 1 the capability of the auditor 2 the capability of the pc to receive auditing3 the amount of time available 4 the maximum result to be obtained given these limits in terms of increase of r c the increase in affinity can be seen in the persons change in position on the knowtomystery scale of which the tone scale is the middle guts person has personal reality except for possible intellectual reality on those tones that lie above his position on this scale he only has reality on those tones that lie below his chronic tone his chronic tone can be the tone of the body plus thetan or chronic tone as thetan the body plus thetan tone can be considerably higher than his tone as thetan the chronic tone of the body plus thetan combination can be at 40 while the level of the thetan is at unconscious any level above the chronic tone is susceptible of being dramatized dramatization is thetan or thetan plus body performing evolutions not under the thetan or thetan plus bodys control nonvolitional actions old mental studies fixated on these and believed that there is nothing else but there are volitional actions they lie below the chronic tone of the individual on the tone scale there are two chronic tones that of the thetan and that of the thetan plus body combination the body plus thetan can dramatize any tone above the chronic tone but most likely it will be the half tone above the chronic tone the above is of arc therefore increasing affinity is making the pc less susceptible to dramatization and gives the pc reality on more tones that are now below him you have added levels on which he has reality and subtracted levels which he may dramatize previously as certain tone was above him he was the effect of it now being above that tone he has reality on it and he is longer the effect of it the body plus thetan tone is an apparent tone and it never goes above 40 so you could have pc flying along at 40 enthusiastic and the next day you will get the thetan alone and he drops from 40 to zilch he has come up to degradation as thetan he feels awful for apparent reason because you are now seeing the thetan who has come up above unconsciousness to degradation as thetan for the first time this is case gain in terms of affinity to go somewhere by route one you have to get the thetans chronic tone level upscale enough to do it you can measure persons reality by measuring significance since reality is matter energy space time and significance the five parts of universe psychological testing measures reality on significances you can test reality by solution of problems if persons conversation is full of cant understand and he gets very reasonable about unreasonable things and he can assume viewpoint but his own while he doesnt really have one his reality level is low he may demonstrate this by the fact that as the pc comes to others viewpoints he begins to recognize his own overts and to suffer on that account that is big reality increase and occurs because understanding more and being more able to take other viewpoints the pc becomes more responsible he cognites cognition is actually the process of changing reality of significance it is necessary to case gain cognition more understanding case gain pc saying that the session was wonderful has not necessarily had any case gain he may have been beaten into propitiation but if he says you know my mom must have had quite hard time that is cognition if the pc is able to assume new viewpoint in this case that of his mother he has had case gain getting the pcs goals and gains at the end of the session is little psychometric test measure of case gain communication there is obvious gain when the pc is more willing to talk to people but his increased perception of walls etc isnt really changed reality so much as it is increased communication reach and withdraw willingness to receive etc is what is involved here even if the case is delusory and sees the room as full of polar bears it would be case gain at the end of the session if he could see the polar bears better if you are operating from the platform of the reality that the room is not full of polar bears and that you must therefore get rid of the polar bears youwill have dropped the pcs communication this was one of freuds errors he cant communicate with you but he can communicate with these polar bears if he could communicate with the polar bears well enough he wouldnt have to communicate with them and they would depart thats the way to get rid of polar bears psychiatrists try to convince the patient that he doesnt have any bugs crawling on him this is the same as saying there must only be this one reality and unless we can hold the status quo of this reality we have lost this has been the criterion in all mental activities for the many trillenia and an auditor may be holding onto it with both fists and not realize it this consideration is that our only gain would be from the platform of where we are if we could continue the alteration to making things more like they are here and now we we would get case gain this consideration is way to clobber people by holding them on the time track these are the technical data underlying programming auditing is done by 1 unburdening basics 2 discovering what basics there are 3 disentangling them so as to erase basics this includes cchs it includes all processing discovery of basics end eradication of basics is done by discovering what basics can be found before the basic that disentangles the basic that you are trying to untangle basic will almost blow by inspection unless there is more basic one holding it in however basic on chain contains elements that are not basic to the basic say you have the basic on the chain of some somatic it is basic on the chain you are running but it has something in it that comes from more basic chain on another subject when this happens you can slip the basic out from under the earlier basics by finding the basics of remaining elements in the basic of the original chain frequently this can be done by dating by the time you are through you have practically cleared somebody if you can keep track of what you are doing you will be very successful if not the whole track collapses and the pc goes under the first action you should undertake on case is the most advanced action that can be undertaken in your estimation always enter case more boldly than you think is wise and you will usually be right if you dont you will never find the ceiling at which the pc can operate if you get away with it you are all set you have saved time that is what you are doing with the helatrobus implants if the pc cant manage it pull back so all there is to auditing is unburdening finding chain finding the basic on the chain and taking apart the basic i dont care what process you are using running chain back is unburdening it its taking off charge so that you can lay your paws on basic you are after the first gpm and if the pc cant recall what he had for breakfast this morning you have to unburden the case how long should you continue unburdening the case until you can get your hands on an implant not one second longer that you run the charge off of at least one dialwide disintegrating rocket read per item if and when you get stuck you probably have too early an implant one that is too close to basic remember you are trying to unburden pick up the last incident in the second chain if you know what it is and run that one with fast pass or lets use straightwire to give him some locks or find overts on this lets see if we can chase him earlier and find the first it is all unburdening you see lets run the threecommand process for awhile we are just trying to get our hands on an implant so we can run some charge off of it and find an earlier implant so that we can get to the basic implant you have to go later and unburden the basic implant because you are asking the pc to walk through wall of fire between pt and basic there is wall of fire you cant push the pc through the wall of fire you have to get him through to get the pc through it you have to put some fire out on gradient that is done by programming6305c30 shspec271 programming cases part ii some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 8jun63 the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track in particular p3 of this bulletin contains scale of case states that is relevant to this tape there is gradient scale of cases it is not complete there are interim points that are not shown on this scale the lowest level on the scale level 8 is that of total unconsciousness the next one up level 7 is awareness of own evaluations this is where the mental sciences are at psychiatrist listens to someone chatter and becomes aware of his own evaluation of the person as crazy what he perceives is his own evaluation of what he perceives or of what is there to be perceived its an incapability of observation because its an observation of own evaluation you see it most flagrantly in the fields of arts and aesthetics the less that is known of subject the more it has authority or evaluation as its sole reality or adjudication this is where most antiscientology wogs lie i had an uncle who said you shouldnt mess with the mind that uncle is perceiving not scientology but his evaluation or anothers evaluation of it the next level up level 6 is dubin of dubin here person has dubin of his own nightmares that is all he sees it is someone forming his opinion on newspaper articles actually that is dubin the readers of dubin the reporters of dubin the sources this level is below but approaching unconsciousness as thetan manifestation the body plus thetan can go lower scale than thetan whose unconsciousness lies just above this level of dubin of dubin body plus thetan can apparently stay conscious longer than the thetan can as far as awareness of being thetan is concerned lot of boiloff occurs above level 6 level 5 is dubin of the time track the facsimile does exist but what the person or pc sees is dubin of the facsimile that is there second facsimile above this at level 4 is nonperception where the pc gets blackness invisibility small rockets etc it is nonvisibility what used to be called the black v is at this level above this at level 3 is spotty partialperceptic glimpses of the time track with only some visio sonic or tactile etc then at level 2 there is totally visible time track with interruptions there is blackness in this track unless the blackness was really there in an incident fifty or sixty goal clear would be in this condition he could monitor the time track the way one monitors the physical environment above this at level 1 there is time track the lowest two levels are gross lower scale harmonics of level 1 the above is scale of perception of the time track it is what makes cases different auditing time estimates should be based on pcs location on this scale you could probably use the physical universe to test where pc is on this scale for instance you could have him look at wall with picture on it close his eyes and tell you what he gets the result will be about half tone or tone higher than where he really is eg if he cant see it what wall he is at level 4 above though actually he will tend towards level 5 in running track there is tendency to slip one level the only levels that are fairly serious are levels 7 and 8 because it is very hard to get into communication with those cases but establishing communication at one level moves the person up to the next level and so on up to the top ultimately dont expect this to be done swiftly and accurately howevermost of the cases that you will be dealing with will have invisibility and sporadic track if you consider the amount of auditing necessary to audit sporadic track case as one unit of time invisibility would take two units dubin of track would take four units of time etc ie the time required to get given auditing result doubles at each level as you go down the scale for instance if it took one hour to audit out one engram on pc with sporadic track it would take thirtytwo hours to audit out an engram in an unconscious case actually that is optimistic at both ends the case result that we are interested in is ot we already have the fait accompli of clearing so we are going beyond it any effort to get an ultimate result in processing leads to ot that upgrades the number of hours to ot to say 500 hours to ot for the sporadic track case insanity neurosis or ability to respond to communication play part in that scale of cases because those conditions are found only at one level of the scale the own evaluations level level 7 any objective test of case state that has human observer adjudicating pass or fail works out poorly where the observer is himself at case level 7 have you ever been flunked on tr1 by coach that couldnt coach the concepts of insanity or neurosis are contained as goals in the helatrobus implants therefore they cannot be used to evaluate state of case wisdom based on the helatrobus implants is nuts other goals from that implant include to die to be sick to move to escape to get it ie to get sickness etc etc almost any one of these goals has been the source of learned treatises dramatizing them to explain all of mans ills eg treatises on escapism the history of man contains references to few implants it remains valid though and the engrams described in it did exist they just got collected together during implants what causes different people to be at different positions on this scale it could be the length of time that they have spent in this universe this implies universe that accumulated from the successive collisions of home universes with it the mest universe picks up different home universes at different points on the track older thetans are in worse shape state of case then would be monitored by number of overts different statuses of thetans at the time of entry etc the why doesnt need to be known to solve the situation how these thetans came to be there in this universe can be stated easily charge this is quantitative matter you pump charge into case when the eighteen prepcheck buttons go out ie inval eval etc if there were thought involved you could probably shortcircuit it all but there is also thought which includes volition as the universe pumps charge into thetan he pumps it into other thetans and other things then he inhibits himself from doing so the result is overts and withholds the charge gets encysted as composite picture of the number of things done to the being held in place by the number of things done by the being this produces x amount of charge on the case that in the absence of auditing just keeps on growing the thetan gets lot more or little more in given lifetime but it is always additive that is what makes the universe trap if charge didnt keep accumulating the universe would be therapeutic instead of aberrative you can have an attitude about the charge too the attitude doesnt alter the charge but it can affect how you feel about it in view of the fact that an ot has fantastic power it is funny that charge would bother him until we figure out the basic overt of the thetan any overt thetan commits is also mixed up with the energy thetan is emitting all of his overts have particles connected with them so the only way to really get him is to hit him with particles because that is the path of his overts so most implants are mainly connected with particle flows of various types people therefore have different amounts of charge one person has quantity of charge another person has quantity b etc the more charge person has the more difficult it is to release it that is why it takes so much longer to get results on the unconscious case this depends to degree on whether the case condition is chronic ie lasting more than lifetimeor acute temporary one lifetime or less eg the pc may be spastic now as an acute condition relating to his body the question is whether he is always going to be that way matter what body he picks up chronic if condition is chronic it will add lot of time to auditing you could put deaf man on meter and ask him whether he was deaf last lifetime and the one before that if he was you have deaf thetan on your hands not deaf body and it will take time to fix charge is what causes case to be the way it is just because thetan plus body is low on the state of case scale the thetan itself is not necessarily low on that scale environmental factors can also make someone look downscale when they are not lrh relates an anecdote of time when he audited girl who was acting very nutty and brought her through in short space of time you have to estimate this to program someones case what you are going to program is the persons case so you have to estimate the case to determine how to get the charge off the case case is programmed in relation to the amount of charge on the case that is what determines how you are going to take the charge off the case since auditing requires the cooperation of the being you have to estimate his cooperativeness his ability etc this does affect the ease of auditing and the speed of auditing sample program the case dubs in track charge can be run off we get dialwide rocket reads on helatrobus implants if the pc can run it run it it is dicey because the case can easily go to smithereens it is better to pull overts on this lifetime and run any stretch of track on which the pc has reality be very sure that the case has withholds from the auditor especially thislifetime ones muzzle the auditing dont force this pc run rocket reading implants as long as they run easily when things get difficult fall back swiftly to patching up roughedup track return to an arctype process if the going gets too rough on ris running ris is dangerous that would be very extreme and daring programming for this case it is quick but dicey the safe way is using straightwire havingness withholds etc an alternate approach is if you got goal run all the charge off the goal never look for earlier goals when you have found one dont try pushing the case to get all the charge off of an implant take case with sporadic track you can run it pretty hard you can move around on the track from one gpm to another without messing things up much this level of case level 3 could even stand leaving goals without running them he may arc break but you can do it the case can be pushed hard the invisibility case level 4 can be pushed bit but not as hard as the sporadic track case with the dubin case level 5 you need lots of track repair ow running havingness you must readily cut and run if implants get rough with the dubin of dubin case dont let him near implants this isnt common case level 6 use straightwire and arc break processes run the case lightly for wins every session you are running the case too steep if you are not getting session wins unless this case is aware of having regular wins in session the cases reality is not coming up the aware of own evaluations case level 7 is suited only for havingness and cchs room processes contacting pt processes this case cant detect an overt as such he has responsibility he will tell things to you but not as overts to get daring with this case run straightwire with the unconscious case level 8 establish communication animal processing is the same sort of thing establish comm get the animal to reach always be little optimistic in estimating where someone is on the scale then program to get as much charge off as you can with the pc winning how much charge is being gotten off is measured by the ta and needle action charge is important because its what restimulateswhen he tries to outflow and prevents his outflow its what educates him not to reach in getting off charge processing lets him reach and do total selfdeterminism is only possible at the highest level given above level 1 there there are automaticities time track charge on the case the result is unlimited reachhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 june ad13 central orgs franchise the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track although finding and curtailing the development of the time track at genus is not improbable the ability of the preclear to attain it early on is questionable without reducing the charge on the existing track therefore any system which reduces the charged condition of the time track without reducing but increasing the awareness and decisionability of the preclear is valid processing any system which seeks to handle the charge but reduces the preclears awareness and decisionability is not valid processing but is degrading according to early axioms the single source of aberration is time therefore any system which further confuses or overwhelms the preclears sense of time will not be beneficial thus the first task of the student of engram running is to master the handling of time on the preclears time track it must be handled without question uncertainty or confusion failing to handle the time in the pcs time track with confidence certainty and without error will result in grouping or denying the time track to the pc the prime source of arc break in engram running sessions is bypassing charge by time mishandling by the auditor as subhead under this taking and trying to run incidents which are not basic on chain constitute an error in time and react on the pc like bypassed ris or gpms an arc breakless session requires gentle accurate time scouting the selection of the earliest timed incident available and the accurate time handling of the incident as it is run there are only few reasons why some cannot run engrams on pcs these are 1 q and with the pain and unconsciousness of incidents 2 failing to handle the time track of the pc for the pc 3 failure to understand and handle time 2 and 3 are much the same however there are three ways to move time track about by significance the moment something was considered b by location the moment the pc was located somewhere c by time alone the date or years before an event or years ago you will see all three have time in common the moment when you thought _____ the moment you were on the cliff______ two years before you put your foot on the bottom step of the scaffold are all dependent on time each designates an instant on the time track of which there can be mistake by either auditor or pc the whole handling of the time track can be done by any one of these three methods significance location time therefore all projectionist work is done by the time of significance the time of location or time alonethe track responds those auditors who have trouble cannot grasp the totality and accuracy and speed of that response the idiotic and wonderful precision of the time track defeats the sloppy and careless they wonder if it went they question the pcs being there they fumble about until they destroy their command over the time track go to 47983678283736 years 2 months 4 days 1 hour and six minutes ago well clear statement of

more than 40000 less than 40000 get it the first read dont go on peering myopically at the meter asking the same question the rest of the session accurate bold rapid those are the watchwords of dating and time track handling in moving time track about move only the track dont mix it and also move the pc you can say move to you dont have to say but you can the somatic strip will move to but never say you will move to and this also applies to present time the pc wont come to present time hes here but the time track will move to the date of present time unless the pc is really stuck in getting pc to present time unimportant in modern engram running say move to date month and year of pt in scouting you always use to move to_____ in running an engram or whatever you always use through move through the incident_____ if an auditor hasnt ruddy clue about the time track and its composition he or she wont ever be able to run engrams so obviously the first thing to teach and have passed in engram running is time track composition when the auditor learns that he or she will be able to run engrams if the auditor does not know the subject of the time track well then he or she cant be taught to run engrams for rote commands that cover all cases can exist you couldnt teach the handling of motion picture projector by rote commands if the operator had never imagined the existence of film an auditor sitting there thinking the pc is doing this or that and being in general fuddle about it will soon have film all over the floor and wrapped about his ears his plea for rote command will just tangle up more film so long as he doesnt know it is film and that he not the preclear is handling it if an auditor can learn this he will then be able to learn to run those small parts of the time track called engrams if an auditor cant run pc through some pleasant time track flawlessly he or she sure cant run pc through the living lightning parts of that track called engrams an auditor who cannot handle the time track smoothly can scarcely call himself an auditor as thats all there is to audit besides postulates matter what process you are using matter what process you invent and even if you tried what is laughingly called biochemical approach to the mind theres only time track for the bios to affect theres thetan theres time track the thetan gets caught in the time track the job of the auditor is to free the thetan by digging him out of his time track so if you cant handle what youre digging thetan out of youre going to have an awful lot of landslides and lot of auditing loses for both you and preclears invent games devices charts and training aids galore and teach with them and youll have auditors who can handle the time track and run engrams charge and the time track charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track when this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track this is the state of case scale all levels given are major levels minor levels exist between themlevel 1 track charge level 2 full visible time track some charge level 3 sporadic visibility of track some heavily charged areas level 4 invisible track very heavily charged areas black or invisible field exist level 5 dubin some areas of track so heavily charged pc is below consciousness in them level 6 dubin of dubin many areas of track so heavily charged the dubin is submerged level 7 only aware of own track too heavily charged evaluations to be viewed at all level 8 unaware pc dull often in coma on this new scale the very good easy to run cases are at level 3 skilled engram running can handle down to level 4 engram running is useless from level 4 down level 4 is questionable level 1 is of course an ot level 2 is the clearest clear anybody ever heard of level 3 can run engrams level 4 can run early track engrams if the running is skilled level 4 includes the black v case level 5 has to be run on general arc processes level 6 has to be run carefully on special arc processes with lots of havingness level 7 responds to the cchs level 8 responds only to reach and withdraw cchs predianetic and prescientology mental studies were observations from level 7 which considered levels 5 and 6 and 8 the only states of case and oddly enough overlooked level 7 entirely all states of case were considered either neurotic or insane with sanity either slightly glimpsed or decried in actuality on some portion of every time track in every case you will find each of the levels except 1 momentarily expressed the above scale is devoted to chronic case level and is useful in programming case but any case for brief moments or longer will hit these levels in being processed this is the temporary case level found only in sessions on chronically higher level cases when they go through tough bit thus engram running can be seen to be limited to higher level cases other processing notably modern arc processes moves the case up to engram running now what makes these levels of case it is entirely charge the more heavily charged the case the lower it falls on the above scale it is charge that prevents the pc from confronting the time track and submerges the time track from view charge is stored energy or stored or recreatable potentials of energy the emeter registers charge very high or low tone arm sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge the chronic meter of case is an index of chronic charge the fluctuations of meter during session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pcs time trackmore valuably the meter registers released charge you can see it blowing on the meter the disintegrating rr the blowing down of the ta the heavy falls the loosening needle all show charge being released the meter registers charge found and then charge released it registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight by dn by climbing ta or ta going far below the clear read then as this cleans up the charge is seen to blow charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to charge up in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc the whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing when prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown we get arc breaks the state of case the chronic level as given on the above scale is the totality of charge on the case level i has charge on it level 8 is total charge the day to day condition of case its temper reaction to things brightness depends upon two factors the totality of charge on the case and b the amount of charge in restimulation thus case being processed varies in tone by the totality of charge remaining on the case b the amount of charge in restimulation and c the amount of charge blown by processing charge is held in place by the basic on chain when only later than basic incidents are run charge can be restimulated and then bottled up again with very small amount blown this is known as grinding out an incident an engram is getting run but as it is not basic on chain adequate amount of charge is being released later than basic incidents are run either to uncover more basic earlier incidents or b to clean up the chain after basic has been found and erased full erasure of incidents later than basic is possible but charge can be removed from them providing they are not ground out but only run lightly time or two and then an earlier incident on the chain found and similarly run when the basic is found it is erased by many passes over it basic is the only one which can be run many times the later the incident is the further from basic the more lightly it is run there is difference in the technology required to run basic or later incident it is only the number of times through that differs basic is run through many times somewhat later engram is run through couple of times an engram very late on the chain is gone through once otherwise all engrams whether basic or not are run exactly the same engrams are run to release charge from case charge is not released to cure the body or to cure anything physical and the meter cures nothing charge is released entirely to return to thetan his causation over the time track to restore his power of choice and to free him of his most intimate trap his own time track you cannot have decent honest or capable beings as long as they are trapped and overwhelmed while this philosophy may be contrary to the intentions of slavemaster or degrader it is nevertheless demonstrably true the universe is not itself trap capable only of degradation but beings exist who beaten and overwhelmed themselves can utilize this universe to degrade others the mission of engram running is to free the charge which has accumulated in being and so restore that being to appreciated life all cases sooner or later have to be run on engrams matter what else has to be done for it is in engrams that the bulk of the charge on the time track lies and it is therefore those parts of the time track called engrams which overwhelm the thetan these contain pain and unconsciousness and are therefore the record of moments when thetan was most at effect and least at cause in these moments then the thetan is least able to confront or to be causative the engram also contains moments when it was necessary to have moved and most degrading to have held position in space and the engram contains the heaviest arc break with thetans environment and other beingsand all these things add up to charge an impulse to withdraw from that which cant be withdrawn from or to approach that which cant be approached and this like two pole battery generates current this constantly generated current is chronic charge the principal actions are when the attention of the thetan is directed broadly in the direction of such track record the current increases b when the attention is more closely but not forcefully and accurately directed the current is discharged c when the basic on the chain is found and erased that which composes the poles themselves is erased and later incidents eased for further generation is possible by that chain and it becomes incapable of producing further charge to be restimulated the above are the actions which occur during auditing if these actions do not occur despite auditing then there is case betterment so it is the auditors responsibility to make sure they do occur as the time track is created by an involuntary response of the thetan it is and exists as real thing composed of space matter energy time and significance on level 8 case the time track is completely submerged by charge even down to total unawareness of thought itself at level 7 awareness of the track is confined by extant charge to opinions about it at level 6 charge on the track is such that pictures of pictures of the track are gratuitously furnished causing delusive copies of inaccurate copies of the track at level 5 charge is sufficient to cause only inaccurate copies of the track to be viewable at level 4 charge is sufficient to obscure the track at level 3 charge is sufficient to wipe out portions of the track at level 2 there is only enough charge to maintain the existence of the track at level 1 there is charge and track to create it all charge from level 1 and up into higher states that is generated is knowingly generated by the thetan whose ability to hold locations in space and poles apart results in charge as needful this would degenerate again as he put such matters on automatic or began once more to make time track but these actions alone are not capable of aberrating thetan until he encounters further violent degradation and entrapment in the form of implants aberration itself must be calculated to occur the existence of time track only makes it possible for it to occur and be retained thus thetans first real mistake is to consider his own pictures and their recorded events important and his second mistake is in not obliterating entrapment activities in such way as not to become entrapped or aberrated in doing so all of which can be done and should be engram running is step necessary to get at the more fundamental causes of time track and handle them so it is skill which must be done and done well lrh dr jh l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6306c11 shspec272 engram chain running i finally found out why you cant run engrams i found out youve been trying to run engrams and you never run engrams you run chains of engrams this is the way i ran engrams in 1949 this got crossed up with repetitive processing flatten the process became flatten the engram when it should have been flatten the chain you flatten the chain by getting the basic engrams never exist all by themselves there is always chain an engram is only part of chain of similar incidents which in turn is part of time track you are essentially running time track you never handle an engram all by itself because it is too closely related to the rest of the track to be treated that way if you are skilled auditor you can quickly pick up bpc when the pc arc breaks indicate it and have the arc break disappear until you can do this you will have rough sessions in engram running the bpc is always the earlier incident on the engram chain charge is able to make the pc feel worse or better depending on whether it gets restimulated and encysted or blows you can let the pc learn more by entering lot of engrams and not finding basic the result is that the pc knows more but feels worse because you havent erased basic on the chain running chain of engrams is not the same as finding out about lot of incidents every time you run an engram you open up valve into the next earlier engram letting its charge get restimulated and partially leak into the one you are running if you continue to run the later engram it gets sticky ta ceases and it gets solid and will eventually collapse on the pc the bpc from the earlier engram causes the pc to arc break moving back to the earlier one blows some of the charge charge always flows later from its source not earlier we can only find the earlier engram because the later one was run as we go back on the chain each incident seems to be the earliest incident when it is actually just the earliest available incident if two engrams or any two pictures collapse the cause is bpc and the pc will very shortly arc break the converse is also true if the pc has bpc and is arc breaky you have two pictures collapsed outofvalenceness thats over there is also problem of bpc if an earlier engram is tapped it will bleed charge into the one you are running the somatic will strengthen but this phenomenon wont cause outofvalenceness an outofvalenceness is caused by an earlier portion of the same engram that you are working on that hasnt been seen it is assisted by charge bleeding from an earlier incident you could even run dubin case and get him earlier than the dubin however it is safer to use straightwire or mest processes suppose you are running an engram where the pc hit his head and when the pc goes through the incident the part where he actually hits his head gets skipped this indicates that the engram is part of chain of hit head so we work our way back through earlier incidents as he gets back to basic he gets full perceptics when we get to basic we run it over and over and his somatic blows if we came back up through the chain you could send the pc through each engram on the chain and now he would get the somatic each time the only way to flatten an engram is to flatten chain of engrams chains of overts follow the same principle as was done in sec checking this involved the withhold system used in prepchecking old style see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill and pp 208 209 above these also go much earlier than this life chains of overts include overt engrams it doesnt matter which you run because the overtmotivator sequence is an installed mechanism it is very old it is not as deeply laid in as obsessive create but it is equally implanted and engramic either overt chains or motivator chains can be run they rarely entwine sometimes the pc will jump chains from motivator to overt when that happens you should follow it down to the basic overt but you should then also pick up and complete the motivator chainrunning engrams is very simple here is how lrh would do it get crude date eg 89 trillion years ago get the pc to return to this incident ask him what he is looking at ask how long is this incident get the duration by meter get the pc to move on through the incident to the end there will be long pause the pc says i did ask him what it is all about the pc tells you ask for an earlier beginning get when it was send the pc to the earlier beginning then through the incident the pc goes through the incident and tells you about it pc has somatic lrh dates with the meter an earlier incident with the same somatic he sends the pc through that incident you go earlier date it etc if you dont complete the chain in one session and the pc doesnt get the picture run few commands of since the last time i audited you is there anything you were unwilling to duplicate run this to clean needle the picture will now be on dont harass the pc to find all the unknowns in the incident it is not necessary to do this when you have had rough session try since the day before that session occurred what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate alternate these commands if the pc cant run engrams it is because he is at the wrong place on the scale of case levels to be able to confront it even dubin case can run earlier than the dubin but it is dangerous engram running is important because you wont make ots without it all the fancy stuff was developed to handle cases that were too heavily charged to run real track the least common denominator of the case scale is noduplicate which is right in the middle of the communication formula the swan song of this universe is that that which you are unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic an arc break is an unwillingness to duplicate if you show students bad tvd they will flub the first five minutes of their next session because they were unwilling to duplicate the bad tvd and therefore it went on automatic in their next session this is what happens when you show bad example you could clean up earlier bad auditing by running since few days before the bad auditing what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate it will clean up resistance to duplication can be caved in one can become what one resists or the effect of what one resists persons ability to duplicate is what determines his ability to run engrams because the engram itself is duplication of the actual event the pc duplicates the event but if the picture he is running is an altered copy of the original it is dubin all engrams have some dubin in them and develop new material you can get some surprising changes one is particularly unwilling to duplicate dangerous things so one then gets lots of them the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obsessively duplicating everything the trouble with this strategy is that his duplication goes on total automatic some people have very heavy engrams indeed over which they have control these engrams are very inaccurate they stub their toe and have picture of being run over by truck that is all they run if anything since there are very incredible things on the track anyway such as the helatrobus implants it would be very inaccurate and dangerous to determine whether or not pc can run engrams by looking for factualness for instance basic on prenatals is an incident from the helatrobus implant in which the thetan on pole is tumbled through series of tubes all curled up one way to see if guy can run engrams is to try him out if it is go you can get out the arc triangle in hurry better test is simple duplication for instance you can call off series of numbers 3 6 2 9 7 to person and ask him what you said if the pc didnt duplicate you you can forget about running engrams or you can go by the chart of attitudes or any test of duplication but you shouldnt go by the material he runs you can use an arc process to improve someones reality all sorts of other processes will also do this the duplication process see p 414 below also works well cchs are effective when rightly used to show the pc that it is safe to duplicate if the case cannot run engrams and if you are running them correctly engram running is probably too steep gradient for the pcthe reason these data on engrams is important is that the helatrobus implants are long chain of engrams each one with basic and they tend to bunch the whole track on some cases you can only run six gpms before the rocket read shuts off and at this point you have to start running engrams when do you go earlier whenever the pc recognizes that there is something earlier however he states it he may say so directly or he may say something that shows that he is looking for something earlier if the pc sees something earlier you go earlier never ignore this if you ignore the indication that an earlier incident is available the one you are running will get harder to run besides you risk an arc break charge is registered on the emeter by needle and ta motion you must get ta action or you are just restimulating the case without blowing anything there is absolute basic on engram chains when you get to basic on chain there may be portions of it that themselves have earlier basics go ahead and run those out too there is only one basic basic it contains those impulses which eventually became aberration there are two things you can do with dating 1 relieve charge 2 identify something if you do total dating it goes down to the second you get the exact number of years plus days minutes seconds ago get the date accurately and the incident gets placed right where it should be on the track thus relieving charge dating also contains identification you can use rough dates for this purpose eg 89 billion or 450 million as long as you dont have bunch of incidents close together in row blocking out an incident has these steps 1 get an approximate date 2 move the time track to that date 3 ask the pc what is there accept whatever he gives you in every case 4 find its duration fairly accurately if it is days get the number 5 move the pc through it not to the end 6 then establish what was there 7 move the pc to the beginning and send him through again dont vary the routine and dont q and with the pcs unknownness if the pc keeps saying im stuck forget about holders and denyers he has just gotten in over his head bail him out and revert to lighter processes always suspect that there is something bit earlier ask for it blocking it out is done by going through it once after that the pc may be expected to tell you if there is something earlier generally run the pc through the incident twice once through is plenty if it is gummy having to go through an incident more than twice is suspect dont try to keep getting more out of it it is ok to keep running an incident as long as we are getting motion on the meter but dont strain to get more perceptics out of the incident more will turn up as you go earlier you can keep running an engram as long as the pc is interested in it and finding out more but the instant he says there may be something earlier go earlier or you willstick him in the later incident if you dont go for earlier incidents you blunt the pcs ability to go earlier and stick him where he is but dont force him earlier if he is starting to bounce up to pt let him and run arc processes basic isnt generally the more powerful incident it is just the first incident it seems so unimportant to the pc yet later incidents built up on it bigger and bigger basic is the shorter lighter incident theoretically you could run back to basicbasic if you found and erased this the pc would then have pictures and track if pc seems to be trying to escape running engrams by going earlier he is over his head and needs more preparation if you get the pc fully interiorized into the engram say by putting his attention on large object in the incident he will get it all fully charged up in 3d this is not what you want you will never get him out of the universe that you are packing around him6306c12 shspec273 arc straightwire arc straightwire is the oldest broadnature repetitive process it is possibly the first repetitive process the arc triangle was originated in july 1950 in elizabeth nj it was expanded in september or november of 1950 at the hubbard dianetic research foundation in angeles it was an important tool for understanding the mind it is best described in notes on the lectures see pp 916 the arc triangle is the most fundamental statement of significance although it also embraces mest when prime postulate impinges on mest it becomes involved with arc the mest can be in the physical universe or in the time track affinity is so much itself and so relative that we get into difficulties trying to interpret it in an auditing command affinity embraces everything from the knowtomystery scale it is feeling for or feeling with or lack of those it has connotations of feeling about it is not enough to say emotional response sympathy and empathy come into it it is very broad and new concept if you will substitute the knowtomystery scale for affinity and use the words emotion and misemotion pcs will respond to it the emotions scale being just part of the knowtomystery scale is included in affinity the word affinity is really inadequate to embrace the whole concept because the concept has not been expressed in any language how many words can be used in command to express the concept of affinity lots everything on the knowtomystery scale can be used including the whole tone scale we find the pc chronically situated at one of these levels and that is the level to which he will respond in processing reality could pertain to significance alone as in his reality is poor or to actual chunks of matter reality is normally considered to consist of considerations about something or someone on up to the more solid concepts of matter energy space and time in clearing this word you will have less trouble than in clearing affinity unless the pc is really in thought but if you bad to vary it you would have harder task on your hands you would have to specify which part of mest you meant or which consideration communication is anything that fits under the communication formula it involves cause effect duplication etc in clearing communication you could specify which type or kind you meant you could use various parts of the communication formula in the third c command of arc straightwire clearing commands doesnt just mean can the pc define the word it is matter of substituting words in the command so that the pcs level of reality is met by the command the question we should ask is which word communicates to the pc what we are trying to communicate to him r and c make understanding when combined this was worked out mathematically in the fall of 1950 they actually compute mathematically when the pc cognites he has reached point of arc expressed as new understanding you wont get cognition if you omit one of the legs of the arc triangle if you run only r and c and not you dont get cogs if you wish to raise any one point that is low you can and should work on the other two points that is terribly valuable datum that must be observed in any arc process any point that is overrun or more difficult will give you trouble unless you preserve the balance amongst the three one leg will ever flatten by itself it is the three that you are trying to flatten so flatten all three in flattening process you can run it to 1 three equal comm lags2 cognition leave the process right there dont ever overrun cog for instance dont put in the last midrud if the pc cognites on the nexttolast the arc processes unflatten easily so if you go past cognition the process will be unflat 3 ta motion runs out for arc processes this is the least reliable and the most desirable you can run by blowdown but you cant depend on ta motion to run out at the same time on each leg the way to flatten one leg is to give equal time to the other legs not to beat the slow one to death the first thing that arc straightwire was found to do was to break neurosis if it is going to have that effect it will work fairly fast the only difficult cases on the 1950 positive process are the ones who ground down to finite number of answers and gave those over and over without ever cogniting the reason for this is that their positive arc moments are quite few and they run out quickly they are pleasure moments and wont flatten you have to run the reverse side of it around 1958 lrh started running lot of reach and withdraw the way iq was being raised was to run what could you withhold on someone funny phenomenon or you could plunge people into an engram and run it half way that will also raise iq scores as person who needs mass to think gets more mass to think with the upsets you run into on case are not the cases pleasure moments they are times of separation and individuation the most fundamental forms of arc breaks are 1 times when the pc was knocked away from being part of things 2 times when the pc was forced to part of things that he wanted nothing to do with his power of choice to connect or disconnect was overthrown this gives an arc break he was there but didnt want to be there or he wanted to be there but couldnt be there an implant is the biggest kind of arc break you can run recall an arc break on someone and it will run him into implants into times when he was held in place where he didnt want to be and told things that he didnt want to hear fundamental overthrow of his power of choice the arc straightwire processes were revised to saw out pieces of implants in order to help handle the helatrobus implants lrh discovered that the big midruds see hcob 8mar63 use of the big middle rudiments or the 18button prepcheck mush an engram they mess it up spoiling the record the engram frays around the edges it turns into pure energy without giving the pc any memory of what happened in the incident this showed that if you were going to use big mid ruds and big prepchecks on pcs stuck in engrams you werent going to unstick them you need steam shovel not hand shovel thus the negative arc processes were invented negative arc processes do handle implants lrh also discovered that pc is operating on entanglements with the physical universe it is one thing to bail him out of this and another thing to get him to look at his considerations about being entangled its not what happens to person that is important it is his considerations about it that count people especially sociologists get caught up in the idea that the environment determines peoples states of mind this is the philosophy on which foreign aid is based power of choice is senior to this by miles it has to do intimately with r and c enforced r or or c will wreck the triangle but given the same environment and predicament two people can have quite different reactions the goodness or badness of the surroundings doesnt necessarily reflect in the happiness or unhappiness of the inhabitants this messes up social planning because the happiness of the individual involves his preferences and his considerations about his surroundings whether or not he has arc for them the pc has had all these preferences and considerations present with regard to all his circumstances all up and down the track that is an adequate statement of power of choicethis raises the question of whether there is such thing as an ideal state or condition in scientology the possibility of such state exists as it has never existed before in the universe an ideal state is state that someone wanted to be in over which he had full power of choice the attainment of happiness for pc is parallel to attaining clear the two factors are 1 the environmental conditions of the pc 2 the pcs r and c with regard to the matter energy space time and postulates of his condition this is channel that has remained fundamentally unknown to this universe these are born out of an interplay between the pcs postulates and the experiences he has netted we are still on an interactive basis between postulates and conditions of experience the persons power of choice is his affinity reality and communication with regard to set of circumstances existences or environments we should give this fact more attention in processing we needed process that could easily be ground out by the hour by any old auditor but which would give fantastic results arc straightwire approaches this ideal as process though it does require some skill and it can be done very wrong arc straightwire does give fantastic results although unfortunately it does not go the whole route because it doesnt actually handle the conditions of existence it only handles pcs attitudes reality and power of communication relative to these conditions but it handles enough to cut away lower levels of case especially levels 4 5 and 6 see p 402405 above for description of the eight levels of cases at level 7 its usefulness is doubtful at level 8 it is useless it brings cases upscale to where they have their own time track to run and are able to run it at that point power of choice is less our concern because the pc believes now that his power of choice is alterable and that he can do something about his conditions now he can handle the real stuff that has aberrated him sooner or later too one has to actually handle the conditions of existence auditors who dont understand arc straightwire can dream up all sorts of wrong ways to do it for instance they skimp on one leg because the pc has trouble with it although cases at level 3 can run the process commands in the order 1 2 3 1 2 3 you will get more ta with the order 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 that is the only way it will run on lower level cases so you might as well run it that way with equal time on each leg until flat or run an equal number of questions on each leg to get over the fact that the pc may have long comm lags on one leg you are after similar amount of run for each you depend on the other two legs to fix up the tougher one letting them get out of balance defeats the process how long you should spend on each leg depends on the pc and how long he takes to flatten something listen for cog to end off on the number of variations that there could be is great always try to get the pc to run the simplest most fundamental version the one that is closest to pure r and c the less you change the command the happier the pc will be since this produces the minimal change of process if you find the pc struggling with wording get it changed early if you are going to change it at all good question for affinity is what attitude has been rejected dont change the question too much settle down for the long run make sure the pc has question he can run another keynote of arc straightwire is that it is always run muzzled the auditors sole concern is understanding and acknowledging what the pc says it is true that sometimes the pc will arc break if you dont talk with him but dont q and or change from an unflat process only talk with the pc to avoid arc breaks and dont violate the auditors code if you run into trouble you can put big mid ruds in on the arc process this wont mush an engram it takes chunks out of parts of the engram chain it picks up parts of the engram chain that belong to other chains anyhow dont try to run arc straightwire as cyclic process cycling to pt on every leg he hasnt been in pt for trillenia you can get him to pt any timeby giving him the command move to pt date theoretically he will only get to pt when the process is flat the process is flat when all ruds are in on the process and it produces departure from the pcs clear read on any leg you are not really after this flat point with the process you are only trying to get part of the charge off so that the pc can run engrams remember that can unmoving tone arm early on in the process is meaningless ta has to be run in before it is run out during the course of running this process the ta may well go up and stick on each leg your main concern is is the pc answering the auditing command does he understand it can we keep it balanced so that we can bring him through it you can ask the pc is there any question or command you havent answered the process can be prefixed with any combination of words eg in auditing on your job or in marriage this makes it more powerful than problems intensive especially if it is assessed against the problem areas of the persons life taking an area that reads well the helatrobus implants contain words like remember and think so you avoid these in auditing commands as much as possible rougher cases will be happy to run this there are cases that cannot recall or remember levels 7 and 8 they need reach withdraw and cchs you can use these principles in discussing whether or not they wish to be here whether they like you whether they wish to talk to you using the above prefixes you can run arc straightwire as pt 2wc process6306c13 shspec274 levels of case here is where we are at technically we are developing dianometry to point where one can give series of tests and decide what you need to do with case there are six types of processes that are learnable and workable direct processing of postulates is not included although rising scale processes do sometimes work especially on level 1 cases the scale of case levels is invaluable and the six types of processes handle all levels the six processes are the only ones that raise case up the levels the only problem lies in how well they are known and how reliably they are executed we are working on how you can tell where pc is so you can tell what to use on him lacking this data you can just process the pc and go up or fall back to hit his level here are the case levels 1 ot track you can even go higher than level 1 for instance you can tell the thetan how to handle theta trap you can also teach him how to maintain game so he wont have to go downscale to have one what you can do with this level consists of education and practice only 2 this is theoretical state usually parts of the time track are missing and those parts that are there are under handling although the thetan at this case level is theoretically supposed to have total access to his time track with nothing aberrative on it the perfect time track is unobtainable it would fold up before it got there at this level we work to get the person over the idea that he has to have time track by handling engrams the thetan learns to block out facsimiles special process is used here 3 at this level the pc has partly visible time track that is however very aberrative he has lots of engrams but he can run them at this level you would use engram running by chains blocking that sort of thing out 4 this is an occluded case with black invisible andor spotted field lower levels can also have such fields so be careful at this level you can still run engrams if you have made sure that you are not actually dealing with level 7 or 8 you can run him on r3n r3n is strippeddown directive routine 3 which uses line plots it has to do with implant gpms r3n2 is an abbreviated form of r3n see 6305c14 shspec263 implant gpms and 6305c21 shspec266 the helatrobus implants 5 dubin case easy to restimulate this case should be run on arc break straightwire duplication what there are processes that produce change in the pc without necessarily giving change in case level processes can be powerful enough to overwhelm the pcs power of choice so you can change the case but the pc may not recognize it so his reality and confront havent improved that is what occurs when you run higherlevel process on lowerlevel case that is why it is idiocy just to cure someone of an illness he will just get sick again you have just worked directly against his hidden standard your real object is to advance the case up the reality scale so you had better use the process that corresponds to the pcs case or reality level you should see improvement both directly in terms of upgrade of case level attitude towards existence etc and indirectly by seeing ta motion if there is ta the pc is not improving with regard to his viewpoint of existence level of communication etc level 4 or 3 cases can also be run on arc break straightwire for repair or boost 6 dubin of dubin this case is distinguished from level 5 by the degree of franticness and the terrible automaticity of the bank it is not common type of case but it is struggle to audit because the track wont hold still to be looked at nothing bites because of this constant motion of the time track the level 6 case longer has the power of stopping motion you could call this type of case the grouped automatic time track or the moving time track caseyou cant run straightwire on him because of the constant motion of the track such cases should be run on cchs repetitive processes work as do sec checks and to lesser degree prepchecks so does general ow done as an excuse for sec checks and prepchecks it is not done as strictly repetitive process the overts you get are very light and feathery that is ok the bottom rung on level 6 has passed beyond the ability to run bank 7 this case can only confront his own evaluations these cases can get enormously interested in cchs because that stuff is dangerous to them they cant run the bank it is not there to be run it is utterly unconfrontable 8 the unawareness case this case can only be run on reach and withdraw being virtually or actually unconscious if you have someone who is in coma take his hand and with commands have him touch the blanket touch the sheet etc the perpetual boiloff case needs reach and withdraw just like the guy in the coma reach and withdraw runs several levels above level 8 for instance it runs up to levels 5 and 6 but here on level 7 you must flatten cchs or you will leave the pc parked the pc at this level will run heavily on these processes you can run processes at levels higher than the case level for which they are primarily intended they dont do much damage if left unflat if the case level is several levels higher than that of the process but dont overestimate the case level and get loses the six types of processing are 1 reach and withdraw 2 cchs 3 sec check 4 repetitive processes 5 r3n implants 6 r3r route 1 could be added as way of handling level 7 case almost any case reacts to almost any of these processes but what you want to do is to improve the level of the case with economy of time there are certain processes that will do it fastest and host of others that dont fit the pcs case level the fastest process is the one that we are after for instance we just run enough r3n to clear off implants so that we can get at other parts of the track you can run someone on implants for long time but what you are after is unburdening the track enough so that you can run gpms there are more implants per unit time in the pt area ie the last 5000 years then there were earlier but the only really thorough workmanlike job that was done was in the helatrobus implant darwins theory of evolution came from one implant case level improves to the degree that charge is removed case level is determined by the amount of encysted and unreleased charge not by the inherent power of the thetan concerned different cases may have different tolerance of charge but the levels will still be determined by the amount of charge the auditors sole interest is to relieve charge in order to change case manifestations the index of charge off is amount of ta or dialwide rocket reads that start out like mad and turn into fall if you are running engrams without getting ta watch it you are just stirring up the bank and not discharging anything the pc will get unhappy with you just give the pc the rfactor that you are going to run more implants to get them out of the road so we can get this earlier material discharged let the ta run into the case on arc break straightwire this may take two sessions if necessary you can drop back to cchs and sec checking or even reach and withdrawit is better to start low and run high underestimate the pcs ability so as to avoid giving the pc loses and keep his confidence and hope factor up the variable is the ability of the case to rise up the scale of course the lower the case level the slower charge blows level 5 and 6 cases will get into rows about being underrun but when the case is being run in the direction of up the case will forgive you almost anything the lower the case the more they estimate their ability to be they dont feel confident enough to see their limits such people do take social pride in their case level there is statusseeking in auditing god forbid let ta motion be there instead and we will all have won6306c18 shspec275 beingness the overtmotivator sequence is about trillion trillion trillion 1036 years old minus hundred thousand trillion it is long track but we have the process to take it apart the main difficulty with the time track and its use in auditing is that there are so many cases that cant confront time track or any part of it so you get loses trying to run engrams we have been accumulating processes that can bring someone upscale to where they can view the time track great number of processes have been accumulated and recently codified as we looked at the fundamental of what we are trying to do with case the ultimate procedure is rote engram running but not everybody could do it so the subject has had to be wrapped up in such way that it could be done by all current rote engram running is superior to and different from earlier engram running we are running engrams by chains to open up and smooth out the time track the only reason we are doing anything about engrams at all is that those are the parts of the time track that are least confrontable if you get rid of those stretches the pc has time track the worst part of the time track denies anyone the best part unless you get rid of the engrams you havent got any time track because the pc cant confront it this sets up innumerable problems the more heavily charged the track is the less the pc can confront it and there is point where the pc moves out of any confrontability of the engram and now there is nothing to confront at all this gives you the scale of cases ot to unaware awareness of the physical universe also diminishes as you go downscale if each case level were to be divided from the others it would be divided by layers of anaten anyone at level 8 would have to go through layers of anaten to get to level 7 awareness of own evaluations as one goes upscale the layers of anaten seem thinner and are thinner because the more aware one is the less one minds unawareness the lowest conscious level of unawareness would be catalepsy or amnesia but even man thinking that he has only lived once has lot of automatic unawareness of the time track when you throw into his lap the idea of having lived before you will get confrontation of his opinions about it eg what would that do to old age pensions and this will make him pretty groggy if you push him up the line his suppositional actions will occur in the absence of processing as he goes from level 7 to level 6 he will get wild ideas after going dopey he gets dubin of dubin lots of suppositional reality for instance he may think he is tutankhamen if you could get him to discuss it more intimately he would get pictures of pictures then as the pc reaches level 4 it all goes black the blackness or invisibleness are parts of real pictures the rest of the picture is just unconfrontable the blackness of level 4 is on the time track it is actually there on the time track it is nice dark safe part of the incident that actually happened run him through run him earlier and pictures can turn on at this point he gets very groggy in the incident as he reaches level 3 in this way he can see much more easily as level 2 moves into level 1 the time track disappears possibly because the time track itself is method of not confronting something he doesnt want to confront it and this overwhelms him to the point where without power of choice he makes picture of it and you have the involuntary picturetaking apparatus that is the time track one can however only be overwhelmed by that which one does not confront so the levels of cases scale is scale of confronting and we could mistakenly think that confronting would solve the time track while confronting does get results and is an interesting process it is not the common denominator of processes the common denominator of processes is duplicate the common denominator of reaction is confront the time track is duplication of an actual event and each one of the case levels is level of willingness to duplicate or unwillingness to duplicate so your breakdown from ot towards clear is anindividual lack of desire to duplicate what he has to duplicate in order to be an ot leading to an overwhelming automaticity of making time track duplication goes hand in glove with the idea of beingness as we study beingness we will see this with great clarity to be or not to be is not the question in this universe you are going to be something whether you like it or not your power of choice on this matter longer exists you can notbe certain thing but only in order to be something else you can be or notbe certain thing but you will always be something the question is what to be so this is the problem one picks up as one enters this universe it doesnt matter if the universe is timeless because you entered it somewhere as you examine peoples time tracks you find that their tolerance of time is improving as you go back since time is the single source of aberration if your timetolerance improves as you go back on the track you must be getting into periods not only when the pc was less aberrated but also approaching the beginning of the time track an individuals time track is not infinite because 1 he entered the universe at some point 2 the earlier he gets on the time track the less it is constant continual and infinite thing the universe on the other hand continues at its own rate of vibration if the individuals time track were of infinite duration cases would be unresolvable getting back to the question of beingness once in this universe you cant absolutely notbe the question is what to be that is the only question in the universe that really bothers somebody you will drive kid up wall by asking him what do you want to be if you want him to be something and he knows it would be dangerous you have postulate counterpostulate situation continuing problem of beingness theres dwindling spiral of beingness the moment one enters this universe there are fewer and fewer safe things to be you can aberrate someone by being after him to be something that is very dangerous you get problem with this the lesson of this universe is that everything you can be is too dangerous to be but there is nothing to do but be in this universe the universe has finite space that looks infinite the gains of r212 came from the fact that the pc was making lists of beingnesses and the fact that real ri is potential beingness anything you might want to be is either too dangerous or too discreditable states effort to dominate the individual is out of jealousy of beingness the press is dramatizing this by saying you mustnt be scientologist it is dangerous to be one so if you want guy to start sorting out his time track at almost any level where he is aware of it at all you could start him at once on question that would get him into some interesting categories time track is to duplicate or not to duplicate but any duplication winds up in beingness duplication and beingness are united or gradients of one another you will have cases that will not become ot until the beingness of ot is demonstrated to them to be not quite as dangerous as it has been all cases or all pcs have assigned to all upper states dangerous or discreditable beingness and the same to all lower states and to their own states impossibility to be well that is the state of any case if there is program for the security of this planet that we can push forward people become loathe to advance their states of case or do anything else they stay parked in an inertia because there is desirable future hope factor this is why hope is rudimentary therapy to some degree you would have to promise that an advanced state of case would not then bring about further problems complicated by the political or sociological problems on this planet if there is nothing that one can do with an advanced state of beingness it is doubtful that people will try to attain it so one needs future or else the problems one got into before as free thetan make one see point in case advance people will downgrade their own states if they feel uncomfortable lonely or unsafe up there planning and organization to resolve that problem alone would bring about case advance in the absence of such planning promise and organization you wont get as fast case advanceif you advance any helatrobus goal lot of people will go on an automatic notis there are people who are on prevented beingness they make theta traps implants etc they can be tested for by offering them any beingness they will notis it for instance you say wise prime minister would be nice he says oh i dont know that would just give you more powerful government they would degrade any more advanced beingness or anything you wanted them to be they might even think that they were doing people favor we have the idea that if we dont have success with certain number of cases we havent got enough people to form any strata of civilization it is ok to say all right you are making an officer cadre the rest can be as they are that presupposes that there is future plan to take care of all this we have plan now for what to do with this planet fine now what about the boys from the next planet you inevitably progress into an organizational future so you have to solve the problem of beingness not only at the level of the individual case but also on out into the future through some organization that ensures some safe future an ot can straighten things out on the planet but unless you mock up plan to do so to solve the beingness problem more broadly you wont make any ots unless you plan to straighten things out few people will go through to ot because it has been so unsafe in the past the ot has had blind spot his own power was so great that he thought he could stand alone but every time he went up against an organized body he lost because the organization could furnish more viewpoints than he could it is the plurality of viewpoints that confuses the individual he cant sort it all out and eventually gets pulled down the individual could furnish only limited number of viewpoints to which he could pay attention and which he could coordinate communism advances because it has plurality of viewpoints organized to confuse the individual viewpoint the individual ot has his problems because he is an individual and has been convinced that he could do it all by himself and he could but the little boys with the airplanes always show up some time in the future the universe was ended by magellanic clouds less than 500 trillion years ago only space and rubble was left there were suns and planets lot of thetans got together to put it all back together you got planet builders and sunbuilders in spite of all this the little men with the airplanes showed up then with their thetatraps where did they come from this has happened repeatedly in this universe this universe surrenders to cooperative action and not to individual action but now we have new breed of cat the experienced being when you get through auditing someone now he is an experienced being who knows the isness of the universe and who knows that matter how tough you are you can get in pole trap we have the technology to straighten someone out unless powerful being learns that this is universe of organization and coordination he will just be back on the pole trap again any body of beings operating with coordinated program can beat him you have got situation where the individual is trying to operate in universe of cooperation and of course that degrades the beingness of the individual to that degree the more he fights to be an individual the less he cooperates the less he is willing to co operate the more enforced is his cooperation the more he fights against this sort of thing and the less freedom he has that is description of the dwindling spiral that an individual goes through noconfront is the mechanical basis of the spiral discarded beingnesses are what bring him down in facsimile the hardest problem the pc usually has is trying to isolate what is him and who is he and what is he this is usually the biggest lie in the facsimile the pc has been running it as an overt being the executioner and he finally turns out to have been the victims wife it is in fact dangerous not to be scientologist but the rest of the beingnesses are matter of opinion and the coordination of beingnesses is one of the better solutions being at the bottom of the reality scale has gone down through scale of beingness to get him to be anything at the bottom is impossible except to be an unaware being there are deeper channels of unawareness but there is absolute unawareness he goes into comataking responsibility for any beingness of any kind whatsoever to move him up the line he would have to have some security in being able to be something at an upper level you can have problems in processing if there is future beingness going out of responsibility occurs because one continually gets the lesson that being responsible lands you in the soup the repetition of this lesson is what puts the individual downscale in livingness the scale keeps going further south to deeper levels of unawareness it has to be made safe to be exterior to be theta clear without some guarantee that you wont just wind up in the soup again you wont become skyscraper tall again havingness is useless without purpose unless the game itself is an expanding game then processing cannot produce stability future livingness ties into rise up the scale outreality equals responsibility what to be to be an or to be b that is the question if you cant be an and cant be b and there arent any other things to be the answer is anaten it is interesting what you can do simply by using the tool of secure beingness marital difficulties result from 1 husband who wont be husband 2 wife who wont be wife 3 husband who wont let wife be wife 4 wife who wont let husband be husband this is the average marriage marriage is not unhappy marriage is difficult beingness you could use beingness processing to remedy it bypassed charge that causes jealousy is bypassed charge in the other person it is not knowing about the other persons past therefore there is crisscross of bpc because we are not bypassing charge in each other scientologists will be the first people who can be friends in this universe because time alone builds up bpc in people who know nothing about the time track you have to handle the helatrobus implant because it bolluxes up the time track and debars an easy route to running engrams and to reaccustoming the individual to different levels of beingness only engram running will clear somebody beingness case state hope expectations and confront are all tied up in the case scale now that we have the scale of cases and knowledge of what gets case up to engram running we can sort out the time track reaccustoming the person to various levels of beingness after youve got all the engrams run out youve got an ot then you need an organization to handle the problems of the ot in this universe otherwise he will just slump again6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing processes fall into categories according to which case conditions they handle cases deteriorate as they go down the time track one factor against which they deteriorate is confront and the other factor is duplication confront has to do with willingness and duplication has to do with ability as the pc becomes less willing to confront he becomes less able to duplicate similarly processes are allowed to deteriorate and fade out of use through failure of willingness to confront and ability to duplicate cchs for example went out for five years through getting down into the effort band there was duplication you would have very exact sort of process if you ran what are you able tounable to duplicate along with other flows you add more legs to it as the case needs more complexity highscale case not being much troubled by flows could go far on one leg only you can get different viewpoints on different flows also this can give you ta action where you might not otherwise get it you add enough brackets to get ta there is perfect way to run brackets since the number of available flows is virtually infinite the idea of flows is something that monitors all case levels and breaks its back around level 4 above level 4 any or all flows could be run person well downscale below level 4 almost at the bottom can only run one flow such person cant function on any other dynamic than the first he cant conceive of another viewpoint though he needs to run more than one flow there is problem here this is problem of the dynamics how many can person function on there are many facets of processing by which you could match up case to its ideal process you might be able to figure out the perfect process mathematically but there is the point about the need for workability that we mustnt lose sight of process should not be perfect it should be complex enough to be workable the complexity factor also goes into the number of processes you need we should not emulate modern science modern science is method of precisely determining overwhelming nonsense we also have to determine the common denominators present in all cases the processes that have survived the development of scientology are those that have broad workability they include arc the midruds buttons and common incidents on the time track the common denominators of all cases kraepelins list of psychiatric case types is ridiculous it is like saying i am auditing betty so it is betty case type or well everybody is george case type in the first case you get too many case types in the second case you get too few there is middle ground this is finite number of case types classified according to their behavior in auditing sessions and larger but still finite number of processes it is only useful to divide cases up into case types so that you can match them up to the processes the case types are based on behavior in session not in life you get finite number of them then match them up with processes that raise the pc upscale you cant expect auditors to memorize more than few types of auditing processes perfectly if you expect more of auditors than this they end up mixing types and styles of auditing and you get hash repetitive processing seems easy now that you are familiar with it in fact any type of processing you have learned well presents particular problem cchs got badly learned they are kid glove type of process since cases that get cchs exclusively are low on the effect scale and cant tolerate being mauled about lrh tells an anecdote about dropping cchs because they werent getting results then giving tvd and discovering that one knew what he was doing they had utterly alterised the process it was then that he stopped just creating new processes and began to insist on perfect duplication of what had already been developed we stopped accumulating process types when lrh found out that it was variation that made processes and process types stop producing results people shifting from the original type of process would then apparently bring about need for new process type process types are dependent on how many you can keep in line how to keep processes in line and working is amore important factor than you might think when process seems to have stopped working you will find that variations from the original have crept in the simpler process types tend to survive better than the more complicated ones they are also perhaps easier to keep in line in their unvaried form but even the simpler ones will drift out of line process can die when it is too simple and gets used very seldom reach and withdraw is good example of this type of process it works at level 8 and is the only type of process you could use on an animal processes that work very slowly also tend to get dropped since they are seldom run to flat point so you dont see results we dont really know how much reach and withdraw processes can do processes can vanish because of disrespect we use one diffidently arc processing disappeared for awhile because of this that they are the only workable processes for certain type of case gets lost and so those cases get lost reach and withdraw is one of these it is slow but sure and it is almost lost from lack of respect for its potential there are lots of processes in the band of reach and withdraw that are ignored book and bottle hangs right in between reach and withdraw and cchs it contains duplication like the latter but is the former type of process lots of cases wont move unless run on these processes they wont move on cchs we mustnt lose processes we have been pressing so much at the top of the scale of cases that the bottom has been neglected so these lower scale processes have dropped out the next division in processing is what the auditor knows is wrong with the case vs what can be done with the case these can be two very different things modern processes have nothing to do with what is wrong with the case the viewpoint of curing specific conditions by specific processes is an outmoded viewpoint left over from old medical practices one must run what the pc can run and not fixate on curing that is sort of q and ii case with temporary relapse into heavy problems may not be able for the moment to be run on problems repetitivetype process therefore you had better be able to undercut problems processes if case is dramatizing something that something is not real to the case that is guiding rule of processing what you are guided by is not are we handling what is obviously wrong with him but does the case respond to the process that is being run on the case 1e does the case get ta when the ruds for the session are in you must of course check that 1 the session ruds are in 2 flows are in line 3 the process is not already flat or unsuitable for instance speaking of flows most of the stuff we run eg the helatrobus implants are motivators so if you had ta and it ceased after you had run several flows the flows may be getting stuck we are interested in increasing the capabilities of the case he should at least be getting easier to audit because that means that he is getting more responsive to external orders getting more capable of viewing his track and pictures getting into less trouble getting better at locating bpc the case would be getting more done per session too auditors tend not to notice that case is paining and winning because they are too close to the case and they dont observe the slow gradient the way to spot it is to notice how the case was month ago if the case is progressing well if he is interested in and happy doing what he is doing dont change it unless there is ta for long time give ta motion time to develop also it may take several sessions to establish the pcs case levelrun engrams using the precise system and commands given the precision of the system tends to develop the pcs precision on the track dont word the item too adventurously make it finite enough so that there is hope of reaching basic it should be something he is worried about and can reach if you run chain of being held still you are asking for lots of still points which may be hard to get to the root of what you validate you produce with the exception that getting the pc to confront what he doesnt want to lets him take over the automaticity of producing it so it stops being produced modern processes are built on and monitor the degree of withdrawal of the person into himself and those things that will lead the pc out from himself so he is longer so restricted thus reach and withdraw is the most basic action you should have some idea about types of processes how and why they work and what case level they are most effective on and you should get good at estimating where the case must lie and upgrading the case from that point always run the case little steeper than it thinks it should be run the reaction of the case in terms of protest or arc break has almost bearing on whether what you are running is the right process you look amidst the yap yap and see if the pc is running the auditing command protest is common denominator of the whole track and this universe it

behaviour of the time track engram running by chains is so simple that any auditor begins by overcomplication you almost cant get uncomplicated enough in engram running in teaching people to run engrams in 1949 my chief despair was summed up in one sentence to the group i was instructing all auditors talk too much and thats the first lesson the second lesson is all auditors acknowledge too little instead of cheerily acking what the pc said and saying continue auditors are always asking for more data and usually for more data than the pc ever could give example pc i see house here auditor okay how big is it thats not engram running thats just lousy q and the proper action is pc i see house here auditor okay continue the exceptions to this rule are nonexistent this isnt special brand of engram running it is modern engram running it was the first engram running and is the last and you can put aside any complications in between the auditor is permitted one question per each new point of track and that is all example auditor move to the beginning of the 88 plus trillion year incident waits moment what do you see pc its all murky auditor good move through the incident wrong example auditor move to the beginning of the 88 plus trillion year incident waits moment what do you see pc its all murky auditor can you see anything in the murk flunk flunk flunk the rule is acknowledge what the pc says and tell him to continue then theres the matter of being doubtful of control wrong example auditor move to yesterday are you there how do you know its yesterday what do you see that makes you think flunk flunk flunk right example auditor move to yesterday waits moment what do you see good another error is failure to take the pcs data you take the pcs data never take his ordersright example auditor meter dating is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen trillion gets contradictory reads or dn off meter are you thinking of something pc its less than 18 trillion auditor thank you on meter is it greater than seventeen trillion five hundred billion less than pc its seventeen trillion nine hundred and eight billion four hundred and six million ninetyfive thousand seven hundred and six years ago auditor having alertly written it all down thank you ends dating wrong example auditor is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen tr pc its less than eighteen trillion auditor ok is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen flunk flunk flunk in dating the pcs contrary data unspoken and untaken can give you completely wrong date your data comes from the pc and the meter always for anything and if the pcs data is invalidated you wont get meters data if the pc says he has ptp and the meter says he doesnt you take the pcs data that he does in dating an argument with the pc can group the track so take the pcs data and if the pc is dubin you should be running the arc processes not engrams anyway as the case is overcharged for engrams if the pc isnt dubin then the pcs data is quite reliable also minimize pcs dependency on meter dont keep confirming pcs data by meter read with that reads yes thats there yes theres rocket read just let the pc find his own reality in running an engram all auditors talk too much you can date on meter but only so long as the pc doesnt cognite on the date you can help pc identify or choose an area of track but only if he specifically asks you to example pc ive got two pictures here can you find out which one is the earlier one is of freight engine the other is whole train auditor on meter is the freight engine earlier than the whole train is the whole train earlier than the freight engine to pc the whole train reads as earlier now however if the pc has two facsimiles your problem is only that youve missed something rule whenever charge is missed the time track tends to group this does not mean the auditor has to do something about it unless the pc gets confused and asks for help at which time the only action is to spot on the meter what charge has been missed and tell the pc arc breaks all routine 3 arc breaks including r3n and r3r are handled the same way an exact way there is deviation from this if the pc becomes critical of anything outside the engram room auditor scientology the technology it is an arc break arc breaks are of greater and lesser magnitude ranging throughout the misemotional band of the tone scale the handling of arc breaks always follows this rule arc break rule l if the pc arc breaks issue further auditing commands until both pc and auditor are satisfied that the cause of the arc break has been located and indicated do not issue more orders do not run process do not offer to run process do not sit idly letting the pc arc break follow this rulearc break rule 2 when pc arc breaks or cant go on for any reason do an r3r arc break assessment and locate and indicate to the pc the bypassed charge the only harm that can be done in r3r or r3n is issuing further orders to the pc or trying to run something before the bypassed charge has been located and indicated given this handling of arc breaks and an exact adherence to the rote of r3r all former problems of engram running vanish early engram running auditor who knew earlier than june 1963 engram running should consider he or she knows how to run engrams routine 3r is itself it has dependence on earlier methods of running engrams failure to study and learn r3r because one knows about engram running will cause lot of case failure early engram running was often attempted on cases below case level 4 the technology further was too varied too much was demanded of the pc too little effort was put into finding the basic on chain too many forcing techniques were used too often the auditor ran just any engram he could get these and other faults prevented engrams from being run r3r is rote procedure that is victory in itself but it is better procedure if you know oldtime engram running there is attempt here to invalidate you or that knowledge or make you wrong in any way those are all ways to run engrams and gave you better grasp on it i only wish to call to your attention that r3r is not oldtime engram running but is scientology routine designed to achieve the state of ot and is not designed for any other use than freeing the spirit of man therefore study and use r3r and dont mix it with any earlier data on engram running anything you know about engram running will help you understand r3r but it wont help your pc if mixed in with r3r i couldnt put this too strongly youll trace any failure in the auditor with r3r to 1 inability to execute the auditing cycle 2 inability to run session 3 failure to study and understand the time track 4 failure to follow r3r exactly without deviation 5 failure to handle arc breaks as above 6 using r3r on lower level cases not prepared by preengram running processes routine 3r engram running by chains is designated routine 3r to fit in with other modern processes it is triumph of simplicity it does not demand visio sonic or other perception at once by the pc it develops themthe ordinary programming of the lowest level case would be reach and withdraw processes cchs repetitive processes r3r r3n r3r routine 3r is the process that leads to case level 2 only some additional exercises are needed then to attain the next level ot so r3r is the fundamental bridge step to ot and were going only for ot now for various reasons including political we have bypassed clear which remains only as courtesy title denoting one or more gpms run many cases even the black v can begin at once on r3r r3r by steps r3r is run in the 3n model session preliminary step establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment step one locate the first incident by dating step two move pc to the incident with the exact command move to date step three establish duration length of time of incident an incident may be anything from split second long to 15 trillion trillion years or more long step four move pc to beginning of incident with the exact command move to the beginning of the incident at date wait until meter flicks step five ask pc what he or she is looking at with the exact command what do you see if pcs eyes are open tell pc first close your eyes acknowledge whatever pc says do not ask second question ever step sixsend the pc through the incident with the exact command move through the incident to point duration later step seven ask nothing say nothing do nothing except observe meter or make quiet notes while pc is going through the incident if the pc says anything at all just acknowledge and let him continue using this exact command softly okay continue do not coax distract or question pc during this period exception only if the pc arc breaks take action and then only do the r3r arc break assessment if the pc gets stuck bounces gets into another incident or if the somatic strip sticks or refuses to obey the auditor only do an arc break assessment do not force the pc onward by any command or question step eight when the pc reaches the end of the incident usually pc moves or looks up say only what happened take whatever pc says acknowledge only as needful say nothing else ask nothing else when pc has told little or much and has finished talking give final acknowledgement step nine repeat exactly and only steps two to eight continue to do so until pc either spots an earlier incident or b gets change on run through the incident from the run just before in event of either or b do steps one to eight exactly and only on the new incident step ten at the end of any session of r3r leave the pc where he is on the time track do not attempt to bring the pc to present time or take the pc to rest point as these actions may very well bypass charge end any r3r session with very careful goals gains as the pc is usually rather anaten and any needed havingness but keep the havingness very brief only enough to restore can squeeze do not end session on boiloff or arc break step eleven at the beginning of any new r3r session if you finished the last engram you were working on begin precisely and anew with step one if you are still working on an engram already found begin precisely with step four and carry onstep twelve if the pc gets into trouble in the session do not use mid ruds or ask for missed withholds mid ruds will mush an engram missed withholds unless found as part of the arc break assessment may move the pc violently about through recently found engrams do only the arc break assessment and locate and indicate charge accordingly if the session goes wrong since the last time i audited you mid ruds and missed withholds are permissible at session start before any r3r action is taken in that session step thirteen when encountering goals engram such as the helatrobus implants lay aside r3r and use r3n when encountering goals engram prior to the helatrobus implants or subsequent to them use r3m2 but only when such an engram has ris step fourteen when basic on any chain is found flatten it fully and permit it to be stripped of any lock engrams or earlier incidents that appear in finding basics remember that the time track by my most recent measurements considerably exceeds trillion trillion trillion years basics may occur as early as they occur but seldom nearer pt than 200 trillion years ago and quite ordinarily at 15 trillion trillion years ago end of steps there is variation of these steps for any reason this is the most exact procedure known and there you have it rote engram running superior to any engram running ever done and giving superior and faster results future hco bulletins will expand the reasons for these

reserved6306c25 shspec278 routine 2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment the use of different processes has been monitored or regulated by two things 1 the ability of the auditor to do the process 2 the efficacy of the process in advancing cases both have to be taken into account it is important that these two factors mesh otherwise auditors tend to lose what is win or lose in auditing you have to be able to define them or we wont be able to recognize them win in terms of thetan behavior is 1 intending to do something and doing it or 2 intending not to do something and not doing it lose is 1 intending to do something and not doing it or 2 intending not to do something and doing it lose gives you disagreement ridge forms between those two things ridge is bit of entrapped energy that will read on an meter in processing intending to do something for case and not doing it is lose from the pcs side it is the basic definition for lose if the pc sets goal for the session of becoming ot and doesnt make it it is lose matter how unreal the goal was an auditors idea of win could be not to arc break the pc then he does and gets lose this is the intention and sole intention of many auditors going into session this being the case it demands of process that it work regardless of the intention of the auditor that is quite bit to demand of an automaticity but it is very safe base for process your skill as an auditor is in getting the process across and completing an auditing cycle keeping the form and running the session it does not lie in inventing process as you go along you have enough to do without having to invent processes although lrh used to do it it is feasible to dream up the process while auditing the pc but it is only necessary when you dont know what to do the way around this problem is to know the fundamentals of cases what we expect of an auditor is to be able to complete an auditing cycle hold the session form together and take care of the pcs unformness as needed that is minimal if you go lower you havent got an auditor and more randomness than order will be introduced into the session person who couldnt master repetitive process would never make an auditor because of the importance of the auditing cycle you need to be able to acknowledge this is more than just saying thank you the auditor has to understand and it is up to the auditor to minimize the possible breakdowns of the auditing cycle that results from the auditor being startled by what pcs come up with the auditor must be cured of tendency to q and since that is damaging to the pc common sort of q and is echo metering this drives the pc round the bend if this is done with dating it can ruin the pcs precious ability to estimate time any echo metering is and not q and aing is part of the auditing cycle if the pc says around 750 years you say 750 years the essence of q and is departing from the auditing cycle with new doingness because the pc has added new doingness this misses pcs withhold the worst situation you can get into is the arc break caused by your taking it up when all the pc was doing was originating the pc has originated and you thought it was question or arequest and acted to handle it flunk you didnt acknowledge the origination you can get the pc to clarify the origination by asking the pc was that request the final test of an auditor is not is he perfect but can he unscramble mess by session end get as good as you can get but dont get upset about imperfection just be sure you can straighten it all out as an irreducible minimum let things go that are going well and straighten out things that arent r2h is new process to assist in this see also hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment for more details on the process this would be predecessor of the l1c r3r is pretty rote procedure it has variations it took 13 years to arrive at it i intended auditors to run engrams and failed in the past i had loss that is why r3r came in the main difficulty in handling engrams is the complexity of the procedure these rote steps are pretty simple done one by one r3r runs engrams better and smoother than earlier engram running ever did it is quite triumph the failure in getting auditors to run engrams was enough to make lrh abandon trying for some years of all processes this is the one not to learn by doing it on the pc dont practice running engrams on pc you will tanglefoot if you dont know the fundamentals of the time track dating is an interestingly exact skill the hardest and trickiest step is getting the duration because it is hard to get the proper duration and in rote procedure duration is everything if the pc doesnt know know what the incident is all about you have the duration wrong why the later part of the incident is always knowable as to length the question is where it really begins for instance you know how long this lifetime has been but you dont know how long your track is if you get the pc just seeing one scene every time you run him through the incident then the duration is wrong he has just got the back end of the incident in terms of reality and behavior of the meter the pc could reach the last part of the engram if he cant tell you about what is happening the duration is wrong because there is obviously something more to it and that something more is always earlier so you must redo the duration the first incident wasnt wrong youve just gotten more incident this could happen more than once in one incident if the second run is still very vague if the pc still doesnt know about the incident if he has gotten only few more pictures get the duration step redone thats all you have to do you may have to redo it several times just take the pcs data the pc will always go to the beginning of that part of the incident which he can now reach luckily this is very uncomplicated and it is very important because all that is in the bank is in engrams engram running is longer barred to the black v case even gpms are specialized engrams gpm is just an engram with pattern required to run it the mind is not confused the pc looking at it and unable to find what he wants thinks that it is confused it is an idiotically orderly machine which does what you tell it to do addressed by proper technology the mind is incredibly precise and accurate the pc may think it looks confused but he is like someone on his first trip to the library he will be confused until he cognites that he can just ask the librarian for what he wants and get it the auditor always gets what he asks for in r3r the mind is not ouija board just keep your commands sensible and comprehensible the biggest problems an auditor has are 1 finding the correct date and duration 2 arc breaks most auditors are somewhat afraid of arc breaks if you havent learned to assess and handle arc breaks you are licked you will shortly back off from running engrams because you will have had lose routine 2h comes in here it is arc breaks by assessment it is superior to arc break straightwire it asks the pc for an arc break dates it assesses it for bpc locates it and indicates it to the pc this puts you at cause over arc breaks and gives you practice at dating things that the pc is not very nervy about unlike engramsr2h can be run on pc at level 6 dubin of dubin case r3r doesnt necessarily run only engrams you can also run secondaries with it which is fine just dont call it engram running dont run chains that havent been assessed you risk having the chain try to branch into another chain you can run locks with r3r on case that is not up to running engrams getting the item to run is done by the rules of listing you could also assess the 18 buttons of the prepcheck and list what they have suppressed in this lifetime and get chain that you can run with ta if you hit one of the helatrobus implants shift to r3n if it is another sort of gpm you hit go to r3n2 watch for dates between 38 and

arc breaks r2h by steps the auditing actions of routine 2h are complex and must be done with great precision the actions are done in routine 3 model session mid ruds and missed withholds may be used step one tell the pc recall an arc break when pc has done so acknowledge that the pc has done so do not ask the pc what it is if pc says what it is simply acknowledge it is business of r2h to know what the arc break consists of step two date the arc break on the meter if the pc volunteers the date do not verify it on the meter further accept it at once and write it down the date is more important than the content of the arc breakstep three assess the arc break for bypassed charge using the attached list find the greatest read the assessment is seldom gone over more than once as whole and those that read are then read again until one remains this is rapid action on the meter look only for tiny ticks or falls or small left to right slash of the needle do not expect large reactions the mark v meter is indispensable step four indicate to the pc what charge was missed in that arc break he or she has recalled the pc must be satisfied that that was the charge missed the pc may try to recall what it was that was indicated this is not vital part of the drill but the pc must be satisfied that the located bypassed charge was the source of the arc break there is danger here of great deal of auditor adlibbing and tanglefoot if the pc is not satisfied and happier about it the wrong bypassed charge has been found and step three must be redone it is part of this process to run an engram or secondary thus located the assessment form this is sample form it may be necessary to add to it some lines of it may eventually be omitted however this form does work the auditor may add few lines to it in asking the questions preface the whole assessment with in the arc break you recalled_____ do not preface each question so unless pc goes adrift dirty needle means pc has started to speculate ask have you thought of anything and clean needle had an engram been missed had withhold been missed had some emotion been rejected had some affection been rejected had reality been rejected had communication been ignored had similar incident occurred before had goal been disappointed had some help been rejected was an engram restimulated had an overt been committed had an overt been contemplated had an overt been prevented was there secret routine 2h is skilled operation practice gives the auditor knack of doing it rapidly an arc break should be disposed of about every fifteen

bulletin of 1 july ad 13 central orgs franchise routine 3r bulletin 4 preliminary step the r3r preliminary step is done to assure that the correct incident chain is run on the pc for that pc many chains locks secondaries and engrams are available on any pc but some of them are beyond the pcs reality and ability and some of them are too featherweight to get any case gain the basic problem in starting case on r3r is to run the pc on chain that will improve the case b hold the pcs interest c be within the pcs current ability to handle the establishing of the correct chain was missing element in all earlier engram running almost any pc from level 7 upwards could have run engrams if the exact chain necessary to resolve the case could have been established this is accomplished now by an accurate assessment using sensitive emeter and the following form and procedure it does not matter if the pc begins on chain of locks secondaries or engrams so long as running it does b and c above you do not have to specify in r3r whether you are running engrams secondaries or locks the word incident covers all also it does not matter if the pc stays within this lifetime or goes whole track so long as the assessed chain is followed and basic eventually discovered for it the chain leads where the chain leads but once having found the proper chain the auditor must follow that chain not skip about to do this the auditor when asking for an earlier incident in later r3r steps always specifies the proper chain found in this assessment by the level item result of this preliminary step assessment for example if the chain found here in the preliminary step is decisions to die level found decided item found to die one obtains earlier incidents by always saying is the next earlier decision to die more than years ago less than years ago thus the result obtained in the preliminary step is used on and on until an actual basic is reached this may be fifty or more engrams run and perhaps even some r3n in the middle of the chain if the chain leads into gpm by normal rote use of r3r when basic is reached and discharged and the chain being run now gives little or ta action or even free needle new preliminary step is done but until that happens this preliminary step is not repeated with the other steps once it has happened basic found and run however new preliminary step is done exactly as given here for the first chain assessment you find the chain you run engram after engram on that chain or lock after lock or secondary after secondary you find basic you run the basic thoroughly with ta action now gone on the chain found you do new preliminary step rule ta action exists on the correct chain rule chain once assessed must be fully run rule ta action ceases on discharged chain rule new assessment is done only when chain is discharged rule any properly assessed chain will produce ta action rule if chain assessed does not produce immediate ta action with skilled r3r the assessment or the resulting question formed is incorrect the exact procedure of assessment is 1 assess pc by elimination as below for r3r form level 2 list the form level found to completed list 3 nul the completed list to single subject 4 use the form level plus subject to designate the character of the incident to be found every time an incident is looked for all rules of listing as developed in r212 apply to this preliminary step they are not repeated here one is not looking for rrs or rses in the preliminary step assessment any type of read is valid arc breaks when doing this step of r3r use the arc break assessment for listing form not the r3r arc break assessment form the main sources of arc breaks in the preliminary step are 1 wrong level assessed 2 the listed list incomplete 3 the wrong item taken from the list 4 former chain or engram abandoned to do new assessment 5 earlier levels restimulated old prehav auditing 6 earlier listing restimulated such forms will be published from time to time as they tend to change and improve earlier assessments donethe very earliest assessment 1948 used was what the pc could see when he closed his or her eyes this was then run this was followed by an arbitrary method of assigning necessary incidents to be run such as birth and prenatals the next earliest assessment 1949 was to ask each time for the incident necessary to resolve the case an automaticity known as the file clerk was depended upon impinged into action by finger snapping the next period 1951 concerned whole track exploration running whatever you could get to read on meter the next period 1952 concerned overt engrams located by what the pc seemed to be doing physically this ended the dianetic period where engrams were run to clear but mainly to cure psychosomatic illnesses variations of these assessments were revived from time to time in dianetic uses culminating in the 5th london acc where overt engrams were run with confront and great stress was laid on getting the postulates out of them the meter and shrewd guesses played their part in assessments up to this time there was great dependence on insight and judgment we were barred to some degree by my own ability to see other peoples pictures which made engram running very easy for to do along with my general knowledge of the whole track and the mind this led to be very hard to convince that engram assessment was subject at all or that most auditors couldnt do it with the advent of scientology with its complete shift from dianetic goals healing went out as reason for running engrams and concern about the body vanished as an auditing target this led to stresses on exteriorization of the spirit moving it away from the body as the reactive bank was thought to be part of the body its engrams received further attention eventually i discovered that the thetan had engrams and that these were being automatically involuntarily created by him engram running has vanished as healing process engram handling by chains has emerged as an entirely reoriented subject not even vaguely connected with the body and with the target not of human clear but of operating thetan the assessment for engram chains or any kind of chain emerges finally in routine 3r this assessment technology from beginning to end is scientology none of it was ever heard of in dianetics therefore we have crossed bridge i have finally understood that precise assessment is vital for an auditor and that an auditor can learn the exact chain to be run on the pc without any intuition or second sight and that even my own auditing is bettered thereby and that the thetan cannot be freed and reempowered without an assessment and rote technology for engram running this is r3r the earliest r3r assessment for chains was done by pc interest and the button protested the pc was merely asked in this lifetime what have you protested and with listing whatever the pc said and seemed interested in was taken this however did not often produce adequate ta action when the chain was then run the next improvement was using the 18 prepcheck buttons this drew blank on some pcs level reactingaccordingly i then developed new prehav scale based mainly on flows it is protest that is basically responsible for making mental image picture however very few cases are up to this level in order to bring more levels of case under engram running and to get more ta action for any case i developed this preliminary step scale the present scale takes some account of 1 the old prehav scale 2 the knowto mystery scale 3 the chart of attitudes 4 the 18 buttons and 5 the flows scale as well as some old wellknown buttons several possible levels such as create have been left out because they would go at once into the gpm or implant goals it may not be important that they do indeed with experience we may even come to guide the pc at them but for the moment they are left out there would be nothing wrong in borrowing further from these sources to draw up longer preliminary step scale but i think this should cover most pcs the three most important visible factors in r3r are pcs interest b tone arm action c the ability of the pc to run the incidents if the auditor can see these he knows his preliminary assessment was right interest does not mean happiness and joy interest is only absorbed attention and desire to talk about it tears terror or agony may be present without the interest factor being absent chain of engrams is expected to produce pain and anaten chain of secondaries is expected to produce misemotion these have nothing in them to head an auditor off chain equally significance and story content have bearing on the rightness or wrongness of chain selected they are entirely incidental to judging the correctness of chain all the auditor is interested in is whether the pc is interested b the ta action is good and c can the pc run the incidents on the chain with correct and exact r3 r that careless auditing and bad r3r can influence c leaves us with only two exact criteria for correct assessment pcs interest and b ta action while running incidents only these two things tell us the assessment was right the assessment can be right and unskilled r3r can wreck both in the later steps fact which has to be taken into account in reviewing cases in progress r3r assessment this is the assessment for r3r preliminary step in this form will be recognized the old prehav scales and others but improved for the purpose of engram chain assessment this assessment must be done accurately it is hard to do if the pc doesnt understand level during assessment is startled by one or disagrees these will make the assessmentinaccurate if the assessment is inaccurately done the pc will arc break or the resulting engram chain will not give ta action when being run the final level assessed will probably give ta action at once when found if right the key sentence in assessing is in this lifetime have you mainly level this is repeated for each level called levels are called once as in ordinary elimination those that stayed in are reassessed the same way the one form can be used for many additional assessments on the same pc as chains are run out the use of this form brings r3r down to case level 7 in workability chain of engrams being run must give ta action if none is present in running engrams and the ta stays high or low the assessment was wrong the level found here is used to make and complete list with the question in this lifetime what have you level found in this lifetime is used not because we only want chains in this lifetime but to keep pc from going all over the track during the preliminary assessment this making it too long the chain you want comes into this lifetime all rules of listing apply as in r212a in doing this list in event of an arc break while doing the preliminary step use the arc break assessment for listing if needle dirties up in assessing this form give form to pc and ask what happened and if that fails get in bmrs on this assessment suppressed withheld failed to

opinions about in nulling this scale the pc may suddenly break down emotionally or get an overpowering reaction not just twinge or an interest in level since the pc will not know the real level until it is found if so stop dont go on go back to above the point where pc was all right and then carefully null back down to where you stopped go over this area getting in suppress and invalidate if needful and youll have the pcs level found you may lead into arc breaks if you persist in going on as you have bypassed charge but the pcs reaction must be large for you to use this mechanism beware of sell by the pc pc doesnt know the level until it isactually found some pcs will decide on level and it will then read in such case get in protested and decided with on this scale have you by fast check dont let your pc mess up an assessment by sell or decision but dont keep on down long assessment of this scale with the pc shattered by pain or emotion as the pc will suppress the right level when you have found the pcs level on the above scale by elimination then list the following question using that level found in this lifetime what have you level found list the list to clean needle so that it nuls very easily leaving very few in on the first nulling only two or three in on the second nulling of what has been left in put mid ruds in on these if necessary nul out to the final item combine the level found and the item found this is very simple step the wording may have to be altered in tense but not in sense decided may become decision failed to think may become failure to think in the item found some shift of the pcs wording may be needful but be very careful that you get combination of level and item that makes sense to the pc and reads on the meter without protest reading too these reads are often not very large and at best assume steep falls with ta action so be careful to add up the level and the item found to sensible statement that does not alter the sense for instance you can err greatly if the level was fear and the item was entrapment if you vary it to fear of traps that wont give you the same chain at all the correct one is fear of entrapment of course you can have correct level correct item and then fail to combine the two sensibly if so you will get confused pc and b wrong chain either way youll get little ta action and r3r done the level failed to convince and the item father had better be left just that way it gives short chain this lifetime soon done by changing the item father to fathers you would go whole track but the significance is wildly altered and might not run at all the less alteration the better and never alter the sense of it use the question is the first available level item incident earlier than five years ago later than five years ago and using times to suit go on with step one of r3r note the above scale is in random order of arrangement at this time and positions of levels on the scale have significance l ron

point then cch 3 to flat point then cch 4 to flat point then cch 1 to flat point etc to bring the cch training into line with current methods of teaching trs etc at the end of each drill list of coachs questions is given in addition coach should take instructions from the commands and training stress and frame them in the form of questions for example in cch i coach could ask did you make every command and cycle separate coach must avoid invalidating student and not ask questions on what coach thinks the student has done wrong the correct method is to ask few questions at time choosing and forming questions at random on the other hand coach should not ask question about something that has not happened in the drill for example in cch 3 if coach has not manifested dopeoff coach would not ask when i doped off did you take my hand and execute the command one hand at time cch 1 name give that hand tone 40 commands give that hand physical action of taking hand when not given and then replacing it in the coachs lap making physical contact with the coachs hand if coach resists thank you ending each cycle all tone 40 with clear intention one command in one unit of time take up each new physical change manifested as though it were an origin by the coach when it happens and querying it by asking whats happening this twoway comm is not tone 40 run only on the right hand position student and coach seated in chairs without arms students knees on outside of both coachs knees purpose to demonstrate to pc that control of pcs body is possible despite revolt of circuits and inviting pc to directly control it absolute control by auditor then passes over towards absolute control of his own body by pc training stress never stop process until flat place is reached freezes may be introduced at end of cycle this being after the thank you and before the next commandmaintaining solid comm line to ascertain information from the coach or to bridge from the process this is done between two commands holding the coachs hand after acknowledgement coachs hand should be clasped with exactly correct pressure make every command and cycle separate maintain tone 40 stress on intention from student to coach with each command to leave an instant for coach to do it by own will before student decides to take hand or make contact with it stress tone 40 precision can be coached for some time silently with coach looking for silent student intention student indicates hand by nod of head coachs questions cch 1 1 what is tone 40 command intention without reservation 2 did you give tone 40 command 3 was the command executed 4 what is change any physical observed manifestation 5 did you notice any change 6 what was it 7 did you take it up with 8 did you introduce freeze at

ability to duplicate and thusly increase his havingness training stress absolute student precision drops from tone 40 flubs total present time student on coachs right side students body acts as block to forward motion when coach turns student gives command gives coach moment to obey then enforces command with physical contact of exactly correct force to get command executed student does not block coach from executing commands method of introduction as in cch 1 freezes may be introduced at the end of cycle this being after the thank you and before the next command maintaining solid comm line to

mimicry commands student raises 2 hands palms facing coachs about an equal distance between the student and coach and says put your hands against mine follow them and contribute to their motion he then makes simple motion with right hand then left did you contribute to their motion acknowledge answer student allows coach to break solid comm line when this is flat the student does this same with half inch of space between his and the coachs palms the command being put your hands facing mine about l2 inch away follow them and contribute to their motion did you contribute to their motion acknowledge when this is flat student does it with wider space and so on until coach is able to follow motions yard away position student and coach seated close together facing each other coachs knees between students knees purpose to develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale solid communication line to get pc into communication by control and duplication to find auditor training stress that student be gentle and accurate in his motions all motions being tone 40 giving pc wins to be free in 2way communication that process be introduced and run as formal process to teach student that if coach dopes off in this process student may take coachs wrist and help him execute the command one hand at time that if coach does not answer during anaten to question did you contribute to their motion student may wait for normal comm lag of that coach acknowledge and continue process coachs questions cch 3 1 what is tone 40 motion intention without reservation 2 did you

mimicry something was needed to supplant look at who am i and find the auditor part of rudiments cch 4 name book mimicry commands there are set verbal commands student makes simple motions with book hands book to the coach coach makes motion duplicating students mirrorimagewise student asks pc if he is satisfied that the coach duplicated the motion if coach is and student is also fairly satisfied student takes back the book and goes to next command if coach is not sure that he duplicated any command student repeats it for him and gives him back the book if coach is sure he did and student can see duplication is pretty wrong student accepts coachs answer and continues on gradient scale of motions either with the left or right hand till coach can do original command correctly this ensures invalidation of the coach tone 40 only in motions verbal 2way quite free position student and coach seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to bring up pcs communication with control and duplication control and duplication communication training stress stress giving coach wins stress students necessity to duplicate his own commands circular motions are more complex than straight lines tolerance of plus or minus randomity are apparent here and the student should probably begin on the coach with motions that begin in the same place each time and are neither very fast nor very slow nor very complex introduced by the student seeing that coach understands what is to be done as here is verbal command formal process coachs questions cch 4 1 what is tone 40 motion

auditors and instructors arc break assessments these lists are valuable intelligently used they put an auditor or scientology staff or executive at cause over all session arc breaks and scientology upsets the following assessments are for use in finding bypassed charge in various auditing activities the source of all arc breaks is bypassed charge there is other source of arc breaks the type of charge that can be bypassed varies from one auditing activity to another r3r 3n etc therefore different lists for assessment are necessary for different routines in auditing another list for general auditing is also necessary everything that has been written about bypassed charge is valid all bypassed charge is in some degree missed withhold missed by both auditor and pc having these lists for assessment there is excuse for an arc break to long continue in session or for anyone to remain arc broken with scientology the following assessments find what kind of charge has been missed it is then up to the auditor to locate it more precisely as to character and time and indicate it to the pc the pc will feel better the moment the right type of bypassed charge is identified by assessment and indicated by the auditor if the pc does not feel better but further arc breaks then the assessment is either incomplete or incorrect many complicated ways exist for charge to be bypassed there is reason to go into these you will find it is always bypassed charge and that it could have been located and indicated in any arc break r2h is the training process for use of these lists in r2h devoted to in auditing or when an arc break is found in past auditing session during an r2h session the type of list that applied to that session is used there are four ways of using these lists the first is to assess by elimination and come up with one list line still reading on the meter and indicate it as the charge to the pc the second is to go down list taking each one that reads and clearing it up with the pc finishing the whole list and then finally indicate what read the most the third way is like the second except that the pc is required to help find what made the type of charge read and actually identify it as particular thing the fourth way is to assess only for biggest read or one line and have the pc help spot it the third way is the one most commonly used at the end of session where it is just cleaning up the session and each question is completely cleaned on the needle in turn the first way is most used on violent arc breaks the second or the fourth ways are used in r2hassessment often has to be done through dirty needle effort is made to clean it up before assessment and just because the needle is dirty is reason to call them all in learn to read through dn for both arc break assessments and dating it is rather easy to do with mark v meter as the characteristic of the dn shifts when one is in effort has been made here to convert the words to nonscientology language as the sense would be lost to scientologist these lists are all barebone and contain only the usual types of bypassed charge they may be added to as experience with them increases they become too unwieldy when they are too long the only way you can get confused as to how to locate and indicate charge is by finding the wrong charge general arc break assessment used in general sessions of all kinds where an arc break has occurred or at session end in all routines and for r2h the prefix sentence in this session has is used when cleaning up session at its end or during the session at that time had is used for r2h the actual date may be occasionally substituted for time to keep the pc oriented but only if necessary list l1 withhold been missed some emotion been rejected some

l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6307c09 shspec281 the free being the shsbc is the place that you have been coming to for the last trillion trillion years it is lrhs job to make auditors who can clear up the track if we hadnt waited so long it would have been easier but two things prevented its being done sooner 1 the state of civilization 2 the previous failure to realize that the cycle was the cycle of loss of the ot being now had come to the point of believing that the only safe place to be was in meatbody civilization the fight the quality of life had been lost peculiarly enough freedom as an ot has come down almost into pi say to 500 years ago for some but they were lost too there is way to obtain and maintain stability as an ot as things stand what is peculiar about this war on ots was that it was lost by the most powerful all battles are won by combination of force and intelligence given enough force you dont need much intelligence viz nuclear bombs but then all you get is shortterm win long term win is achieved only by balance between force and intelligence intelligence alone is never enough for instance in the communist takeover of tibet the wise men of tibet were powerless to prevent it there is an imbalance in any defeat any coordinated civilization combining technology with force and keeping force and intelligence balanced can make monkey out of an ot literally there is an implant four galaxies over that taught you that you came from apes the whole darwinian theory is implanted there in about day in fact thetans had different tastes relative to bodies for instance some liked caveman cultures and some didnt this is not evolution it is just different mockups for thetans the civilizations of treetop premen and of cavemen were just two different styles with evolution between them the deterioration of matter is not nearly as rapid as scientists think it is and the earth has been here much longer than they think carbon14 dating methods the measurement of time elapsed by deterioration of atoms doesnt work because this deterioration doesnt occur as fast as scientists think suns in this area have been burning for at least 200 trillion years dark stars suns that look as though they have gone out were never lit they dont go out so society is full of misapprehensions and stupidities that themselves act as traps these stupidities are intelligently conceived as means of cohesing society ignorance is used by the intelligent as means of entrapment if everyone remains ignorant of the society nobody can get out of it so they have choice but to cooperate and keep society going so these meatbody societies operate on combination of mediocre intelligence and mediocre force they make the airplane and the space ship and progress further then they disintegrate societies repeat patterns over and over again thetans get on different kicks and make these societies but beware of societies with as much progress as there is on this planet various unusual forces are at work here this planet is evolving unusually fast because for one thing it is being used as dumping ground it is on the periphery of the galaxy sun 12 is handy to other galaxies and to the center of this galaxy it is still being used as dumping ground for that reason this planet has very heterogenous society and lots of trouble because one is guiding it most planets have some guiding thetan these dont change they are rather like little play town there is master hand guiding this planet if there were there would be far less trouble than there is when you take thetans that have been indoctrinated to have certain types of societies in bodies that have been mocked up and then they get scooped up and dumped as unwanted in one place you have lots of different impulses at work one with the other this produces lots of friction that is what our society is this society belongs nominally to the espinol united stars or the espinol united moons planets and asteroids this quarter of the universe is ours this is sun 12 there has been command post occupied for this system now since 1150 ad at the time when group on mars was finally abolished and vanished you notice that at that time there was suddenresurgence in science and learning it became an uncontrolled civilization and one has been paying any attention to the dumping that has been going on since nobody took any interest in this system and it has been running wild ever since that time probably the most basic impulse on the planet is simply the basic impulse of thetans who have been reduced to more or less meat body level which is total cooperation with one another as you see in communism we are all equal there must be personalities of any kind and the cult of personalities must be banished this is the least common denominator of implants and indoctrination the notion that they must have teammates why did you arrive on this planet in the condition you are in good reason particularly certainly not just because of the overtmotivator sequence though you will try to find the overts you did that pulled it in you are still trying to be reasonable and intelligent about it you think that there had to be reason it is true that you have overts but the only reason you were ever punished was for being you for being powerful and for not being quite intelligent enough the exact crimes were to be there and to communicate once upon time some ot came along and for fun put together civilization complete with curbstones and hairdos some other thetan came along and interfered in some way so to get even the first thetan would indoctrinate his pet society on how to trap big thetan so this became the most accomplished skill that meat body society had how to trap spirit ot was ever so out of his mind as to depend upon any of his men or troops to untrap him he never taught them to do that because at the time he was doing this it never occurred to him that he would be caught singularly unintelligent it isnt this universe that did it you were just knuckleheaded not enough intelligence was used proportional to the force tributes to god are tributes to the workings of an ot creating the entire universe seems like very intelligent action but it was knuckleheaded because one worked out how to reverse it to unbuild it to cause things to asis this lack of intelligence was recently dramatized by frankie the limpers funding the atom bomb without building defense against it ots in the past have employed too much force and too little intelligence an ot could build anything atoms molecules suns traps but he didnt bother to figure out how to turn it off when he got tired of it the problem came from an insistence on matter that was to endure forever this was not smart eventually that is what theta poles were made of thats the pole youve been on confounded things last forever its possible to be trapped for over 135 trillion trillion years the tech for trapping thetans is vast but there is nothing on how do you get him off of it here is problem how can you free thetans when there are ots left all an ot has to do is to pull the trapped thetan off and toss him out in space to cool off seems simple but it requires an ot and what if there isnt any einstein was dead wrong he only contributed to the ignorance by which you get trapped space wagons used to travel trillions of light years per day teleportation is pipe dream you just unmock body here and mock it up there its not the same atoms the skill of making matter disappear has been grievously neglected like the tech of how to free thetan the failure to teach meat body society equally to free or to trap was just unintelligent this situation is like the phenomenon of stuck or single flows in processing where if you run motivators long enough the pc will give you an overt you can always get trouble when you run only one side of flow that is important to you because it says where you sit as being at this exact moment and why you are interested in the technology before you and why it is appearing at this time everyone will tell you that this technology is impossible it isnt it is only neglected they think it is impossible because they have outflowed the reverse technology the technology isnt neglected because the lack of it didnt cause societies trouble it did the galactic confederation is in trouble right now because of this lack the confederation operates on alimited ot basis its hierarchy of command is that of limited level of ot and it goes down from ots at the top to the doll body as the ship captain and the post captain and down to meat bodies it is one of the few civilizations that has endured long time just because it has used these different levels they have tried to maintain nochange condition which is dangerous and impossible if you dont improve you decline the problem of the galactic confederation is that they have run out of the ots that are needed to command units that is the limiting factor on how big they could be since not once in 80 trillion years has anyone ever suggested repairing ots they have static and therefore declining society ots get peculiar they get fitful they get moody they can get keyed in and all they could do about it was to subdue the errant thetan turn sleeplight on him tell him to get more solid and take him down to the hospital i know i was there i was the guy they did it to if the technology of untrapping is so vital why hasnt someone worked on it because they are afraid of the technology governments would fear ots if they knew about them the galactic federation of course does they would worry about how you could maintain the social strata and the fixed organization if every janitor could be an ot it would be fine if you could restrict the technology to ots but it would spread to doll body and meat body beings they would fear the social and political upset that would occur if you freed thetans youd have to give them political solution which was as great as the political threat you cannot give them tech without taking responsibility for it or nobodyd listen to you people on earth dont think that scientology doesnt work but theyve been trained against the vector of it theyve been trained to destroy to entrap to set up fixed status of something and then work out destructive means of entrapment with it so people cannot leave certain social and economic strata of the society you are not up against pavlov freud etc you pose tremendous threat to the social structure of our current civilization you can tear it to pieces by rehabilitation of thetans tremendous power and force which can only be safe if there is also tremendous intelligence connected with it so that the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics will be produced for instance an ot can pull the air cover mammoths have been found in the polar regions with freshfrozen vegetables in their stomachs to explain this phenomenon it would be necessary to explain the fact that they must have been quickfrozen in sixty seconds in tropical region what natural cataclysm could have taken place in sixty seconds somebody pulled the air cover and gave the planet reverse spin because they got mad an ot who could do such thing in fit of pique would be terribly dangerous an overt act doesnt just damage it damages the greater number of dynamics one can commit an overt act unintentionally by lacking data or not using sufficient intelligence to see what really is for the greatest good but really heavy overt act is one where one deliberately sets out to damage the greater number of dynamics keep this in mind during secchecking you should be looking for actions that are really harmful to greater number of dynamics not just some irresponsible actions an overt act is often realized after the fact you could have done it smarter way that wouldnt have been an overt so you get regret and hungup overts you seldom find anything in this lifetime that is real deliberate overt it has been awhile since the guy had power enough to do real overt some thetans will take on their shoulders more responsibility than is rightfully theirs however running dubbedin overts wont get them anywhere but under all that there is real overt of magnitude phase of this universe has taken place and ended the phase of the free being the free being has lost to solid unintelligent meanlevel societies another cycle opens up now this new cycle involves different kind of being one that is as strong as the old but experienced not as stupid because now you know what the score is now you have good reality on meat body society and can see their political frailties and the impossibility of obliterating them because they start again elsewhere they can be managed handled helped or thrown on reverse vector the use of intelligence with force can maintain freedom of action without racking up new bank and new overts new war against the thetan there has never been lasting or intelligent society of free beings for asisness has dropped out as an ability and needs to be putback in but such society is needed since everyone on his own puts everyone downscale in the long run if freedom means total irresponsibility up and down the line you are not talking about freedom you are talking about catastrophe we dont need war we need balanced technology with the ability to meld force and intelligence we need knowhow and force not knowhow in the use of force we need balanced intelligence that can reverse what one does unmocking matter as well as making it freeing as well as entrapping if you know how to enslave people you should know how to free people if you are going to make up matter dont insist that it be indestructible in dealing with meat body societies dont just stir up the ant hill it will just disperse and continue to grow the era of total irresponsibility is over long cycle is over in this universe the cycle of the free being vs the meat body society is over the battle was lost and the free being doesnt exist anymore we shift gears by just putting some intelligence in with the force freedom with barriers is insupportable there is nothing in this case to be free from or to push against freedom must be worked for if you think that you will stay clear or ot just by

the required skills of processing and why here is where we stand and where were going an auditor to make clear or ot has to be able to handle confidently certain skills today we assume that every successful process we ever had is and was valid process we are at point of summation and valuation as we are achieving excellent and steady progress even on the most unlikely cases i consider that the period of basic mental research has ended and the period of adjustment of skills on which i will for some time be engaged has been entered upon i list here the auditor skills which are requisite to handle any case skills by case level case levels 8 7 and 6 objective processes reach and withdraw commands cchs havingness processes case levels 7 6 and 5 model session repetitive command processes r2h meter reading simple assessment of form case levels 6 5 4 and 3 assessment of levels listing and nulling lists r3r 3n these constitute to use another table the following exact skills handling the pcs body as in reach and withdraw or 8c ability to execute the auditing cycle ability to give repetitive commands ability to handle meter ability to run model session and keep the pc in sessionability to read tone arm ability to accurately meter date ability to run r2h ability to locate and handle arc breaks ability to assess simple form ability to find level ability to list complete and nul list ability to run r3r ability to do 3n ability to do form line plot for gpm ability to do line plot for an offbeat gpm ability to list for and find goal ability to list for and find top oppterm knowledge of the time track knowledge of the thetan knowledge of the basics of life general knowledge of scientology note the abilities of r3r r3n and r2h are also listed separately in the above these briefly are the skills required to make an ot they are well taught at saint hill they are practised in central orgs as fast as released hco bulletins exist on nearly all this material except some fine points of r3r which are known but not yet written up and some of the r3n line plots not yet issued basic skills if you examine the above you will find that where the auditor cannot do the required skill the faults are only one or more of the following cannot execute the auditing cycle cannot execute an auditing cycle repetitively cannot handle session cannot read meter cannot study and apply scientology data given the ability to execute the auditing cycle once or repetitively handle session read meter and study and apply procedures all the above listed auditing skills are easily acquired and successfully done therefore in looking for the reasons for results one finds the failure to apply the required procedure and in tracing that one inevitably finds one or more of these five basics amiss in the auditorit is longer question of whether scientology works it is only question of whether the auditor can work scientology if he or she cant then the trouble lies in one or more of these basics the trouble does not lie with the procedure or with the pc of course some procedures above are harder to do than others and some pcs can worry an auditor far more than others but these are incidental and are very junior to the five basics above the lower the case level of the auditor the harder time he or she will have grasping the knowhow and using it for instance squirrel is only dramatizing case level 6 or 7 student having rough time is case level 6 or 5 somebody almost heartbreaking to teach is case level 7 or 8 but with alert guidance and even making mistakes i have seen case levels from 3 to 8 alike getting wins and finally smoothing out on the five basics above ive seen it myself in the past two years of training at saint hill so ive discarded case level as an index of auditing ability it is only an index of howhardtotrain the question of psychotic or neurotic does not enter these are artificial states and have real bearing surprisingly enough on case level my belief in an auditors ability to audit has far more bearing on his auditing than his or her aberrations the only factor left is auditor judgment this varies about and improves with wins but processes are so arranged that it is question only of what is the highest process that gives ta action rather than presession case estimation trial and error is the best test i would use it myself for i have often found the most unlikely preclear at first glance capable of running high level processes and some very capable people at casual inspection unable to see wall so i always run the highest level that i hope pc can run and revise on experience with the pc if necessary former training as all modern courses and academies have stressed basic skills as above for some time past training has been lost those who learned r212 are much better fitted to do r3r and 3n than those who did not we look on any auditor today to be able to do repetitive processes but remember that was sometimes hardwon ability and old book and bottle was developed to assist it people who learned prehav assessing or goals finding are definitely well progressed anyone who can do the cchs successfully will always find them handy so i count training lost and i am about to collect all earlier processes that worked on psychosomatic ills and publish them since being careful not to do healing has not protected us at all and we might as well take over the medical profession for i now find that only their trade association has been firing at us in the press so that opens up use for almost all training on processes ever given if an auditor has learned the above basics he or she can easily do the long list of skills required for clearing or ot clearing we can clear to keyedout clear or clear stably i have considered it necessary to stress thorough clearing we are on longer road but more certain and stable road when we erase the time track or sections of it clear is now case level 2the main goal however is ot due to the general situation when we were attacked i decided on policy of 1 hold the line on the legal front and 2 accelerate research to ot as our best means of handling the situation both these policies are being successful in the extreme and i hope you agree with them by courtesy one gpm run gives first goal clear further test is done one chain of engrams completed is an r3r onechain clear this is easier than you might think theta clear at this time is case level 2 that is exterior ot is case level 1 complete with skills rehabilitated the route to these states is very well established and is contained in the first list above hours of processing cases require as many hours as they are located on the case level scale the lower they are the more hours they require the higher they are the less they require as some index i have had about 800 hours lately including all techniques from r212 forward much of it purely research auditing on myself as pc developing procedures and getting line plots barely 250 hours of this was effective auditing and i am definitely on the easy last half to ot in period of about half that mary sue achieved 10 goal clear and has just completed her first assessed r3r chain this included all the r3 goals work the research of r212 on her as pc as well as r3n and r3r effective auditing given the data now known amounted to about 150 hours or less guess to ot given skilled auditor and training on all modern data as above and an able pc would be less than 500 hours to one chain r3r clear this expectancy is being fulfilled on the saint hill course for those now in z unit to this would have to be added any processing time necessary to get the pc up to r3r i consider that ot lies on the sunny side of 1000 hours of processing now for cases that can be audited difficulty of clearing case is really easy higher state attained is an uphill fight so dont underestimate the difficulty of clearing we went too long on the time track before developing and working at scientology but we can do it and it is lot more than worthwhileit is vital that we do do it if we miss now we may be finished for there is help elsewhere and there never has been this technology or any successful mental technology and just now nobody cares but us when weve succeeded all the way everybody will want on but not yet my own job is very far from an end the job of getting the purely technology developed and organized is practically over unless you consider recording of the full technology as part of the job ive only recorded essentials and am just writing the last bulletins on those butahead is vast panorama of research on other dynamics and enormous amounts of other technology lrhdrrd l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6307c10 shspec282 auditing skills for r3r some of the material in this tape is also to be found in hcob 9jul63 technical summary the required skills of processing and why we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an ot unfortunately they are not simple and they are numerous but they break down to about five skills which must be perfect they are 1 the ability to follow an auditing cycle 2 the ability to give it repetitively 3 the ability to read meter very well 4 the ability to read understand and follow the procedure of bulletin 5 the ability to get and keep pc in session any time an auditor cannot handle an upper level procedure it is because of the fact that he cannot do one of these five basic things as an auditing supervisor knowing this will enable you to get auditing done if the auditor cannot get results with process it is one of these skills not the process is awry amount of persuasion will overcome the lack of one of these skills you like to think that you are up against case level in training an auditor low case level does make it harder to teach some people but if you make that criterion of whether you can train someone you will lose there is case requirement for training you mustnt q and with the i cant of someone if you make him do it you make him right not wrong to agree with the i cant is q and aing with his aberration the d of t must never be permitted to refuse student because getting into the practice of doing so leads to limiting who can be trained to the point where auditing gets done when the instructor says yes you cant the instructor is invalidating the reactive mind and the students ability to audit deteriorates rapidly it takes some people little longer to get towards those basics and just do them but if you keep at it they will get there complex technology like r3r will show up the weak points in any of your five basics for instance given what you are handling in r3r if you q and you get major bad reactions 2 and occurs when the auditor doesnt make his intention stick in the session he tends to become the effect of the pc the level of error is always stupidly elementary and has nothing to do with what process you are running or how complicated that is r3n and r3r look very complicated they have lot of steps and lots of doingness but if you can do the basics of auditing you will have trouble it is fantastic to have process that runs engrams by rote all that can give you real trouble in r3r is wrong date and wrong duration which can result from faulty meter reading or faulty dating procedure it is difficult for an expert meter reader to get dates and durations of engrams if the auditor cant read the meter well wrong date doesnt mean minor wrongness it is something grossly wrong which rapidly snarls up the time track wrong date produces bypassed charge and grouped track the bpc is fantastic if person has his attention on date or something it will tick once on the meter even if it isnt the right date hence you can q and you might say that dubin case is just someone who has his dates mixed up you could probably cure dubin by accurate dating nothing drives the pc battier than to have wrong duration say the incident is really trillion years long and you give him duration of two days the pc tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident he cant because he is looking at something that happened two days before so it stays all black and gruesome when you get that phenomenon you reduration the incident what made r3r workable is that pc has perception on any incident that isproperly dated and durationed that is where perceptics lie there are only three reasons for perception 1 wrong date 2 wrong duration 3 it has gpm in it wrong assessment and overrun chain already flat give you ta but not necessarily perception the incident can get obscured if it has gpm in it because black energy goes up and obscures the engram this was caused by the pcs protest in the incident when lights go off in an incident look for gpm if that happens you have to get the pc to straighten out the gpm by taking him to the first pair of items in it get the motion out pick up another pair of items get the ta motion off that pair etc just clean it up rapidly then run it as an engram it is never very long or very difficult to run there is point where r3r and r3n cross start the case on r3r and pick up any implants that turned up while running r3r check for an implant on the duration step if you get onto the helatrobus implant clean them up get the first pair of items and discharge them with rocket reads etc then go back to r3r use r3n as the adjunct it is there are some technical details that you have to know these include 1 how to assess an arc break 2 what lists one should use 3 ability to do an accurate and thorough l and n to complete but not overlisted list the source of arc breaks on lists is incompleteness of lists you can however assess prepared arbitrary list without fear of having the incomplete list phenomena turn on because the pc never started the list so it isnt complete but in regular list in order to get the items you do have to be able to do l and n which includes metering if you are having trouble with r3r be sure that your difficulties do not stem from troubles with getting in ruds or say writing while watching the meter learn to audit by fundamentals and you will have trouble with procedure that just combines the fundamentals your main danger as an auditor is being too complicated recognize that the simplicities of the game are what make it hang together and work wrong date and wrong duration are the only things that give you trouble wrong assessment is very junior and generally just gives you ta because wrong date and wrong duration are such lies it is difficult for the pc to asis them and what happens to the track when you move to wrong date it is very hard to get the right date and duration to read even when the pc is in session and you are on the right chain date is easier than duration because the beginning of the incident is so hard for pcs to see especially at the beginning one source of wrong assessment is overrun when you try to go earlier than basic case levels 5 6 and 7 see pp 414415 above all have channel through the bank on which the pc has reality where he can be run on engrams without dubin using r3r so if you find that channel and run the pc in it the pc wins and can go on up6307c16 shspec284a b preliminary steps of r3r this is demo session on two sides of tape of lrh auditing msh doing the preliminary assessment for r3r as given in hcob 1ju163 routine 3r bulletin 4 preliminary step6307c11 shspec283 arc breaks the trouble with arc break assessments is that you will generally have to do them on pc with dirty needle dont suppose you can or should clean up the needle first since all dirty needles are arc breaks you dont try to clean the needle and then assess for the arc break the only thing that will clean up the arc break is the list all you have to do is to follow very strictly the rule of the instant read and never miss an auditor who could do that would be pearl and that makes arc break assessment splendid training device if there were arc breaks on the persons track the fact of button going out would not cause dirty needle for instance suppress reads because it is sitting on chain of arc breaks there are two elements here 1 the thetans reaction to the experience he has bad with mest and significance 2 the mest and significance itself nothing has to be observed in order to be cf bishop berkeley and his tree falling in the middle of the forest thetans reaction to mest and significance must involve some contact with it but it can exist without being perceived the relation between the mest significance and the thetans reaction is communication to be affected by something one must communicate with it or knowingly not communicate with it this fact eliminates lot of philosophical baloney deliberate notknow of something can get thetan in trouble what gets the thetan in trouble is that he has been there and didnt communicate and he made picture of it or protested it and now he doesnt want to confront the picture either because the significance in the picture has been added to by his reaction of not wanting to communicate to it so thetans reaction becomes part of all observed or carefully not observed mest significance this then is the new significance of the thetans reaction at the time which made into mental image picture becomes the time track the past is different from the present in that the thetans picture of the past has had the thetans reaction added into it in mockups of future track hope or hopelessness is also added in so the future also has reaction added into it it is not often made up into pictures though it sometimes is it is just whole cloth dreamups not pressures against the physical universe or actual pictures however you can cause somebody to run future track so what you are auditing is thetans reactions to events gpms with their balanced masses float on the track and seem to be in pt to the pc if you want to horrify someone scatter him out of pt that the pc thinks is right there if you cant get read on dating facsimile that you know is there ask if it is tomorrow or yesterday this will shake the pc out of pt and you will get read however the pc usually arc breaks when you do this you are dealing with past that seems to be present time that requires reaction to it but has already got reaction in it so thetan takes his reaction out of the past incident and wears it in present time and you have the factor of restimulation of reaction his reaction of the past becomes his reaction to the present when you have audited an engram the pcs reaction to the engram becomes part of the session time track it gives faint shadow of read if you get the pc to spot it again it is not really charged it is just the action pattern of the observed present you might even be able to get another rocket read out of helatrobus implant series at any given instant of the time track you can rekindle any given reaction the time track has reaction added to it making it different from pt pt doesnt have reaction in it except as borrowed from the track or added by the thetan you could lay out some stretch of time in which you deliberately added happiness to everything if you get someone to audit you through that time few days later you will get ridiculous amount of happiness the guy who is always looking for happiness and not finding it simply doesnt put any happiness into ptwhen you are supposed to react favorably or hopefully but you dont feel that way the confusion of conflicting significances can be so great that the whole situation seems very unreal and you want nothing more to do with it and it can chew on the back of your neck from then on you say i wont look at it and put it away on automatic if you dont stir it up life will you can get things to persist just by postulating it will persist otherwise you can only get persistence with lie the thetans reaction to mest significance is about the reality r and results in feeling of affinity or misaffinity this reaction is communication c and it is bridge between the thetan and the mest significance the reaction is monitored by past arc or lack of it concerning similar mest significance of the past this assumes that the pc can maintain detached attitude then it is simple but say your pcs needle is nice and clean and you ask him to recall an arc break that is moment of miscommunication time when some charge was bypassed which has been restimulated the pc attributes the arc break to something other than the actual bpc which introduces lie into the situation and causes the arc break to persist time condenses as the pcs reaction to the mest significance prevents him from retaining detached attitude about it all if you are involved in the middle of the battle there is time to retain detached attitude you put it on total reaction this is caused by condensation of time what we really get the brunt of in this universe is an insufficiency of time you get that by staying on the time track if you start protesting time you get too much time on your hands actually this is an unwanted location that is blamed on time you start protesting time when you have an unwanted location the basic lie on the track is to confuse time and location few trillion trillion years ago you probably didnt stick on the time track the further back you go the less you were fixed into present time you were slippery on the subject and could go yesterday and tomorrow at will as with the time machines in science fiction an ct is the only real time machine you cant change the past and future without recreating it you werent necessarily surrounded with the environment of pt this was very useful you could slip around all over the place however the drawback was that since one was fixed in time you couldnt stay in communication very easily and certain impatience was generated you got unpopular because you couldnt be fixed in one spot to be communicated with only implants could cure this there had to be major louseups to cause aberration on the subject only gpm implants could do it if you have fixed time you get fixed reaction because it is an enforced thereness you cant drift out of the incident you have very little time and it is the unwanted absence or presence of time that gives all problems you could clean up problems by running tell problem you have had what time was awry there where was there too muchtoo little time this isnt especially workable being rather limited but you could probably get some changes shred the bank bit and move him on the track time is made insufficient by economics you could also adjust problems by attack on location less effectively but you could you can actually find the spot in space and do reach and withdraw that is why spotting spots in space works if someone had an accident with car and tree you could run reach and withdraw on the car and the tree all impact is based on scarcity of time you need some very complex mechanisms to cause facsimiles to stay with person in pt bothering them all the time with them reacting against them all the time to build up tremendous lot of reactions which then becomes the personality of the individual thats theonly trick that is the chief engram that is what makes engrams unrunnable but now with r3r we can run them your reaction to mest significance is couched in various ways where those reactions tend to not communicate or to obsessively communicate you rough up energy then it stays in the picture ie it is flowing at one foot per second and you get it flowing at three feet per second but it isnt really flowing that fast or you prevent it from flowing at one foot per second and make it flow at one inch per second ie the normal course of flows is interrupted because of the existence of problem or an obsession to be at it or feeling that you have got to get away from it or that it is bad the result is that you bypass charge it is former reactions that get rekindled there which then throw old pictures into restimulation since the pc doesnt spot the old pictures the present reaction is somewhat inexplicable and he misses the charge the auditor locates and indicates it and the pc feels better what has been handled is not the facsimile itself but the reaction factor part which since it is the thetans reaction is the part most intimate to him it is similarity of reaction therefore that pulls in earlier similars cf getting the emotion somatic or attitude and running chains of that the only thing that caused restimulation of yesterdays charge was the fact that you reacted the same way today that you reacted yesterday the devil with the situation the reaction was the same and for that reason you pulled in yesterdays situation and didnt even know it youre not interested in running out yesterdays association as facsimile all you want is to clip out one little piece of it which is reaction reactionectomy when you indicate the charge you are actually matched terminalling the past reaction and the present reaction and they can go bzzzt and the reaction or charge can vanish that is all you handle with an arc break assessment not the facsimile of yesterdays mest significance you dont have to know any more than that there was an earlier similar arc break the way to get pc into an incident is to ask him to find the largest object in it and tell you about it he will go right into the incident the thetans reaction to mest significance is manifested as arc your and my quarrels with many things that are wrong with the world is because our reactions are quite different from other peoples reactions to the same things hence to know everything is to forgive everything you get down past the reactions to the actual mest significance on an arc break all you handle is reactions not facsimiles in other words you dont run r3r on arc breaks you handle reactions the arc break assessment lists are just lists of bypassable charge so they vary depending on what activity you are engaged in arc breaks never rekindle until they key in an arc break is always keyin it is never the fact but the followup you can almost always get the missed withhold question to read on the arc break assessment list because that is the common denominator of arc breaks it requires missed withhold to key in an arc break there could be something far more fundamental than the missed withhold which wont read because of the pcs preoccupation with the missed withhold you can run the missed withhold and then still have to run the arc break if all you find is the keyin not the correct bypassed charge the arc break just keys in all the more the missed withhold only keyed it in on bypassed charge lists you may find the keyin and still have to run out the charge cf getting in buttons in ruds etc so missed withhold will read on almost any list it is on but there is most likely more that has to be found you should continue the list or reassess make sure that you are using the right list if nothing reads you are on the wrong list all you have to do to clear up an arc break is to locate and indicate the correct bypassed charge if it takes more than that you didnt find the correct bypassed charge if you dont know that you will give up using the system because you think that it is not invariably workable one reason for failure to cure an arc break is using the wrong list for assessment this could happen if there was little time spent on some other action which you and the pc had forgotten about6307c16 shspec255 tips on running r3r auditing engrams and gpms is new world to many auditors especially to those who learned different kind of engram handling this doesnt invalidate yesterdays techniques they have their place especially in the field of healing we can heal things although we have neglected this area of responsibility for which reason we are being attacked in the area so we will collect and publish what we can do r212 for instance can have fantastic results when done as limited process just dont do more than four oppositions on one item get one ri do two or three oppositions and be happy with it the pc has been beaten down by his experiences on the whole track he thinks nothing good can happen in the universe when one goodness occurs it is almost too much for him to have that is different zone of expectancy from making clears and ots people wouldnt be able to conceive what you meant if you said that you were making clears and ots although in fact they would believe you and feel very uneasy about it you would have restimulated bypassed charge and they will always get cross with you in all auditing dont stir up more charge than you can handle if you apply that to any process you run or to any program you formulate you will have happy pcs the worse off case is the less you stir up this goes directly in the teeth of the q and that is yesteryears mental sciences the effect scale has to be observed at low levels the person cannot receive much of an effect so you have to featherweight the effect to let the pc receive it the more desperate the case the more featherweight the cure the technology of the preliminary assessment step for r3r lowers the level on which it will be effective that bypasses the ordinary defenses of the mind so when you do such an assessment the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle applies in neon lights if you are auditing case at level 7 6 or 5 see pp 414415 above for description of these levels this person doesnt easily run engrams the assessment has located the only tiny channel on the time track where the pc can confront engrams and on which you will not find dubin that is the basis on which the process has been developed case at level 3 see p 414 above this is the case with partially visible time track can be run on any engram you can find and wont be particularly upset or damaged by wrong date or other error but case at level 6 dubin of dubin case has barge canal sixteenth of an inch wider than your barge and full of roots old stoves and curves on that channel there is dubin of dubin and with correct assessment the case will have perceptics this gives you the responsibility of handling the case very carefully by the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle because at this level there is process that will put the case back together again if it falls apart the lower the case level the fewer incidents you will find per preliminary step the chain may be only one incident long test your level after you have run an incident if it doesnt read and the pc has had some sort of cognition about it dont choose this time to go backtrack if you have an incident that the pc can run it doesnt matter how long ago the incident was if he gets ta on it runs ok and that is all there is to the incident and if there are problems finding the date and duration and if there is read on asking for an earlier incident fine do another assessment things are more likely to run longer with an upperlevel case the clue to whether the chain is flat is ta action not how far back basic is to find out if you have run the ta out of the chain be sure that the ta didnt cease because of wrong date wrong duration or gpm in the incident if none of those apply leave it those are the criteria of flattened chain the helatrobus implant goes as far back as 43 trillion years ago the situation of having the ta cease is not the same as the situation of not having gotten any ta the only reason that you have trouble with running case with ta and arc breaks comes down to these factors1 wrong assessment 2 wrong date 3 wrong duration 4 gpm in the incident that you are trying to run that you have collided with but have not found out about so you have been trying to scan the pc through the items of the gpm the worse off the case is the weirder the assessments will look to you the pc may run something well that is from the backtrack and still be lowlevel case so dont take the recentness of the incident as adjudicative of case level dating anything beyond an easily available incident becomes very difficult you are very likely to misdate and pass by incidents and the pc will know it too gpms are hard to date anyway being timeless and pc will have trouble staying in place on the time track this can also happen with upperlevel cases but they can take it lowerlevel case will plow in thoroughly the preliminary steps on level 4 see above this is dubin case or level 3 lead inevitably to gpm it is about the fastest way to find goal you ever heard of if the case is running well you can probably run the whole goals series right there any trouble you have with running case all goes back to the four factors given above wrong assessment includes running something that has not been assessed on lowerlevel case you can spend more time assessing than running the engrams test the level after you have something flat dont run over the pcs head when you have flattened the chain leave it the worse off the case is the more it moves from nonsense to murder so dont muddy the little channel you have to work in listen to what the pc tells you about what he wants to run but assess before you run it the way you make work for yourself as an auditor is by doing things that you shouldnt be doing for instance dont mix r3n and r3r dont switch from one to the other by mistake there is point on the track where you can get back of and find the basic of all gpms ive hit that point i havent got it so i can hold it steady i got there by the way by keying out had an awful time recently working out the most vicious series of gpms on the track there are five pictures but the first one is invisible goal with them just opposing items in dichotomy four firing five times in row for each picture i ran into myself on the track trying to figure this out i gave up took two sessions to get it unwound and the first picture is invisible so youd always try to put picture there so basic is always missing it makes vacuum and pictures pour in thats why later gpms accumulate pictures you get in the habit this is the vacuum that holds the whole bank together when he contacted this lrh could hear gpms coming apart all the way down to pt obviously you dont try something like this on lowerlevel pc desperate conditions are hard to maintain in the face of featherweight touches but heavier measures like bypassing too many goals in r3n wont help the case it is always ok to push pc little heavier than they can go but the rougher the case the less they can take the arc break is good test if the pc arc breaks regularly dont always blame yourself except for overestimating the state of case and running the process too steep there is real excuse for running pc poorly but if you put the pc in an available channel he will run like doll buggy if you run him right do careful assessment after every flattened chain checking carefully for wrong date or duration or gpm in it pcs that dont assess easily on the standard scale can be gotten to extend it auditing is as easy to do as it is real to the pc6307c17 shspec286 dating accuracy in dating is the single most important function of the auditor since last october lrh has been studying something with intensity it took the preceding couple of years to determine that goals and related mental phenomena come down to engrams and the time track the difficulty with running engrams from 1950 on was the number of cases that couldnt run the time track years were spent on improving cases in october the time track assumed greater importance up to the point where lrh discovered that the gpm was an implant at that point we had to discover whether or not person could go clear without running the time track and engrams there had already been lot of failures with getting people to run on the time track lrh has always operated on the assumption that everyone could make it to ot few weeks ago he had to consider whether only fifty percent could go on to ot this was serious question which he had never before wondered about research since october has been very rough it has had to be done more rapidly because it was obvious that we didnt have much time left as proven by the january fda raid that was one reason that lrh decided to bypass clear and go for ot clear is an an aberrated comfortable human state which society can accept ot is something else it is like making playground supervisor vs commando with the government attack on scientology we had time margin to let us take care of clear first then go for ot so we are into research concerning how to make an ot when you accelerate research you get problems because you have taken time out where you need time in the last few months the work lrh has done per unit of time exceeds anything previously attempted the fact that if you cant run the time track youll never get to ot emerged however what also emerged was that with r3r if you get the right chain with the right date and duration you can get anyone to run with sonic and visio that wasnt solution unless the pc also got ta action ta action is the key to all case progress because it measures charge blown hence improved reality and better ability to confront the track the pcs reality must improve or he cant go any earlier on the track if you process someone without ta you would be doing him more good by taking him for walk in the park ta motion tells you how much mass you are discharging off the reactive bank where ta is not moving you are not discharging mass you can tell in the records that this is happening by observing that the same goals are being set for every session and the pc is getting only lukewarm gains that coordinates with ta action that was what caused lrh to wonder if fifty percent would never make it to ot there was the thin hope that by running lower level processes you could get enough charge off so that the pc could run track with ta it was pretty frail hope doing this could produce keyedout clears but that is not good enough the world is going down fast and new solutions are appearing to handle crises we are the only new factor in the world in order to meet the present situation the scientologist in the us will have to produce at least spectacular case results or spectacular being the problem now is what is absence of ta ta action disappears off case to the degree that time is in error and there is the answer ta does not cease because you have run wrong goal or from arc breaks or failure to run gpm it is because of wrong time time is the single source of human aberration this datum now emerges as more important truth than we had realized the gpm is totally devoted to scrambling someones time so if you cant get the gpms off the case you cant unaberrate him gpms are hard to date but they must be gotten off the case gpms have characteristic sound there is slow statement of the goal in earlier gpms this was preceded by crack so they sounded like this spat ssssssssssss spat non sen si cal ly spat part of the aberrative factor is the pcs effort to speed it up to get it to run at speed that he is comfortable with he is speedy sometimes peoplecant get rocket reads off of items because they dont duplicate the speed of the items they go very slowly the the thetan thinks why doesnt it get over with the doublefiring principle of gpms also messed up the thetan and hung him up in time it gave positive or negative charge to two opposing sentiments it hit him from the right and from the left it made him feel as though he couldnt move but had to move to get out of the way of it he would also get into timescrambler the total purpose of the gpm was to scramble time gpm engrams are the hardest engrams to date pc cant scan through gpm you have to use repeater technique because if you try to scan through it it all goes black because the pc protested it all the way through in running it you rekindle the protest he had when he got the implant that turns the engram black then you cant see anything in it and he cant move on the track and he is all frozen up in the thing the only thing that stops ta action is wrong dates wrong time and ta action equals processing the perfection of your auditing alone wont solve this so dating accurately is necessary to get ta action this doesnt mean dating down to the last microsecond your errors are the gross ones eg dating something at 945 years ago and it is really 145 trillion years ago very approximate dates back in the trillions of trillions of years ago is vastly sloppy but it is successful enough to get ta to straighten out case where the ta has ceased you clean up on time in auditing or on dating with an eighteenbutton prepcheck you should also clean wrong dates and wrong time as long as the needle is rough on the subject this could in or out of auditing you handle by 1 finding when the wrong dates were found times when things were wrongly dated you dont at first redate these things 2 when that is all cleaned up run down what was wrongly dated and clean it up with the pc even if you have to redate it you will see ta action restored to the case you want wrong dates that the pc guessed at or assumed earlier in auditing you continue to clean up the area until the needle is really clean and all the wrongness and upset has been cleared out of the way now the pc will date easily someone who is an auditor will also need the wrong dates that he has found on pcs and his anxiety on the subject all cleaned up too if you got the right date and right duration you will get perception if the incident has gpm in it the perception goes off because you have restimulated the pcs protest dubin itself is simply phenomenon of wrong dates you could produce the effect of dubin by deliberately giving the pc wrong date and wrong duration and sending him to the wrong point on the track then you will get collection of apparently dubbedin pictures and ta wrong items are tough on pc wrong line plots are result of wrong time sometimes you will flatten chain and the ta will go up this has something to do with wrong dates more deeply seated in the case than you can overcome without reassessment the pc has overstepped his own reality if the pc has trouble whenever he goes on the backtrack because it is all unreal and he cant believe it what is his wrong date it is the notion that life began at birth his error on time is on the length of the time track this is trap mechanism clean up all his considerations on the subject and his ability to run track will change look at the entrapment value of this limitedtrack business and see how much fuss current societys savants make about past lives one protests against truth unless they have vested interest in maintaining lie every pc tends to get their track tolerance extended as they find correct dates in the portion of the track that they can run fairly easily any case will hit ceiling of reality on the subject of dating but people only creak to the degree that there is wrong timea wrong date can sneak in on you without your doing any dating for instance you assume that certain gpm is in the helatrobus implant when it is really goal that is much closer to pt by running it with the helatrobus line plot you have incorrectly dated it never leave wrong goal or even more importantly wrong date on case if the case has been run on r3r and ta action is doubtful clean up wrong dates and all possible charge on the subject of dates dating etc if case is getting ta action dont harass the pc about it but if there are arc breaks look into wrong time always also look into wrong assessment some cases are very nervy about time and wrong dates they can hardly take it if you make small error on date getting all the dates straightened out will improve this case even if nothing is run dont invalidate the pc by checking all his dates do it periodically just checking for wrong dates every now and then in session date things in terms on years ago since the pc has been on other planets with dating systems that are different from earths ad and bc the wrong date phenomena extend to other parts of auditing for instance the pc may be doing an objective process walking through the room through facsimiles of maypoles merely in the act of doing that the pc gets reality on the room and gets the pc date which straightens out the track to that extent you could date the facsimiles whenever the pc hits one and then return the pc to walking around the room you could probably take case that couldnt remember half of this lifetime and accurately date things this would give him tremendous reality on things that he had never remembered before6307c18 shspec287 errors in time the insistence on having lived only once seems odd it takes more than gpm to produce such frenzy on the subject behind all aberration and illness there must be lie aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth pavlov apparently never noticed that reward was one of the stimuli that he was observing communism based on pavlov and the physiological nature of man becomes disastrous when practiced pavlov did total anatomy of punishment but left out reward capitalism works only because one analyzed it and pay is still part of the system if capitalism were earnest about fighting communism it would dig up such truths and promulgate them punishment does not uniformly control response at all it is not constant not all beings succumb to threat of punishment the reward part of existence is at least as important men will do more for reward than to avoid punishment the more that reward is taken away eg by taxation the more difficulty society gets into the lie that man is driven animal is destroying the social structure of man as long as you are trying to isolate the truth you will be 0k matter how much trouble you have in getting at the truth the trouble starts when you settle on lie and stop looking for truth you can have misconceptions and still not go nuts but when you settle on lie and say that that is the truth you have had it the lie will pervade your life it takes lie of the only lived once magnitude to continue the aberration of man to maintain such lie must take fantastic amount of duress someone must be working at it all psychosomatic healing could probably be done by finding the lie about the somatic for instance you could use the command recall lie behind the psychosomatic what would be the most disastrous type of lie it would be one about time here is how to aberrate someone give him false time track implant him with false past complete with pictures and times times in the order of magnitude of thetans actual existence of trillions and trillions of years only wrong time will freeze case as reflected in frozen ta so this must be pervasive common denominator of aberration this suggests processes like recall lie about time or dating everything in the pcs lifetime hence the importance of history with this view of the subject of time lrh investigated to see if someone earlier had played around with peoples time in the past sure enough there were implanted times and areas of track where time was utterly confused and incomprehensible you could get guy fixed up with enough false pasts that he would dramatize them he would get the opinion that he should never return on the time track because it is too dangerous or too confusing you could confuse the guy further by giving him some incomprehensible dates r3r is good enough to be able to find moment when false past was installed date it and find its duration and then run it out the incident pretends to be trillions of years long when it was really two or three hours long the common denominator of these incidents is that the point where you approached is commonly repeated in the incident one moment is actual the other is picture of it in the incident so you get two beginnings as well as two departures commonly such implants also have mechanism showing troops marching to the pc the beginning and troops marching away the end with numbers running along the sides of these implanted pictures to give their times the implant will often have these pictures of beginning and end reversed it is very confusing the way you can tell false track is that it really doesnt move there is time in false track for all the details between major events and the sound is seldom included true time track is more sequitur but can have periods of anaten the reason the pc is likely to be on false track is that most of it except for the beginning and end points is safer and less uncomfortable than actual track false track is lie about time it may have dates neatly placed on the sides one thing you can say about false track is that gpm is on false track this would be pointless they may beimplants but they are not on false track so if you are running gpm it is not the false time track you can find gpms and date them there are two things that you want to know when you find an incident and date it 1 does it contain oppositefiring items in which case it is gpm 2 does it contain any false past you need this data discouraging though it seems to say so on false track be especially alert for false date and duration the darwinian theory is just an implant putting out the idea that man is mud it starts with goal to persist they have you in cell so they start by showing you being in cell then they show you pictures of your arriving in the cell to be implanted then they show you complete with pictures like movie all that has happened to you this is background data that lets you know how mean you are then they show you being implanted while you are watching you are having the hell picked out of you by electronic mass stacking around your body you are hit with electronic waves and the mass becomes associated with the pictures nothing at all is said there is sonic in this incident some false pasts do have sonic but beware of running things in these incidents that arent there the darwinian implant makes evolution appear true but it isnt when there are horses on planet it is because someone came along and mocked up some horses this sort of false past implant was done lot before the helatrobus implants some was also done after the helatrobus implants you have to know about this in order to get dates corrected you have to know that some are false not just wrong look for false pasts not false dates per the time track can also contain false future fortune tellers practice this to this day someone who is always trying to know the future is just dramatizing false future implant sound and motion are seldom found in false track incidents rather these incidents tend to jump from still to still more like lantern slides than movie the helatrobus dear gorilla and glade implants dont use pictures the helatrobus implant only uses pictures of railway and house in the gorilla and bear implants they have guy with pink striped shirt with monkey or sometimes gorilla that they put on the cart with you this is not the same as getting whole set of pictures that purport to be your past or future while getting electronic blasts false track can get in the way of running actual track some of it is pretty incredible but if false past doesnt read go ahead and run it run it anyway even if it is false maybe you will be able to find the real beginning however it is hard to find the beginning of falsepast incident when you run across something in session handle it but dont louse up your pc when you start correcting dates you will run into false pasts and futures so beware of redating just get in and clean up first the fact that it is false past and run it so you wont have it in the way if you locate source of wrong dates dont ask for another source of wrong dates run the one you have here is rule when you have your hands on an incident that contains false past or future run it with r3r to get it off the track get its actual duration the real beginning of the incident and also its end are hard to find since such incidents generally have two beginnings and two ends dont do anything extraordinary just be prepared to re duration it if necessary dont just redate it and leave it because thousands of dates will have been restimulated in the course of auditing and finding it again will be difficult apart from the fact that that incident is all you should run anyway until you have run it out so when you have your hands on something handle it dont leave the pc struggling with it while you try to do something else remember that your major auditing cycle is to accomplish some particular result on the pc if you get into something outside the perimeter of what you were going to do dont neglect it because it may never show up again when you have found the source of the pcs upset whatelse is there to find if you invalidate the source how will you accomplish you major purpose dont bypass achieving what you set out to do cognition can signal the end of your major auditing cyclehubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 22 july 1963 ma franchise bpi you can be right rightness and wrongness form common source of argument and struggle the concept of rightness reaches very high and very low on the tone scale and the effort to be right is the last conscious striving of an individual on the way out i amrightandtheyarewrong is the lowest concept that can be formulated by an unaware case what is right and what is wrong are not necessarily definable for everyone these vary according to existing moral codes and disciplines and before scientology despite their use in law as test of sanity had basis in fact but only in opinion in dianetics and scientology more precise definition arose and the definition became as well the true definition of an overt act an overt act is not just injuring someone or something an overt act is an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics see the eight dynamics thus wrong action is wrong to the degree that it harms the greatest number of dynamics and right action is right to the degree that it benefits the greatest number of dynamics many people think that an action is an overt simply because it is destructive to them all destructive actions or omissions are overt acts this is not true for an act of commission or omission to be an overt act it must harm the greater number of dynamics failure to destroy can be therefore an overt act assistance to something that would harm greater number of dynamics can also be an overt act an overt act is something that harms broadly beneficial act is something that helps broadly it can be beneficial act to harm something that would be harmful to the greater number of dynamics harming everything and helping everything alike can be overt acts helping certain things and harming certain things alike can be beneficial acts the idea of not harming anything and helping everything are alike rather mad it is doubtful if you would think helping enslaves was beneficial action and equally doubtful if you would consider the destruction of disease an overt act in the matter of being right or being wrong lot of muddy thinking can develop there are absolute rights or absolute wrongs and being right does not consist of being unwilling to harm and being wrong does not consist only of not harming there is an irrationality about being right which not only throws out the validity of the legal test of sanity but also explains why some people do very wrong things and insist they are doing right the answer lies in an impulse inborn in everyone to try to be right this is an insistence which rapidly becomes divorced from right action and it is accompanied by an effort to makeothers wrong as we see in hypercritical cases being who is apparently unconscious is still being right and making others wrong it is the last criticism we have seen defensive person explaining away the most flagrant wrongnesses this is justification as well most explanations of conduct matter how farfetched seem perfectly right to the person making them since he or she is only asserting selfrightness and otherwrongness we have long said that that which is not admired tends to persist if one admires person for being right then that persons brand of being right will persist matter how mad it sounds scientists who are aberrated cannot seem to get many theories they do not because they are more interested in insisting on their own odd rightnesses than they are in finding truth thus we get strange scientific truths from men who should know better including the late einstein truth is built by those who have the breadth and balance to see also where theyre wrong you have heard some very absurd arguments out among the crowd realize that the speaker was more interested in asserting his or her own rightness than in being right thetan tries to be right and fights being wrong this is without regard to being right about something or to do actual right it is an insistence which has concern with rightness of conduct one tries to be right always right down to the last spark how then is one ever wrong it is this way one does wrong action accidentally or through oversight the wrongness of the action or inaction is then in conflict with ones necessity to be right so one then may continue and repeat the wrong action to prove it is right this is fundamental of aberration all wrong actions are the result of an error followed by an insistence on having been right instead of righting the error which would involve being wrong one insists the error was right action and so repeats it as being goes down scale it is harder and harder to admit having been wrong nay such an admission could well be disastrous to any remaining ability or sanity for rightness is the stuff of which survival is made and as one approaches the last ebb of survival one can only insist on having been right for to believe for moment one has been wrong is to court oblivion the last defense of any being is i was right that applies to anyone when that defense crumbles the lights go out so we are faced with the unlovely picture of asserted rightness in the face of flagrant wrongness and any success in making the being realize their wrongness results in an immediate degradation unconsciousness or at best loss of personality pavlov freud psychiatry alike never grasped the delicacy of these facts and so evaluated and punished the criminal and insane into further criminality and insanity all justice today contains in it this hidden errorthat the last defense is belief in personal rightness regardless of charges and evidence alike and that the effort to make another wrong results only in degradationbut all this would be hopeless impasse leading to highly chaotic social conditions were it not for one saving fact all repeated and incurable wrongnesses stem from the exercise of last defence trying to be right therefore the compulsive wrongness can be cured matter how mad it may seem or how thoroughly its rightness is insisted upon getting the offender to admit his or her wrongness is to court further degradation and even unconsciousness or the destruction of being therefore the purpose of punishment is defeated and punishment has minimal workability but by getting the offender off the compulsive repetition of the wrongness one then cures it but how by rehabilitating the ability to be right this has limitless applicationin training in social skills in marriage in law in life example wife is always burning dinner despite scolding threats of divorce anything the compulsion continues one can wipe this wrongness out by getting her to explain what is right about her cooking this may well evoke raging tirade in some extreme cases but if one flattens the question that all dies away and she happily ceases to burn dinners carried to classic proportions but not entirely necessary to end the compulsion moment in the past will be recovered when she accidentally burned dinner and could not face up to having done wrong action to be right she thereafter had to burn dinners go into prison and find one sane prisoner who says he did wrong you wont find one only the broken wrecks will say so out of terror of being hurt but even they dont believe they did wrong judge on bench sentencing criminals would be given pause to realize that not one malefactor sentenced really thought he had done wrong and will never believe it in fact though he may seek to avert wrath by saying so the dogooder crashes into this continually and is given his loses by it but marriage law and crime do not constitute all the spheres of living where this applies these facts embrace all of life the student who cant learn the worker who cant work the boss who cant boss are all caught on one side of the rightwrong question they are being completely onesided they are being lastditchright and opposing them those who would teach them are fixed on the other side admityou arewrong and out of this we get not only nochange but actual degradation where it wins but there are wins in this imbalance only loses for both thetans on the way down dont believe they are wrong because they dont dare believe it and so they do not change many preclear in processing is only trying to prove himself right and the auditor wrong particularly the lower case levels and so we sometimes get nochange sessions and those who wont be audited at all are totally fixed on asserted rightness and are so close to gone that any question of their past rightness would they feel destroy themi get my share of this when being close to extinction and holding contrary views grasps for moment the rightness of scientology and then in sudden defence asserts his own rightnesses sometimes close to terror it would be grave error to go on letting an abuser of scientology abuse the route is to get him or her to explain how right he or she is without explaining how wrong scientology is for to do the last is to let them commit serious overt what is right about your mind would produce more case change and win more friends than any amount of evaluation or punishment to make them wrong you can be right how by getting another to explain how he or she is rightuntil he or she being less defensive now can take less compulsive point of view you dont have to agree with what they think you only have to acknowledge what they say and suddenly they can be right lot of things can be done by understanding and using this mechanism it will take however some study of this article before it can be gracefully appliedfor all of us are reactive to some degree on this subject and those who sought to enslave us did not neglect to install rightwrong pair of items on the far back track but these wont really get in your way as scientologists we are faced by frightened society who think they would be wrong if we were found to be right we need weapon to correct this we have one here and you can be right you know i was probably the first to believe you were mechanism or mechanism the road to rightness is the road to survival and every person is somewhere on that scale you can make yourself right amongst other ways by making others right enough to afford to change their minds

july 1963 issue ii central orgs tech depts org technical hgc processes and training hco secs check out on all technical staff star rating it is of the utmost importance that hgc technical continues to be maintained as the worlds best auditing the whole repute of scientology on continent ultimately depends on the quality of technical delivered by central organizations in times of shifting technology this may be considered difficult however nothing in the book maintains that an hgc must only deliver the latest the book only says the best staff morale the unit broad dissemination depend basically upon technical quality if you will look into even the oldest hgc files you will find profiles with firm gains this does not mean then that todays research line has to be installed at once to get gains on pcs of course to attain clear or ot todays research line is vital but the problem is not upper echelon processing in hgcs it is lower level cases if you go not on the basis of make clears and ots but solely on the basis of get maximum tone arm action on the pc you will have very happy pcs and eventual ots to get tone arm action it is necessary to 1 have pcs who are getting wins and 2 have staff auditors doing processes they can do successfully hgc gains then depend on getting tone arm action on every pc and b training auditors to handle the five basics well programming for hgc pcs depends on the pc and the auditor available programming pcs the stable datum for programming pc is rule run the highest level process on the pc that can be run that produces good tone arm actionthe stable dont for programming pc is rule dont run process pc feels he or she cannot do or the auditor cannot do you dont need to predetermine and sometimes downgrade pcs level in order to process him or her programming has nothing to do with tests or hope or critical opinion programming is trial and error proposition based on c what highest process gives the pc ta action d what process has the pc been interested in what process can the auditor do confidently pc interest is nearer certainty of needle reads on the meter and tone arm action than many other methods of assessment any pc who has had earlier auditing can tell you what was or was not interesting discussion of this with the pc will establish which type of process it was dont necessarily just go on doing that process but use it to classify what type of process the pc will most likely have wins doingie objective processes repetitive processes engram running etc lot of pcs are audited at levels they have idea they can do they will do them but simple discussion about processes they have been interested in doing will reveal to them and the auditor where they are most likely to get ta action with strain gains gains on pc can be measured in terms of charge discharged not necessarily in goals run out or some specific action done you can run out goals with ta action run out engrams with ta action and yet the pc does not change the goals set by the pc at session beginning change on changing pc in reviewing cases watch those goals on the auditors report if they deteriorate the auditor has messed it up leaving bypassed charge if they remain the same session after session there was real ta action if the goals change session by session theres lots of ta action too you can just get lots of ta action whatever you run and eventually see cleared pc matter what is run lack of ta action will clear one wrong time is the exclusive source of ta action therefore as pcs time concept is improved or his dates corrected you will see more ta action but many things contribute to wrong time including bad meter dating and time disorienting implants the question is not what corrects the pcs time so much as is the pc getting the tone arm action that shows time is being corrected well done auditing cycles alone correct flawed time concept so you have pc interest and tone arm action that tell you the programming is right and if the pc is going clear and ot buck these things and the pc wont go anywhere matter what is run precautionswrong dates wrong goals wrong items bypassing charge never flattening process running pc beyond regaining an ability or cogniting the process flat account for most upset in auditing there is valid reason for pc getting upset now that arc break assessments exist providing that the auditor is auditing as per the next section auditor skill basic auditor skill consists of five things if an auditor can do these five little further trouble will be found any staff training programme any academy basic goal any hgc auditing that produces results depend on these five basics if you review staff auditors or examine students on these basics by themselves all auditing would rest on solid ground and get gains where any one of the following are out in an auditor there is going to be trouble all along the line fancy new process will cure what is wrong in session if these things are not present the basic auditing skills are 1 ability to execute the auditing cycle 2 ability to execute the auditing cycle repetitively 3 ability to handle session 4 ability to read meter 5 ability to study and apply scientology data it takes very little to establish the presence or absence of these abilities in an hgc auditor or student each one can be reviewed easily view an auditors ability to audit in the light of the above only put him on tv for half hour rudiments and havingness actual session of any model session he or she is trained to use and watch l to 4 above then give him or her an unstudied short hco bulletin and see how long it takes for the auditor to pass verbal exam on it comparison of this data with number of the staff auditors hgc case reports will show direct coordination to the degree that few results were obtained the auditor missed on l to 5 above to the degree that good results were obtained the auditor could pass l to 5 above inspection of half dozen different cases the auditor has done is necessary to see complete coordination there is your training stress for staff training programmes only when the above skills are polished up do you dare to go into involved processes with the auditor for more complicated process further throws out any existing errors in the above five abilities and makes hash out of the lot during such period one can fall back on auditor confidence what process is the auditor confident he or she will get wins with well let him or her run it on the current pc and meanwhile with training smooth the auditor out and get him or her genned in on higher level or more recent processeswithout an auditor case will not progress and case will progress more with confident auditor who can do something of what he or she is doing than with an auditor who is shaky for the shakiness will magnify any faults in the five skills that the auditor has auditors do by and large pretty fine job it takes while to gen in new skill i can do it in one or two sessions so its not causing any strain mary sue can get one straight in about four sessions so nobody expects new skill to appear magically perfect in time at all but the length of time it will take to groove in on new skill depends on the five abilities above the main auditor faults will be found in auditors who are trying so hard themselves to be right that thee and must be proven wrong that shows up most strongly in 5 above the degree of disagreement an auditor has with data measures the degree of unworkability that auditor will enter into processing and this is the same degree that that auditor thinks he or she has to preserve his or her survival by making others wrong this also enters into the other four abilities by covert effort to make the pc wrong this is rare but it is best measured by an inability to accept data and so can be tested by 5 above processing on rightness and wrongness remedies this other processing remedies it and just practice remedies it this factor is easily disclosed as unhandled in some training courses where blowing student sometimes gives long dissertations on what they dont agree with in scientology that what they say doesnt exist in scientology does not deter them from believing it does for their last spark of survival demands that only they be right and all others wrong such state of mind doesnt make good auditor since both scientology and the pc must be made wrong squirrels are only case levels 7 or 6 dramatizing alteris on scientology instead of their track even they can be made to audit by long training even in the absence of processing they arent just trying to make others wrong essentially that is the characteristic of case level 8 unaware there arent many of these around auditing and training can handle them even if it takes long time such people would almost die literally if they found they had ever been wrong and they get quite ill with aplomb just to prove you are wrong it goes that far case level or sanity have little to do with anything when it comes to training auditors insanity is goal to be insane not an index of potential auditing ability and only case level 8 does complete shatter of session as an auditor take these factors into first account in an hgc dont keep staff upset by shifting processes continually processing is pretty stable which is why i can give you this expectancy for new high level performance in hgc groove the staff auditor in for wins and ta action and all will be well groove them in by processes only and all will be chaos and in the academy stress this data and teach the five abilities above beyond all other data and youll have auditors if the hgc could expect from an academy graduates who had the five abilities listed above everyone would get more comfortable an hgc need not have to run school of its own to provide itself with auditors summary the data i have given you in this hco bulletin is not subject to change or modification hgc pcs will only win if they are run so as to obtain good ta action the hgc will have trouble achieving that only to the degree that its staff has not achieved the five abilities abovewe are building on very solid ground all actions we now undertake in the hgc and academy should contribute to successful auditing for out of that alone can clearing be achieved l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedbetween lives implants lecture given on 23 july 1963 well this is nice motorcycle weather weve had couple of summers and we now have another one so cherish it those of you are lucky you know youre going to be leaving here just in time to have another summer ok whats the date 23rd well what do you know alright 23rd july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course couple of new students to introduce here stand up and take bow they are laurie stokes and i looked back there and i thought i saw new student donna fisk not of course for retread now i had two choices here im working on an assembly line process for you and trying to smooth out your dating problems and that sort of thing im collecting lot of information on that all of it very important as far as tone arm action is concerned i followed through that wrong date or bad dating or misconception of date or whatever reason the tone arm action is i found out that the pcs time sense is his basic aberration therefore i am working like mad to get you processes that rehabilitate pcs time sense of course the most exaggerated statement you could make is the time for pc to run engrams is when he can recall the date if you did that if you did that itd be absolutely sure that the pc would be getting tone arm action on r3r discovered new rundown of r2h youre using an r2h in training pattern right now well r2h exists of course as highly therapeutic process too in fact more or less the way youre doing it ive been refining it getting it down to about tenstep action which gives the maximum tone arm action i looked around for something i could use you see to rehabilitate pcs time sense and there it waslying right in my lap so i am refining that to just rehabilitate pcs time sense it does wonders for case and finally found that i may be looking at one shot ot process as simple as it is actually it becomes much simpler for the process to run than the one youre running right now as r2h but that is not quite ready to release there are couple of questions that are still kicking around about it such as what happens when the pc gets into an engram you say when was that and he is very surprised indeed to be in this engram then you say well its bypassed charge it is so and so and so and so and he has to put that together for you while sitting in the middle of one engram its all very interesting ive got to answer couple of questions like that and then ill release it the common denominator which i what i have been looking for of case levels is simply that and more it is just time sense to the individual that doesnt mean how well timed he is or this doesnt mean that jean cooper and so forth thats rhythm sense just time sense the whenness of things the deterioration of this sense is what gives you the case level that is not the end of that but tremendous ramifications to this there are lots of other things that can make the pc unhappy your aberrative significances by the ton but the common denominator of case levels is time sense knowing that then you could probably establish case levels which we were trying to do by test short time ago by some kind of test of our time sense the whenness of things it is as simple as this whats your earliest memory in this lifetime and the pc says well lets see i can remember back to when i was 29 and so forth youve probably got case level7 or something like that maybe case level 6 or something like that you say whats the farthest back you can remember and so forth and hes trying to puzzle it out and he looks awful cloudy and you wonder what hes puzzling about so hard hes trying to find out if he can remember back to breakfast well youve got case level 8 dont you think or if he cant grasp what youre asking him it is an indication here of this type of thing your best case programming however is discussion with the pc about what process that youre dealing mainly with longtime pcs what process have they been most interested in youre liable to get very interesting ramification out of the pc is that they have never been interested in the higher level processes they were really making gains when they were running and they will give you some other process and that merely gives you the class of process you know that doesnt give you just dont know continue to run the process necessarily as they were running that they were interested in but it tells you where the interest of the pc is along the case levels and therefore you can run the pc he will feel that he can do these processes and you may be running pc who is uncomplainingly and actually unaware of it himself running processes he doesnt feel he can do you understand you may be doing something like this you see the pc is sitting right there slugging and crying and sweating at it and that sort of thing and you just start the discussion of interests interests discussion thats all and the pc says well so and so and so and so and they were really interested as they were doing some 8c at one time or another and he found that was terribly interesting actually theres process more interesting than that 8c dont you think youve got your answer right there now theyve done an objective type process that is one that they feel they can do these are all in the lines of estimation of cases dont you see but right now i have little assignment for you is just have discussion with your pc on this basis there is bulletin that will be out tomorrow on that subject scheduled to go to hgcs but you will find it considerably interesting it tells you more about this discussion but actually it is more or less what i have just told you just have discussion with your pc as to what process has been the most interesting to him and what does he consider interesting process and all that sort of thing put it down in your auditors report and dont necessarily shift his gears but it might be very revealing to you and also to the pc now i have reality on doing process that is too steep i have never had this reality before but this is the subject of todays lecture i got confused and didnt much appeal to the process was just bit too steep thats brand new experience for but i can sympathize with the guy who is wading along now and doing that sort of thing running something that is bit over his head i had some adventures recently that im going to tell you about in this lecture and if any of you faint or anything like that why fall straight back into the chair not into the aisle if you start screaming or anything i think the pavilion speakers are off arent they go out there and scream anyway the difficulty of exploration are based on the fact that you can most easily go when you know i think the british motorist deserves the gold medal amongst all gold medals for knowing before they go i remember one time getting routing form from the royal automobile club for an african trip and they gave little cards everything was measured off in tenths of mile i read these cards all over you went over the top of brow of hill you see and there was small can of stones to the right and that was 17 miles from the point you just left down at the bottom was small bridge and it had barn on the right that was 185 miles you see i read all these cards and didnt bother to take the trip but exploration has its disadvantages it definitely has its disadvantages because more than once why one finds himself out on the end of ridge and theres way back he cant get up the sheer surfaces hes come down and he looks in front of him and finds theres way down that is it so it can be too much of good thing notknowing before you go you actually cant know too much about where youre going before you go when youre doing anything like exploration of time track ive been fronting up on this for some little while and i find very few times that i had any faint heart or upset along that until just recently and i got the creeps frankly well it starts like this i was up in the van allen belt this is factual and i dont know why theyre scared of the van allen belt because its simply hot youd be surprised how warm space is down amongst the clouds and so forth it can get pretty cold and damp but you get well up and sunlight shining around and that sort of thing its quite hot the van allen belt was radioactively hot lot of protons get trapped in that area i was up there watching the sun rise that was very interesting and my perception was very good and i was just taking look at norway and essex and the places around you know and getting myself sort of oriented then something happened to that i didnt know quite what had happened to i felt some facsimiles must have appeared in front of but they didnt look like facsimiles some other things happened and i had feeling like i might actually go into the sun and few other little uncomfortablenesses there that wasnt what awed but i got confused i got confused because the sun was suddenly larger and then it was smaller somehow or other i was doing change of space process that i myself was not familiar with it made bite off my thetans fingernails just little bit i said well id better look this over little more thoroughly and proceeded to do so bit later that day i did some reach and withdraw on the polar cap and so on orientation we got quite bit out of this because i was able to establish some reach and withdraw processes i knew how the world must look to somebody who was in body and had pictures appearing in front of them that sort of thing i knew they could get kinda queasy about the situation that wasnt what overawed what overawed was when i found out i hadnt been looking at pictures that was upsetting i was invalidating my own perception it didnt look like pictures dont you see i was busy invalidating my own perception and so on and i wondered why i was nervous that was what was really puzzling what was this all about i couldnt quite figure out what had happened and then i finally did find out what had happened i had actually appeared in despatchers tower on venus and had appeared back there i was above here i had done it like that with volition on my own part at all so that was upsetting you start doing appear and disappear you see automatically and you say whats happening you mean to say im going to be prowling around in the stratosphere and all of sudden find myself appearing and disappearing elsewhere without any volition on my own part actually i didnt think all this through until later but i thought well prowling round up here is little bit over my head now id better know little bit more before i go that was some weeks ago and since that time ive been exploring around and finally found out what i was looking at you talk about fellow hes brought home this nice pet tame riotous snake you see hes put it in box and then snakeologist comes along and he says good heavens man where did you find that king cobra that was the way i felt ive been looking at where you go every time you die i finally found out what this planet is and why life is so loopy now we got some of this back in 52 dishing it out in intellectually i had good intellectual reality on it wed talked about the between lives area and we dished all this off the cuff this is not data which is not unknown to us you see that isnt the same as going there it isnt the same as going there with your eyes wide open and realizing that all you had to do was to bethere at the exact point which youre supposed to appear at and willynilly you wouldve gone over niagara falls through the implant that is what has happened to over the last few weeks and so i have been studying the situation very hard and eventually ive come up with the data with regard to all of the nasty mean and vicious implants that have ever been invented this one is it it has been going on for thousands of years it is the most complete memory wipeout system and the biggest bunch of lies that anybody ever had anything to do with now your understanding is that when you die why somehow or other about fifteen minutes later you appear in another body lets look at this thing from timedisorientation basis that is lie it takes sixtynine days plus more than sixtynine days you very often go this has upset some of our calculations we wondered what had happened to some of our people why they didnt show up again immediately and that sort of thing youve gone as long as eight or nine years between death and birth now ill just give you fast rundown on this situation what happens is youve got compulsion to appear and this is why this yoyo you see youve got compulsion to appear at the betweenlives return point of course you just do disappear at death and an appear there you dont travel to there its all nicely implanted and youre supposed to arrive at this exact point having arrived at this point you go through the works the works consist of false death given to you in pictures youre caught there and beamed in and you get bunch of pictures which they have taken these arent your pictures and it tells you all about the death you just died only thats not the death you just died so youve got completely false death now this gives us moment of pause right at this point this is alleged by the way to be fifteen day timetrack it isnt it isnt its days but it isnt fifteen days it says its fifteen day timetrack and this is fifteen days from where you last were it starts with repetitive picture which gets you good and lost in other words they keep giving you this same picture and the same picture and the same picture so that when you try to back out of the incident you keep running into the same picture and you keep thinking that youve got the beginning of the incident you havent youve got picture in the incident you see and then you go to an earlier picture and you think youve got the picture new that starts the incident and thats wrong too so the trick is to get ahead of it but that can be varied one way or the other and i neednt go on about this but usually you see an actual scene and then you see picture of picture so you dont really get outside the pictures in order to begin the incident you cant find the basic on the incident thats all that amounts to what this whole series of pictures represented as happening in the space of fifteen days counted off day after day is give you your death which is false death its not the right death at all as matter of fact in scouting this in session i found death where i got ead blown off about 1150 and they showed picture of death by exploding bombards it was very interesting because they didnt have bombards in 1150 you get the idea they didnt have them for another couple of hundred years they slipped but these pictures they show of your death are all earth pictures i dont know how we explain this it could be explained by them coming down and taking some pictures id hate to explain it so esoterically that they pick up somebodys photograph and photograph his facsimiles because in this particular character it wasnt possible either that or they in some fashion preordain the destination of the society at that point and expect your pictures will be concerned with that dont you see but they are earth pictures and they compare to the historical periods of earth for instance death at 750 you get knocked offyour horse or some sort or die in bed with your boots off and you go up there and find yourself having died in battle amongst knights you had helmet sitting on cross as your grave and so forth its not your grave but its norman helmet interesting you see messed up like firedrill in other words they give you the wrong death thats the way it begins now you move up to point called the year 0 and thank god theyve got year 0 because you can always date the incident by dating the year 0 because there is year 0 on your timetrack so when you want to take one of these incidents apart for dating always look for hole look for hole in the incident you see and youll find something like theres year 0 there well good date the year 0 for gods sakes dont date the incident ill show you why in just moment because they give you future history of your life this is going to be your life television program this is your life has bearing on the thing at all i often wondered why i could never stand the stinking program but this is this will be your life and they now give you from the year 0 which they communicate to you as the year 0 this is given in another room this is given in room alongside another chamber see youre first fifteen day period that all finishes up you see alleged fifteen days then you go to the year 0 and this is great big room great big room and this screen is whitish colored screen whitish surround to copper grid this copper grid is many feet long and i havent tapemeasured it i didnt have tapemeasure im not really up there very high yet i cant carry things like that anyway its at guess 75 feet125 feet150 feet something like that copper grid its very long and very high but it is much narrower than it is long dont you see itd be on the order of 3 feet high and 75 feet long or 5 feet high and 150 feet long something of that sort this has some compulsive effect upon the thetan the whole thing is to make him make pictures now they dont show you your future life at all they show you what happened to you at the year 0 at the time you entered the universe now it so happens that there are lot of incidents where people have told you you entered the universe and some happened not so long ago and some happened long time ago it could be such thing as guardroom or something like that and theres bunch of angels sitting around in the guardroom and you walk in in doll body at the beginning of the universe you walk in in dollbody slight discrepancy there youre madly out of valence you see thats you over there but its facsimile of some kind or another and the year 0 usually takes one of these facsimiles now there isnt really picture in the whole sequence of the next section of this there arent any pictures you understand except yours so what actually happens is from the year 0 to the year 1 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years in the future youre given compulsion to mock up your own track on this screen and date by date by date by date by date from the year 0 forward to 1 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years youre given compulsion to put your timetrack up there now all thats very interesting you finally come to the second significant date which is 1 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years in the future this is the wrong date the wrong date cake if there ever was one but you actually have put your own facsimiles from your own year 0 forward to that far from what you consider the year 0 of course this makes scramble too but theyre just your own pictures remember there wasnt single picture in that whole thing except what you put there but what did you put up there man you put up the early implants you put up the glade the bear the gorilla the helatrobus implant you put up the whole lousy lot entrapments and everything else and you just did that and this was probably in the course of the next sixty days not fifteen minutes sixty days long time isnt it sixty days of restimulation and wrong datesthose are all your pictures you scan somebody through that sequence and whatre you scanning him through youre scanning him through the misdated helatrobus implant youre scanning him through anything and everything that you can think of all misdated so you say alright you cant scan through these things so its impossible to get through it n this was about the time i started to feel queasy and felt that i was just being run just little bit over my head i was scanned through it twice and i felt i was little bit over my head because to take at gulp scan through all of the goals of the helatrobus implant in one single pass made feel just little bit odd and i felt this was little bit too steep for id better find some way to take this thing apart so it can be taken apart so theres this middle period thats in the main room the middle period and how thetan is moved through there i dont know yet i think he must be moved there on very slow endless belt proposition very slowly fantastic slow speed ho spends sixty days going past this cottonpickin screen you see its not that big putting his pictures on it now we get to the third sequence and this is far more interesting because they furnish all the pictures which i think is very sweet of them they dont now try to pick up any pictures they throw you usually nearly always the same sequences very very stable sequence they use wavelength communication system by the way thoughtconcept wavelength communication system is all i can make out of it not words but you do hear some sound and part of it is baby crying they throw you picking up body and so forth then they show you departing and of course you depart and then you get another picture of departing and you get another picture of departing so you really never get out of that one either you see then they show you picture of being sent directly down to earth and channeled straight into the body of newborn baby i think its awfully nice and you even hear the baby cry i think thats good thats good its very clever part of this and all through this thing youve got false emotion of were just good joes and were doing our best for you you get the feeling i can imagine this one thought concept in there which is terribly interesting that i imagine your girls have occasionally been startled at which is weve treated you like gentleman remember weve treated you like gentleman anyway you want to know why the girls are always wearing the mens sweaters but the whole idea and the whole emotional tone that shot at you all during the rest of this duress knockabout restimulation misdating scrambled up washout is were being nice as matter of fact ill bet youll occasionally get pc that says well they treated well i couldnt get along without this that sort of thing because thats the prevailing emotion anger theres nothing the light touch you know the most effective possible touch you then see picture of yourself separating from this planet and how they explain that i dont know but its sort of thrown in for good measure because it said so on the blueprint i suppose youve already been sent to earth you see and the thing is kinda mixed up you even get picture of yourself being scooted across the desert on earth with yucca trees down under you and that sort of thing there you are youre on your way and youre going down to pick up this baby and everything is flush you see you couldnt pick up kid without em you know couldnt do that magic you see they have all these babies beamed you know all they do is ride you down the beam and you pick up the baby and youre all set there you are and so forth this thing with the multiple end so you cant find the end of it easily you know the end and then the end and then the end and then the end which is the end and so forth finally winds up at what actually happens toyou youre simply capsuled and dumped in the gulf of lower california splash to hell with you youre on your own man if you can get out of that and through that and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like shes going to get married or have baby or something like that youre all set and if you can find the maternity ward to hospital or something youre ok and you just eventually just pick up baby youre strictly on your own man in state of total amnesia and gaaa having been lied to to this degree with your track all scrambled well in this sequence youre given compulsion that the next time you die you must appear on the landing stage and thats it thats the whole ruddy lousy cottonpickin lot this is an interesting thing because this is the most vicious engram i have ever seen set up to scan through that thing is asking you to scan through restimulation of 1 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years of your own timetrack just asking you do to it just like that you see its all right just scan through it you know cant do it man to find the beginning of it well there are other ones with false beginnings and false endings so that you cant get out of them easily but the time line this is specifically fifteen days your last fifteen days you see on earth only it isnt its not even fifteen days and then the last section tells you that its 100 days long and you get 100 days counted off to you in there but it isnt 100 days it is more like about nine days and then having channeled you squarely into the head of your new body the dump you in the gulf of lower california very interesting because by the time you get out of that this is the type of facsimile that cant be run nobody has ever been able to approach even looking at it it gives you enough queasiness so that you just tend to back right straight off from the thing how the devil can you undo that now because you have been given such compulsion to appear there here i am up in the van allen belt and i take look around and i see the sun and i get myself oriented im just spotting myself around you know getting ready to flex bicep or something like this and i just glanced in the direction of venus and i go snap and im on the landing stage theres compulsion to shift in space right on this damn landing i took look around the airport and i found oddly enough id gotten curious about this place before some hundreds of years ago and had simply hung around for while and hadnt gone through the implant but this has been going on for as long as youve been on this planet theres lot of these they run somewhere in the neighborhood of two to three per century if youve been on this planet 10000 years youve got lots quite few of them figure it out for yourself thats how many of these confounded things youve got as far as i know it hasnt changed an iota im saying little bit more than i know now but i figure it is apparently set up and has continued on there has been vast change of pattern as far as i know but i am prepared to amend that when i start looking at few early facsimiles on it which i havent done the point is this the helatrobus implant the gorilla implant the bear implant wayback thetan fights all of this kind of thing you got through all that you got through all that and you were still ok they used to say about that id never been the same after the second helatrobus you know i used to occasionally snarl at people more than i used to earlier but before i hit this place i was on the same post for so trillion years same post same name gives you some idea of stability of identity mary sue gave the cue on this thing she said look at how hard they have to work to keep you from being ot hey you know thats quite thought isnt that quite thought now you look at this look at this now theres complete idiocy on it somebody sits up on venus there are probably some other stations around up in the systems on venus i notice thatwe all believe that venus has methane atmosphere and is unlivable i almost got run down by freight locomotive the other day didnt look very uncivilized to im allergic to freight locomotives thanks always running into you we notice that mars doesnt have any atmosphere either and wont support life in spite of the fact that it turns green and red and purple with the seasons it doesnt support life we understand theres lots of things we understand about this system but this carefully maintained station and space opera meatbody type society maintains it very carefully they have hospital theres space craft hanging around there despatchers stations landing platforms this type of thing its all highly civilized but they carefully maintain this one its very interesting they maintain this one theyve maintained it for thousands of years without any change whats happening why are they maintaining this thing dont be deluded by the atmosphere they pump into you the emotion they pump into you during the implant that its also the best of the best of all possible worlds man it might be that we treated you like gentleman but the facts of the case is i classify that as dirty trick why is it so interesting whether or not somebody gets off this planet well frankly your answer is exactly as good as mine i can make few guesses on this but thats about all the rest of this universe isnt run this way its question of where are we why well i know this that onto this planet great deal of dumping has gone on stuff from the nearby galaxy not this galaxy but the next galaxy over and so forth gone on there so they take political prisoners and guys who they dont want around but it is less personal than they think they just have excess population so they start to get rid of their excess population you see theyve got revolt or youre on the wrong side of war or something like that and they pick you up in droves and icecube you and throw you into sea someplace i know this planet has been subjected to that and several planets in the immediate end of this galaxy been subjected to that that i know but somebody must have taken great deal of interest in this fact and somebody must be awfully afraid somebody must be awfully afraid you can almost say it isnt so many how many are here it might also be question of whos here think of the cost now lets just think of it in terms of just society you see think of the cost of maintaining huge station or several stations its maintenance light power wages think of maintaining it on basis of hard work because it is look at the volume that station handles how many people die on this planet on any given day well thats how many guys are started in on the beginning of that line on any day thats lot of people man thats something on the order of 2 billion implants every half century now thats quite volume of course somebody may not say thats great volume but look at the length of the implant now if it were two second implant i would say well yeah anybody could handle that but i know that its more than sixty nine days and i know the stuff is ferried back here why i think thats all very interesting and this looks to like very expensive proposition remember this has been going on since before the days of egypt way back without any change what industry what enthusiasm so we ask these various questions whos here and who are we we can ask lot of questions about this i dont pretend to have any answers to these questions theres interpretation on getting it particularly beyond the interpretation the same interpretation im telling you about the room you live in ive seen the room and youre just beginning to look at it now the amount of duress necessary to produce continuous degraded state cant be measured thereby look at the hard work to keep people aberrated now few months ago i was telling you about if you were just left alone for while youd snap out of it remember if you were left alone for while youd snap out of it the universe itself is therapeutic but look at how hard they have to look at it i know that in any given situation somebody has to be awfullyactive to maintain the situation in bad state situations have to be maintained in bad state they just dont naturally exist in bad state thats very definitely true of people if you were left alone even if you could put in two or three hundred years at it youd start to snap out of your mass you have to pick up the next baby anyhow all off your own bat well supposing you just picked up the next baby without the betweenlives implant to slow you down well i find that would be quite interesting quite an interesting thought because right there youre looking at world clearing weve got several ways that we can whip this situation we actually talking about an existing situation were talking about the situation that your pc is sitting in in that pc chair in an auditing session there is his ptp how the hell is he going to get out of here well i know how to get out of here i could have went as matter of fact just dont appear in this immediate vicinity of the solar system go back and find your friends and bring some battle cruisers in but the point im making here is the key is the second you find yourself free to appear dont you see why appear i said to hell with that and stepped back up here again and said now what the hells happened here whats this funny compulsion and ran that on down thats it well actually it doesnt take much to get rid of the compulsion now an exteriorization is very easy for thetan to exteriorize if you have him be in some place hes familiar with now supposing scientologists just elected place to be when they kicked the bucket and supposing why we simply ran out and actually its just section of this implant even though it jams the case up who cares run out that compulsion even by repeater technique dont you see we can do that you see run that compulsion to appear over there and then tell the guy very strong and hard now where is good place that youre very familiar with well when you die appear there now remember that when you die appear at such and such place different place two or three hundred years even with processing youd be free in other words youd live it out look at the amount of time thats just been bought because it wouldnt take more than couple of hours to do this job on anybody i remember it was eugene thompson that made this interesting discovery that if you simply told thetan to be in place where he was familiar with or liked to be he would exteriorize it was up here in london many years ago you can ask somebody what he is familiar with he gets tangled up sometimes and thinks hes gone into facsimile when hes actually gone into locale dont you see as far as thats concerned you see you could use saint hill providing you ran out all your arc breaks on the subject but the point here is elementary if guy has got to pick up his own body off his own bat anyway he might as well body off his own bat anyway nobody else is going to do anything for him you know very well what would happen to somebody if he had an engram and you gave him another engram on top of it and said his engram didnt exist you know how therapeutic that would be and then you misdated everything hes got and then told him bunch of lies and pulled an emotional switch on him you can imagine the state your pc would be in if you did these things so supposing you just drained that out of the subject of death and somebody just was in place they were familiar with and didnt go back through the betweenlives area im telling you true that in two or three hundred years you would have lived it out youd be flexing your biceps anyway relieved from that situation youd be starting to take long breath because there must be considerable fear connected with this perhaps the fear of death is mainly the fear of the betweenlives area it may not be fear of death at all certainly oblivion takes place during that period and economic chaos would ensueat once if people kept coming back and demanding their toys back im sure that youd get lot of people who would argue against this and say this was not the best for the best of all possible worlds theyd say well they could say lot of things about this im frankly not very interested in what they would say about this but now if scientologists supposingly just started tapping people on the shoulder and giving them this two hour treatment which deletes the compulsion to return to betweenlives area and instead of that appeared in yankee stadium or something and took off and found new body you see the only service performed it gives you place to be when youre dying you see and spares you some of the agony of death it gives you place to be as the only service performed all of the rest of it cut your throat well you can easily perform that service next thing you know you start cutting down their customers now couple of things stand in the road of all this you should know this couple of questions are unanswered here how close is the liaison between these jerks i mean these fellows and earth how close liaison are they maintaining do they care anything about earth at all they must have seen space probe going by the other day they must be aware of some interplanetary action taking place right here what are they going to say about it within the last two weeks ive seen full armored spaceship sitting on landing port with my own eyes what are they going to do i dont think theyll do anything i think theyre hung with their own petard the moment they appear they blow the show i dont think theyd do anything i just think they get fixed on wrongness and they are continuously executing this wrongness so they insist on its rightness and they think thats going to solve everything im interested that jamming the track to this degree and getting so little time period amongst incidents as they do to the person is giving people weird time zzzzzzz so that you have fan job aeroplanes only occupying third of century whereas matter of fact in most societies theyll be happy and content with fan job aeroplane for anything up to billion years somebody invented fan job aeroplane fine thats good over here weve got jet planes now weve got supersonic planes now weve got space ships you see its this acceleration ive been into periods in that because ive seen as different here than it is in any other place ive ever been this could be the primary factor they give your timetrack such fast jam together that everybody gets an idea of more accelerated motion of the way progress has got to occur there could be other explanations there could be explanations of the bases being created here for takeover of this particular galaxy since this type of implant is not native to this galaxy inspecting your own track you will see that is the case its the next galaxy there could be an enemy to this galaxy sitting there quietly letting manufacturing and production base build up for an attack into this galaxy these could be simply prison guards and with tacit consent from one and all far and wide why any of you agitators that cut up fuss or didnt join the local ama or something like this they capsulated you and threw you down here and they know very well that this is prison now i know that this is known in some peculiar way because bulletin board notices exist all over the place with regard to this planet they say landings on earth why does everybody comply with this i got here by accidentally landing here up in the himalayas but why does everybody comply with it why is this planet stayedawayfrom i dont know how many visitors did alcatraz have this is about where we sit with regard to this situation now there is another factor that is quite interesting if they have pictures of earth in order to show you how you died did they get them on earth or are they picking them up in some weird mindreading fact off of beings as they come up there have they actually figured out how to photograph facsimile if theyve figured that kind of thing out why then thats explained but how do they know whats going on here thats not finally answered dont you see they havent done anything about these space probes the boys have been at it hereshooting stuff off into the heavens for the last several years and nothing has been done about this now knowing very well i suppose that any time they exceeded certain zone or area they know very well that an armored cruiser could blow anything that this planet could build like kids toy out of the sky so maybe theyre not worried about it or maybe theyre counting on decimation of population destruction of industry in atomic war another question is how thoroughly do these people influence the affairs of earth we can understand that earth is very very strange planet i have never seen populations behave with the same hecticness and weirdness and of course if people who were rather revolutionary or upset or nonconformists were picked up uniformly and concentrated on one planet youd get almost an ungovernable situation which i think rather tends to explain maybe what this is all about ive seen other planets go nutty but only when they were in external stress of great magnitude otherwise they were rather peaceful the days before the helatrobus implants on some of the planets attacked by those people you couldnt maintain government with everything going to pieces all the time but thats an interesting question alright what degree of influence is exerted against this planet now astrologists may have something in their favor when you realize that these planets swinging closer to earth would make it easier to travel to earth and further from earth you have less traffic or less this or that and so you would have less things happening on earth you see the proximity of planets combinations of planets or that sort of thing maybe just to the degree of the interspatial relationship of the thing and so on maybe this has some influence on the situation i wouldnt know just discussing here points now heres another point where do we sit i think between thee and thats the point were interested in yeah well they may be counting on an atomic war wiping out space opera and so forth space probes may have already excited their curiosity there may be some purpose in this but that they took action when the first space probes passed them either says theyre backup space probing or sayssome other explanation exists for that so we can neglect all that what is the role which we occupy in this this is very very interesting that i released this might be source of great worry to you but remember its been in one of the books carefully seized by the fools druggists the fools drugs addicts thats good name isnt it the fools drug addicts anyway in what to audit and betweenlives area are described in the book what to audit this is not unknown and what to audit is many many years old it has been kicking around for long time it has been available to almost anybody and look nothing has happened in other words the information has already been released when the publicity on the subject of dianetics was at much higher pitch than it is on the subject of scientology so what is this if we really started to run with the ball and so forth we expect couple of meat bodies in the usual white jumper that comes along with the space opera except those guys by the way wear khaki its an odd looking uniform we expect them to appear on the front doorstep and says are you scientologist well theres the space ship and they take you up and throw you in the can at pluto or something is this the kind of action here that we might expect or is it situation where we are threat to them well all sort of pass away or are they in state where this covert action going forward for so many years would tolerate almost anything before they would disclose themselves or do they count absolutely on the exact camouflage which we have we are ridiculed thats our camouflage i should think if anybody was in the know or any liaison line existed between these two systems maybe kennedy and other presidents find this out the moment they step into the white house maybe thats what makes them look so old in two or three years the way they cave in they find out why you boys are slaves you seeno i dont think anything like that happens but supposing you did get liaison line between this society and them what would be their best reports on us fraudulent bunch of quacks theyre space opera science fictioneers bums the very best authorities the ama the fools and drug addicts the newspapers which is where they get their news radio broadcasts television broadcasts all forms of news represent us as being totally unimportant ridiculous and so forth i think they could have all of our books sitting on desk up there right this minute and laugh themselves silly without bit of worry about the whole thing theyd certainly not blow the show for it and theyd have to blow the show understand theyd have to appear not covertly you dont bring space ships down in dewline monitored society privately must be getting very hard for these characters to deliver the goods these days past the radar screens and that sort of thing i think they could be sitting there with the whole library in front of them and they wouldnt have any impulse to do anything they say well few of them and so on not important and so forth we wouldnt really want to do that and we never have done anything like this besides that atomic war is coming right up theres danger from these people because theyre bunch of frauds anyway theres always some madman gets some kind of an idea like this and it all passes away and so forth look at the buddhist we let him conquer threequarters of asia and he was trying to end this lifedeath cycle and keep from coming through our carefully maintained plant and he never made it never did anything so theres your precedent nothing happened nothing happened nothing happened but i was standing on their landing stage the other day nothing happened the funny part of it is is lot of us have friends thats interesting too and if you have to work this hard to keep somebody aberrated and working this hard you still arent successful in preventing breakthrough the way we have made in this society in spite of all of the cockeyed contrary propaganda lies and nonsense which are leveled at this society we are making progress and if this continues we will make progress all the way this is polite gathering and it is time to indulge in threats or violence or anything like that so i wont describe any future plans with relationship to these people but i think the one thing they must be afraid of is having their planet rolled which of course is the one thing that will happen to them anyhow the situation is much more favorable to us it shows that aberration is very difficult to maintain it shows that it is being actively maintained as far as the validity of this and the possession of one of these series of implants in your pc is concerned ill vouch for it you may not be able to run it but its there you can certainly cut swathe out of the back end of it that stops the thing but to run somebody through it before hes got the track neated up is impossible so look at what weve got here were going along our own way the first thing we ought to do is give some attention to preventing further implantations of scientologists ive already given you program by which this can be done your next action on the thing is dispose of them i can see tomorrow i can see tomorrow the chinese he appear on landing stage to go through his false death and he hear wordsthought wave as follows be on earth support your local scientologist there is further reason to upset you this time youve been good boy and show him an s and double triangle and there he goes actually youd only have to do this for two or three hundred years and earth would start to go clear on its own because it wasnt getting this continuous assistance the only other source of action is the psychiatrist with his prefrontal lobotomy and his trans orbital schizophrenia this bloke and his avidity for doing everybody in if you just leave cycle alone why hell come out of it but youve got to leave him alone got to let him have rest thats the best treatment of psychosis dont do anything with psychotic you see well ithink that all of sudden through finding the worseness we also not pollyannaishly find some goodness but actually find the answer to our problem as far as the clearing of this planet is concerned that is the easiest end of it the hardest end of it is right now right here and so forth now how can you run this incident that must be burning through your wits right now well what you do is get your gpms out of the road they are the only thing you cant scan through and get your basics on this type of incident if you run those two things then the incident can be scanned and we already have the tools by which the incident can be run the only thing youve got to do is make sure that your pc gets lots of ta action in session and very shortly matter if you ran implants did run implants or something like this they will be jumping up there ready to be run and the fact that they are and this gave bad turn for day or two is i thought are all the things i have run simply jammed into this and have i been running them at wrong point in time because they have been properly dated i have been running them at right point in time even though they were then jammed in this particular incident id been running them out at right and i found out that not all of them had been restimulated there in fact very small portion of them had been restimulated just to make it impossible to scan though the thing but you run down gpms you date them on the timetrack youre running them at that time on the timetrack youre not running them out of the group you see dont worry about that but sometimes pc will give you date now were dating years ago and their dating are years into the future these two dates do not conflict their dates are wrong our dates are right so redating gives you of any incident strips it out of this or any time you find an engram properly dated on the pc youre away at first i blanched the amount of false track i had must be fabulous and i tried to get rid of all the discreditable incidents by simply saying they were false track then i had to run out all of the invalidations because they were my own track i thought well this is wonderful way out of it theres that time when i sat incapacitated for long period of time and didnt feel strong any more and so on and it was obviously just false track it happened to really theres very little unreal incident of the track very little incident when you finally get something durationed exactly and right you can tell whether or not its one of these types of implants but the track is not the same track its corny track theres something goofy with it the pictures you run out on pc by and large are the actual pictures of the pc and when you cant run pictures on the pc youve got wrong date or wrong duration so if you get right date and right duration you can run the picture and the picture can be run that way turns out to be what it is it turns out to be real picture or bad picture only the pc can tell you if youve got the right date and the right duration so simply by carrying on with r3r without the slightest change carrying on with r3m without the slightest change you get the timetrack into the kind of shape pc could perforce actually scan though one of these implants matter what type or part of his timetrack it had been it takes less number of hours than you would think youve got the weapons with which to do it you get the basic series of implants of any chain of implants that is to say you get the basics on these things out and youll find very rapidly and very readily that the rest of them tend to fall away and they desensitize for instance if you get the first two items lets say weve got the same items firing twelve times in row and if you got the first two fires cleanthe rest of them wont even click isnt that interesting whereas if you got the twelfth one it takes you about fifteen minutes to get all the rocketreads thatll go off and then you get the eleventh one youve got all the rocketreads to get off it and so forth in other words weve got the mechanism which turns the time track rightside to and takes the charge out of the place where it counts weve got these various mechanisms solved in other words what we know already can put somebodys timetrack in shape so that the person eventually can run straight through one of these incidents and damn the torpedoes in fact without having all of my timetrack beautifully cleaned up i was playing tag with one of these things in my last session and i was terribly intrigued by the fact that i had become bit contemptuous of it i have moved around i know what it is it has been crossdated it suddenly occurred to alright so if i find i cant scan through something here ill just redate it and sure enough it disappears on the backtrack the second you do so so you could probably take it from the year 0 and redate everything that appeared on the screen in front of the pc and throw his timetrack back and the next thing you know the thing would be gone as an incident particularly if you were running basic on the incident you can run the beginning of it off selectively you can run the end of it off selectively the last 100 days the first fifteen days without running the pc through any of his own timetrack restimulating so there is many ways this thing can be handled weve over the hump on this situation but this thing must exist pretty well as present time problem for every pc audited he must be afraid of death he must be trying to keep his body from getting sick and disappearing simply and solely because he doesnt want an implant at the end of this line alright if you were to solve that problem by stripping out his compulsion to appear in the implant stage tell him to appear someplace else youve probably solved present time problem of great magnitude on the part of the pc the truth never hurts its only lies that aberrate the very fact that this is prison planet that is being monitored this carefully right this minute right this instant im talking here some joe off this planet has appeared on that landing stage and is being told how he just got through an airplane crash whereas the guy probably dies of pneumonia see right this minute you see and in this instant another guy dead in other words this is continuing situation thats going on and on and on this gives you and understanding of whats happening we couldnt have run them in yesteryear we can run them today the best answer is to first put the pc in shape so that he can run engrams and gpms by making sure that you can get good ta action running these things on the pc the next thing to do is to run engrams and run implants and gpms on the pc until he can go over his track rather comfortably and he can come on back on the backtrack and pick up this other type of timedislocation implant scan through those things and knock them out in other words weve got it made theyve been looting down the backs of our necks and we didnt know it for thousands of years each one of us as person and as society as whole and i just want to point out to you that the other day i was looking down the back of theirs thank you very much6307c24 shspec289 arc breaks and the comm cycle current model session is pretty short sincemidruds and pulling missed withholds is better than the previous beginning ruds an arc break assessment at end of session is much better than any endruds we had in the old model session if all lines are cleaned up as they read presession stuff is the same as always she rest of the model session goes like this 1 goals for the session 2 sincemidruds if ta up or needle dirty 3 check for and pull any missed withholds 4 body of the session use whatever is necessary to get him through b chat little before ending the body of the session 5 arc break assessment if the pc is not very happy at end of session the wording of this is still very fixed the only problem is on what to do if rud question is clean asking the pc if he agrees it is clean can cause an arc break if the pc feels that it is impossible for the question to be really clean 6 take up each goal from 1 above acknowledge the pc for each one made 7 ask for any gains made in session dont milk this question acknowledge these by saying thank you for making these gains 8 can squeeze 9 end of session the reason for rough needle on the pc is the auditors outtr2 and tr4 clean up tr2 and tr4 and youll clean up more needles than you can shake stick at it isnt the significance of it you see its the calm flow of the auditing cycle during arc break assessments you normally consider dirty needle to be withhold or something the pc has done but weak or overly heavy tr2 can do it as well there are two comm cycles in an auditing cycle 1 auditor pc 2 pc auditor these cycles can operate independently both have to be very acceptable before you get good auditing cycle the pc doesnt even have to say anything for communication to exist thus from the auditor you can get an rfactor as an independent comm cycle and from the pc you can get pc origination as an independent comm cycle from the pc as in tr4 in this case an acknowledgment is not even really necessary an artificial acknowledgment can knock an origination off its base you can handle these with head nod or facial expression the pc origination only needs ghost of an acknowledgment for the pc to know that the auditor got it if it is something that seems funny to the pc and to the auditor it is ok for the auditor just to laugh with the pc if you can project your think tank you dont need tr2 sometimes anacknowledgment can indicate understanding on the part of the auditor the pc only needs to be sure that you understand good auditor of children obeys kids auditing commands in r3r you dont have to ask the pc whether he has done the command on move to the beginning of the incident he doesnt have to tell you that he has done it you will get meter flick when he is there and you can send him through from that point if the pc gives you gobbledygook do not tell the pc that you didnt understand that is powerful phrase to use furthermore by saying that all you have done essentially is to ask him to repeat what he has just said this is peculiarity of homo sapiens you just get the same words again that doesnt help you are just asking for complete arc break you want the pc to vary the statement what you want is an explanation or broader statement so you have to be able to get him to do that without invalidating him here we get the basis of the arc break there is bungedup communication cycle whatever else there is what is bunged up about it is that the communication is not fully detected and understood lacking those points there is comm cycle the intention of the pc is cause distance effect and that cycle is interfered with so that the communication is not fully detected this is the woof and warp of all arc breaks communication that is partially but not fully detected or you could detect something but not receive it for instance say the pc says that he feels fine and doesnt need to continue you say well thats fine but we will continue to fill in the time here the pc sees that the communication is not received because action is taken you said that it should be something else before it arrived at you therefore there is busted communication line you can get roaring arc break on this this is primary cause of arc breaks in this case r and c are out because u is out actually the communication is detected expectations come into this you can yell at rock since you dont expect detection you dont arc break auditing is different because the expectations are different there are other kinds of arc breaks all of them are based on the communication cycle the whole definition of bypassed charge is partially detected it had to be partially detected because it must have been stirred up comm cycle once begun must go through if it doesnt there will be trouble eventually you would think that people at cocktail parties would always be bypassing charge on each other because they are always partially detecting that someone spoke the only reason wog meat bodies dont explode during cocktail parties is that they are armored they dont expect anybody to hear them so theres never any partially detected charge comm it is very dangerous to ask for communication and then fail to acknowledge what is received as result of your request you are inviting an explosion in doing that for instance an auditor asks for the earliest incident the pc cant give it and arc breaks because the question kicks in an earlier incident than the one he can see which he cannot reach thus the pcs bank gets only partially detected and you get an arc break if the time track is like bunch of mines laid out in line and activated magnetically lets say you want mine number 4 you throw magnet to mine number 8 then you wonder why you get an explosion mine number 8 speaks but it is only partially detected one way to locate the earlier incident is to find its order of magnitude of years ago comm cycle once begun must go through or there will be an upset eg the president promises to communicate to everyone but lacks the ability to carry through this gives the background for the revolution people who dont know anything about the communication cycle find this all so threatening and dangerous that they just decide to withdraw from communicating because they dont understand what is happening or how to remedy the upset desperation only enters in whencommunication goes out think of the sessions when you have gotten desperate your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you could put comm between yourself and the aberration thats bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge you dont worry about case for any other reason when you cant seem to reach the pc or the bank with your comm you get worried and upset when you are upset as an auditor see what communication you are not getting home to the pc and you as an auditor will feel better if the pc is miserable comm cycle is awry but this could happen in various ways from the pcs point of view some comm cycle has begun it hasnt been fully detected and it hasnt been understood that is the basis of low arc or arc breaks in your pcs even when the pc doesnt have an arc break realizing this point will help you understand something about your pc that you hadnt seen before keep on figuring out whether you are bypassing any charge the basis of low arc or arc breaks is 1 some comm cycle has begun 2 it hasnt been fully detected but has been slightly detected 3 it hasnt been understood actually in any pc you are going to see an out comm cycle because he isnt ot the telepathic cycle is usually out there can be the mundane result of the pc not having ever understood the command and at least faintly knowing it the reason that it is an arc break is that the nonunderstanding brings in and r it is the and r factors that tend to make the c not understood something didnt go through an incomplete comm cycle always results in bpc you should know that that simple little outness can bring the living lightning you should also know that the cause and effect always work in that direction the catastrophe that you are handling has simple little outness as its origin not complex bear the basic things that wont go through and get detected are r and c and the basic things that these three face are m s and t so you have the livingness of the person arc vs the material universe or mest or it is the individual vs time that is what keeps the k and c from completing the communication cycle there is lie in the individuals communication with time or with times communication with the individual bypassed charge originates as the beginning of comm cycle that is not wholly detected or understood charge is energy excited and channeled to go in certain direction but it never arrives because it is not wholly detected or understood so it always remains as bpc then explodes in dispersal of some sort it does not always explode sometimes it just results in downtone pc who is not feeling so well lately we know the magic of the explosive nature of interpersonal relationships knowing these things you should be able to handle session better dont be afraid that handling means always doing what the pc says just let the pc know that you got his origination and understood it and go ahead and do what you are doing youve got to be an expert in the detection of communication that has begun the better you are the fewer arc breaks youll have the arc break assessment covers the number of types of comm that can be started and not detected in the activity you are doing so that you can find the correct bpc and not have to shotgun it with something like an earlier incident was restimulated deciding which list to use could be problem look in the right place if the arc break is in the session and you do an r3r arc break form you wont find it therefore use the right list if you dont get the bpc you are using the wrong list get the right one just realize that deciding which is the right list could be problem and use another list if you didnt find she arc break the main mistake you could make is not to be sure everything is fine with the pc after you have handled the arc break make sure that you are right about the bpclists locate the type of charge bypassed the type of comm cycle that began and was never completed now its up to you to locate and indicate to the pc the charge the charge is not on the list it is in the pc the assessment is not the location even though the magic is good enough so that you can often get result just by indicating what was assessed you only actually get type of charge not the charge with the assessment you must still locate and indicate the specific charge if you tell the pc what you got on the assessment and he feels better fine let sleeping dogs lie but if he doesnt feel better or if there is still charge there find the exact charge that was bypassed you may need another list to get it so there are five steps to handling bpc with an arc break assessment 1 find out if there is an arc break 2 assess the appropriate list 3 locate the exact bpc 4 indicate it to the pc 5 check whether the indication was all right with the pc if it is wrong date check the ones you have gotten or see if it is in the first or the last half of the session6307c25 shspec290 comm cycle in auditing illustrations for this lecture are contained in hcob 4aug63 lecture graphs most auditors early on get the idea that there are all kinds of pcs good and bad there are pcs who are nervier about comm breakdowns than others but practically pc can stand up against good comm cycle the difficulty an auditor has comes from his own auditing cycle and his impatience there are two comm cycles in the auditing comm cycle one with the auditor at cause one with the pc at cause they are only connected by the fact that the auditor has calculatedly restimulated something in the pc which the pc discharges on his half of the cycle that is the whole game of the auditing cycle some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc if the pc doesnt answer the auditing question he never gets rid of the restimulation if the pc alter ises eg if he alterises the question or if he alterises the data from the bank then every restimulation gives rise to an alteris the cycle of acknowledgment is another little shadow cycle fadeout another shadow cycle is the auditor seeing that the pc has received the auditing command you can tell by locking at him that he didnt get it or that he is doing something peculiar with it so do look at the pc to find out so there are really seven comm cycles in the auditing cycle the four main ones plus three more 1 observing that the pc is ready to receive the auditing command failure to do this one can cause trouble if the pc is hung up on the previous cycle he doesnt really get the command if he wasnt ready to receive it 2 observing that the pc got the acknowledgment 3 tiny one before the acknowledgment which is seeing whether the pc has or hasnt said all he is going to say if you acknowledge him before he has said all you havent let one line flow to its end so the acknowledgment cant actually go through and the lines jam when you violate one of these comm cycles you will get trouble in which case you might need more cycles to unsnarl it so the auditing cycle can occur theres another comm cycle inside the auditing cycle which is between the pc and the bank you have an effect produced by the auditing command which results in cause the restimulation causing the pc to outflow it is actually two comm cycles there pc to bank and bank to pc then you get pc to auditor the latter is actually the least important of the cycles except when it isnt being done and it is the hardest to detect when it isnt being done what is mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused some of the comm cycles within it when you are doing complicated action like r2h if you are nervy on handling basic tool like the auditing cycle break it down and work on it while doing something simple on an easy pc then you will find out where it is jammed up there is different auditing cycle inside the regular auditing cycle which occurs when the pc originates just handle it as its own drill it handles any origin including the pc throwing down the cans the pattern of causedistanceeffect is reversed because the pc is now being cause at the start of the cycle what the pc causes has to be understood so there can be some little comm cycles where the auditor gets it clarified what the auditor uses to clarify it mustnt just cause the pc to repeat himself tell some more about that is good approach but whatever you use isnt rote once the origination has been clarified the auditor acknowledges and can then resume the regular cycle if the pc is ready for it also at the beginning of thepcs origination cycle the auditor should observe that the pc is about to originate and shut up and make the comm cycle of im listening the fact that duplication is part of the comm cycle carries it over into r c and u this makes the auditing comm cycle different from the military comm cycle which doesnt require understanding military cycle causedistanceeffectcompliance auditing cycle causedistanceeffectunderstanding hence the auditing comm cycle involves and r too there has to be and r at the effect point because of duplication and there had better be and r at the cause point also so there should be arc at both the cause point and the effect point the trs handle comm cycles from one side or another full auditing cycle would need fulldress tr above what is covered in trs 04 and r come into tr1 it is one thing to enunciate syllables clearly and another to have an understandable communication r is involved it has to be duplicatable an accent can get in the way of duplication it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible from the point of view of accent diction and sense since if the auditor is not comprehended by the pc tr1 is out and comm cycle or auditing takes place then there is the pc who doesnt want to be audited at all here you have to establish comm cycle with some trick like tell why you shouldnt be audited or if the pc ia misemotional and the is out you can do an arc break assessment in order to pick up what is awry with the comm cycles between the pc and himself where the bpc lies repetitive auditing cycle is specialized activity it gets you in trouble if you dont realize that there is point beyond which you shouldnt be trying to complete the cycle that point is an ability regained that ep is of senior importance the major auditing cycle has as its ep ability regained junior to that is the process cycle which in turn is made up of single auditing cycles repeated as needed so the cycles that exist in auditing are 1 single auditing cycle 2 process cycle 3 major auditing cycle indications of flatness in process cycle are 1 three equal comm lags with the pc confidently doing the process 2 minor cognition win 3 ta flat 4 major cognition 5 ability regained the above eps are given in ascending order of seniority 1 and 2 are both absolute minimums the first real flat point is when all the ta has been run out of process major cognition takes precedence over the ta criterion to continue over major cognition invalidates the pc the senior ep is ability regained which is also the ep of major auditing cyclehubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 28 july ad13 central orgs franchise time and the tone arm hco secs check out on all technical staff except for percentage of cases which is not star rated i recently completed study begun many years ago which gives us new hope and easier auditing of difficult cases we have known for many years dianetic axioms that time is the single source of human aberration this did not have the importance it deserved to make an ot one has to clear the time track this seemed very easy when i discovered few months ago that anybody can run an engram the reasons one cant are just 1 wrong time of the incident 2 wrong duration of the incident 3 incident may contain an implanted gpm or 4 it may be false track therefore having wrong time and wrong duration so anybody that can be put into an auditing session can run time track with good perception if the perceptions arent there its just wrong time or wrong duration or both or its gpm in which case one reverts at once to r3n or its false track in which event one finds accurately when it was installed and the duration of that incident all apparent grouping of the track comes either from wrong time or false track which is also wrong time either one looks like incidents are grouping well that seemed to wrap up clearing and ot but i still didnt broadly release it i wanted to be sure i dont mind being wrong but i dislike making you wrong in your auditing its already happened too often so i carefully researched this all over again and found it was not enough just to clean track one had to run track with tone arm motion thats the real barrier to clear and ot given the above data one can run incidents and gpms but do these when run give tone arm motion without tone arm motion charge is being released and actual case betterment is observed beyond few somatics removed the pcs session goals stay the same the pcs life doesnt change so the clue to ot and clear is tone arm motion it must exist during the session if it doesnt something is wrong at first i thought that dating prepcheck on dating or on dates would reestablish all ceased ta action it will up to point and is valuable repair of cases must contain such prepcheck and also discovering wrong dates and durations on engrams and gpms this is vital but it will not make some cases continue to get ta motion on the time trackif case even when cleaned up on dating and properly assessed for level and item in r3r or on r3n does not then get ta motion on running track another factor is present what is that factor the pc has fragile tone arm just one wrong date or duration in r3r or just one wrong ri in r3n and tone arm action ceases the ta going way up or down and staying there stuck ta cases then give us type of case so i knew there was another factor involved rather than time alone time remains the single source but pcs regard for or attitude about time can make it difficult for the auditor to run r3r or r3n regard for time sums up of course into arc about time or just arc the mechanics of time as in earlier writings time is actual but is also an apparency see dianetics 55 or other similar material time is measured by motion motion is matter with energy in space thus person can conceive of time as only matter and energy in space such as clock or planetary rotation time is actual but the person has become so dependent on matter moving in space to tell time that his time sense has become dependent on matter energy and space we care only for ta action our opinion of pcs time sense is unimportant does the pc get ta action on r3r andor r3n if so the pcs time sense is okay for making ot straight away if not if the ta is fragile sticks easily high or low then the pcs time sense needs improving time sense deteriorates to the degree that one has depended upon matter energy and space to tell time and on time confusing implants such as false track however running out false track on ta motion case is not an answer the dwindling spiral was as follows state time sense state b time sense dependent upon matter energy and space state c arc breaks with matter energy space and other beings state d deteriorated time sense by the time state d is thoroughly reached you have pc who gets ta motion running track as energy will not flow in the absence of time there are four degrees of poor time sense the first is average and common but is not enough to impair ta action the ta sticks but getting wrong dates off restores ta action which then continues the second is case that has to be continuously repaired and delicately handled to get any ta action at all the third is case that gets ta action on repetitive processes or rudiments but not on gpms or engram running while silently moving through an engram few people get ta action this comes when they answer what happened the third under consideration doesnt get any ta even when answering what happened and rarely if ever rrs the fourth is case that gets ta action on repetitive processes and very little if any on rudiments the four types of poor time sense compare to case level 5first type above gets ta action only when wrong dates are cleaned upcase level 6second above gets ta action only with constant careful handling and ta action always packing up case level 7third above ta action only on some repetitive processes and rudiments case level 8fourth above ta action on repetitive processes and only now and then on rudiments case levels 2 to 4 get ta action matter what happens this then ta action is your best index of case levels iq graphs tests behaviour in life are all incidental identification aaa is most easily present when time sense is awry therefore the degree person identifies different things establishes the degree of aberration programming cases are programmed only against ta action obtainable in auditing case must not be run without ta action or with minimal ta action case may be case level 5 and need only few wrong dates and durations corrected to get good ta action but it may also be case level 6 7 or 8 trial and error programming is best programme high and drop low matter what the morale factor may be try to run gpms the goal to forget etc with r3n if it cant be done assess for r3r preliminary step and run chain of engrams if still ta drop to processes for case level 7 if still ta drop to processes for case level 8 you may see by the pcs past auditors reports what the case level is how stuck has that ta been dont run case lower than it easily gets ta action and dont brand case at low case level and then never graduate it upwards when the lower process is flat the upper process should now be runnable the story is told by the ta with one exceptionauditor ability and training but case levels 2 3 4 are not all that influenced by the auditor ability the auditors skill has to be pretty good to run case level 5 on r3r and r3n the auditor doesnt live who can run r3r or r3n on case levels 6 7 or 8 it just wont run in the guess department the bulk of the cases about are 4s and 5s goodsized percentage are 6s and 7s about 10 are case level 8 about 10 are case level 3 therefore about 30 of usual group of pcs will run with good ta on the time track given trained auditing without trouble another 30 will run with good ta on the time track with careful coddling and serious date goofs except for the 1 case 3 the rest will fall into case levels 6 7 and 8 meaning that about 39 of the cases in scientology wont run at once on r3r or r3n and another 30 case level 5s need saint hiller hanging over the auditors shoulder or in the chair and the other 30 case level 4s will run very well and easily on r3r and r3nso the biggest percentage group case levels 6 7 8 combined need special processes to graduate up to action with r3r and r3n these case level 6 7 and 8 processes now exist and are being released as rapidly as they are demonstrated workable r2h for case levels 5 and 6 has already been released r2hl for case levels 6 and 7 is being readied up for bulletin the corner process and others for case level 8 are tested and the data is being assembled and other advances can be made to audit easily and relaxed with good ta action on the pc is my immediate desire for auditors and auditing supervisors i feel we are over the hump on this the fundamental solution to ittime and the tone armis contained in this

and gives us far less worries as auditors auditing cases for some time now overlooking four score of cases many very rough i have been breathing easy and theyre all winning 2 getting cases to rr on gpms is entirely matter of auditing those cases who dont on current basic processes until they do so it isnt worry about getting the case to rr its only how to get the case to run with ta action and get high enough to rr and run gpms we have the patterns and technology needful now 3 arc breaky cases the arc break assessments correctly done finish the problem of the consequences of arc breaks and put the auditor at cause over arc breaks 4 natter persons who get auditing and natter staff members who snap and snarl bad morale all wrap up in the arc break assessments this done weekly in any group on group members clearing every line restores theta atmosphere 5 incredulity of our data and validity this is our finest asset and gives us more protection than any other single thing if certain parties thought we were real we would have infinitely more trouble theres actual terror in the breast of guilty person at the thought of ot and without public incredulity we never would have gotten as far as we have and now its too late to be stopped this protection was accidental but it serves us very well indeed remember that the next time the ignorant scoff 6 the cold war has gotten less threatening differences are less violent we have had the time we needed 7 government attacks have entered more desultory stage meters will go to jury trial eventually and we will certainly win the us government attorney handling the case became terribly ill and had to resign it8 economic problems in organizations gross income is generally on the increase throughout the world and shows signs of dwindling and all this in the face of bad press personal income depends upon steady organizational gains and more positive results on pcs future personal income is without ceiling 9 personal states of case if you heed hco bulletin of july 28 ad13 and are getting good tone arm action on any process you will eventually make ot ot is wholly matter of consistent tone arm motion session after session not the significance of what is run 10 state of training as auditors although i would like to see more auditors trained at saint hill general training has improved and training data is complete shortened training time will soon be reality new positive goal for hpahcas will make more good auditors i feel very good about general auditing ability i recently summed up the basic skills of auditing and find that over the years we have been working right along and winning on training all training done has been to the good changing technology has not influenced the basic skills and forthcoming material follows the pattern in which we have been trained other problems solutions unexpectedly leaped up in fields where we were only vaguely aware of problems we bought an awful lot of time with the discovery of the exact nature of between lives implants and how its worked using this data it is possible to keep any scientologist from ever getting another one of those implants as the general course of living is therapeutic it takes violent implants such as earth people get at every death to keep people unaware of former lives and aberrated just by omitting those implants and using their reporting technology to keep in touch amongst ourselves we would salvage the lot in few hundred years in any event our data is too widely disseminated to be recollected and burned and just the other day i was personally looking over their shoulders world clearing is possible without extensive auditing if we just keep our own show on the road and keep track of each other this was breakthrough i didnt expect and its all ours the discovery of false pasts and futures was also bonus for it means more ta action on more cases and faster clearing its doubtful if ordinary track ever hurt anybody summary all weve got to do is keep going as we are for things to improve now the only thing which could slow us down is our own selfcreated dissidence all we have to do is do our jobs and keep the peace and weve got it the makebreak point is behind us ahead are only better days improving little by little day by day weve made it over the worst part lrh drcden l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 4 august 1963 central orgs franchise ll routines emeter errors communication cycle error the emeter has its role in all processing and must be used well however an emeter can be misused in several ways meter dependence the meter in actual fact does nothing but locate charged areas below the awareness of the pc and verify that the charge has been removed the meter cures nothing and does not treat it only assists the auditor in assisting the preclear to look and verify having looked pc can be made more dependent upon the meter or can be made more independent of the meter all in the way meter is used by the auditor if pcs case is improving the pc becomes more independent of the meter this is the proper direction meter dependence is created by invalidation by or poor acknowledgement of the auditor if the auditor seems not to accept the pcs data then the pc may insist that the auditor see it read on the meter this can grow up into formidable meter dependence on the part of the pc the rise of the ta is whats it the fall of meter ta is an its _____ to get maximum charge off the pcs groping whats it must become pcs finding its if the pc asks the auditor what or which reads on the meter and the auditor always complies the pcs ta will rise more and fall less as the pc is saying whats it and only the meter is saying its a_____ pc must be carefully weaned of meter dependence not abruptly chopped off the pc says whats it the auditor must begin to ask occasionally well whats it seem to you and the pc will find his own its _____ and the ta will fallas it would not if only the meter were employed milking the ta of all the action you can get requires that the pc get most of the its as for his whats its see diagram attached dating dependence rule use the meter to date and verify date correctness by all means but only after the pc has been unable to come up with the date example pc cant decide after much puzzling if it was 1948 or 1949 finally the auditor says 1948 1949 and sees the meter reads on 1948 and says it was 1948 but if the pc says it was 1948 the auditor only checks it if the ta sticks up higher meaning probably wrong date he checks with in this session have we had wrong date that reads what date was wrong and lets the pc argue it out with himselfta action will restoreris reliable items have to be clean the pc can usually tell but the pc cant tell the right ri out of list or the right goal unless the auditor sees it rr or fall but sometimes the auditor thinks an ri is clean longer reads having read when it still has somatics on it in this case its suppressed and the auditor checks it for suppress the pc saying the ri is not clean should still be reading carries more weight than the meter as the pc gets along in running time track and gpms with their goals and reliable items he or she often becomes better than the meter as to what is right or wrong what is the goal what ri still reads meter invalidation an auditor who just sits and shakes his head didnt rocket read can give pc too many loses and deteriorate the pcs ability to run gpms in conflict between pc and meter take the pcs data why because protest and assert and mistake will also read on meter you can get these off but why create them the meter is not there to invalidate the pc using the meter to invalidate the pc is bad form youll have less trouble by taking the pcs data for the pc will eventually correct it the meter is invaluable in locating bypassed charge and curing an arc break but it can be done without meter just by letting the pc think over each line read to him or her from the arc break assessment and say whether it is or isnt and if it is spotting the thing bypassed cleaning cleans the auditor who cleans clean meter is asking for trouble this is the same as asking pc for something that isnt there and develops withhold of nothing example ask do you have present time problem get needle reaction ask the pc for the ptp that hasnt read that is impossible for the pc to answer thats whats meant by cleaning clean dirty needle all dirty needles are caused by the auditor failing to hear all the pc had to say in answering question or volunteering data charge is removed from case only by the comm cycle pc to auditor the auditors command restimulates charge in the pc the only way this charge can be blown is by the pc telling the auditor auditor means listener the auditor who has not learned to listen gets first dirty needle next stuck tone arm finally arc break the most important line in auditing is from pc to auditor if this line is open and not hurried or chopped you get dirty needles and lots of ta action to continuously get in auditor to pc and impede the line pc to auditor is to pile up endless restimulated charge on case rule tone arm action of any kind without any significance of whats behind it will take pc to ot eventually rule the most correct track significances run but without ta action will not change but can deteriorate case rule the correct track significances run with ta action will attain ot fastest thus we see that an auditor can get everything right except ta action and not make an ot and we see that ta action without running specific things will make an ot though it might take thousand years therefore ta action is superior to what is run running the right things with ta action is faster only thus the line pc to auditor is somewhat senior to the comm line auditor to pc see diagram dont get the idea that the process is not important it is people were made to talk in psychoanalysis without getting anywhere but there they probably had ta and ran the wrong significances it takes the right process correctly run to get ta action so dont underrate processes or the action of the auditor realize that the answering of the process question is senior to the asking of another process question pc could talk for years without getting any ta action got it so listen as long as ta moves learn to see if the pc has said everything he or she wants to say before the next auditor action never do new auditor action while or if the pc wants to speak and youll get superior ta action cut the pc off get in more actions than the pc is allowed to answer and youll have dirty needle then stuck ta and then an arc break see the attached drawing of this and all will suddenly get clearer about any pc youve audited and trouble will evaporate by cutting the itsa line an auditor can make case gain disappear learn to listen thats what auditor means it has taken so long to see this in others because i dont cut the pcs line very often and repair it fast when i do so forgive for bringing it up so late when the pc is talking and youre getting ta you already have an arc break or are about to get one so assess the bypassed charge rule dont demand more than the pc can tell you rule dont receive less than the pc has to saywatch the pcs eyes dont take auditing actions if the pc is not looking at you dont give acknowledgements that arent needed over acknowledgement means acknowledging before the pc has said all summary running the right process is vital getting ta action on the right process is skilled auditing listening is superior to asking build up the pcs confidence in his own knowingness and continuously and progressively reduce the pcs dependence on meter lrhdrcden l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6308c06 shspec291 auditing comm cycles definition of an auditor that mixture which is not shaken stagnates for that reason we have checksheet changes people who ask for changes in organizational structure overlook the fact that the character of this planet and its population makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet it takes incredible stress and planning to get anything done on the backtrack one ia used to operating with ease and swiftness this planet is different this planet was part of federation and passed out of its control due to war etc this federation has been called the markab confederacy this sounds spaceoperaish but if it is true is should be stated whether it is acceptable or not the planets of the confederacy united out of fragments of earlier civilizations over the past 200000 years but it is not native to this galaxy in the past 200000 years mental implanting has been taking place that is not native to earlier track the markabians have the basic problem of how to kill thetan the best way to hide your overts is to give someone amnesia and tell them that something else happened thats what is going on here their ideal is the conformist what they are conforming to is pretty scummy and lowtoned their standard choice citizen is the contented wage slave this leaves the artist the brilliant engineer the manager the criminal and the pervert all persona non grata they are afraid of all these types so they condemn them to perpetual amnesia calling it being dead forever then they ship them here so on this planet we have minimal number of workers and maximal number of artists geniuses managers criminals and perverts how do you make an organization out of these dudes they are all non conformists therefore the difficulty you get in organizations with these people is alteris this has led to civilization on this planet that is totally different from the civilization that planted it here until recently when current western civilization started to look like the markab confederacy the fact that current western civilization has the same image as the markab confederacy makes this civilization restimulative it makes it look dangerous one of the highest crimes in the markab civilization is error in income tax that makes matters relating to income tax very restimulative here the material of the betweenlives area is contained in what to audit history of man pp 65 66 the markabians have not launched big reaction to the fact that their secrets are out probably because they fear that landing in force would restore everyones memory and blow the amnesia people get mad at governments and organizations on this planet because they are really mad at the markabian government almost unbelievable force was used by the markabians to create the amnesia you can easily restimulate peoples amnesia by giving them some data about the markabians it seems very unreal to them as an auditor therefore you are handling the roughest case in the universe to rehabilitate the individual you have to rehabilitate his knowingness charge on the case represents lost knowingness as the case moves up the line you get an odd phenomenon the case remembers more one kind of memory that is restored is picture memory at an advanced state the pc can tell the difference between false and genuine picture he graduates up to simply knowing without depending on pictures up to point of knowing who and where he has been independent of crossproof knowingness is slow to increase but it does rise over the top of that identityknowingness which is still rather general comes detailed knowingness eg knowing how you got here why you are here and other details of the past without pictures that is the restoration of the beingness of the individual it returns gradually bit by bit along this gradient what does it take to bring about such total amnesia total explosion of spaceship in his face twice was enough to be little confusing to lrh it takes far more force than that to destroy someones memory to the point where he would have case the force also has to be combined with trickery scrambling dates giving balanced items etc to keep the thetans memories scrambledthe amount of force it took is what the auditor has to get off the case its easier for the auditor and the pc to confront things like unknownness than to confront force but the force must be confronted eg in running ow getting off critical thoughts does nothing for the case theres something done behind it which contains energy and must be gotten off it is the energy contained in done that makes it hard to confront harder to confront than some random think the mission of an auditor is the restoration of persons awareness which includes restoration of his memory his identity what holds it down is force used with trickery thus an individual gets an arc break with force and then becomes the effect of force so you are handling someone who has lots of arc breaks with beings matter energy space time location and form that is pc an auditor has to be somebody who can release this force from the pc ta movement registers relief of force in the reactive mind force is being removed from the case as long as the ta is in motion when force is aberrated by trickery the ta hangs up until the trickery eg wrong dates is handled you dont always have to run process to get the ta moving ie particular curative process if the ta is moving the pc will eventually go ot auditing in the absence of ta motion will never produce an ot if you run the right significance off the case and get ta action you will make an ot quicker but running the right significances without ta wont do it while getting ta alone on anything right or not will eventually give you an ot if might take thousands of hours if you audited person randomly ia motion indicates the blowing off of encysted force as it leaves the case when you run the right significances it speeds up the case because you are running the force off early track and you get extra charge blowing which doesnt all show up on the meter sometimes you will see repetitive blowdown as remote force area blows up the most fundamental method of making ta move is not running process it is the basic definition of an auditor listener it is up to the auditor to permit the pc to blow the mass that has been restimulated by the process which he does by listening his basic job is to listen not to restimulate we can get away with restimulating charge because we can talk to each other the only way to get rid of reactive charge is by communication line that is the only method cf axiom 51 the auditor only gets hit by the charge if he stops it from flowing across the comm line all therapies from time immemorial have consisted of listening but what makes auditing different is the ta action which the auditor produces by restimulating charge and letting the pc blow the restimulated charge the auditor gives the command it crosses the distance and hits the bank square in confrontable aberrated area the bank now causes an effect on the pc the pc now becomes cause as he tells the auditor about it answering the question the pc gains some knowingness when he observes what happens when the command reaches him additionally life is always giving commands to the pc and restimulating all sorts of charge as the pc tells you about his betweensessions activities with or without sincemidruds ta occurs as he gets that restimulation communicated to you this shows that the line from the pc to the auditor is little senior to and more important than the auditors line to the pc in the former line you will find all auditing failures providing any process at all has been run if the case was loused up by auditing we inspect the ta in judging particular process if there was ta on the process the process was ok as far as getting the causedistance effect of the pc to the auditor goes when that line goes out the restimulation flows back to hit the pc where else can it go you see the first symptom of that line going out in the pcs dirty needle the auditor isnt listening he is doing something to shut the pc up the line with the pc at cause may take many times as long as the one from auditor to pc as the pc examines something undoes identification gets force off and gains knowingness the more ta action you get the more positive the pcsounds even in just one auditing cycle ta blowdown accompanies returning knowingness on the part of the pc the names of these main lines in the auditing cycle are the whatsit line from auditor to pc and the itsa line from pc to auditor the tone arm follows pattern it goes up on whatsit possibly the reverse happens on lowta case and it comes down on an itsa high ta shows you restimulated but unresolved charge when charge flows across the comm line it asises and the ta moves down knowing scientology if you were in the galactic confederation now you would be enthroned you could fix up all the messedup ots as long as you could listen in the confederation your pcs wouldnt have all the enforced amnesia you have to get rid of with an earth pc it would be like the difference between auditing an earth case and an ant the progression of events that occur when an itsa line goes out and is not restored is the following 1 dirty needle 2 stuck ta 3 arc break the itsa line is the most fruitful source of bpc charge restimulated and not allowed to flow out there are arc breaky pcs there are only auditors who dont listen the only crime you can commit by letting the pc talk is to do it without getting ta action what about the pc who is just talking motivators well they dont get ta from it besides someone who is just motivating is already in an arc break so you should find the bpc so that the itsa line which is the the same as just talk can get in again so let the pc talk as long as you are getting ta action and longer dont acknowledge just look intelligent and nod if the pc looks brighter at you this is case level 2 see above for description of this level auditing by the way if the pc is telling you all about the track lower down the case levels you have to direct the pcs attention more6308c07 shspec292 r2h fundamentals r2h is one of the most satisfying processes you have ever run for description of r2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment it takes apart arc breaks by assessment however it falls apart with inexpert handling it is different from any process we have ever had in dianetics and scientology it has great power it will run engrams and secondaries and may be senior to r3r the only thing it wont run is gpm which must be run with r3m and r3n r3m gets you the patterns of wildcat engrams r3m is how you got the gpm patterns in the first case in r3m dont ask the crisscross question on oppose i would ask what does the next pair consist of or give the oppterm of the third pair then what would oppose that r3n presupposes that you have the reliable items on some pcs if they dont random list you dont get ta random listing gets off the locks so you must still do this even if you have the item the main thing that causes the ta to rise and stick in r3n is wrong date or wrong gpm pattern cut itsa line will additionally send the ta up and stick it gpm is hard to date and floats on the track because its purpose was to foul up time the opposing items firing at each other sound like time to the pc the gpm floats in time and produces nochange situation this makes it perilously easy to misdate one also there is an implant basic to the helatrobus implants but much earlier which looks the same as the helatrobus implant it is at about trillions4 1048s years ago it is far more aberrative than the helatrobus implants that ia the one that they put on the screens in the betweenlives area see history of man pp 6566 gpms are the only things that need to be audited with special technique r2h has the potential for running wholetrack engrams and secondaries better than r3r by taking all the bpc out of them and letting them snap back to where they should be on the track we are not actually trying to erase everybodys time track in toto we are trying to take out of the time track the things that prevent the pc from having his pictures we are trying to pull the pcs havingness up to the point where he doesnt need pictures in order to know who he is if you can take the charge off of his unconfrontable pictures pictures that deny the knowledge of the track to him he can have pictures or not as he chooses the main pictures that louse things up are gpms however because the betweenlives implant has the target of invalidating all your pictures restimulating implants and wiping out identity and memory many people who are upset about auditing might think that you are trying to do this telling the pc that you are going to erase his time track will therefore cause an overwhelm lrh was thinking about outer space tactics and figured that lack of comm is the main trouble he speculated about entering societies from within with communication and wondered what would happen if we put up markab headquarters complete with flag etc they when they arrive they would think we are still loyal etc but the reaction of the earths population to the symbols could be rather wild the point is that when you tell the pc that you are going to erase his time track he goes into propitiative anaten because that is what has been done however if he had heard that you were going to return him his pictures he would feel very different pictures if inimical can be disowned the pcs real trouble is the pictures that keep him from seeing his pictures of course they are his pictures too but he disowns them you are only trying to pick out and handle pictures that bar other pictures when you have done this you will wind up with case level 2 see p 414 above with all his pictures then you can get at the automatic mechanism of picturemaking and place it under the pcs determinism whereupon you have got an ot level 1 see above there is an interesting point that can occur in auditing where the pc may disown the time track and just say well i dont know who i am but i am from there on you can have the track back with knowingnessyou could go at this another way instead of erasing pictures bring up the pcs confront on pictures to the point where he could face the hostile ones and understand them without flinching or misowning them this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach except that it gets the pc to confront his pictures r2h well run can give the pc greater ownership of pictures and it makes the pictures better and prettier life and beingness consist of potentials and abilities not things but the ability or potential to have r and c degree of livingness is measured by arc how much arc is guy capable of and degree of arc is measured by the amount of livingness person is capable of think of it as potential for having affinity what is arc arc with with other beings usually communication with other beings goes out through mest ie it uses mest vias one usually has arc with other beings through mest one can however communicate telepathically even without high arc in some civilizations there are such things as telepathic vocotypers telepathy is hardhitting force it can pick up the thoughts or fears of thetan down the line who is also being subjected to implanting arc can also go way above telepathy below certain level arc depends on mest for its communication medium arc only really gets important after one drops away from telepathic communication because it is so present before then that one thinks of it when you introduce mest into comm lines arc becomes the measure of life so one could be in arc with thetans matter energy space time form or location those are the principal things to be in arc with see fig 16 the arc an individual has expresses the degree to which he can be at cause over thetans matter energy space time form and location the potential of arc of the individual gives the degree to which he can be at cause over the things of life the less life he has the less he is as thetan gets more and more solid he can have less and less arc because he must have gone out of arc with mest form and location or it wouldnt be piled on him without his choice so he must have had arc breaks with these things but how could he without having arc breaks with other thetans it is probable that he did have arc breaks with other thetans and it was having arc breaks with other thetans that led him normally to have arc breaks with mest form and location not necessarily but normally the more the arc the more direct the communication the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication so as the thetan rises up the line he rises back up to direct communication direct reality and direct affinity with other beings when you drop away from telepathy you enter mest into the line and arc becomes subordinate to mest the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication then you get very low where thetan communicates to mest not just through it man is not mud but man who wasnt alive at all would think muddily and reach mudlike confused conclusions that is the condition of other mental sciences today their adherents are so far away from other beings that they are talking to mest not through it this is like the kid beating his red wagon or cussing mest objects this situation is different from investing mest with life and otherdetermining it which is on another harmonic you are perfectly capable of mocking up living being or investing matter with life and then otherdetermining it and having it walk around and talk this is potential discussed in dianetics the evolution of science apparently in the form of discussion of installing demon circuits in the mind see pp 32 60617 but what if you felt that another living being is more capable than shoe what if you divested living being of life that is how far south people have gone arc breaks with thetans matter energy space time form and location bring about the dwindling spiral of decreased arc one believes that it is deteriorated but it never really deteriorates r2h forecasts that by clearing up persons arc breaks the auditor returns to the pc his arc potential by cleaning up arc breaks with mest things you can clean up arc breaks with pictures of those things in the reactive mind hence the reactive mind becomes more accessible and confrontable since thetans matter energy space time form and location are what the pictures in the bank are images of thus in auditing one clears up arc breaks with things in pictures that the pc cannot confront in his reactive mindtherefore the bank becomes more confrontable and it opens up the basic concept of r2h is that the reactive mind is reservoir of arc breaks space space is the cure for noconfront the button of the bank is space so that it is right on top of you time you get an apparent absence of time in the reactive bank in the presence of totality of time you get nothing where something is and something where nothing is thats what makes the bank reactive instantaneous response regardless of when the response was laid in form this relates to aesthetic taste the pcs reactive mind has closeup stockpile of those forms that the pc has detested the most location an example is running an australian incident as being in england or you are poking around planets that are lightyears away without knowing it when you run such things they may spring back to their proper locations the problem is identification or disassociation disassociation is the reverse of identification two things which should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different r2h helps the pc to differentiate all the identifications of thetans mest forms and locations that he is afflicted with you could also run into disassociation if you really put in the itsa line the pc will be giving you all the disassociations he runs into as he looks over whatever it takes to answer your question he should see similarity between your question and his answer but he doesnt at first so you will get nonsequitur responses these are things that are on the pcs mind as he tries to answer the question hence to get them off his mind he says them the thing to do here is to wait until the disassociation is run out eventually the pc will answer the question disassociation is an inversion of identification which also gives an inversion of arc you get restimulation factor that works this way 1 the pc knew girl with pink hair 2 therefore girls with pink hair arent to be trusted 3 therefore nothing pink must be trusted 4 the pc knows fellow named pink who brushes his teeth so he had better not brush his teeth any more below disassociation you go into an inversion and you get more identifications at lower levels good comm is shooting people arc doesnt just decline it inverts and then inverts again there is bottom but odd things happen on the way down beingnesses forms and memory can die but not the individual there is some method of communication all the way down because arc never ceases you can get into weird versions of reach and withdraw for instance you have to go through the anger band so if you can improve c r or you can keep raising the triangle by running arc breaks as in r2h the main limit of the process is the limit of communication of the command recall an arc break but that can be communicated with little work if need be furthermore it is therapeutic to someone just to comprehend the definition of arc break you dont care what the pc is arc broken with in gpms you may get arc breaks with mest for obeying implanters and with implanters for debasing mest to this use it is an up scale case that recognizes real arc break with mest it all works out if you just follow the formal structure of r2h 1 ask for an arc break2 get what it was 3 get where it was 4 get when it was 5 do an assessment cleaning every line as it reads 6 work the arc break over until the pc feels fine about it and it longer reads take what the pc gives you dont probe the pc may get into trouble getting when you use your meter to help out only when the pc is in despair about the time and has utterly given up then just tell him what you have seen reading that is your meterdating you can watch the meter while the pc gives possible dates repair of r2h 1 when the ta is hung up you have wrong date and you had better find it 2 you can also get in big midruds on the session or the process because the pc has recalled arc breaks that he has suppressed and that he hasnt told the auditor 3 the pc can arc break in the session because of an arc break in the past 4 you may have missed read on the assessment so you dont have the right bpc when you get read on line of the r2h assessment be sure to take it up with the pc by getting the pc to tell you more specific data about the reading line eg on had some emotion been rejected you must find out what emotion was rejected dont just indicate the generality to the pc since that wont handle the arc break it is not the correct bpc if this doesnt work then one of the factors listed above under repairs is out if the pc protests line fine dont shove it down his throat but come back to it later it just wasnt ready to be answered you should get bds on finding the correct bpc if you dont get bds with running arc breaks you are going to have trouble with future arc breaks you must find the bpc getting one doesnt necessarily mean the arc break is fully cleaned up so check with the pc and notice the meter after you have gotten one bd you ask the pc how he feels about the arc break and watch the meter like hawk if the meter is clean and the pc ia ok now dont go on or you will be after withhold of nothing and you will create an arc break do not keep cleaning clean if the arc break isnt clean continue running it it doesnt matter how many arc breaks you handle per session what matters is how much ta you get dont leave an arc break until it reads smooth as glass if an arc break doesnt blow down you are asking for future trouble because you have bypassed some charge without cleaning it up the mechanism that you are operating on is that the incident will blow if the misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out and that arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge if you find the bpc there wont be an arc break and the pcs bank will straighten out clearing an arc break depends on itsa the slippiness of the process of running an arc break depends on knowing when to leave it and letting the pc get charge off with itsa you could theoretically get the pc all the way to ot with this just by getting the charge off6308c08 shspec293 r2h assessment the original meaning of the symbol 8 has to do with money it represents two money bags one on top of the other how can you evolve list 1 for r2h this has really taken some doing r2h is process with new rationale it is the case level 2 process see above for description of level 2 it is not just headed at ot but it would give you free needles as clear waystop in many cases you would get keyout phenomena that would give you the straightenedout track that would look very like case level 2 it is really only keyout but it would have the attributes of clear if you combined it with r3n when necessary to get gpms out of the way it would take you to case level 1 recent policy letter 30jul63 current planning gave series of scientology levels scn 1 pe level scientology scn 2 healing care of the body contains hpahca scn 3 advanced auditing and academy courses leading up to the phenomenon of clear

can make better human being class 4 he can make an ot class 5 he can make sane universe r2h can be used at scientology levels 2 3 and 4 it is phenomenal to have process that can be used at so many levels it would be putting lot of stress on the theory of arc to ask of r2h that it reach into level 4 and some holes in what we knew of arc showed up r2h turns out to be inadequate for certain kinds of work the only frailty of r2h given an auditor who listens and meter that reacts is in the list used if one specific type of charge was missing from list and you used that list on all arc breaks that specific type of charge would tend to charge up on the case it would be restimulated and encysted eventually it would gum up the track and overwhelm the pc so the weak point of r2h is the embraciveness of the list used lrh cooked up all sorts of fancy systems and finally hit on the formula that would give an embracive list it is very simple like the itsa line the full derivation formula is as follows the cdei scale has an upper and lower band which were previously missing known and unknown go above cdei you never get curious about something you know about so knowingness must have disintegrated down to unknownesses therefore things must be unknown before you enter cdei at all in the logics we have had the datum an unknown can cause confusion so that is how it fits in actually this is not in the logics dianetic axioms 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity and 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data may be relevant herethe know at the top of this expanded cdei scale is below notknow the first postulatesee p 14 above the know on this expanded cdei scale is evidently equivalent to know about the second postulate unknow on this scale then is evidently equivalent to forget the third postulate unknow is not the same as notknow you never get curious about something you know about so unknow would have to intervene between know and curious about on this scale below cdei there is lower band nothing an absence nothing to inhibit that is the black panther mechanism of ignore it man routinely does nothing about things below that there is one more level falsify falsifying puts something else there so that now you can get the whole scale again on an inversion the false at the bottom of one scale becomes the known at the top of the lower inversion scale so there is known falseness then unknown falseness then curious about the falseness etc all the way down so you get perversions of perversions falsifications of falsifications as you descend into lower and lower inversions of the scale so in this universe one probably never sees know but always form of false finally you get modern science based on the false premise that man is mud the pure cdei scale wouldnt handle engrams because it was incomplete and didnt invert the way the full scale does the pure cdei scale still shows only one band say 2010 of the tone scale whereas every time you go through one cycle of this expanded cdei scale you drop 70 on the tone scale now you can look at arc for an incident and arc for an earlier incident to each level of the expanded cdei scale we also add missed withhold and all this dives you the list 1 containing the totality of all possible combinations of charge on an arc break all possible levels that will have all possible reactions for everybody so combining them youve got attitude reality communication and missed withhold on each of the eight questions plus all these on earlier incidents giving you total list 1 with 64 questions that is how you would evolve list 1 if you were off in the boondocks you could use this schema by assessing the cdei scale on the incident first then assessing the level with r c and missed withhold the current list 1 is really the inhibit scale you wouldnt have to put in kucdeiof on missed withhold on lower level cases some on the levels of the expanded cdei scale are null anyway you can eliminate k u c d and 0 leaving you with i and f as the most potent sources of arc breaks because of the low case level with which you are dealing so for beginning cases this would leave 16 question list as you go upscale you find after awhile that your list falls short so that you have to add as too much someone at case level 2 would need still more expanded list dont have anything missing on list 1 the dale carnegie course is course in the creation of and maintenance of false realities psychiatry isnt even up to this lower case levels probably need emotion on the scale as well as attitude representing affinity in order for it to communicate to the pc after all the whole knowtomystery scale can go under affinity you might wonder why we dont expand this schema to include overt the answer is that ow mushes engrams and ruins pictures overts and prepcheck buttons ruin the energy structure of an engram because of gpms etc the buttons are too powerful and fundamental it takes certain amount of aberration to hold the picture together ao that you can run it but the buttons of arc and cdei only strip charge out of the engrams and make pictures better big midruds are ok for use on the physical universe as in ruds because the physical universe wont unmock easily at lower case levels however perhaps when the pc gets up the line into case level 1 using big midruds on the physical universe would be dangerous too we dont want the list to be too beefed up so that it mushes things up too much that would defeat the purposes of r2h the heaviest button on the list turns out to be falsity that is what the thetan objects to most and it is also what he feels guiltiest about falsity aberrates because it destroys trust it is part of every theta trap and it accounts for lots of arc breaks with mestthe way to get the most ta out of list would be to go down the list preassessing it then take the biggest read and have the pc explain and itsa about it method 5 sometimes when you use this method some pcs will drag the bpc that got restimulated on an earlier part of the assessment on through the rest of the list with him such pcs would do better being cleaned up level by level as you go along method 3 but if you do it that way the major charge that would give you bd has been bled of charge to the point that this major charge wont read much on the list you should therefore take any change of characteristic as read you get that difficulty in exchange for dirty needle the best solution might be preassessment that narrows the search too abbreviated list leaves you with bpc and high ta charge moves the time wrong in an incident the incident is charged say because of something that happened in 1912 but the incident is in 1920 you could miss this leaving bpc and eventually getting stuck high ta from the wrong date process that would be ta pump would be recall worry what was it about from this you get ta pump consisting of an alternating whatsit and itsa this is not particularly therapeutic one other point what if you had pc who got ta but got better his failure to get better would be an apparency eventually he would go ot but it could take thousands of years however you also have to run the right significances you also have to complete cycles case change may result from shifting processes on the pc that you were getting ta on with this happening the case could still get better but uncomfortably also you can restimulate things on case that dont get handled for some time for instance you could early on get screenrestimulated engrams that could not be run out right away this would be an unnecessary restimulation of charge getting better is not how the pc feels but whether he is getting more knowingness and more ability also current state is not measure of getting better for instance person may have had good memory and awareness level and had it knocked out in the last betweenlives this then would be temporary condition you have to review case over at least thirty days to know what the true state of affairs ishubbard communications office saint hill manor east

is less important than the ta action 4 ta action on the right significance brings about faster clearing 5 the right significance and ta action equals case gain 6 keep the itsa line in 7 get ta action 8 when training an auditor get him to figure out how many ways you can cut an itsa line the smoothest auditing is the auditing which least cuts the itsa line auditor means listener 9 it takes lie to hold aberration in place 10 serious aberration surrenders easily its the mediocretype aberration that takes the long haul 11 the primary difference between scientology and psychiatry is that psychiatry is authoritarian and tells the person what is wrong with him often introducing new lie scientology finds out what is wrong with the person from the person and then knows more about it than the person but listens anyway 12 listening is the badge of superior knowledge he who has privileged to listen only he who has superior knowledge talks all the time with this data you could evolve all of scientology dont discount the knowledge of scientology even though you dont use it to evaluate for the pc if pc feels unreal about having lived for say 30 trillion years let him go through the unreality and run it out he will natter about how unreal it is he has never talked about an unreality before but in the process of talking about it he is raising his arc with whatever it is albeit slowly pc has two kinds of talk theta talk and entheta talk auditing consists of two actions corresponding to these two kinds of talk 1 listening with ta action this is getting theta talk out of the pc keeping the itsa line in it is theta the pc is generating that is blowing his bank apart 2 locating eg by assessment trapped charge entheta talk is handled by locating the impeded charge of theta which is barriered in the bank bpc this is the first step of putting in the itsa line find what trapped charge is trying to get loose the pc is talking up out of the bank he has been protesting cut communication lines unrealities and lack of affinity charge has been ticked and missed and the pc will go on nattering unless the auditor locates and indicates the charge what about talking havingness down this only occurs when it is entheta talk the whole phenomenon of havingness is raising arc with the environment if the pc is cutting his arc with the environment his havingness will drophow many ways can you cut an itsa line it would be beneficial to an auditor in training to give you all the ways he can think of it with an example of each and how to prevent or remedy it there are three parts to successful session 1 get the pc in session ie interested in his own case and talking about it 2 keep the itsa line in so that you get maximal ta action 3 knock out the significances necessary to resolve the case fastest the above would define the superskilled auditor you would get lower classes of auditors as you cut out parts of this until you end up at the bottom with book auditor whose skill is just to listen to the pc talk about his case with idea of ta or right significance when training auditors pound one significance home at time dont get complicated and you will win for instance on coaudit just keep the pc talking about himself dont worry about repeating the command or acknowledging etc all you want is the pc telling the auditor about his troubles you can see improvements if the pc looks brighter and talks better ie if he shows increased arc as you move the auditors skill up to using meter you want to get ta motion keeping the ta moving is the deepest problem in auditing at present this can get complex the reason ta stops is time the type of incident that is the most tastopping is the gpm especially after it has been redated crossdated or grouped in one of the betweenlives screens and after it has been mislocated if there were gpm probably nobody could group bank the gpm gets pinned down in the betweenlives screens and ta stops it is timestopper because it floats in time and appears instantaneous the auditing action that stops ta motion is wrong date it tends to group incidents if the incident is 3d visio and stays in the same place as you run it the date is ok if person is running different incidents at once he has wrong date if you wrongdate gym it is grim ta stops as if hit by truck it is possible to date gpm but the reads on dates are tiny because it is gpm and it is very rough to date it after you have dated gpm the date is as valid as you get ta if ta packs up the gpm is very likely to have been misdated you could find that you have to redate gpm when the pc gets off enough charge to spot that the first date was screen date your new date could still be only temporarily right you could go for seven sessions getting it dated which could be very fine if you kept the itsa line in and let the pc help you most of the track you see is real track but it is often invalidated false track is nothing because there really is false track there are false pictures but false track is just the dub in someone has put over his actual pictures if you invalidate someones track hard enough and hit him hard enough he puts dubin over the top of the picture which looks like the original except that it has little film over it as you audit it the film comes off and he sees the original picture the dubin is not very different from his own track actually the unreality the pc gets about the picture is the force and invalidation that has been laid in if you hit someone hard enough things get unreal down to unconsciousness unconsciousness is just total unreality so there are also arc break phenomena which prevent the meter from reading well that is one reason why the meter reads so little on gpms they are full of arc brokenness but if you just keep trying to date the gpm and dont cut the itsa line you will get ta having the itsa line in and blowing charge will increase the pcs reality on the incident to the point where the date is more and more real bundles of facsimiles will start to come apart if you just keep chewing at gpm in this way chewing at its date its pattern etc it will suddenly be there so clearly that you will wonder how you ever missed it you are getting enough charge off so that he can see it keeping the itsa line in while dating is very helpful but hard to do at times let the pc give you anything he can tell you about the date get all the ta out of it first and only go to the meter when the pc throws in the sponge then work it over and when it is all hopeless with the meter talk from the pc takes over keep at it persevere and relax it might take up to seven sessions to get the date the stable datum is that if you keep chewing away and trying to find it suddenly enough charge will disappear so it all folds up and you get it just keep him talking and he will come up with it but the more you askthe meter for the data the less you will win you can kill ta by evaluating because the itsa line is being put in for him dont put in the itsa line for the pc the meter gives you preview of coming attractions meter reads at deeper level of awareness than the pc when some charge is blown the pc will now see what the meter saw awhile earlier you say whatsit and the pc says itsa this is auditing but if the pc says whatsit and you use the meter to say itsa the ta folds up this will occur if you create meterdependency it is better if you must tell the pc what the meter says to present it as question if you put in the whatsit and get itsa from the meter you will get ta action if you have pc demanding information you can help him out it is more desirable to use the meter than to have the pc quit sometimes you have to snap in the itsa line try to get the pc certain before using the meter then you may use the meter but get the pcs agreement first as an itsa eg concerning the date you can work back and forth with the pc and the meter using the meter to jog the whatsit eg to get the order of magnitude then ask the pc if he gets anything let him find it if he asks does that read see if you can get him to say itsa eg by asking does it seem right to you then when he has said itsa you can confirm it with that reads one way to cut an itsa line is by continually asking for more than the pc can give for instance the pc says proudly ive got picture of some mountains the auditor says what kind of mountains are there any people or when the pc says i just cant find the date i dont have clue the auditor says well come on what is it this stretches an itsa line beyond its ability to stretch the situation is that you have bled off all the restimulation that was available so stir up little more by using the meter on one step or so of dating the pc easily invalidates his own reality and ability to know date dont above all use the meter to invalidate him it is better to leave the charge on something than to arc break the pc about it if he gives you date and asks for meter confirmation and there is read make it as ok as possible for instance you could say well i didnt see one there it doesnt say anything right now on that use your meter to give him the whatsit line and coax the itsa line at last resort all you have is your meter like when there is howling arc break and the pc isnt talking or thinking that applies to sessions where the pc is out of comm you can cut an itsa line to ribbons with arc break assessments as the drop of hat the value of the assessment is when all else has failed because the most operating thing you have around you is the pc the problem of how you discharge gpm without cutting the itsa line is tricky one what if he is going over one pair of items and the next pair comes up and he wants to go on if you leave bypassed charge on the items you are doing he will arc break one solution is to write down the new pair acknowledge them and then clean up the old pair the whatsit line raises ta the itsa lowers it the solution of mystery is the resolution of the case and the restoration of ta motion the pc is stuck on whatsit for which he has itsa when the ta quits the pc sometimes has his own whatsits he forgets the whatsit you gave him and never gives the itsa so you get high ta pcs do this all the time especially during break hence you could ask is there anything your attention is on or did you speculate about anything during the break the funny thing is that asising whatsits doesnt give you auditing you cant asis whatsits you could ask get the idea of questioning things repetitively this would give you high ta the bank is composed of cure to the problem or puzzle the reason that the puzzle is hung up is that there is something in it that was cure cures brought about problems to asis problems you have to pick up the cure which is the itsa the problem was the whatsit the cure is the itsa so you announce the confusion the pc gives you the stable datum and you get restoration of balance it blows off twoway comm blows all the locks off of engrams for instance if the pc says that he has big ptp you could ask when he became aware of it what solutions he has had for it etc so you need to find the whatsit and the itsa problem is in microcosm gpm you could ask what have you been puzzled about what answers might there have been to it auditing questions must balance between announcing the puzzle and asking for the cure6308c15 shspec295 the tone arm meter that only had tone arm would be useful to teach auditors to keep the tone arm moving it should have the same numbers it should probably also have onehanded electrode it should be very small and rugged ideally it should be able to go through the bottom with stop you could hang it on the pc with belt and keep him on it for cchs it would show discharge of charge the minimum ta you should get is 025 divisions per twenty minutes 075divisions per hour small amount of ta is enough for healing needle blowoff is enough r3t or r2t consist of putting in the itsa line and dating even 01 division per twenty minutes is enough to blow somatic that is enough for healing but not enough to make the pc feel better as result of auditing this explains the oddity that dianetics heals chronic somatics with the pc not realizing that auditing had done anything you would heal the illness but the person still doesnt believe in dianetics you havent helped the person that was what drove us out of healing not the medicos auditors found it frustrating without understanding the ta it is doubtful if the auditor will ever be able to predict his result if you know about the ta you will know that if the pc got ta in session 1 he is liable to throw the auditor curve at the end of the session 2 he is liable to have some sort of upset within twentyfour hours 3 you have restimulated charge because all auditing restimulates charge these phenomena are not inevitable the reason ow is not being stressed is that not all auditors seem able to restimulate overts they accept critical thoughts and motivators and miss all the pcs withholds any auditing that requires extraordinary targeting and restimulation becomes more difficult to do difficult part of auditing is in selecting the significances of restimulation which the auditor must engage in with the pc the degree of restimulation restimulated in the significance becomes an even greater level of skill eg the question of how much gpm you have to restimulate to get the gpm run the skillful auditor restimulates only the number of items he wants to run the less skilled the auditor the more items and gpms he restimulates in order to get one pair to run the whatsit line regulates restimulation on the whatsit line you should 1 know what you are going for 2 know what you have to get to 3 have heart and dont overrestimulate 4 avoid q and auditing works by restimulation and blowing of charge you can blow charge on an early incident of chain and have the later charge blow off without registering on the meter that speeds things up if you dont put in the itsa line and let the charge blow off the pc stacks it up and arc breaks etc etc not restimulating charge at all or restimulating too little charge equally result in noauditing this will give an arc break because the expectation of auditing not fulfilled will itself bleed charge which is then bypassed and will blow up restimulating too little charge or charge is worse than restimulating too much charge for instance you will get in bad trouble if you fail to run the pc through an engram twice because he is in pain incidently thetan in good shape probably enjoyed pain you can pick this up by asking the pc to waste some pain repetitively he will cognite that he can have it sadism isnt peculiar it is lower harmonic of an actual fact any sensation is better than sensationanything is better than nothing that is different from only being able to enjoy pain as thetan goes upscale he can stand more effect most newspaper reporters are unauditable if you try to audit them all you get is lot of missed withholds the reporters attention is all out there he has attention on his case this guy has lot of arc breaks he is dramatizing overts indicating bpc gives the pc control over his charge when you run circuit with charge on it it gets spongelike character then it starts picking up charge whether you want it to or not out of the intention that auditing will occur it will still bleed charge out of the bank and the pc will still arc break ta measures the adequacy of restimulation it shows that an adequate amount of charge is being restimulated and that it is adequately dispelled with the itsa line there is really miles of margin for error on either side of the ideal amount of restimulation where you will still get ta and case gain you can have the pc swamped and still get ta or you can be running the pc pretty shallow and still get ta there is lot of tolerance too much or too little restimulation beyond this margin of error causes cessation of ta the meter doesnt tell you if you are getting too much or too little restimulation most standard processing is strong enough that you are not restimulating too little charge auditors therefore dont worry much as long as there is some ta motion just doing any auditing at all guarantees some restimulation what you are auditing regulates how much charge you are restimulating using upperlevel processes you are only going to err by getting overrestimulation since niagaras of charge are available if you are going through gpms without getting ta it is not because there is too little restimulation it is overrestimulation if there is too much charge the pc shuts it down and the ta locks up you can say that it is unreal to the pc but unreality consists of 1 force uncoordinated raw force 2 invalidation 3 disagreement on the thought level so to say that something is too unreal to the pc is to say that there is too much charge on it the auditors problem is delicately to put the whatsit line in the right place so as to bleed off charge where the pc can confront it if the discharge line gets overloaded the pc will explode in an arc break the problem of the auditor therefore is not how to restimulate more charge it is not the problem of how to empty the atlantic ocean but how to bleed few drops off of it the pc may beg you for oneshot clear process here you see the working of the effect scale what the pc needs is some small effect some line to bleed charge that is small enough not to be dangerous he is very careful because everything is live wire if you run any pc at too high level it can become too much for his body while still being ok for continuing to get ta eg person with cancer is in an almost continuous arc break however if you go above the charge tolerance then thats it for the ta lrh comments on wilhelm reichs character armor wilhelm reich had an esoteric form of charge that he called orgone this sort of charge was thought to be involved in the buildup of arthritic deposits charge is also what caused things to break around jung and it is what gives people odd somatics acute or chronic acute charge destimulates in three to ten days if it keeps on being restimulated with opportunity to be destimulated or bled off one gets chronic somatics even then it takes periodic restimulation at the end of each lifetime to keep thetan as unaware and charged up as he is there is preparation series of gpms that have thirty to forty wrong dates apiece with command to return sandwiched between each of about eighty gpms the goals make life the opposite terminal they are all derogatory goals like to be wrong or to get caughtyour first indication that the pc is nearing his limit of restimulation is lessening of ta action by this time the pc is already past the point of comfortable charge level audit as delicately as possible at this point as you go on be sure the itsa line is very in and dont let any more charge get restimulated until you have cleaned up what you have do not let the pc dive into earlier track matter how eager he may be to do so that is how you get stuck tas haul out of there start getting thorough you can ordinarily trace back any ceased ta to some action that stirred up more charge than got handled for instance say we run the center goal out of the bear implant then we start running the rest of the goals suddenly we lose ta action we have just restimulated three or four out of five goals ie we have three or four gpms on restimulation that amount of charge stirred up eliminated ta motion the overcharged case is always the high ta case it is the whatsit line that is responsible for this overrestimulation with resultant high or low ta even if it is life or the pc that put the whatsit line in the wrong thing to do is to get wore whatsit tell something you have been worried about is therefore not good process it is all whatsits for the pc to look at if you want to cure the overcharged case you could assess his problems to central one and ask what solutions have you had for this problem this allows the pc to itsa and thus permits the ta to come down the cures give you the itsa line get all the whatsits already in restimulation and get the solutions off that will give you itsa bring the ta down and get the ta into action when you finish one whatsit with itsas find another whatsit that is already there and finish it etc this is guaranteed to fix the ta find something small enough for the pc to let go of knowingness and reality dont increase unless you get charge off the case so the case knows that nothing has happened unless you increase his knowingnesshubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 august ad13 central orgs franchise scientology two star rated hco bulletin how to do an arc break assessment hco secs check out on all technical executives and personnel tech dir check out on hco secs and assn org secs the successful handling of an arc break assessment is skilled activity which requires 1 skill in handling meter 2 skill in handling the itsa line of the auditing cycle 3 skill in assessment the lists given in hco bulletin of july 5 ad13 arc break assessments are used either from that hco bulletin or amended there are several uses for arc break assessments 1 cleaning up session arc break 2 cleaning up auditing in general 3 cleaning up pcs or students possible arc breaks 4 cleaning up member of the publics possible or actual arc breaks 5 regular use on weekly basis on staff or organization members there are others those above are the chief uses for long time periods the standard 18 button prepcheck is faster but an arc break assessment is still useful in conjunction with it the drill is simple if complicated by adding in r2h material dating and other additives the arc break assessment ceases to work well and may even create more arc breaks if used every time pc gets in little trouble in r3n or r3r the arc break assessment is being used improperly in r2h r3n r3r sessions it is used only when the pc shows definite signs of an arc break to use it oftener constitutes auditing unnecessary use of an arc break assessment may arc break the pc with the assessment the arc break assessment may be repaired by an 18 button prepcheck on arc break assessments arc break assessment by steps step one select the proper list this is done by establishing what the pc has been audited on if more than one type of bypassed charge is suspected do more than one list if the arc break is not completely cured by one list do another kind of list all lists have been in hcobs as lstep two inform the pc that you are about to assess for any charge that might have been restimulated or bypassed on his or her case do not heavily stress the arc break aspect right i am going to assess list to see if any charge has been bypassed on your case wrong im going to try to cure or assess your arc break step three without regard to pcs natter but with quick attention for any cognition the pc may have during assessment as to bypassed charge assess the list phrase the question in regard to the reason for the assessmentin this session during this week in scientology etc call each line once to see if it gives an instant read the moment line gives reaction stop and do step four step four when line reacts on the needle say to the pc the line reacts what can you tell about this step five keep itsa line in do not cut the pcs line do not ask for more than pc has let pc flounder around until pc finds the charge asked for in step four or says theres such charge if line reacted because the pc did not understand it or by protest or decide make it right with the pc and continue assessing step six in session if pc found the bypassed charge ask pc how do you feel now if pc says he or she feels ok cease assessing for arc breaks and go back to session actions if pc says theres such charge or gets misemotional at auditor keep on assessing on down the list for another active line or even on to another list until the charge is found which makes pc relax in routine arc break check not session but for longer period dont stop assessing but keep on going as in step five unless pcs cognition is huge end of steps please notice this is not r2h there is dating the auditor does not further assist the pc with the meter in any way if the pc blows up in your face on being given type of charge keep going as you have not yet found the charge typical response to wrong charge found pc well of course its cut communication youve been cutting my communication the whole session you ought to be retreaded etc note here that pcs attention is still on auditor therefore the correct charge has not been found if the bypassed charge has been found the pc will relax and look for it attention on own case several bypassed charges can exist and be found on one list therefore in cleaning up week or an intensive or career any long period treat list like rudiments cleaning everything that reactsblow down of the tone arm is the meter reaction of having found the correct bypassed charge keep doing steps one to six until you get blow down of the tone arm the pc feeling better and being happy about the arc break will coincide almost always with tone arm blow down you can however undo session arc break assessment by continuing beyond the pcs cognition of what it is continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited invalidates the pcs cognition and cuts the itsa line and may cause new arc break rarely but sometimes the arc break is handled with ta blow down purpose of assessment the purpose of an arc break assessment is to return the pc into session or into scientology or into an org or course bypassed charge can cause the person to blow out of session or out of an org or course or scientology with session formerly in is defined as interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor against session against session is defined as attention off own case and talking at the auditor in protest of auditor pt auditing environment or scientology with scientology with scientology is defined as interested in subject and getting it used against scientology against scientology is defined as attention off scientology and protesting scientology behaviour or connections with organization with organization can be defined as interested in org or post and willing to communicate with or about org against organization against organizationness is defined as against organization or posts and protesting at org behaviour or existence the data about arc breaks can be expanded to marriage companies jobs etc indeed to all dynamics with dynamic against dynamic what it boils down to is this there are only two conditions of living but many shades of grey to each one these conditions are 1 life not arc broken capable of some affinity for some reality about and some communication with the environment and 2 death arc broken incapable of affinity for reality about and communication with the environment under one we have those who can disenturbulate themselves and make some progress in life under two we have those who are in such protest that they are stopped and can make little or progress in life one we consider to be in some arc with existence two we consider to be broken in arc with existencein session or handling the living lightning we handle people can be hit by forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them their affinity reality and communication life force is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an arc break or have an arc broken aspect if they know what charge it is they do not arc break or they cease to be arc broken it is the unknown character of the charge that causes it to have such violent effect on the person people do not arc break on known charge it is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the arc break this makes life look different and more understandable people continuously explain so glibly why they are acting as badly as they are whereas if they really knew they would not act that way when the true character of the charge or many charges as in full case is known to the person the arc break ceases how much bypassed charge does it take to make case the whole sum of past by passed charge this fortunately for the pc is not all of it in constant restimulation therefore the person stays somewhat in one piece but prey to any restimulation auditing selectively restimulates locates the charge and discharges it as seen on the action of moving tone arm however accidental rekindlings of past charge unseen by pc or auditor occur and the pc mysteriously arc breaks similarly people in life get restimulated also but with nobody to locate the charge thus scientologists are lucky in heavily restimulated circumstances the person goes out of in such condition people want to stop things cease to act halt life and failing this they try to run away as soon as the actual bypassed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person up goes affinity and reality and communication and life can be lived therefore arc breaks are definite their symptoms are known their cure is very easy with this understanding and technology an arc break assessment seeks to locate the charge that served being hidden as whiphand force on the person when it is located life returns locating the actual bypassed charge is returning life to the person therefore properly handling arc breaks can be called with exaggeration returning life to the person one further word of caution as experience will quickly tell you seeking to do anything at all with an earlier bypassed charge incident which led to the arc break immediately the earlier incident is found will lead to vast mess let the pc talk about it all the pc pleases but dont otherwise try to run it date it or seek to find what bypassed charge caused the earlier incident in assessing for arc breaks keep the itsa line in very well and keep the whats it out in every respect except as contained in the above six stepssummary an arc break assessment is simple stuff so simple people are almost certain to complicate it it only works when kept simple old auditors will see similarity in an arc break assessment list and old end rudiments they can be handled much the same but only when one is covering long time period otherwise assess only to cognition and drop it the trouble in arc break assessments comes from additives by the auditor failure to keep on with additional lists if the type of charge causing the arc break isnt found on the first list chosen failure to read the meter and failure to keep the itsa line in doing arc break assessments to cure arc breaks is not the same drill as r2h and confusing the two leads to trouble handled skillfully as above arc break assessing cures the great majority of woes of auditing registraring training and handling organization if you find you arent making arc break assessments work for you check yourself out on this hco bulletin carefully review your meter reading and examine your handling of the itsa line if you want live people around you learn to handle arc break assessments dont worry about pcs getting arc breaks worry about being able to cure them with assessment until you have confidence you can theres nothing so uplifting as that confidence except perhaps the ability to make any case get ta motion dont ever be reasonable about an arc break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one because if that arc break exists the pc doesnt know whats causing it and neither do you until you and the pc find it if you and the pc knew what was causing it there would be further arc break lrhdrcden l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6308c20 shspec296 the itsa line the itsa line is the pcs comm line to the auditor it is not always pursuant to the auditors whatsit sometimes it is pursuant to the pcs whatsit the auditing cycle is made up of concatenation of comm lines comm line can be very faint as with the attention line there may be lines preceding the attention line as the auditor gets the pc to put his attention on the auditor having an attention line already extant you convert it to an itsa line theres the situation where the pcs attention line is on something other than the auditor if the auditor is adroit he can flick it over to where he wants it for instance the pc says i cant stand wild parties blah blah it takes skill to flick the attention over to what you want the pc to talk about this is getting the itsa line in pc will always follow the leastcharged aberrative line with his ta action ta exists on the leastcharged aberrative line at any moment the mind is so regulated that it will not release charges that the pc considers too dangerous ta action ceases when you have too much charge you could bleed it off but you have gotten into too much charge and ta action equals case advance even if you get somatics off you can make it even worse by running the pc with ta action you can make the needle action cease too the longer you run case with ta action the more the case freezes up and the harder it will be to produce ta action the most likely way to get ta action on case is to get in the itsa line routine1c routine 1comm is the process that does this it is soft touch way of getting in the itsa line this is the workhorse it requires deftness but it gets in the itsa line on jammed overcharged case and it will restore ta action per btb 4dec71r i r1c r1c consists of 1 finding something that moves the ta 2 running the ta out of that subject to fn cog vgis the usual method of finding what to run in general r1c is by assessment of dynamics assessment by dynamics gives series of questions covering each of the dynamics this is assessed by tone arm as given in emeter drill 23 take up the reading question by use of further questions on that same subject the best way to restore ta action to case that has become overcharged is to cleverly get in and handle the itsa line cleverness is required you could ask the pc who comes into session talking about something else did our last session have anything to do with this this puts his attention back into session gently without putting it on the auditor this is preferable to the psychoanalytic practice of letting the pc run on and on about irrelevancies getting your job done and having your pc like you all the time conflict and are sometimes diametrically opposed the crudest way to get the itsa line in is tell about it this is functional however what you want to do is to move the itsa line around enough to relieve his problem to the point where you can put the attention line on significance that will give him case advance it is about as skilled as building watch very adroit to the point of invisibility you duplicate what he has been talking about and pull his itsa line bit further and put it on something you want it to be on you can even reuse the pcs origination later when you have run out of ta or itsa for instance the pc complains of headaches you get him to examine how they are affected by what you are auditing then several sessions later you can bring the headaches up again as needed unless you can handle the attention line smoothly you cant get the itsa line established you are split between wanting the pc to think well of you and getting your job done in the end they come to the same thing but for the moment it is matter of making forward progress despite unavoidable or avoidable upsets be as clever and as adroit as you can plus little there are thousands of ways to shift the pcs attention say his attention is on something you ask what have you learned about _______ you get ta parallel what the mind is doing and you can control it find what the pcs attention is on and if you can get tamotion by having the pc locate things about what his attention is on he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it it is the ta motion that takes off the compulsion not the significance of what he digs up the pc way be talking about his grandmas jammaking but if he is getting ta motion he is getting gains the fastest recovery comes with combination of significance and ta motion the least charged aberrated area of the case is where you will get ta motion sometimes direct approach to highlycharged area may fail until it is unburdened by getting ta off some other area first when you work with that area the latter area the pc will know that processing works for him pcs always make gains if they are getting ta motion ta motion only occurs when the itsa line is in why do we call it the itsa line the itsa line is more than just comm line it is seeing something to describe and describing it person in jail cant go to anywhere to see if itsa he cant say itsa beach or itsa brighton etc nightmare is the inability to itsa followed by mocking up something that can be itsaed that is wrong itsa is the way the thetan orients himself itsa ceiling itsa floor itsa wall etc itsa therefore ima cf descartes with i think therefore i am hide somebody and the itsa line is cut on himself one else can say itsa disassociate somebody from his identity and he wont be able to itsa himself he wont be able to say itsa joe jones this is the basic aberration inability to orient identify declare or recognize it is not just the inability to solve if itsa is so important to ability memory identity and power then we would expect the major trick on the track to be that of cutting the itsa line one way or the other and so it is implanters give you all sorts of false data you get killed one way and they convince you that you died another way or that you didnt die at all they disrupt your itsa line this can go on to the point where people believe that they live only once the reportback mechanism is even used by doctors when they have insane people report back for shocks etc people think that what we are doing is unreal but we know the substance of their unreality we know where their itsa line is out the notion man is an animal at death there is cessation of cellular commotion makes nothing of everyone the itsa line can be out of arc and on kucdeiof the whole scale for r2h tell someone that something that is isnt and his itsa line will go out give someone chalk for candy he bites into it his itsa line is out this is the false level nothing say that nothing haunts this planet its all natural and anyone who thinks otherwise must be paranoid say something isnt that is or that something is that isnt like the darwinian theory inhibited tell someone not to examine something because it is dangerous enforced know this or be shot desired wanttoknow itsa curious curiosity itsa not just curious about then theres unknown itsa you have reality on the unreality of people on this planet the itsa is their unknowingness thetans tolerance rises to where he can confront an unknown comfortably without doing anything about it x in algebra would be an example of this mathematician has gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and having to solve it all some auditors likewise cant stand the pcs being in an unknown as he is working on an itsa and have to leap in and get the itsa line in themselves with the meter known an itsa line can be too known for instance some crimes are unsolvable because they are committed in too known fashion the obviousness of the postman makes him the ideal murderer in mystery he is too known sometimes things are too obvious that also includes the everyone knows that never gets examined itsa identifies either individually or if that is not possible by classification by type you get comfortable feeling from this which every now and then gets betrayed eg when you find out that you are in stage set not room this gives you an arc break from the false itsa gpms are full of such false itsas the subject of itsa has to do with straightening out ones arc with the universe it is an interesting question why there should be this passion for itsa getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pc to auditor comm line in the latter is more likely to be related to the pcs attention line to the auditor getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify inspect decide about and differentiate things in his bank or in thephysical universe eg in objective processing the room you could probably get ta by running whats that and pointing at things this is not always workable itsa is familiarization eg with car or typewriter that is why familiarization processes like touch that _______ work person who is really itsaing is blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusion about an area that is the mass aspect the force aspect of it when you have itsad on area the area never comes up again until then the area keeps coming up in the future ten years in the past two trillion years in the past as this as that etc while the pc is looking for the itsa what drives some auditors nuts is the extra itsas he puts in and takes out this that lot of apparent itsas come off before you get the final itsa but you could almost say that all the running of case on through to the final cognition the final itsa consists of conditional itsas an auditor should never expect only permanent itsas it is adroit of the auditor to use the pcs attention line to get the itsa line in by steering it to areas that can be itsad put the pcs attention on things he can identify letting the itsa line exist is the lowest level of auditing putting the itsa line in is more active the universe is full of whatsit lines so concentrate on the itsa line the itsa line will suffer from being too known as in everyone knows the itsa line is the pcs line to the auditorhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 august ad 13 central orgs franchise scientology three four r3rr3n the preclears postulates we have long known that the preclears postulates made at the time of the incident contained charge as the preclear is moved back on his time track beyond trillions three you will find that incidents and reliable items contain less charge proportionately to the pc who was stronger then and that the pcs postulates made then contained more charge in short as you go earlier on the time track the incidents seemed weaker to the pc then and the pc being more capable had stronger postulates thus it is not uncommon to find gpm on the early track producing only falls on the pc and the pcs postulates made at that time rocket reading or falling this in fact gets even more disproportionate so that on the very early track you might find that running ris out of gpm produces ta motion but taking the pcs postulates out produces ta blow down that goes through 7 around the whole ta dial and back up in my recent surveys of the tone arm and its relationship to auditing it became apparent that three types of charge existed in gpm 1 charge as an engram 2 charge as reliable items 3 charge as postulates all three must be removed from gpm any incident wherever it is on the track contains postulates comments considerations directions made by the pc at that time thus in all incidents the pcs postulates must be called for and removed to remove postulate from any incident have the pc repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle of the meter if it comes down to persistent tick get suppress off it and get it repeated again just as in the case of any ri in gpm dont leave postulates charged treat them like gpm items whether in gpm or an engram add to your arc break l lists l3 and l4 have we bypassed any postulates there are implants which tell the pc not to erase his own postulates there is also bear series goal to postulatesometimes the postulate lies ahead of the actual engram in r3r example man decides to get hurt then enters into an engramic situation the engram does not wholly free until the postulate is removed occasional calling for any postulates considerations or comments you had in this incident while running r3r engrams or r3n will keep the incident going well when the pc says one have him or her repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle i bring this up at this time as i have found case that got ta action on engrams or gpms or rrs on ris until the postulates were given special attention at which time ta action of an excellent kind occurred summary stuck ta is always caused by running the pc above the pcs tolerance of charge you can stop any ta by ramming the pc into incident after incident without cleaning them up postulate is only one kind of charge at any position on the time track also look for the pcs postulates early on the time track expect them to occasionally blow the meter apart flatten any postulate found by getting it repeated until the reaction is gone off the needle and all charge of course on anything whether falls or rrs must be removed from engrams or gpms l ron hubbard lrh drbh copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6308c21 shspec297 the itsa line continued things look more complex than they actually are sitting somewhere in back of every thetans bank is tremendous insecurity in which the thetan believes implicitly that the universe is dangerous or that he is in danger or that he cannot live or survive as powerful being the itsa line could look to you like simple communication line on which if you let anyone talk enough he will get better this is not so if you understand the itsa line you will see the pc go through cycle of fishing for an itsa if the auditor tells the pc what is there by putting in the itsa with the meter it leaves the pc in zone or area of insecurity as will any interruption of the pcs itsa the pc has to be responsible for putting in the itsa line if the auditor does it too much eg saying the meter reads that it is before 1850 etc you have created psychiatric potentially hypnotic evaluative setup it is ok to give little help but not to put in the whole itsa line for the pc when you tell person that there is hope for his case you are putting in an itsa line the hope factor but what about the line plot for instance this puts in an itsa line for the pc to some degree the line plot for the gpm is the lesser of two evils it allows the pc to identify it to his own reality and it is less undesirable than letting the pc wrap himself around telephone pole it was an otherdetermined thing in the first place and the most important thing is to get the charge off of it similarly if the pc is trying to date something and bogs utterly you should help him with the meter enough to increase his ability to see what he is after by narrowing his search even if you get down to the hour and minute and the pc never spotted it at least youve got it dated but it is still bit of lose the only time you totally lose is when you have to put the whole itsa line in aberration is means of perverting the itsa line pure evil is denial of the itsa line and aberration of it perversion of the itsa line has to be very direct in order to be very aberrative given the slightest chance the pc will put in his itsa line but the question is will he put it in on anything aberrative he wont unless directed to it psychoanalysis directs the itsa line to something nonaberrative lets him itsa and then evaluates putting the itsa line in totally analyzing it for him putting in hope factor by saying that something can be done to change conditions puts in the itsa line to small degree even start of session puts in an itsa line with the intent of putting the pc in position to itsa the intention makes the difference where one puts in the itsa line for another an evil intention in this respect is one that is devoted to decreasing the persons ability to itsa that is the way to make slaves good intention is an intention to improve someones itsa get the person to identify spot and point out and he will be in better shape than he is this corner of the universe is suffering from surplus of lousy civilization it was recently conquered but it was set up to be conquered by the use of degrading mental technology the civilization in this area implanted their own soldiers to be loyal to be brave etc such civilization has power because for an implant to stick it has to have two items one positive and one negative eg to be loyal soldier and to be disloyal soldier so fifty percent of the implant is in the negative also the fact that the implant was done at all destroys loyalty the galactic confederacy with implanting lasted eighty trillion years the espinol confederacy with implants lasted few hundred thousand years rome died at the hands of her slaves not at those of barbarians being free man didnt pay so who wanted to fight for rome slavery produced civil war the first families of boston made their money from slaves and so we got civil war too it is not just matter of sentiment statistically slavery never pays off it is dangerous russia is having trouble because of the slave economy which is hangover from prerevolutionary russia probably the white russian nobility came back from the betweenlives area as communists slavery always produces backlash because thetan never really gives up he can hold the postulate that he was right all the way down to the bottom of unconsciousness the effort todominate and to deny power of choice to others is the road that this universe walked towards the hell it became fear stands ahead of that the nonsense behind it is that thetan cant do anything but survive so for him to fear nonsurvival is foolish how to kill thetan is the biggest problem in this universe how can being who cannot cease to survive get into state of mind where he is afraid that he wont it takes lot of trickery usually it is on an extension of self into possession like making minion mocking up mockup endowing it with life and protecting it when someone attacks it it can be body state etc the thetan must have confused himself with it to the point where he thinks his survival can be affected that is the first step into aberration the next step is elementary one is worried about survival so one solves the problem of survival by domination this solution is not successful in the long run that which is not admired tends to persist that is one reason why domination stays around domination is not admired thetan to protect something dominates thetan b in so doing he sets himself up to be dominated in turn having set up causeeffect line the line can reverse it is comm line with duplication which makes it easy to reverse any custom on this planet has this reverse duplication element you can count on its having been the reverse at some time the duplication factor easily makes cause look like effect on this comm line and it leads to the overtmotivator sequence one commits overts then one day one slips into effect and gets what one caused running ow frees up vicious comm line and cures some identifications thus undoing aberration for instance waiters wear black tuxedos any custom was reverse custom at an earlier date if communication is so dangerous why does thetan communicate at all it is because he wants to be oriented once oriented thetan uses his best tool communication to dominate to do people in and to mess up things that he tries to identify with he misuses his comm line it is there because he is lost and feels the need of orientation hence his desire for communication there is insecurity behind this desire the reason for which we dont know yet in using the itsa line were using the obsession to identify which lies back of the communication line we are using principle higher than communication coupled with communication in order to orient and rehabilitate the thetan all we are missing is what lies behind the insecurity that caused him to start the whole cycle originally the thetan was not insecure was not reaching not protecting anything and he was not communicating how and why did anyone get to him originally to the point where he felt that he needed to be oriented to be comfortable it is hard to figure this out because there was communication at the time but you show the problem and very shortly later ill show you the answer just as it took only one step to start down that road so it takes only step at the other end to go back up the pc gradiently comes up to ot then breaks through with shock that may scare him processing is the cure for having to be familiarized with things to itsa we are undoing the tendency to itsa by using it once thetan is free of those things he will snap back to his original lost power at least until he rights some wrongs and slips briefly selfdeterminism pandeterminism and personal power is restored to the individual along the line of minimal help and maximal recovery of selfdeterminism of selfability to itsa on the part of the pc as the case goes along its progress is measured directly by the degree to which selfdeterminism is returned into the pcs hands thus you could get fantastic number of engrams and gpms run and have foggy pc by dating everything in the bank for him or by invalidating some datum of the pcs matter how slightly an auditor has the same problem mother has to give enough help but not too much the amount of help required is not constant from one pc to the next because pcs are at such different levels of independence and aberration both could be high the problem is to determine how much help the pc needs in order to know what you want to do is to takewhatever ability you find and reduce any dependency you find give the pc all the help he needs to get along and then reduce it added into all this is your flubs you will never reduce them to zero so dont try you will get caught in crosscurrents of communication and purposes since the pcs comm line is so often fogged up in session the auditors ability to handle it perfectly is nil so the auditor shouldnt be afraid of mishandling the pc because an occasional mishandling is inevitable so when this happens you have to get slippy and handle the intention line if possible dont put the pcs attention on the auditor this can happen by mistake but watch out eg dont say do you want to tell about it this inadvertently diverts attention to the auditor the pcs itsa line will get better to the degree that it is permitted to exist dont just let the pc talk but direct his attention to things in the bank that he can identify dont tell him what he is looking at if you can avoid it but if you do have to tell him let him itsa it if you dont his ability to identify will deteriorate and his ability to know whether he is right will decrease that is the effect of confirming his itsa line with the meter if you look on what you are doing as improving the pcs ability to know that he is right to be positive you will make minimal mistakes that is the chief ability that is there to be improved on case if you look on case as something from which significances have to be removed regardless of the pcs ability to be certain the pc will still make it but it will take much longer the pcs case improves by removal of charge but is impeded by the auditor cutting back his ability to itsa an arc breaky pc is probably one with high degree of independence perhaps swamped by charge you can create dependency by telling him everything there is also the point to be considered that if you dont tell the pc when an item is finally discharged early in running gpms the pc will leave items charged and the mechanism of the bank will cause him to bounce and arc break so you put in the itsa line itsa discharged sooner or later the pc will start to tell you that it is at that point stop telling him that it is clean dont stop if he still cant tell to do so would leave him with live ris and postulates wean him off from the meter slowly validating his knowingness as it develops give the pc all the help he needs if pc cant tell what is in his bank he cant live with it there is certain minimal help that pc needs to get started he cant do it all on his own on the other hand you could get pc who hasnt been here long who cognites on the axioms knocks out the bank does change of space processing between the auditing room and the next building see the creation of human ability pp 3739 171173 this is the grand tour process the object of which is to get all areas into present time by directing the pc to be in variety of places and says goodby and thank you fine you audited him arc breaky pcs sometimes get into the situation of having their concept of their own independence cut up by people putting in itsa lines for them they dramatize pc who is routinely arc breaky undoubtedly has something wrong with the itsa line and not from auditing he could benefit from an 18button prepcheck on the itsa line those eighteen buttons are the most powerful itsas there are or ever have been in the universe another approach would be to handle the fact that the pc is using the arc break to solve problem but the prepcheck normally gets it cleaned up cut itsa line is the most colossal ptp there is persons itsa line to the rest of the universe is cut just by the fact of his being on earth if he tries to leave earth he goes to the between lives area the only missing piece is why does thetan have compulsion to itsa6308c22 shspec298 project 80 80 is mathematical trick to say oo and 0 it embraces all project 80 has to do with organizational targets dissemination and technical planning 1964 will be the year of scientology for everyone organizations suffer from loss of personnel one would be rich if one just lived and persisted long enough if you are persistent you yourself become sort of institution to solve problem is mest universe way of looking at things the right way is to find out how did it become problem lrh operates on the basis that if he conceives of problem he is about fortyeight hours away from seeing what made it problem an organizations problem of losing all its people is one that we have licked with all the shifts and changes we the people are the stability in the development of the tech we have the material for scientology 4 research towards ot see above making ots wrapped up as far as research is concerned in view is wrapping up of the betweenlives area so as to strip out the reportback mechanism it is bit tougher than lrh thought it would be there are in addition to gpms screentype incidents and postulationtype incidents the gpms are all negative on the beginning end of the screen and positive on the leaving end so the dichotomy makes them tend to collapse some rules for cleaning up charge faster have developed but it is all just auditing keeping the pcs attention directed to those areas of the track where he gets ta action that is the highest level of professional skill drills for thetan exterior is all wrapped up not everyone will reach the technical level of those who are at st hill who have been through all the developments and changes that is too much to expect auditors elsewhere are operating at different levels of reality which establish different levels of arc for them the gap between our r and theirs has been getting wider and wider so we are in an informed ivory tower with bridge behind us that is rather important this planet is in slightly different circumstances then others it has chance not to get tilted things put here tend to stay other nearby planets are more tightly governed and are harder to enter to salvage them they are invasionary planets this area used to be controlled by the espinol confederacy but their return platforms are closed off that spells defeat for them is there some other implantive system that is deeper into the heart of this galaxy system that is going to backfire against this one probably so it is probably coming up soon but conquerers almost always spare the jails we cant bet on the preservation of earth but we can bet on this planet having better chance of becoming rehabilitation center than other planets but what if we have left bridge in the rehabilitation center so that everybody flounders around with way to improve if you dont leave bridge you will wind up with group of people who are very angry at those who might assist them that would be very undesirable weve got to leave bridge however at present our feeder lines into the public are weak not organizationally but technically project 80 is the bridge it requires that we find what the public agrees with and use that to improve their arc up to another level and that we keep doing that in order to bring them up gradiently we are not necessarily improving their arc with us we are just improving their arc to point where we can hit another level of agreement the dynamics various scales the arc triangle and the dynamic principle of existence all of these are too hightoned for scientology 1 so they comprise scientology 2 see above for description of the scientology levels so we are back to 3060 day hcahpa training this is only possible because of the discovery of the itsa line some of you as auditors overlook what is win for pc knowing that your goal is to run out gpms etc you miss the fact that the pc has had win in being able to talk to an auditor when he couldnt talk to anyone before the feeling that one is getting case advance and real case advance lies in the fact that the itsa line is in and the ta is moving get the itsa line in and the ta moving and you will get level of improvement and result never before achieved this has nothing to do with significances if you get somebody talking about his health or his lumbosis you find out that the cures solutions decisions discoveries cognitions comments reiterations and hopes about that lumbosis in their aggregate caused the individual to havelumbosis if you get them off with ta action you get recovered lumbosis the condition could well vanish just from getting the pc to itsa about these cures etc this does not apply to broken legs yet someone who has been trained in getting an itsa line in and not cutting it given also some basic training in the auditors code the axioms the arc triangle the cdei scale etc would have good results and wins scientology 1 operates at the level of it is possible to have happy marriage or if you want to get along with children better listen to what they say and let them know you heard it dont just ignore them or employeeboss relations are mainly problems of communication in fact you should make communication the stable datum how you design this line is all regulated by what people can go into arc with you have to talk to people at level where they can have arc r1c is list of questions that you can use to get in an itsa line specific questions from this list could be used by book auditor to run on someones lumbosis this could be done on coaudit basis and would get fine results that is the auditing level of scientology 1 lower grade scientology 2 hpahca can get fabulous results with r2c r2c is r1c preceded by an assessment on the expanded cdei scale plus the eight dynamics see hcotf 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics as well as hcob 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics directions for use of hco technical form 17oct63 and hcob 31oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics continued the tone arm is used the pc first looks over the cdei scale to see which level best characterizes his life it might take ten minutes and it might take fifty hours the pc has to see which levels applied at which times in his life and where and how and which they are and how they relate etc you can get lot of ta on examining the scale eventually the pc comes out with level x now give him the eight dynamics expanded ie broken down into subparts he has to find out which ones he has been most concerned about this lifetime this could also take ten minutes or fifty hours eventually the pc comes out with dynamic therefore the question becomes x the pc gets asked about the combined assessments eg curious about children the question could have third component considerations solutions decisions about concern for so you have matched up the arc triangle with mest form and location the pc will start off with arc vs arc then when he can confront mest he will get into the sixth and seventh dynamics so as you repeat this operation the pc will go up the dynamics to the sixth and seventh this would be way of clearing this lifetime uppergrade scientology 2 would use r2h arc break dating and any other process like prepchecking that uses needle action as well as ta it is retread level for hpahcas so the lineup for scientology 1 and 2 is scn 1 nonauditing pelevel scientology b auditing book auditing on coaudit basis scn 2 lower level hpahca level uses r2c tone arm used only not needle actionb upper level hpahca retread level processes using needle action and ta another element enters the scene the arc break assessment this would be specialized activity it can be done by central orgs or auditors in private practice to patch up field auditors pcs and at the same time the field auditor whose pc needs this action can be nudged about following the auditors code eg about keeping his mouth shut try to bring it home that arc break assessments need to be done we can use them both on pcs and on auditors you can keep lot of coauditors straightened out by having someone around to do arc break assessments you could have course in which you can give classification of hba hubbard book auditor the student gets gen on 1 the itsa line 2 the auditors code this course would also include testing and coaudits the whole secret of our communication is that it is up to us to establish the level of the communication that we engage in we have considered it somewhat dishonest to put our communication at level of anything less than everything we know but it isnt really dishonest to say less then we know there is reason to overwhelm people with all the data it would just be outreality there will be snags in the program there will always be people who are uncomfortable with motion and change these people will try overtly or covertly to stop it all they will be the people who despair of getting result by doing the usual because they wont do it they will be the ones who keep applying unusual solutions dont get your attention pinned on one bad apple and forget that everywhere else it is going fine to do this would be to embark on crusade in an illadvised direction probably all evil generates from too great concentration on evil if you concentrate on how the show isnt getting on the road when it is in fact on the road you will contribute to keeping it from being on the road you should take care of such matters on routine rather than an emergency basis when we have auditing at lower levels totally shaped around the definition of an auditor as listener we will have trouble getting the whole project well done6308c27 shspec299 rightness and wrongness people use mental technology the way they do in this universe because they dont know what they are doing the purpose of mental technology must be one of survival with consequent necessity to dominate so it must consist of being right and making others wrong survival rightness and wrongness and domination fit together apparent contrasurvival actions are the thetans effort to be right this is the lowest ebb of aberration because the thetan cant do anything else but survive in order to survive you have to be more right than wrong so you get obsessed with being right the beginning of succumb is the recognition that you are wrong this is not sensible but it is the way thetan behaves therefore if an individual is surviving at all he must be right even if it is only an insistence on being right if an individual is undertaking an action and is surviving then it must be right action thetan has to enter basic lie on the scene to worry about his survival this is idiocy because there is reason for thetan to worry about survival thetan first worries about the survival of something else something that can be threatened with nonsurvival then the thetan identifies himself with that thing this is the first lie when he starts worrying about his own survival because he has taken the idiotic step of identifying himself with his creations he enters into the necessity to dominate to ensure his own survival there is reason why if you are protecting sand castles you have to take the idiot step of becoming sand castle and you can go on protecting them indefinitely without doing this but once you have identified yourself with sandcastle and are worried about your own survival you enter into the necessity to dominate to continue your own survival to be tougher than the other tough boys on the beach you dont even have to become sandcastle to start the game of domination if that is what you want to do the game of domination consists of being right and making the other fellow wrong that is all there is to it its silly game really for instance russia and the us are each devoting so much of their production capacity to defend themselves from each other that they are failing economically people justify all sorts of insanity on the basis of rightness and wrongness even skidrow bum is being bum in order to be right everyone has tried to make him wrong for what he does so he has to continue to be right if he admits he is wrong he feels he will die you may be confused just watching what is being done because some of it could have good results but the basis can still be nutty rightness people assert nutty rightness because everyone is always making then wrong for the nuttiness if someone agrees that he has been doing something wrong he is liable to collapse since he has identified wrongness with succumbing behavior doesnt necessarily have everything to do with the whole track behavior is behavior people have tried to aberrate it one way or another they have tried to make people behave some other way but the science of life still remains the science of life the factors of life still remain the factors of life and if you were to delete all the gpms and incidents and everything else you would not have removed the basic laws on which scientology is built gpms etc merely use the existing laws of life to enslave people they simply enforce exaggerate and destroy freedom of choice over the exercise of the ability to be happy powerful etc they destroy the ability to be self or pandetermined they make people onesided about everything they use basic laws unwittingly to exaggerate certain things which then lead person to enslave himself the basic mechanism of enslavement is 1 insistence upon surviving followed by 2 the necessity to dominate followed by 3 the necessity to be right or wrong 4 which then becomes as irrational as the original postulate to survive and then5 the person becomes more and more degraded the postulates made by the individual go downhill to the point where you would be amazed at what the individual is doing to be right when you get down to very aberrated rightness you are dealing with death because at that level cessation of survival is so imminent that it gets dramatized before it happens in that way the individual is still right by succumbing currently there are three organizations under attack 1 scientology 2 buddhism 3 theosophy the us government is supporting the vietnamese government in its attacks on buddhists it has attacked the theosophists recently and it launched raid via the fda on the fcdc in washington but these are the only three groups that believe in reincarnation ie they are the only groups that dont believe in death forever in attacking them the us government is asserting rightness about death to get some sort of aberrated behavior of this kind straightened out with someone you would have to get him to tell you how the behavior makes him right you would get an automaticity for starters which would finally run out then you could see how it makes someone else wrong when that is all run out the individual will have far less inclination to do the behavior that he previously had to do to be right the strongest intention in the universe is the intention to be right the diagnosis of how you could make person wrong depends on what that person most insists upon that is what you can make him wrong on this would be getting persons goat behavior doesnt consist of an aberration that someone is dramatizing it consists of an aberration that person dredges up in order to make someone else wrong thats behavior it works too making someone wrong all the time does worry him furthermore one can be made wrong to the point where one inverts goes into agreement with what is being said by the person who is making him wrong and now makes the former wrongness an obsessive rightness the right label gets identified with the wrong action government may be made wrong about bringing in law and order to the point where it now exercises criminality using the label of law and order the issue of rightness and wrongness has been further boobytrapped by guys on the whole track who implanted people with gpms that contain the words right and wrong however when making himself right and others wrong an individual is not acting because of the gpm that just intensifies the action if you try just simply to run someone on right and wrong for very long you run into the gpm and cant keep on in that line ordinarily getting in an itsa line on the aberration will deintensify its power however if guy has accidents frequently 1 find out what he is having wrecks accidents injuries etc this doesnt take very long you have to isolate what it is that the guy is doing the obvious action may not be his intention maybe it is not his automobile accidents that are making him right maybe it is getting injured when you have the right thing he will run easily 2 ask the pc how an auto accident makes him right you will get an easy itsa line 3 ask him how an auto accident would make them or another wrong you will get another avalanche 4 ask 2 again then 3 etc keep it balanced and you will avoid bumping the gpm as hardthis process is below the level of recognition or cognition it undermines neurosis neurosis is defined as an antisurvival action that is compulsively undertaken by the individual the only qualification to this process is that we have to be capable of communicating with the person and listening to him and we have to get our hands on him first but on cold bloodedly practical basis service fac processes are more practical mental technology than the alternatives implants drugs electric shock treatments etc just because of the backlash from angry thetans who want revenge on implanters the hole in implanter tech is that the survival of the implanter can in the future be threatened implants can be undone many implant set ups have been destroyed implanters do implanting because they are trying to be right and to make others wrong thats all it is mere dramatization when you see someone acting simply to be right and to make others wrong you will see worsening condition you are looking at the last dregs of domination the person who is being right is in fact getting worse as are the people in his vicinity implanting works only over shortterm period eg 100000 years which is shortterm on galactic scale implanting worsens not only the people implanted but also the implanter and everyone in the vicinity of these people what is true of neurosis is also true of psychosis psychosis has the same mechanism at lower level and it gets treatment from psychiatrists at the same low level of makewrong and q and the overtmotivator sequence also fits into this effort to dominate and be right when you get two people each insisting on his own rightness their ideas eventually commingle and they cant tell who is doing what this is because both are saying im right and youre wrong if science is dramatizing an unknown one of its parts it is not complete technology it is impossible to have science of life under these circumstances because you cant fully understand something that you are dramatizing part of science of life should be complete understanding and since one is dramatizing at least part of living one cant have total understanding of it in other words being right should be one of the parts of mental technology however if being right is being dramatized by the practitioners of mental technology then clearly they dont have full understanding of the mind this is particular problem with the science of life hence there is tendency to withdraw from life total cessation of the dramatization of the game called life would put one in confused state of thinking that the way to do it is to separate oneself from life by going off to cave and meditating but person that cant experience easily has to experience compulsively the final challenge of science of life is does it produce life not does it produce death if you know all the answers you can live it is remarkable to be in situation where this can be sorted out as one goes along getting more understanding one doesnt have to work so hard to experience existence one doesnt have to be convinced that one is surviving being right dominating etc when person is longer able to select his own behavior he must obsessively be right by doing something wrong it is ok to be right if you are being analytical however there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical and become obsessive it is below that level that we speak of aberration you can find what the person is doing that he doesnt like to do then ask the person how that makes him right everyone has few of these actions they generally arise from some overwhelm of the persons self determinism where he has accepted anothers rightness the person is out of valence and dramatizing someone elses aberrations you could perhaps pick this up on flow one of level 4 triples but we arent interested in other peoples aberrations the dwindling spiral is really entered where the person accepts inability weakness stupidity etc as way to be right any dramatization of mental science that brings about further disability is wrong for the civilization that uses it anything that brings about more life livingness and beingness is right for that person or societyanything that is crazy in person was ok at some higher level all madness is an exaggeration of some ability or capability for instance sexual misbehavior is lowerscale dramatization of the ability to create it becomes aberrated in the following way 1 it was really right 2 it was method of survival 3 it was method of domination 4 it was method of being right in order to make others wrong 5 then one got enough overts such that the communication line switched around what was right about it is now wrong about it and vice versa the sexual misbehavior or other aberrated behavior is practically unrecognizable from its original state as far as the persons behavior is concerned when you understand this you understand much of the nonsense that you previously only protested against the explanation for the behavior that is offered by the individual so obscures what he is really doing that it gets confusing the main line of human behavior is along the lines of 1 survival 2 domination 3 rightness and wrongness however when an auditor invalidates anothers assertion of rightness it only drives the pc downscale and cuts the only communication line that can help the pc dramatization of rightness and wrongness is not the answer to dramatization of rightness and wrongness6308c29 shspec300 the ta and the service facsimile if you cannot make keyedout clear with prepcheck in 25 hours or less the pc is operating on service facsimile this is startling but elementary prepcheck fits in with the itsa line very closely the 18 buttons are hot they give the key itsas of the case if they are not working you have service facsimile on your hands in doing prepcheck it is assumed that you are using timelimiter in order to keep the amount of restimulation under control if you dont control the itsa line the pc will restimulate more charge than you can get asised the time limiter you use can be by subject or location as well as by date pc answering prepcheck questions is giving you key itsas if prepcheck is done for this lifetime you should get keyedout clear per the book 1 definition of clear see dmsmh pp 817 77017 clearing in this way is destimulation by knocking out the points where restimulation took place making incidents inert an inert incident can be restimulated however degree of restimulation is not important to state of case neither is the condition of being restimulated but there is state of case with respect to restimulation all cases are restimulated to some degree but some are overrestimulated case that is overrestimulated will not discharge the restimulation by ordinary means because discharge has somehow been prevented this condition is important it is getting ahold of too much and not discharging it uncontrolled itsa line can cause overrestimulation an incident that is discharged has been relieved of charge so that it can longer be restimulated restimulation can be let off without the incident that was restimulated being discharged it can simply be destimulated so with bank you can either destimulate it by knocking out the keyins of the original charge or you can discharge it by running it discharge is flowing off of charge when an incident is discharged it is gone and it is longer capable of being restimulated let us assume that the reactive mind consists mainly of inert incidents if they would just stay quiet you would never have to clear anybody however the pcs attention can be directed at the incident by life auditing or the pc himself at which point the incident converts the pcs attention to restimulation over which he has control if the pcs attention goes to the incident so as to have understanding and confront you will see ta motion and the incident can be discharged or erased on the other hand if the pcs attention flicks over the incident giving keyin you can knock out the moment of keyin by having him look at it and it will destimulate again ie it will key out bank is inert until life or auditing causes the pcs attention to go onto portion of it the pcs attention is the actual source of charge an 18button prepcheck should key out anything that keyed in it can destimulate somebody to the state of clear so you dont have to make clear to make an ot you only have to make keyout clear the state of case of the pc is directly represented and analyzed by the tone arm and the free needle the eight levels of case compare with eight states of the tone arm and needle see above for description of the eight levels of case case level 8 stage 4 needle 7 continuous rock slam 6 stuck needle at clear read dead thetan 5 low ta 4 high ta 3 ta moving in the high range2 good ta through and past clear read 1 fn at clear read when lrh tried to go from destimulated clear to discharged clear he found that there was waystop short of ot the condition youve got to have to take anyone to ot is ta moving through clear read with good ta without that there is too much restimulation present for you to get the pc to discharge material from the backtrack or to get into gpms if you tried to do this anyway the pcs ta would tend to stick then to go high then to go low then eventually to stick at clear read if you then did prepcheck which would now be harder you could send him back to all those states of ta as you destimulated the case you wouldnt have to go all the way to fn to go to the backtrack now the subject isnt how you discharge the incident it is when the ta should be moving around preferably through 30 before you try to go backtrack so you can make clear by prepchecking few prepared subjects the case will feel wonderful sometimes for years until he starts wondering whether he still has any worries about what used to bother him then he starts restimulating himself and gets keyed in mere keyout clear cant be ot because when he tries to turn on the power it kicks in the inert incidents the only way to make clear completely stable would be to discharge everything in the bank from fning the meter goes blank because youve got nothing to measure thats ot overrestimulation is the cause of amnesia edgy and bad body feelings etc if you gave the pc three sessions in row without getting any ta he would feel rather bad because just the auditing would have restimulated charge and you would have an overrestimulated case when this happens memory gets bad facsimiles get harder to see incidents get jammed together the bank gets to be mess all this is due to overrestimulation if the pc now gets prepchecked and destimulated he can approach the track but this can be done with good ta only if the auditing is done gradiently with good cleanup of everything contacted discharging it as you go dont fail to pay attention to the ta and go backtrack hoping to get the incident responsible for the restimulation you will restimulate more than you discharge in the process of looking for the incident cheerful pc equals the itsa line in and the ta moving it almost doesnt matter what the ta is moving on case level relates to overrestimulation not to the amount of bank the pc has the auditing target is always the restimulated charge not the inert material in the bank the pc can always restimulate more once he has discharged what was available clear means nothing in the restimulation chamber if too much gets restimulated by life auditing or the pc the auditor can destimulate it with prepchecks and arc break assessments see above it is not possible to audit someone without doing one of three things 1 restimulating 2 destimulating this is the same as keying something out or 3 discharging this is the same as erasing auditing is always doing at least one of these three things when case is already confused and is not confronting well naturally the amount of destimulation and discharge are minimal so restimulation takes over you will get ta motion when you dont destimulate or discharge anything you will restimulate more and you will get ta lack of ta is danger signal the auditor should find out why there are two possible actions1 the auditor may do something that can discharge or destimulate the restimulated charge eg prepchecking or flattening what has been left unflat prepchecking or r2h would be safest 2 he can look for something that is preventing discharge eg by doing an arc break assessment to find the correct bpc if the ta is not restored immediately only one thing is wrong the case is sitting in service facsimile and will only worsen until the service facsimile is cleared if small amount of auditing doesnt restore the case to clear state the pc has service facsimile if he is sitting in one it must be run or he will not improve prepchecks turn on mass in the presence of service facsimile because the pc has intention of getting rid of it the pc wont let go of the service fac and the service fac wont surrender to the prepcheck this also includes hidden standards now that we know that the anatomy of service fac is rightnesswrongness computation we can do something about it we knew of their existence before as can be seen in advanced procedures and axioms pp 711 the 18button prepcheck should key out the pc if it doesnt the pc has service fac prepcheck is just series of types of decisions that thetan makes about things if it turns on mass it must be in conflict with rightness and wrongness so in the pcs eyes the auditor is trying to make the pc wrong with the prepcheck and the pc moves the facsimile forward as defense increasing mass the only reason for high ta is overrestimulation the two things that prevent its cure are 1 the cases overrestimulated condition 2 service facsimile that the case isnt about to give up to some degree most cases fall into the service fac category but most dont have the service fac directly in the road of auditing only service facs that lie across the road of auditing interfere with clearing if the service fac has to do with the pcs spiritual condition with his case itself then you have to handle it so that he can get case gain the more pc is trying to be right by having wrong case the less progress the auditor will make with this case pc says if i didnt have bank theyd give one so having bank is right dont let the pc itsa beyond the answer to the auditing question it is far better for the pc to feel that his comm has been cut than for him to pull in restimulation by being permitted to overrun an answer an 18button prepcheck on an assessed this lifetime subject or subjects should give you key out clear but service fac wont surrender to prepcheck6308c29 shspec301 the service facsimile although we call it service facsimile there is more to be known about it than was in earlier definitions in the past it has been said that service facsimile is what person uses to explain his condition or get his way in the world it is called service facsimile because it was of service to the pc the service fac manifestation is blood brother to the ow mechanism it is how you make people guilty the current definition of service fac is that it is that condition which the individual uses to make himself right and others wrong using this definition we can crack cases the only hazard is the use of rightwrong in gpms but the use of time limitation to in this lifetime obviates any danger of restimulating the gpm the gpm is not the reason for the service fac there is an upperscale rationale survival for instance the darwinian implant see above has to persist at the beginning of it all by itself but this is rare however when the goal to survive occurs it is couched in the word persist there is gpm known to date that contains the word survive this concept is therefore not motivated by bank therefore you can use survive in processing pretty easily implanters used the words live and alive lot but survive is the top scale of all this it is ok for us to go back to healing now since doctors the ama havent appreciated the fact that we ever stopped healing people b they will be socialized in five years anyway they are convinced that curing is impossible however 22 12 of people eg patients pcs or whatever get well with any or or fraudulent treatment they are apparently in an hypnotic state and respond to suggestion so any healing profession should get at least 22 12 cure rate unless it is doing something to depress the patient and to prevent healing from occurring if you get less than 22 12 you are actually impeding the cure only two things prevent the scientologist from healing pcs 1 inability to get in communication with the pc eg because he is dead 2 the service facsimile if we allow for the fact that it takes relatively short time to train an auditor into using this lifetime techniques if you take such an auditor and dont worry about making him into an auditor who can make an ot if you turn him loose with only an understanding of the service facsimile the itsa line and repetitive prepchecking limited to this lifetime if you let him rely on the tone arm there he would be practically sweeping the boards as far as illness is concerned for person to have bad back he must have more than facsimile of an experience involving bad back causing it he must have had it restimulated by something and to have real bad back something must be keeping it in restimulation something has to kick the facsimile in and hold it in you must add to the restimulation factor mental aberration factor it is not just what is restimulated it is what the pc feels might become restimulated what he himself opposes what he becomes afraid of when he is restimulated so the individual is added to the equation the experiential pattern of an individual regardless of incidents containing pain etc might be aberrative for instance say person has lived all his life in very cold environment he gets knowingness in the process if you throw him out in the 40below cold either he has confidence that he can withstand the cold or he doesnt accordingly he either freezes to death or lives respectively this is true even though person is conditioned and trained to handle the cold people may react differently to the same engram there is guarantee that someone will respond one way or the other to their stimulusresponse conditioning one person will be terrified by some danger another person will ignore it another will look andsay oh what makes the difference we come back to the service fac for the answer how could you use facsimile to make people wrong so there are three reactions to an engram 1 the guy who is terrified of the facsimile has in back of this lots of ways to be right and to make others wrong by having this facsimile 2 the guy who ignores it has use for it at all one way or the other 3 the guy who confronts it has another method of making others wrong being competent with regard to this type of facsimile the rightnesswrongness possibility is present to some degree in everyone and in every bank to the healer this represents barrier because someone who is using an illness or disability to make someone else wrong wont respond to treatment or if you cure one thing he will pick up something else to do the job of making himself right and others wrong symptom substitution see also haley on oneupsmanship games aberrated behavior is service facsimile in at least goodly percentage of cases when you do mimicry processing and the pc persists in crazy behavior he has vested interest in acting crazy this makes it hard to tell how good deaberrative technique is however if it works on lot more than 22 12 of cases it is probably good technique that is rendered ineffective in some cases by service fac the tone arm turned out to be reliable measure of case progress if you dont get destimulation or discharge you will get restimulation because something is happening if you dont get any ta action you know that you are not getting any destimulation or discharge and that therefore restimulation is all that is occurring therefore dont audit without ta action the margin of time during which you can audit pc without ta action before he starts feeling horrible is only about three sessions if pc is upset about auditing is having trouble handling life etc it is only because of overrestimulation from whatever source gpms arc breaks or whatever what about medium or acceptable amount of ta action fifteen to twenty downward divisions per 2 12 hour session excellent ta would be about thirty divisions per session acceptable is 1520 below that level more restimulation than discharge is occurring these are just approximate figures great deal of addingup has not yet been done to tabulate the figures exactly so there is point where there is an apparency of ta motion yet the pc is not getting better and only restimulation is occurring auditing pc on and on with ta will overrestimulate him all the way up the ta dial backwards through 7 all the way to dead thetan lrh introduces here the idea of ta counter why does ta go up and stick only because of the pressure of overrestimulation if you have ta action or if you are getting rising ta without discharge you get over restimulation because you are overwhelming the pcs power of choice you are trying to get discharge and the pc wont let go of it and he becomes more and more arc breaky if the ta is going up even when you are not auditing backtrack you must still be overwhelming the pcs power of choice between not getting ta and getting high ta we move into service facs when you are doing prepcheck and it turns on mass you have bumped into something that shouldnt be there service facsimile has moved in to assert whatever you are prepchecking and trying to get rid of any mass for thetan is an assertion that something is wrong and there is something weird about it the mass comes from the complete disagreement that you and the pc have concerning whatever it is that turned mass on you want to get rid of it but the pc does not intend to get better because he has to hang onto bank to make someone wrong with itit stands to reason that any thetan that has been hit hard and continuously that has had continued loses and that is trying to get back at and attack some area will be unable to put the itsa line in on that area he cant say if the area is bad or good he cant say what it is he doesnt feel that he can be at cause over that comm line so his final method of staying at cause is to be right and for the other person to be wrong this goes down to the point where he merely has to hold the concept of being right and the other person being wrong this way in sense he is still being cause this mechanism persists therefore because the pc cant asis it because he cant observe it anymore one can be haunted by nonexistent thing if one doesnt have the comm lines to observe it the pc never knows when it goes away if you cant inspect something you cant inspect its cessation therefore for survival the best thing to do is to assume that the thing is still there that is the safest course life teaches you that it is dangerous to go look and see you operate on the principle that if you cant ascertain that something has ended you had better assume that it is continuing something that the pc cant cure with processing must be service fac you can ask the pc how he is making others wrong then when you get it you can ask him how he is being right with it aberrated survival mechanisms all sit around on buttons of rightnesswrongness survival and domination the ow system is connected with this through the makeguilty mechanism these are survival mechanisms buy they are not sensible unfortunately the words rightness wrongness survive and dominate are also in the bank so you have to indulge in some brokenfield running to handle these buttons the more force there is and the less one can stand it and be cause over the user of the force the more one goes into forms of aberrated rightness and wrongness against the holder of force hence people break minor laws to be right about the government since it is so overwhelming this is quite irrational to find service fac you could use the original listing steps of r2 or the preliminary assessment of r3r or you could ask the pc what have you been trying to resolve about your case in processing taking anything that didnt resolve with processing as service facsimile what would be method of making others wrong could also get it be prepared for the service fac not to be very sensible but dont reject it even if it does seem reasonable as long as it is something that hasnt yielded to auditinghubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 september 1963 central orgs franchise scientology three clearingclearingclearing routine three sc there has been such rush on in technical that it may have looked to you that we were in state of rapid change this was occasioned by speedup caused by various events you are getting about century of research or more in very few months so bear with the end is not only in sight its here my job is mainly now to refine and get the data to you the order brought into our work by making five levels of scientology is paying off rapidly level one is in development level two is well away level four is complete and suddenly level three leaped to final phase we can clear clear clear this has been stepchild for months even years now it has been mauled messed up invalidated and rehabilitated and knocked around but book one clear was what most people came into scientology to obtain and now ive done it ive found out why not and how and this hco bulletin is hurryskurry outline of the steps so you can do it there will be lots of hco bulletins on this the tapes of august 27 28 and 29 ad13 give most of its theory clear definedbook one definition holds exactly true clear is somebody with held down fives in this lifetime see evolution of science clear testclear sits at clear read on the ta with free needle natter upsets whole track keyed in service facsimile clear stabilitywe are not concerned with stability but we can now key out so thoroughly that we need not stress keyed out clear i have found the means i am sure to make this state far more stable and recreate it easily if it slips so forgive for being indecisive about clear states for these past many months the breakthrough is stated as follows if you cannot make clear in 25 hour prepcheck the pc has one or more service facsimiles the barrier to clearing and the reason for fast relapse when clear was attained has been the service facsimile service facsimile defined advanced procedure and axioms definition accurate added to this is the service facsimile is that computation generated by the preclear not the bank to make self right and others wrong to dominate or escape domination and enhance own survival and injure that of othersnote that it is generated by the pc not the bank thus the pc restimulates the bank with the computation the bank unlike going to ot does not retard the pc in this instance the service facsimile is usually this lifetime effort only it might better be called service computation but well hold to our old terms the pc is doing it in usual aberration the bank is doing it the pcs engrams etc where you cant clear the pc by auditing just bank you have to get out of the road what the pc is doing to stay aberrated if you clear only what the bank is doing the clear state rapidly relapses if you clear what the pc is doing the bank tends to stay more quiet and unrestimulated it is the pc who mostly keys his bank back in therefore the pc who wont go free needle clear is himself unconsciously preventing it and by knocking out this effort we can then key out the bank and we have fast clear who pretty well stays clear until sent on to ot the state is desirable to attain as it speeds going to ot all this came from studies ive been doing of the tone arm the tone arm must move during auditing or the pc gets worse all those pcs whose tone arms dont easily get into action and hang up are service facsimile pcs note that the service facsimile is used to first make self right make others wrong second to avoid domination to dominate others third to increase own survival to hinder the survival of others the service facsimile is all of it logical gobbledegook it doesnt make good sense thats because the pc adopted it where in extreme cases he or she felt endangered by something but could not itsa it hence its illogical because it is senseless really the computation escapes casual inspection and makes for aberrated behaviour to make clear the steps in brief are 1 establish service fac this is done by assessment of scientology list one of 212 and using that for starter and then using the preliminary step of r3r as published hco bulletin of july i ad 1 3 one uses only things found by assessment never by wild guesses or pcs obvious disabilities these assessments already exist on many cases and should be used as earlier found 2 audit with rightwrong ask pc with itsa line carefully in first question in this lifetime how would whatever was found make you right adjust question until pc can answer it if pc cant dont force it off on pc if its correct it will run well dont keep repeating the question unless pc needs it just let pc answer and answer and answer let pc come to cognition or run out of answers or try to answer the next question prematurely and switch questions to second question in this lifetime how would whatever was found make others wrong treat this the same way let the pc come to cog or run out of answers or accidentally start to answer the first question go back to first question do the same with it then to second question then to first question again then to secondif your assessment was right pc will be getting better and better ta action but the ta action will eventually lessen on any big cognition end the process this may all take from 2 hours to 5 i dont think more the idea is not to beat the process to death or sink pc into bank gpms the pc will have automaticities answers coming too fast to be said easily early in the run these must be gone and pc bright when you end you are only trying to end the compulsive character of the service facsimile so found and get it off automatic and get pc to see it better not to remove all ta action from the process 3 audit second process using the same method of auditing as in 2 above use the third question in this lifetime how would same one used in step 2 help you escape domination when this seems cooled off use fourth question in this lifetime how would same one help you dominate others use third question and fourth question again and until pc has it all cooled off or big cognition 4 audit third process using the same method as in 2 above use the fifth question in this lifetime how would same one aid your survival and then sixth question in this lifetime how would same one hinder the survival of others use five and six as long as is necessary to cool it all off or to produce big cognition 5 prepcheck with big mid ruds using the question in this lifetime on same one has anything been and get in suppress careful of failed to reveal invalidate suggest mistake been made protest anxious about decided if the pc has really shattering cognition just halt prepcheck and end it off this prepcheck is done of course off the meter until the pc says then checking it on the meter and cleaning it off once youve gone to meter on button stay with meter for further queries but dont clean cleans and dont leave slows or speeded rises either and dont cut pcs itsa line that should be the end of service facsimile but pc may have several so do it all again through all steps as often as is needed pcs who have had scientology list one of r2 12 should be given these as the first things used pcs who have had assessments done for r3r chains should have these assessment results used or as much of them as apply for the next runs even if the chain assessment has been run on r3r still use it for r3sc completing clearing to complete clearing then it is only necessary to give permissive in this lifetime 18 button prepcheck making the pc look hard for answers short of arc breaking pc and you should have beautiful free needle and ta at the clear read and the pc shining if clearing did not occur these following faults were present in the auditing 1 pc did not agree with assessment it read only because pc did not understand it or protested it 2 the assessment was wrong 3 the atmosphere of auditing was critical of pc 4 the itsa line was not in 5 the auditor let the itsa line wander to early track6 the auditor qed and aed and went off process and into engrams on pcs sell 7 the process was not done 8 the assessment was done by physical disability inspection or by choosing pcs habits not by actual assessment 9 the auditing did not produce ta action wrong assessment andor itsa line out would be all that could produce ta action 10 pc already sitting in heavy arc break by reason of whole track bypassed charge 11 this process used instead of an arc break assessment well done thus making this process punishment 12 questions phrased wrong 13 questions were overrun 14 questions were underrun 15 auditor too choppy on prepchecking 16 arc breaks in these sessions were not cleaned up 17 pc trying to plunge into early track and stay restimulated 18 pc trying to get early track gpms or engrams run to avoid giving up service facsimile 19 auditor missed withholds accumulated during clearing 20 process end product clear overestimated by auditor pc or supervisors the keynote of clearing service facsimile is interest if pc isnt interested in it the assessment is wrong the keynote of auditing tone is permissive happy easy not militant let pc run on and on on phrasing question matter what is assessed it is always it makes pc right and others wrong pc is not trying to make it wrong an ordinary prepcheck done with service facsimile present will turn on mass on the pc why pc is asserting service facsimile well thats the fast rundown on r3sc routine three service facsimile clear and thats clearing lot of theory is missing in this hco bulletin but not one essential step you can do it if person is cleared before going on to ot they make it hundreds of hours faster note all ot processes will shortly be released with r4 designations but with little other change lrhjwcden l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6309c03 shspec302a r3sc some of the data in this tape are contained in hcob 1sep63 scientology three clearing clearingclearing routine three sc the reason person doesnt recover under auditing has been subject of investigation off and on since 1949 it was most recently looked at with regard to r212 it has now come up again with the discovery that to get case gain pc had to have ta motion the fact that you are getting ta action doesnt guarantee that the pc will feel better but ta action does guarantee that the pc will feel worse pc could feel better despite getting ta action because he is getting somewhat overrestimulated while still getting some charge off by classes of auditors here is what should happen with ta motion class i he may or may not be able to get ta its mostly chance that determines it class ii the auditor has to be able to direct attention enough to be able to get ta action while he listens it is very light attentiondirecting class iii the auditor directs the pcs attention towards service facs and clearing the itsa line is controlled more firmly to limit the pcs attention to this lifetime and to what you are trying to run using midruds etc to do it class iv at this level you are dealing with living lightning backtrack stuff gpms slippery track etc if you see the various classes of auditors arranged in order of increasing control of the pcs attention rather than by degree of complexity of material studied it is all quite clear by overwhumping the pc by restimulating more on the backtrack than you can discharge and by not controlling the pcs attention and letting him skid around restimulating things you get get the pc into condition where restimulation is too great even to permit the discharge of the keyin this is quite problem the resolution of this problem comes with running the service facsimile service facsimile is solution that the person himself has so restimulated that it wont discharge and nothing will discharge past it it is so valuable as solution that the pc feels he would perish if he got rid of it its an overcharged solution which the pc himself is keeping charged up it sits there and charge is permitted to flow by it unfortunately for the being it has weird sort of workability it is nonsurvival solution that has become survival it appears to make sense until it is inspected it has lots of in it when you start to run service fac by running engrams of the thing it will grind and it wont erase this is another odd datum the service fac is mainly diagnosed by the fact that the ta hangs up not by how the person acts in life the low ta or dead thetan case always has service fac the dead thetan case is sometimes hard to spot sometimes he is just sitting in something and when you ask question you get an fn high ta case probably has service fac although it is questionable case whose ta is between 35 and 375 with responsive needle has good chance of having service fac but doesnt necessarily have one person who tends to be out of control on the backtrack is overrestimulated you might even try to find service fac on him when pc has service fac the normal river of discharge is blocked by stable datum that the pc feels is vital to his survival the service fac the hallmark of service fac is that sometimes when it is being run out or between sessions the pc questions the wisdom of getting rid of it service fac is present where life has done so much overwhelming and the pc has done so much overwhelming that life makes more sense he has abandoned it and in lieu of it he has erected this insane stable datum the service facit might be better to call the service fac service computation or survival computation since it isnt actually single facsimile at all it is the person himself keeping the facsimile in restimulation because he knows it is best there are also third dynamic service facs such as the current prison system penologists know very well that the current prison system does nothing to handle crime it only increases crime this system which was adopted in 1835 was intended not to rehabilitate criminals but to dramatize making criminals wrong prisons are actually universities of crime maintained at public expense similarly the fdas actions are the result of basically good idea namely that the public should be protected against noxious food and drug products but this idea has gone bonkers it was good solution that has been plowed in so that it appears lower and lower of the tone scale and becomes an aberration the legal system of precedent is based on the same principle as the service fac in that it involves maintaining old solutions without necessarily inspecting them it is not true that every solution becomes service fac service fac is solution that is insisted upon but wont itsa solution to be real solution leads to further ability to itsa if solution reduces the ability to itsa it is potential service fac the fda is taking over the publics ability to inspect goodness of food and denying the public an analytical attitude towards products thereby reducing the publics itsa the public longer inspects and decides the fda can now go in and can pass stuff as good that isnt because of politics corruption etc the public can now be caved in by it you would never look to travel agencies as source of social aberration because their business is to increase itsa it can occasionally occur that they do though there can sometimes be problems associated with this eg british west indies immigrants flooding the uk however it is reducing itsa that has bad effect on society generally those things that result in or produce solution without inspection that is too broadly applied generate service facs the service fac prevents itsa of charge that comes up thus causing the accumulation of mass this mass gets restimulated when you prepcheck something that nicks the area lack of itsa also causes lack of ta action since without itsa outflowed there is discharge of charge families can get into noitsa of their individual members lack of itsa results in failure to handle situation in its own zone of reality which is all that aberration is service fac makes it apparently unnecessary to cope with anything in its own sphere of reality that is the service that service fac performs the resultant accumulated mass causes ta in the area result in prepchecking or other processing the more service facs the pc has the harder it is for you to get ta action on him in some cases there are definite advantages to getting service facs out of the way before proceeding to running back track you can save time and stabilize clears by destimulating what could key in r3sc is very workable process just inspect the folder past assessments etc looking especially for periods when the ta shut down ie where ta motion stopped for awhile whatever ta motion stopped on will be likely candidate for r3sc dont overrun it if the pc has trouble answering it come off that particular subject the right subject gives very good action the faster you get the real service fac the sooner ta action is restored so this makes r212type processes unnecessary it solves the problem of rockslammers chronic ptps hidden standards and body masses mainly it restores ta action r3sc run on few service facs advances the case to clear it is level iii process because it is clearing process current routine threes that actually produce ots eg r3n will be renumbered as level iv processes6309c04 shspec302 how to find service facsimile apparently there is more to know about service facs than has been relayed probably because it is so simple pcs dont defend their service facs against discovery if you point the pc in the right direction he will go right to the service fac unless you prevent it so dont prevent it in assessing for service facs there is substitute for knowing what service fac is service fac is first tremendous solution always aberrated in pt as part of the pcs environment which the pc believes would result in his survival being threatened if it were disturbed it is something which others keep telling the pc is wrong causing him to assert that it is right this assertion of rightness is very integral and important to the service fac it makes the pc unauditable to the degree that he is getting auditing only to prove that it is right it sticks out like sore thumb one could have more trouble labeling it than finding it the human body is service fac but if we used that we would be going for ot and we arent shooting for that we are just using the service fac on this lifetime to get the pc auditable so the body isnt the service fac that we are trying to target having found service fac we dont use it to make an ot we are only trying to get someone auditable and to get the constantly restimulated solutions out of the way to clear this lifetime on the whole track obviously having bank is service facsimile that accounts for the reluctance to go clear noticed earlier while finding goals being incapable could still be service fac at an ot level if say the ot couldnt tilt planet but attacking this kind of service fac directly is too steep gradient you could run service facs at all different levels the concept of service fac is based on confusion and stable datum theory in running service fac we are attacking solution that is barrier to getting rid of confusion you can pluck the stable datum out of the center of confusion and thus get discharge of the energy of the confusion stable datum holds confusion in place this is the reverse of using stable datum to handle confusion charge is an electrical confusion as long as stable datum holds confusion in place the confusion will not discharge confusions are tolerable and are not always aberrative most have aberrative value eg in card game life is not in itself an aberrative action there has to be some force and violence involved in the confusion or at least fairly real threat to survival for it to be aberrative the thetan knows that if he ceases to dramatize service fac he will die the immediate thing someone is worried about may not be the service facsimile itself it could be the consequence of something else that is service fac the consequence could be very hidden the two things could have at best faint connection as you take off service facs the central one on which they all lean eventually comes off as you audit the case you could get off several before the central one comes to view the apparent service facs lean on the main service fac rote procedure to apply to this would be logical solution to very illogical area but it is better to understand what you are doing if the case has been audited you could collect list of things that have been found on the pc eg old lists r212 assessments etc by discussing them with the pc and following the pcs interest you could find some service facs you might have to reword some of the things you come up with the rightwrong bracket is always the same the question is how would the condition or thing found make you right and make others wrong the service fac is the pc it is something he has it is not like an oppterm it is something he has to make him right and others wrong the pc will slop on the auditing command eg the pc may misduplicate the auditing command as what would be made wrong by it you dont worry about this let the automaticity run out then reask your original question and get it answered service facsimile is not an action an action would be the result of service fac the service fac turns on automaticities because it is an automatic unanalyzed solution for this reason you dont run it as repetitive process automaticity means that more answers than the pccan articulate are arriving from the bank when this happens when words are coming too fast you know that you are getting the service fac throw the question in and let the lions tear at it for awhile let the automaticity run out let er buck when the pc starts to run then when he runs out of answers turn it around and run it the other way if he hasnt already done it himself you are trying to get rid of the avalanche of automaticity and get ta also dont overrun by insisting on more answers than the pc has or you can get stuck flow run it permissively it is sometimes difficult to keep the pc answering the question just because he is in dissociated area the solution is holding back tremendous amount of aberration which wont asis as long as the solution is there the solution just keeps accumulating mass the solution is always below 20 on the tone scale because it is perforce substitute for an itsa line the pc felt that he could not itsa the object that he was trying to make wrong so he dreamed up this solution as final solution and that is substitute for an itsa line then there is asisness or itsa on the environment since there is asisness you get an accumulation of mass since it is substitute for an itsa line the service fac is referred to whenever the pc refers to anything when the solution is below 20 it propounds the idea that to survive it is necessary to succumb that is what it boils down to aberrated though that is for instance the solution may be not eating as in anorexia nervosa the service fac doesnt even have to fit in with the guys environment it is often totally hidden you cant necessarily spot the service fac by what the person is doing it often goes underground especially the very hidden ones some are very obvious too sometimes so obvious that you miss them you could ask as an l and n question what do you think your service fac is interest is the keynote the service fac is not deliberate solution it is subawareness automatic solution which the person is on the verge of all the time that is what makes service facs easy to spot if youve got the service fac the pc cant stay out of it it has to be specific enough you can use represent on something that is too general you can assess the list according to interest the pc tends to fall into the whirlpool of the service fac if the pc has fragile tone arm easily stuck then youve got service fac solution there that is preventing the charge from running off the pc doesnt have to look at things hes got it solved once you have the service fac get the pc to tell you how in this lifetime it would make him right etc dont go for the backtrack this improves the pcs ability to get ta action the peculiarity of the action you are looking for is not particularly great compared with the peculiarity of social mores but it is posing as survival when it clearly isnt prosurvival the pc will be interested in it and it will get ta because it is fixed solution your main interest is ta action just get the mass flowing that was hanging up service fac is fixed contrasurvival solution which the person hasnt inspected it could even be fixed survival solution but then that wouldnt interfere with auditing however using conduct as criterion makes anyone liable to be put away service fac is batty when compared not to the mores of society but to actual survival so you could say the following about service fac 1 it is contrasurvival but poses as survival 2 it has the pcs interest 3 it sticks the tone arm 4 it is always protruded into pt thus any constant ptp can contain service fac for instance you could ask what did you come into scientology to resolve that is one reason that service fac processing is beneficial however it is dangerous to list too many problems on pc because you are giving the pc too much whatsit while an incomplete list will arc break the pc so you had better twoway comm it use friendly discussion so you can move out of it if it gets sticky dont list it when you find an appropriate problem find thesolution in back of it and that fixed solution will give you the service fac if the discussion does get sticky you could free up the ta again by asking for solution that the pc has had to each problem he mentions getting fixed solution means that youve got the service fac notice that r1c and r2c are designed to strip away solutions and stable data therefore they are not likely to freeze up the ta find out if the pc has run r1c and r2c you can use this for data you can ask what the pc found interesting dont ask what problems would that solve that sticks the ta assess it then you can get the service fac the r3r preliminary assessment is almost deadcenter pitch at the service fac providing it winds up with stable solution this solution should be something that makes sense to you and the pc getting the item with the pcs interest will give you the service fac the level assessed will be too broad the service fac is magnet you are asking for right answers and the pc is giving you the rightest answer of all you can even get the service fac as nonsequitur item on list so watch for service facs on any list the fact that the item that is service fac is dissociated gives you clue the pc will handle your session with his service fac eventually it downs on you what he has been doing keep running service facs until you get change in the pc and free needle and good ta the service fac is the source of the ptp that the pc keeps coming to session with so getting it saves you all sorts of time and trouble when you get it out of the way get rid of the service fac and overrestimulation of the case ends this would reduce by 50 the total restimulation on the case so cases wouldnt keep dropping between sessions because of environmental restimulation having the pcs attention on disabilities keeps his attention off the bank thus good handling of service facs increases by hundred to one the runability of the case so you can now run him on steeper gradient6309c05 shspec303 service facsimile assessment we have been walking around the edges of the field of psychotherapy for some time there is third dynamic service fac in this field in that medical doctors who have training for and have business in the field of mental healing are attempting to take dominance over this field they have understanding of the mind only an understanding of the brain all you would have to to is to get legislatures to pass laws that would only allow those trained in the field of the mind to practice in that field and you would have secured the field there are only 272 mental practitioners in england so we have mocked up our own opposition our own extra item so people qualified at level iii will soon have certificate as psychiatric consultant there is legal patent on the name level iii is expected to be able to clear it also incidentally takes in the ability to treat insanity neurosis and psychosis these are just different degree of what is wrong with the mind the person who cant even manage himself and the environment we call insane what is wrong with him is that he has got the final solution some solution that is so allpervading that he doesnt have to itsa anything after that he never has to look so he just disappears in mound of unasised mass in processing certain amount of introversion takes place for the purpose of bringing about extroversion the only time introversion and erasure do not bring about greater reach and greater arc is when overrestimulation is brought about that factor still exists in class iv but there it is whole track that is most likely to get pc into an overrestimulated condition not just itsa on this lifetime at level iii you could overrestimulate someone who was already batty the worse off case is the more careful you have to be of overrestimulation for instance someone who had been running on conceptual basis who did not have much reach and not much arc with the environment might get overrestimulated if you got them to contact the pain in the thing that they are running to clear somebody you will stay in this lifetime only at level iv do you leave this lifetime and that is when someone has an active ta that doesnt go high or low with any pc on this planet it is environmental restimulation that is the straw that breaks the pcs back you can go backtrack but it is rough it can make the pc unauditable an hgc operating with raw public or even with scientologists has to battle with environmental restimulation not with the bank neurotic and psychotic states are caused by environmental restimulation the two factors involved are 1 the amount of environmental restimulation 2 the inherent susceptibility of the individual therefore if all you did was to try to reduce environmental restimulation some people would go sane and others would go mad with boredom it is question of acceptable randomity dogooders end up reducing randomity and things can get pretty boring an acceptable level of randomity equals the amount of environmental restimulation divided by the amount of restimulation the individual can withstand this being equal to some constant pcs usually audit only what they consider safe the mind starts to shut off any restimulation that would overwhelm it cf the minds protection the pcs ability to resist restimulation is too low for him to face up to track so how are you going to get anything done there are three types of cases 1 normal confront of bank those which audit easily 2 confront of bank those who refuse to approach the bank 3 suicidal confront those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs so that they go in over their heads all the time we want to convert the two latter sorts of cases into the formerall cases tend towards the safe solution some cases also adopt vengeful solution like getting even with people by dying even dangerous solution seems like the safe solution to the pc all cases when they become more auditable do so along the channel of the safe solution safe solution is safe decision safe environment safe assumption etc all human rights disappear down the channel of the safe solution that is the hole in the bathtub it is actually very dangerous to have safe solution it inhibits observation and anything that inhibits observation destroys someone who is very neurotic or psychotic is so to the degree that they have adopted safe solution this datum underlies mental healing as sweepingly as the datum that survival is the common denominator it is another way of saying the same thing people adopt survival solutions when then become so safe that they become contrasurvival the safe solution makes the person right and others wrong enhancing the persons survival by putting him in position of dominance and letting him escape domination by others it lets him survive and causes others to succumb he thinks this reaches extremes of craziness eg the miser who starves in household of 100 bills his method of survival is to have lots of money it is very safe solution but in his obsession with this safe solution he has neglected to spend any of it to live so his attention becomes more and more concentrated and less and less sensible for someone to be wise he must be able to observe his environment he must be able to reach it is not good enough to have maxims tucked away to which you can refer in times of stress philosophy becomes not wisdom but study of safe solutions the safe solution is the service facsimile there are times when you will have to be very clever to find just what it is in the pc it is complicated alterised and not believable there could be thousands of them you want to get the one the test is did it resolve the case in the first ones you find the most you can hope for is to find something that moves the ta and brings you closer to resolving the pcs case when you have found the service fac on the case the needle will be looser and the ta will be in more reasonable state acting better when something you have found doesnt run on the rightwrong bracket you prepcheck this is an invariable rule you could fix the pc up by taking anything that has been found charged on old assessments and prepchecking it that which you couldnt prepcheck with ta you could run on rightwrong if it goes nowhere on that ok there is harm done all this will eventually reveal the service fac one way in which you could be too clever with this would be to get overambitious and throw the pc in over his head as follows you are pulling the stable datum out of the confusion therefore the pc may be thrown into the confusion which makes him feel weird if you run r3sc on the stable datum until it is flat it will make it all right for the pc one of the tests of the service fac is that the pc is likely to say or at least think that he is not sure that it is wise to get rid of it be very sure if you are working with someone who is already shaky that you unburden the case gradiently even though he is standing there saying his service fac environmental restimulation has to be reduced on such case before you add any processing restimulation the better the assessment and the less gradient there had been the greater the shock to the person remember the pc adopted the safe solution because he couldnt stand the environmental restimulation so you dont necessarily want to get the big stable data first it is better to start off with r1c or 2wc on solutions that he has had to his problems the more solutions he has had to problem the more it will stick how do you raise someones ability to withstand environmental restimulation you pull his service fac since that is what reduces his ability to see his environment the more safe solutions he has adopted the more environmental restimulation he isnt asising the less he is confronting etc oddly enough or not so oddly the thing that reduces his ability to handle hisenvironment is the thing that he has adopted to handle his environment for him when you remove that thing he can now confront and inspect the environment and handle it when you get the environmental restimulation out of the way the pc can confront the backtrack we have gone into this line because we want faster run to ot i dont care anything much about clearing or whether he gets clear or not we are not trying to make happy persons we are trying to make an able person you can make clear by getting off enough service facs it makes better human being but the point is to cut down the time spent at level iv which is already sizable amount at level iii then we can handle environmental restimulation by knocking out the service facsimile which is what encourages environmental restimulation we have enough attention free so that we can go wholetrack and erase things faster and we are not held up by low tas and high tas so we dont have this situation w started to do gpm we got little bit mixed up we got into the bear goals then we got into the helatrobus didnt realize it but we were into the invisible picture goals all the time by knocking out the service fac session restimulation also drops because the session is part of the environment the assessment for r3sc is simple one it is l and n the lists dont have to be super long in fact they should not be longer than eight to ten pages with twenty items per page unless it is just safe to keep on listing list should be only as long as it has to be to keep the pc from arc breaking because it is incomplete here is the r3sc procedure 1 you do parts of existence list and null it down to some one item that the pc doesnt object to say peanuts it doesnt matter if the item is right so long as the pc doesnt argue about it if say four items are left in and the list isnt complete we will just do step 2 to all four of the levels left in as long as the pc isnt protesting pcs dramatize doing only what is safe ss they move in towards the service fac so you may need to do this assessment several times 2 take the item found and list safe solutions to it safe assumptions about it or safe decisions about it whatever clears with the pc the item you get eg not eat them is probably either as close as you can get to the service fac at this time or the service fac itself 3 take the item and work it over until it is solution to more than just that one dynamic eg solution to more than just peanuts you could ask how could that apply to other dynamics etc we want broader version of the safe assumption to get closer to the real service fac 4 in any case take whatever you get from 3 and run r3sc brackets or prepcheck on it 5 repeat the entire procedure starting with new parts of existence list 6 run it to free needle if you run something and you still have some charge on it list for safe assumptions about that topic look for identifications pcs will mention assumptions that dont make sense such an identification is cousin to one or more service facs note them when you find them this whole operation does take some geniushubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 september 1963 doft dofp scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling as given at the saint hill special briefing course instructors conference of this date the task of the scientology auditing course instructor and ds of p handling cases through uncleared staff auditors is to accomplish training and processing and therefore auditing with uncleared students or auditors the following drawings and explanations were made in drawing we see the auditors perception of the pc as limited by auditors own service facsimile in drawing b we see the auditors perception of the pc the way it would be if the service fac were removed thus we see judgement missing because of lack of perception of the pc or his or her condition or case in drawing thus permitting only processes not requiring high level perception or decisions based upon the momentary condition of the pc in drawing b we see that perception is not limited judgement can be exercised by the auditor because the pc can actually be observed by him higher level processes can only be run by an auditor approximating the observation condition shown in drawing b in drawing c we see the actual observation limitations of auditor or pc in an aberrated condition the keynote is safe assumptions as per service fac thus only safe assumptions will be entertained and real auditing occurs only ineffective assumptions or questions are likely to be asked or viewed example what about thinking about stealing paper clip from hasi this actual question was once asked in ow and its prototypes keep real auditing from occurring since neither pc nor auditor get close to any real aberration that either auditor or pc consider the assumption safe does not mean it is not aberrated and subject to fault so real auditing of the case is undertaken and when something worth while auditing is contacted either auditor draws off or pc unobserved by an aberrated auditor draws off this reduces processing results to next to nothing it also sometimes leads both auditor and pc in over both their heads as little is observed and all these safe assumptions are also aberrated the instructors and case supervisors solution is seen in drawing d auditing at lower stages done by aberrated auditors who have service facs in place must be assumed to be independent of observation of the pc occurrences since observation of the pc as in drawing does not exist the instructor therefore directs the student auditors attention toward the scientology body of data in order to get effective auditing done so does any case supervisor this body of data is designed to accomplish auditing independent of observation of the pc and the many varieties of changes and differences amongst pcs the instructor uses such mechanisms as ifyou can breathe you can audit do it exactly by the bulletin he instructs only in broadly workable processes and along definite rote lines he uses the habit patterns of discipline to enforce the auditors attention to and compliance with workable drills and data if this is done and only if this is done will auditing occur that is capable of producing effective results independent of the condition shown in drawing if the condition shown in drawing c is permitted to occur then all manner of squirrel processes and actions will occur in sessions wild solutions will reign and general chaos will result but more importantly the auditing necessary to produce the ideal condition shown in drawing b can occur only in the presence of instruction or supervision shown in drawing d thus one produces cleared auditors by operating only as per drawing d these facts are not the result of theoretical supposition but of careful empirical observation and test therefore instruction and performance of uncleared auditors must follow drawing d the accomplishment of classes ii and iii auditing and levels ii and iii results is possible by following drawing d it fails only when drawing d is not understood and followed by instructors and auditing supervisors the liability is that the students or auditors service fac may contest instruction as shown in drawing d there is liability if the student is already capable of drawing b observation which is rare in uncleared persons if service fac is in the road of instruction as per drawing d it still has been and can be overcome far more easily than overcoming various erroneous and varying observations of pcs as to confront the pc is to confront aberration directly and to confront the body of data is to confront only an orderly and pleasant arrangement of truthful facts that will still hold good when the student is cleared whereas the pcs aberration unstable before processing will be gone thus we study valid workable data that is broadly true and enforce compliance with it rather than studying or classifying individual cases and their aberrations as was done exclusively in older mental sciences which failed where we have already succeeded for years class iv material ot and whole track is sometimes too much for the uncleared auditor since it is complex it requires strict adherence to the body of data as well as some observation of the pc thus class iv materials ot and whole track are best done when the conditions of drawing b and drawing d both be present in the session this establishes levels of data and classification of its use some auditors with service facsimiles in place will be unable to successfully handle class iv data and some pcs unless cleared of the added restimulation of this life and the environment before being put on whole track will be unable to climb the hill therefore all instruction and use of scientology auditing skills and materials are most successfully done as per drawing d and have proven unsuccessful when auditor observation of the pc was assumed or auditor judgement relied upon while the auditor or student was in an uncleared state as per drawings and c this shows an instructor in or supervisor of scientology auditing his surest route to success with students without blocking those students already in condition to observe pcs those students whose service facsimiles revolt at drawing d will also most surely prevent their observation of the pc and instruction and supervision methods as per drawing d can overcome the barrier whereas nothing will actually surmount the failure to observe the pc short of clearing the auditors service fac this last is matter also of close observation of students over period of two years the object is to get auditing done under supervision and both during and after instruction only then can we ever broadly attain cleared auditors or any of our objectivesinstruction fails when these principles are not present or when done without heavy stress on the body of data and compliance with good auditing practice this is in way critical of students or uncleared auditors it is simple observation it is effective it is mean development to accomplish auditing without observing the more subtle conditions of the pc we have done just that therefore as the student or auditor does not usually observe the pc because of his own service fac and as level ii and iii can be done entirely by data drills and rote procedures all but class iv can be attained without cleared auditors if only cleared auditors were permitted to audit then nobody would be able to start the clearing this shortage of cleared auditors will exist to nearly the end of this universe so it is good thing to have the problem resolved as it is in this hco bulletin of course the most valid reason for using this approach is that only the disciplined body of data used exactly is capable of resolving cases and amount of confront of pc occurrence would by itself resolve anything its the body of data exactly and precisely used that resolves the human or any other mind and thats the main reason to make the student concentrate upon it so this is safe thing to doconcentrate on the body of datano matter why l ron hubbard lrh drbh copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 september ad13 central orgs franchise repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking compiled from hco bulletins of july 2 3 and 4 ad12 how to get the rudiments in just as an emeter can go dead for the auditor in the presence of monstrous arc break i have found it can go gradiently dull in the presence of out rudiments if you fail to get one in then the outness of the next one reads faintly and if your tr1 is at all poor youll miss the rudiments outness and there goes your session to get over these difficulties ive developed repetitive rudiments the auditor at first does not consult the meter but asks the rudiments question of the pc until the pc says there is further answer at this point the auditor says i will check that on the meter and asks the question again if it reads the auditor uses the meter to steer the pc to the answer and when the pc finds the answer the auditor again says i will check that on the meter and does so the cycle is repeated over and over until the meter is clean of any instant read see hco bulletin of may 25 1962 for instant read the cycle 1 run the rudiment as repetitive process until pc has answer 2 consult meter for hidden answer 3 if meter reads use it to steer that that each time the meter flicks the pc to the answer 4 stay with the meter and do 2 and 3 the process is flat when there is instant read to the question one does not bridge out or use two more commands when the meter test of the question gets instant read the auditor says the meter is clean the trick here is the definition of with session if the pc is with session the meter will read if the pc is partially against session the meter will read poorly and the rudiment will not register and the rudiment will get missed but with the pc with session the meter will read well for the auditor fast checking fast check on the rudiments consists only of steps 2 and 3 of the cycle done over and over watching the meter the auditor asks the question takes up only what reads and careful not to q and clears it one does this as many times as is necessary to get clean needle butone still says the meter is clean and catches up the disagreement by getting the additional answers when the question is seen to be clean the question is left in using fast checking never say that still reads thats flunk say theres another read here repetitive prepchecking we will still use the term prepchecking and do all prepchecking by repetitive command step one without now looking at the meter the auditor asks the question repetitively until the preclear says thats all there are more answers step two the auditor then says i will check that on the meter and does so watching for the instant read hco bulletin may 251962 if it reads the auditor says that reads what was it and steers the pcs attention by calling each identical read that then occurs there that that until the pc spots it in his bank and gives the datum step three the auditor then ignores the meter and repeats step one above then goes to step two etc step four when there is read on step two above the auditor says the meter is clean this is all there is to repetitive prepchecking as system anything added in the way of more auditor questions is destructive to the session be sure not to q and hco bulletin of may 24 1962 be sure your tr4 is excellent in that you understand really fake what the pc is saying and acknowledge it really so the pc gets it and return the pc to session nothing is quite as destructive to this type of auditing as bad tr4 end words the emeter has two holes in it it does not operate on an arc broken pc and it can operate on the last word thought minor only of question whereas the question thought major is actually null pc can be checked on the end words of rudiments questions and the charge on those single words can be made known and the question turned around to avoid the last words charge example are you willing to talk to about your difficultiesthe word difficulties said to the pc by itself gives an instant read remedy test difficulties if it reads as itself then change the question to concerning your difficulties are you willing to talk to this will only react when the pc is unwilling to do so caution this trouble of end words reading by themselves occurs mainly in the presence of weak tr1 and failure to groove in the question to thought major with good tr1 the end words read only when the question is asked in practice you only investigate this when the pc insists strongly that the question is nul then test the end word for lone reaction and turn the question about to make it end with another end word question not to have words changed only shifted in order then groove it in and test it for instant read if it still reacts as question thought major then of course it is not nul and should be answered double cleaning cleaning rudiment that has already registered nul gives the pc missed withhold of nothingness his nothingness was not accepted the pc has answer missed noanswer then occurs this is quite serious once you see rudiment is clean let it go to ask again something already nul is to leave the pc baffledhe has missed withhold which is nothingness lrh jwbpcden l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6309c10 shspec304 destimulation of case use arabic numerals to apply to routines use roman numerals to apply to body of data eg scientology iii not 3 auditor report forms are getting standardized format when handling service facs you are handling stuff that can bypass more stuff than any other thing there is if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on his case and he blows his skull off the service fac is what keeps the environmental restimulation restimulated when you are handling the service fac you are handling what makes aberration permanent many pcs have second dynamic service facs this has nothing to do with life but it has to do with your situation on this planet at this time the sickness and incidence of illness on this planet is unusually high because the way to make everybody wrong is obviously to produce nothing everybody counts on guys going ahead and making bodies keeping the civilization wheeling to keep thetans interested enough so they will keep reporting back the industrialist is in trouble at this time because he is producing on wholetrack basis thetan is in trouble simply because of mest that is how he looks at it if he could have arranged never to have created anything he would not now have anything to be in trouble with clearly so any creative activity is doomed to attack and the artists and musicians of this planet always attract someone who caves them in the same is true of industrialists etc they dont have enough force to protect their creativeness so people attack them therefore you find lot of service facs having to do with the second dynamic r3sc is thinice activity if you go one step too far you are in the soup so be careful to word questions with in this lifetime that way you will avoid lot of trouble from over restimulation from getting onto the whole track with service fac running we are engaged upon keyout not bank erasure keep the pcs attention on this lifetime and be careful since it easily goes to other areas which can then easily become bpc that is the second factor that makes service facs fraught with potential arc breaks the first factor was that if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on the case the moment you combine scientology iii with scientology iv you will lose you will have had it you will have left on the pc restimulation both from the pt environment and from the whole track how do you handle this so as to avoid this situation word questions so as to avoid all goaltype answers if an item rocket reads dont take it since only gpms rocket read you could get away with running it if you handled it very gingerly with in this lifetime and if you were very careful and didnt oppose it you can note it for later reference the best way to avoid problems is to ask questions that cannon be answered with goal asking for safe assumption about item is pretty safe in that you dont get goals but asking for safe solution to something tends to give you goals service facs are almost never to but they can be expressed that way avoid it scientology iii bypasses less charge run skillfully than scientology iv just because you are not among so many potentially heavily charged restimulatable things what you want to do with scientology iii is to destimulate the case so dont restimulate it in running service facs you can be wrong by restimulating the more you restimulate the more wrong you are the value of destimulation appeared in the search for ta action which is the only way to advance the case the whole track is too restimulative for most pcs getting into it produces over restimulation and stops ta action the only reason that the ta doesnt move is that the pc is in overrestimulation take room and fill it half full of cotton bales representing charge person in that room wont be able to move too well then put some more cotton bales in the room now the person will have even more trouble moving trying to handle the situation by putting even more cotton bales in the room stops his entirely the proper course of action is to get rid of as much as you can that is already there clearing is getting all the false data and this lifetimerestimulation off the case prior to recovering the truth one gets very good ta action doing scientology iii just by working on that line any case is overrestimulated when you start work on it the basic mechanism of entrapment is to keep the persons attention diverted to financial matters for instance to keep kicking him ground with various forms of trouble and worry so that he doesnt have chance to observe what is really going on the thetan wants something out of this planet and he thinks there is some pay he thinks that he is getting something out of it the trap wouldnt run at all unless the thetan was so busy in it that he never had time to look at it if he could see the trap he could get out of it but his attention gets diverted in it he then makes foolish decisions to hold off foolish confusion and gets still more entrapped it is perfected system of attention fixing shifting and dispersal real trap not just cynical snide comment those aspects of this planet that you protest are probably there to excite protest and overrestimulation eg finances money is bum itsa what is it in socialism you can never buy yourself off you stay tied down life is constant restimulation the pc comes into session subject to all this environmental restimulation restimulation comes in several different forms 1 pt environment 2 restimulated bank restimulated by the service fac actually there is an interrelationship between environmental restimulation and service fac restimulation in that the pc wouldnt have the ptp of environmental restimulation if it werent for service facs 3 auditing restimulation what has been restimulated in auditing and not erased 4 current session restimulation what you are going to restimulate in the session or what you are in the process of restimulating in session 5 auditor restimulation restimulation occurring simply from being audited if the auditor is rough restimulation from flubs all of these sources of restimulation are interactive to some degree they all hinge on the service fac crossrestimulation occurs the only core on which it sits is the service fac the service fac keeps the environment restimulated it has great bearing on other forms of restimulation and prevents their discharge however it can be knocked out the most notable thing about the service fac is that the thetan is doing it right now he is making himself right and someone else wrong all on his own cockeyed determinism he is keeping the gpm in restimulation because he is using the service fac he is mocking up his bank and he is the effect of it too but he is responsible for everything that is happening to him the preceding is happening right now he is doing it it is decisional how does the auditor restimulate something by putting the pcs attention or letting the pcs attention go on any heretofore inert charge that can be restimulated ie anything that is not already discharged the pc is totally incapable of causing trouble in session the auditor can let the pcs attention wander all over restimulating anything his service fac directs him to you wouldnt have psychosomatic illness unless the thetan had as all do the service fac that the best way to handle situation is to get sick that is service fac that goes backtrack easily the way an auditor restimulates something is to let the pcs attention wander to it or to mention it how much it gets restimulated just depends on how often you mention it and with what intensity the mechanism of restimulation is name it the way to get an arc break is to name something and permit itsa this gives you instant bpc as when the auditor says sorry about that last session we had another way to get an arc break is to let the actions of the session bar the discharge of materials already restimulated eg the pc comes into session itsaing and the auditor getting model session in shuts the pc up auditors often ask silly questions to be sociable then shut the pc up in order to start the session cutting the itsa line an auditor can goof at start of session by putting in whatsit eg how are you doing andthen not letting the pc itsa were going to start the session now you can do this any time it results in an explosion on an uncleared pc the service fac is interacting with whatever else is restimulated so the pc is putting in continuous restimulative factor in sessions you will get restimulation trouble as long as pc has prominent service facsimile getting one out of the way knocks about half the potential restimulation out of the way audit smoothly as you do it if you the auditor do the tiniest little thing wrong when you are approaching service fac the pc targets you as the one to be made wrong provide good specific small targets for the pcs attention and dont let his attention slide around it is trick to find service fac without restimulating everything here are some tips 1 audit smoothly this is the solution to session restimulation 2 restimulate more in your current auditing than you have to dont start naming whole bunch of things 3 give the pc frequent on auditing prepchecks to handle charge from past auditing do this every five or six sessions 4 keep up with the pt environment audit at least 2 12 hours week in case that was overrestimulated one would look to see what was practical to cut out normally the auditor would be concerned with reducing the auditing restimulation this is often overdone by excessively big targets b loss of control of the itsa line the auditor lets the pc talk too much one reason an auditor goofs is that he has his own service fac he is unwittingly trying to make lrh or the tech wrong he will usually come around when this is pointed out another phenomenon is that as you look for the pcs service fac and jog it he will target you to be made wrong which can be fairly restimulative and make the auditor flub one way to handle that would be to switch auditors you want to key out service facs so in assessing always use in this lifetime you dont want whole track only gpm rocket reads if you have room full of cotton bales you wont get anywhere with that finding the service fac directly because there is room to move around but you can reduce the restimulation in other ways if you handle all auditing on the basis of reducing restimulation you will seldom be wrong any pc who is running badly is doing so because of overrestimulation any solution of the auditing situation or the case has to take into account reduction of restimulation either by discharge or destimulation you can destimulate the persons life somewhat you can reduce one or more of the five sources of restimulation see p 503 above you could destimulate any restimulatable area whatever you can in fact work with then audit out this lifetime service facs case is as hard to run as it is restimulated more than that anything that reduces restimulation on the case is valid auditing for instance you could destimulate past therapies psychiatrists add more environmental restimulation than they pick off case so of course they fail6309c11 shspec306 service facs and gpms hcob 8may63 routine 3 the nature of formation of gpm says the early gpms contacted are implants this does not mean the pcs own gpms do not exist the pcs own gpm has power and velocity over an implant gpm in ratio of 1000 or 100000 to 1 there is great difference in order of magnitude the whole and entire amount of implanted gpms all together are one ri of one of lrhs gpms the oppterm goals which is one of about hundred ris on personal gpm which extends from trillions 30 to trillions 20 on the track and is actually still continuing number of you have some protest on the length of the time track multiple trillions of trillions etc modern times is trillions 13 to now the stuff that is likely to influence the pc in pt what you are doing in r3sc is fooling around with the pcs current ri in his existing pt goal line of his current truncated goal gpm there is an opposition to it clearing up this stuff is clearing dumbbell pair out of the pcs own gpm restimulated in pt out of sequence on the track the pcs goal will fall out of this with thud it is probable that while you are listing for the pcs service fac you will get the pcs goal rocket reading the amount of aberration required to reduce power must be comparable to the power reduced to account for the reduction of power of the thetan we must find some force of equal power that could aberrate him all the implant gpms did was to confuse you as to what was your goal and what was an implanted goal implanted goals were installed backwards from top to bottom an actual gpm is run the way it was lived from bottom to top use r3m2 to run actual gpms r3m2 is apparently variant of r3m r3m is method of running the sequence of actual gpms ri by ri starting either with an ri or with rocketreading goal starting with the goal the first ri is obtained by using goal oppose list also known as source list more or less with the wording who or what would the goal oppose subsequent ris are obtained by ri oppose lists these have to be listed rightwayto there are different rules for finding the item on these two sorts of lists each ri after it is found is packaged by relating it to the goal and to the ri found just before it and when verified is added to the line plot this packaging step also lets you know when you have entered new gpm as the ris will longer relate to the goal previously found when this happens the new goal is found by doing new goals list for new rocket reading goal or the pc may volunteer the new goal you can also start r3m with an ri perhaps one that was obtained from r212 in this case you just keep doing ri oppose lists and getting new ris by the time you have several ris the pc will give you his goal but you continue with the ri oppose lists other references on r3m are to be found above dont use an early actual goal as service fac and try to run it as such if you do this you are making the guy look down the goals channel the goal in an actual gpm is the furthest item from pt being the bottom terminal when you get the pc to reach down for that goal he is to some slight degree traveling through time between that goal and pt and he livens up the whole track which is lot of charge it is like looking down between the rows of the helatrobus implants you get tunnel of blackness that is what happens when you reach down gpm the same thing happens with the pcs gpm channel only it is quite different order of magnitude with the helatrobus implant it is not so good to do this but with the pcs own actual gpm channel it is like having your head shot off with sixteen inch cannon the residual charge in an actual gpm is incomparably greater if the goal comes up as you look for service fac put it in the auditors report form clearly marked with red circle and dont do much with it except in r3m2 if you run it you are getting the pc to look down through the gpm to the beginning of some track with at least ahundred ris between you and it you will get ta etc if you run it as service fac but the pc running it will scuff up his track the pcs own gpm looks like black island floating it is quite meaty they come in different sizes but each is distinct size you are running the pc back and forth from the bottom of mass maybe three feet thick 75 feet long and 30 feet wide you could well restimulate so much mass that the ta will all of sudden freeze up you would have to remedy this by working out the gpm with r3m2 the pcs own gpm has the beauty of disintegrating as you work with it you get rocketreading blowdowns the black islands turn grey then start shaking and fraying like opaque jello that someone left in the sun the power in this early gpm is commensurate with the native power of thetan ie there is lot of charge on it this charge doesnt discharge through the pc or the meter luckily the technology for handling this is all in r3n see above and r3m2 ris relate to goal but each as its own central postulate with regard to the goal this is true of every ri in the pcs gpm for instance the current ri might have central postulate of to ring bells where the goal is to go to school you might get an oppterm of people who bring their lunches without knowing the goal this would be puzzling thats why it would be an aberrative factor r3sc will land you somewhere in the vicinity of the current oppterm or terminal of the pcs own gpm as it applies to pt or it may land you near some old ri that is in restimulation in pt that will be the source of the pcs pt restimulation with r3sc you can knock that in the head you can pull its central postulate but when you try to make the service fac make sense you may find it impossible to do so until you relate it to his goal by running r3m2 so that is actually what you are auditing when you find the service fac you could find service fac without meter by having the pc write list of solutions until he is easy about it and feels that it is complete then looking on the list for the solution that makes the least sense however when seen as an ri such things can be seen to make sense when you are handling service fac you are handling the central postulate of an ri so running r3sc disintegrates the ri the thinkingness of the ri is sometimes different from its beingness eg you may have the ri lame man but from that you may not know what the significance is that lies within it ie you may not know what the central postulate is you could list for this and find it it may turn out to be lameness things can be audited nicely without being related to the gpm where they occur even though under these circumstances they might not make sense service fac is actually not whole ri but just the central postulate of an ri you are handling the central postulate of an ri when you are handling service fac so you get disintegration being assumes an identity because it has solution in the middle of it for instance in the middle of the identity lame man we may find lameness as solution to something sometimes an ri comes up as its own thinkingness but beingness ri in particular may have an idea at its core an ri always has an idea at its core but sometimes you dont have the central idea when you have the ri given the ri you could list for the central significance which is an automatic solution its safe it solves everything this safe solution would be the service fac that is how an ri is generated the thetan has an idee fixe so he never has to inspect in order to solve so therefore he never asises the mass so therefore he gets caught in the middle of the mass if the thetan does this with goal he gets an accumulation of ris resulting from this goal each of these ris has the goal carried through into it but there is also new idea that makes each ri and that whole mass comes together as gpm so you get this huge mass this huge block of energy with its separate items in it they dont appear separate the whole thing is all squashed together from so much attack and so little inspection the whole thing is dominated by one goal eg to go to school which is common to every ri or identity within it this is what it is accumulates it but that goal all by itself is inspection it is way to solve all problems totally uninspected in fixed way for instancethe goal to solve all problems go to school is totally uninspected solution and now gathers to itself identities who have this idea as well as other characteristics because the goal is uninspected automatic and fixed it generates into itself the second step of identities eg an idiot child that have the goal as central idea but which already have their own characteristics they have the main idea the goal as dominant but the characteristic of the identity after it is longer able to carry out the postulate is something like that of an idiot child the idea of an idiot child is people like unintelligence so the central idea may be unintelligence solves everything but the ri is an idiot child the only way that it could exist in the first place was that the thetan had the idea of the goal to solve all problems go to school so there are three types of ideas in gpms 1 the goal of the gpm this is the first postulate and central idea of the gpm 2 the central idea or postulate of the ri which in itself forbids inspection 3 the identity or individuality or the ri this is the accumulation of mass that results from the fact that 1 and 2 above being fixed uninspected solutions forbid itsa and hence forbid an asisness from occurring that is the anatomy of an ri but it also tells us what service fac is this is what gives us the dwindling spiral of abilities ris substitutions of ideas for thetans the thetans ows all these get piled up on these fixed ideas the biggest fixed idea was goal which then developed into gpm that which is not inspected tends to persist because it is never asised what happens person gets hell knocked out of him the ri and its significance is the constant invitation to attack but it is never the right enemy the constant ow and battling that ensues from this fact accumulates as the mass of an ri it is interesting that an idea is most easily substituted for thetan because it has mass and seems to contain some wisdom i am guard implies i dont have to understand or inspect the thetan has tried to solve screwup with fixed idea or postulate this is sort of sweeping under the rug that permits inspection therefore asisness therefore persistence any idea is liable to become substituted for thetan because he does it himself when one gives up on one goal one gets another for instance say the last three or four mountain ranges the thetan built fell down and fouled up his planet so on the ideal planet never build mountains becomes the solution that holds all the confusion uninspected it is solved instead sooner or later we will find him running society for the prevention of building mountains he is now an identity he is the idea never build mountains substituted for thetan the pc keeps abandoning old solutions as they fail and keeps getting new goals this is covered in r3m basically except for finding the pcs own goal and distinguishing it from implant goals so be alert to anything you find in r3sc that rocket reads but dont run it with service fac tech you cant run gpm with service fac tech but you can run one ri with it but that rocket read is more than just service fac r3sc does handle the ri that is part of the pcs pt environment if you find an ri and your pc is having energy doing odd things to him giving ghastly sensations body distortion sensations etc the pc is liable to disclaim the ri in an effort to get away from it all getting towards the service fac causes qualms and invalidation in pc the service fac is prosurvival so he doesnt want to give it up dont q and with that invalidation to do so will just restimulate it worse if the invalidation occurs pick up everything found as service fac and finish it off standardly with all of the r3sc steps when stable datum is pulled out and not run off completely you leave some of the confusion behind so just get it with r3sc if you take the stable datum half way out of confusionyou leave the confusion this is what happens when you leave r3sc on something halfrun the result is that the person will get foggy his memory will deteriorate if you took the stable datum all the way out you would blow the confusion the postulate in the center of the ri is so far downscale that it is twenty ta divisions below hide it is an idea that has turned into mest you run it only as far as cognition but it may enter at any of these levels 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival but real gpm item service fac goes through the steps of 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival 5 domination 6 rightwrong then the next 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival etc again the service fac may enter at any of these stages it starts off reasonably sensible but becomes very weird like cows are kissable as safe solution to how to repair motor cars this service fac will turn out to be intimately related to solution or domination etc in the pcs mind when you try to run it the pc may not be able to fit it in on rightwrong so check it over on the other buttons he may well cognite on it and blow the charge you could then see how it is solution how it would make or has made him right and others wrong around and around on the buttons until the pc is out of answers and the buttons are clean do an 18button prepcheck and it will all cool down the auditor is always in danger of grabbing the gpm accidentally getting the goal instead of the service fac this has advantages too since the pcs goal is hard to sort out from implant goals the pcs own ris are probably what make implant goals read they read off the top of the pcs own ris the service fac doesnt have to rocket read you can accept one that does but be equally prepared to take one that just ticks the pcs service fac is his current solution his current ri monitored by the goal it is very aberrated stable datum it is an unexamined solution that keeps the pc from doing anything it was decent solution when the thetan first got hold of it but then it started running his life therefore it does not even vaguely take care of environmental enturbulation the rule when in doubt communicate is an attempt to overcome the effect of service facsyou have to work at it to do r3sc wrong the best way to do it wrong is to be completely unthorough to leave everything unflat the pc will get very confused from having all his stable data pulled away when you handle service fac all the incomplete cycles that the service fac has caused hit the pc at once this generates confusion when the service fac running is not completed the confusion gets even worse so it is good idea from time to time to clean up what you have done get it all finished up some service facs wont run quite in the order given for r3sc it may start on later step than rightwrong or earlier at solutions real service fac behaves outrageously in that regard something else that isnt service fac may be far more mannerly while still giving ta action keep your eyes peeled for the pcs goal since this is the best means of finding it that we have developed keep running service facs until the case is in good shape and the pcs goal has shown up you get the best ta on the pcs own gpm channel you can use r3m2 when you get his goal but that is not your immediate purpose r3sc is for destimulating the pt environment factor6309c12 shspec305 service facs the difficulty with getting pcs case forward is that the pc has hidden standard which is that by which he measures his progress it is often unknown even to the pc that is why it is hidden an aberration is an outofcontrol exaggeration of the positive or negative of anything thetan can do hence aristotles doctrine of the golden mean the fact that something is normal doesnt mean that it isnt aberrated for instance the difficulty of exteriorization is accepted but it is not anything much in line with the thetans abilities so departure from the normal is particular index of case state auditors sometimes have trouble because pc runs too easily so in judging case level dont use the pcs behavior as an index use the amount of ta motion by running service facs the case can change very quickly so worrying about the pcs normal behavior is unnecessary and irrelevant it is easier to measure persons case against some scales of abilities than against behavior and it is more accurate the condition of restimulation of the case has more to do with understanding the pc and handling him effectively than does the pcs behavior the only things you worry about with pc are 1 can he do the process 2 is he getting any gains 3 is he getting ta motion the fact that someone has hidden standard merely means that he has chronic restimulation that is throwing extra charge on the case it is some facsimile or whatever in chronic restimulation if it was changed in the session the pc had gain if you got ta some of the chronic restimulation will have gone so the pc will have had gain and will probably say so that unfortunately isnt all that happens with hidden standard the pc is also trying to fit every process to this thing to resolve it he is so introverted in session as result that he doesnt asis anything and you dont get ta action time and the ta fit together and the pc drags his hidden standard facsimile up into every incident or whatever in order to evaluate it therefore the pc is always misdating something the hidden standard isnt the date of it whatever date he is in that is why it is the most effective ta stopper there is way of getting rid of the hidden standard process called r3t now called r4t in this process one simply asks the pc for his chronic psychosomatic what he is experiencing and what is always present he answers and you date it whatever it is then you get the itsa line in on it in most cases that is the end of the hidden standard the hidden standard always expresses itself physiologically it is never hidden physically it will be what the pc complains about sometimes it will take you an hour or so of itsa to find out what it is when the pc spots it he will feel better and you will have been getting ta dont let him start giving you problems or you have had it since problems are not itsa so perhaps you should stick to what physical condition are you trying to solve he will finally itsa it out if he doesnt tell you all at once if he gives it to you right off the bat you might get some ta with when has this troubled you in auditing or in this lifetime you can take it up with r3t and date it taking it back as far as need be sometimes dating it will cause it to blow on the spot especially if you dont get it so narrowed down that you get the pc into an engram and have to run it with r3r or if he gets stuck in his own gpm with r3m2 or if in another gpm with r3n r3t seems to be the precursor to the date portion of the datelocate for handling intractable pressure somatics r3t is commonly overrun youve got to watch the pc when you first start using r3t you are likely to overrun it roughly 80 of the time eventually you get slippy and stop overrunning itnot every pc has hidden standard to the point where it ruins the auditing but hidden standard exists in every case that has difficult or delicate ta that the auditor has to worry about so r3t is the weapon to use to get the ta moving again when all else has failed r3t can fix it but little goes long way dont try to run the whole case with r3t since if you tried to do this you could end up with messedup pc however you could do r3t on everything the pc is worried about in pt you could clear somebody with r3t as long as you you kept good control over the pc and just dated all his pt hidden standards the service fac has to be severely located on the time track in this lifetime so that it will key out handle every hidden standard that the pc could dream up but dont let him pull anything up from the back track in the meantime use tr2 if r3sc goes nowhere you can still clear the pc using r3t the tough case is the pc whose service fac is his hidden standard the only workable handling is carefully to get it dated this is all destimulation so you have to be careful not to run anything the reason you are trying to destimulate the case is so that the pc doesnt have ptps so that he can put his attention on the session if you start destimulating action and then go backtrack and start running something the pc will get restimulated and if the pcs service fac includes making you wrong that is the first thing he will do he will try to restimulate more than he can handle how do you keep the itsa line in on pc that wants to restimulate more be awful damn careful of your whatsits remove all social actions and chitchat from your auditing avoid all violent attention shifts and attention shifts directed by whatsit and dont direct the pcs attention in way that arc breaks him so that he has to get even with you by whatsiting the type of model session to use on case that isnt getting much ta is your wunit type model session social frills w unit was next

training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units for description of w x and z units gf model session is given in hcob 15oct 2 goal finders model session this bulletin is not on the shsbc overrestimulation leads to self invalidation and invalidation of scientology and other dynamics the pc invalidates his own case chews himself up all the time and he doesnt know so let that be warning sign to you the case minus the service fac is subject to less restimulation because he pulls in fewer ptps in his environment case without good processing gains has ptps the way to handle them is by handling service facs there is way of listing for service facs that nails ptps 1 whats safe assumption about your environment 2 what would be safe method of handling your problems here and now in life this is only one of many solutions to this situation such question will drop into your lap the stable datum that the person is using to hold at bay various sectors of his existence so in that respect it becomes method of destimulating the environment you wind up with what he uses to handle his family his job etc take the pcs whole environment to pieces find out where his life is in conflict and what it is in conflict with in pt get what pt consists of this orients the pc and is good scientology i see above for description of scientology i note also the similarity to the pt environment list in expanded dianetics you should both categorize things and locate them spatially this is good for the pcs itsa after you have all of pt use the above process on it you could plot the pt environment out and find where most of the pcs problems are the pc gets gloomiest when talking about this area the ta dies down as you keep talking about it indicating that there are more problems there than the pc can confront he cant put any itsa into the vicinity as the pc looks at the stable datum that he is using to hold sectors of existence at bay and as he finds out more about it you will get his confront on the environment increasing and increasing as his ability to differentiate comes up this is terrific hgc approachnow that you know about the hot spots and fixated areas in the pcs environment you have subjects where he cant itsa you can assess by rising ta to get zone where there is service fac in operation as long as one cant itsa something he will continue to have ptps with it so since the pc cant confront the areas of rising ta he will have ptps there make mistakes etc the frequency of ptps is the measure of noconfront noconfront is caused by substitute confront which is service facsimile it isnt that the thetan cant confront it is that as long as the pc has the service fac the things he is notconfronting can keep caving him in and restimulating him here is lesson that you should learn about life dont stay in places that you dont want to keep confronting because your nonconfronting will lead you to pick up stable datum to do your confronting for you in that vicinity and the next thing you know this is going to be gorgeous piece of mass and will give you more ptps than you can ordinarily count and your life will become very restimulative the rising ta is less observable than the pcs attitude if the pc hasnt got anything to say about something he isnt observing it something is observing it for him and that something is service fac find this and run r3sc steps on it if you are having trouble with r3sc you have collided with the ri of the pcs ongoing gpm it will still handle with r3sc if with some difficulty you use several assessments to get something to run on r3sc you can use scientology list one assessment or discussion of pt doingness and environment with observation of where the pc goes downtone and where the ta rises indicating areas where the pc cant confront and itsa when you run the brackets step of r3sc you will get ta by asising stable data and letting confusion fly off do thorough pc assessment sheet you can use the pc assessment sheet to find out about the pcs pt if you treat it as leisurely 2wc activity looking for ta action not data ie doing it as an r3sc assessment when dealing with this lifetime let the itsa run free when dealing with past track control the itsa line very closely an assessment at scientology iv is rapid bangbang assessmentb r d t c h n i c l b u l l t i n 12 september 1963r revised

communication and leading to havingness in that order the cchs are auditing specifically aimed at and using all the parts of the two way comm formula control is the first action of the cchs and is highlighted by being done tone 40 for the first two cchs cch 1 and cch 2 the reason for control being the main point is simply to bring about an awareness of terminals to which communication will be possible this is done by bringing to the pcs awareness that his body and he are being controlled from particular known source point and b that he also is source point of control with control over self and body all of which is accomplished with cch 1 ie awareness of two known terminals once the above has been done with cch 1 the gains can be developed further with cch 2 by finding for the pc more known points environment and familiarity in this new environment plus the beginnings of the next major step forward in this developement of communication the awareness of distance communication cch3 is the next major step forward in the rehabilitation of your pc tone 40 is used in the next step but only on the motion communication is encouraged the type of communication practised by the actual auditing actions is that of one way communication iecausedistanceeffect with intention attention duplication and understanding plus the first glimmerings of cause being given to the pc by auditor receiving pcs comm and then getting the pc to get the idea of contributing to the motion in this section you are also going to develop the pcs ability to reach by showing him it is safe to reach across distance hand contact mimicry and then reduce his dependency on yes and increase his reach even more hand space mimicry as an added bonus to the above you are also on the beginning step of havingness duplication as you will be teaching the person to duplicate as being in two way communication and not as body with reference to body right and body left havingness is the final step in this portion of the cch formula full formula cchcactch where attention control t thinkingness control this step of cch 4 is the final culmination point which restores the pcs ability to be in good two way communication with high level of havingness by the use of duplication the full two way communication formula is practised in physical manner with the result that you will have travelled very very steep case gain from comm as thetan to full two way communication as thetan with lots of havingness ie the emanation of an impulse or particle book and motion from source point across distance to receipt point with the intention of bringing about at receipt point duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source point with receipt point then becoming the source point back across the distance to the source point which has now become the receipt point with intention attention duplication and understandingobserved general errors 1 not knowing how to change from hand contact mimicry to hand space mimicry ans the change occurs on the run through the cchs after hand contact mimicry is flat with change ie cch 1 2 3 hcm with change 4123 hcm with change 4 2 1 2 3 hcm 5

are not validated 3 overwhelming pc with very slow very fast or continuously varying speeds of movements ans an overwhelm is always wrong velocity plays an important role in being part of the comm formula by all means experiment with it but pay close attention to pc make for wins and increase tolerance not losses and decrease tolerance 4 interrupting pc to handle body origination ans body originations must be picked up when they occurs in deciding to pick up body origination the auditor should bear in mind that it is against the auditors code to prevent pc from carrying out command 5 while doing cch 4 auditor tells pc to do it mirrorimagewise ans when the process is being done as per the two way communication formula you will see that the pc will be executing the command mirrorimagewise the receipt point has become the source point however to tell the pc to do it mirrorimagewise is absolutely wrong as such direction will prevent the pc from looking and put him on selfaudit 6 not being sure of cch flat point ans flat point 3 cycles with change in comm lag physically observed change and the pc doing it 7 imprecise body movements of auditor on cch 2 ans auditor

of the all rights reserved churches of scientology6309c18 shspec308 saint hill service fac handling it is adventurous to go in to handle something like the mind without knowing what you are doing every case and every practitioner in the field of the mind has been concentrated on one aspect of existence and dedicated to observing existence only through that aspect so wonder little has been discovered and less applied knowledge about the mind means freedom for life and beings in this universe therefore anyone who is after enslavement is also in favor of ignorance about the mind there are two ways to make people ignorant 1 deny any information at all 2 substitute false data this is an easier and more effective way add to this the fact that 3 everyone is mired in his own favorite data and youve got good trap the way to overcome ignorance is to find the precise mechanics that apply to all minds because this will be broader truth that overrides all the minor data on which people are fixated false relay of the basic truth dropping out bits could again make slavery because it would deviate enough from the generally recognized broad truth and degenerate into opinion and fixed data this is the difficulty that scientology has had to deal with over the years the solution is results because once the technology is producing results you get arguments so the whole contest has not been for the achievement of certain truths we have had these for years rather the contest has been for workability so that we can get an application of those truths so that we can get rapid release of attention from favorite data and so that there is demonstration that by using the truth greater freedom is attained the one reason why you cant get pc to see that he can get release of attention by virtue of applying general truths is because of his favorite data his fixed idea he considers that any other truths have to agree with this favorite idea in order to be true he is sure that all horses sleep in beds this is not only his fixed data it is his total data any data that doesnt contribute to it he will discard to person with service fac his idea of truth is whether something fits his idee fixe person may have his attention fixed to varying extent so person whose attention is not totally fixed may obtain fringe benefits from studying scientology to the degree that persons attention is fixed he is not able to explore the perimeter of his ideas and therefore cannot see greater truth so he is more entrapped than someone who is less fixed the greater the fixation the closer to psychosis psychosis is the state in which the individual has only the idee fixe the degree of enslavement is the degree to which the individual is fixated on the fixed idea if you try to communicate datum to someone with very fixed idea the datum will be received as false unless you indicate the fixed idea if you communicate some idea that fits with the fixed idea it will be accepted as true it could be that any other datum you then communicate will be taken as true but these data will not be inspected false data is worse than none as far as entrapment is concerned it is like putting up sign pointing over cliff and saying this way lies freedom one can only get fixated on falsehood never on truth truth is an allfreeing mechanism if freedom is not obtained the truth in question must be to some degree limited either in conception reception or application therefore anything you are worried about must have falsehood connected with it there is always lie connected to anything that you are having trouble with session goes well if and only if you get ta action the discovery that pcs case gain can be measured directly by ta action seems simple but it is an advance in technology beyond anything in the past fifty thousand years since it takes judgement of improvement out of the realm of opinion and possible inability to observe on the part of the auditor or the pcall confusions and masses must be there because they are held in abeyance so far as observation is concerned and will not asis because of stable datum stable datum prevents observation of the environment or these masses and therefore accumulates masses what is wrong with mind is that stable datum is substitute for observation person 1 ceased to inspect 2 fell back from living 3 let everything go to pieces 4 chose stable datum instead of inspecting 5 got an accumulation of mass and confusion when you shake up the stable datum by taking apart some of its ramifications confusion can start to flow off the amount of ta determines whether or not the pc had good session matter what the pc says there is opinion about it at all good ta means that the pc will feel better bad ta means almost invariably that the pc wont feel good stable datum is held in place by the confusion its supposed to confront and doesnt instead of remedying the confusion as it was supposed to do and as inspection would have done it collects more confusion like dam the more confusion it is supposed to hold in place the more confusion batters at it so the more confusion accumulates around it like twisting fork in bowl of taffy modern science and other mental technologies have taken stable datum that man is an animal and that the mind is brain the idea that man is mass is stable datum in confusion that is persistently dramatized try to tell the modern scientist about stuck flows and he will think that you are giving him lecture on blood and the causes of coronary thrombosis they cant be taught until you get them to inspect some thoughts that they have had about brains modern science has man equals the brain as stable datum what can you do for someone who is totally bound in and fixated to the point where he is being stable datum you could take datum of enormous magnitude and hold gun on this person and say believe it or we shoot you that substitutes forcedatum for inspection ultimately it fails because it is just another stable datum with an associated confusion that is why iq usually deteriorates with years of schooling since modern education is usually just laying in more and more uninspected stable data you would have whole new area of education if you said look over this data and sort out what is true in it you should have the student inspect data and find what is right or wrong about it this is of limited usefulness as long as everyone has his own fixed idea by which to tell rightness from wrongness another way to go about it would be to free up peoples ideas so that their perimeter of inspection increases so that they can inspect the data that lies before them you lead them up with disciplined action that leads them to their fixed idea when they have spotted and disposed of that they are free to inspect and move up to higher levels of truth therefore it is important to find the pcs central fixed idea as soon as possible thus freeing him to inspect more broadly you free being by freeing him not by making him wiser exteriorization and even the state of ot depends on getting greater freedom not more wisdom because with the freedom wisdom will be attainable and will take place anyway by concentrating on the wisdom you are all too likely to fall into the idea of the implanted stable datum freeing attention leads to freeing the being since all that can trap being is his attention thetan can only trap himself by 1 being unwilling to confront things that are not interesting to him 2 being unwilling to back out of situations in which he has lost interest3 being unwilling to move off and go his way but still somehow be responsible for where he was various combinations of the above lead to the individual trapping himself by leaving some inanimate postulate in his place to confront confusions for him eg i have an unconscious mind that does all that the unconscious mind is that totality of stable data that is holding back that totality of confusion that the individual is longer aware of but is still doing so when you are looking for the pcs service fac you will be looking for that on which his attention is most fixated in pt fetish objects are just things associated in some way with persons service fac any cousin to the service fac that you find will give you ta as the confusion can flow the service fac is the last pair of ris formed at the top of the last truncated gpm postulated it has lot of locks and cousins which you will be able to pick up first it is actually impossible to find the exact pair of items as the service fac the pc has to know that they are part of that gpm before he will recognize them they must be seen as part of the bank before they are recognizable to the pc they have to be related to the last goal and to the last two ris you need these three data in addition you wont find the service fac but try anyway because that is where you will find the last actual gpm it is those two top ris that have the pc so restimulated that pt is restimulative and his ta wont move so you have choice but to find the pt goal of the pc having found the goal find the top oppterm of its gpm by asking who or what would be the latest idea formed concerning this goal to catch catfish make reasonablesized list list it to clean needle and null to reading item prepcheck it after the pc has cognited for awhile then you might see it rocket read the difficulty in finding pcs goals has always been in getting them to rocket read you can do this whole operation with only ticks and rr until you have prepchecked the top oppterm here is how to do it 1 find what you hope is his service fac this gives you enough ta so some charge is off hunt and punch around until you know youve got something that will get good ta action either on rightwrong prepcheck or something dont do anything with it it is not the real service fac this keeps the pcs tone and morale up by virtue of getting some ta off it or by having the promise of getting ta off it 2 start looking for the gpm if things bog down while looking for his goal you can still run the item from 1 for awhile and give him some ta 3 this could go on for couple of sessions until you get goal that ticks and that keeps going tick which reads as an actual goal probably from the past track it is not likely to be the pt goal so 4 use goaloppose to get up to pt so you oppose the goal do the same check on it then oppose that goal and get another one check each new goal found as being for sure an actual goal check if it is the pt goal the pc will be very interested in what you find since they are his actual goals keep doing this until eventually you will reach his pt goal 5 when you reach his pt goal and you oppose it the list goes nowhere it keeps developing more and more ta the pc wont arc break because you are listing towards his future postulates and unburdening the pt goal by the above phenomena you know that you have the pt goal 6 you check this make sure it is the pt goal7 list for the top oppterm which may or may not be opposed yet you could find out where the pc is on the gpm by asking him if he has started to oppose the goal yet list to clean needle null it dont have two rrs on the list etc dont be too concerned with whether or not it is really the top oppterm the top oppterm will most likely give lots of needle action when you hit the top oppterm the needle goes mad 8 after you have given the pc his item you sit still and let him cognite 9 put in bigmidruds on the item as far as you can 10 call the item you will probably see it rocket read that is fast slippy way to get into the pcs current actual gpm starting with r3sc when you are on the goals finding step check over any goals that the pc may have mentioned earlier that were seen to fire then having found the pt goal you are ready to take the bank apart that first ri accounts for all pt restimulation the reason why we havent been able to find goals on pcs is the overburden of the top terminal and oppterm accumulating all the debris of pt and masking the top gpm or any gpm for that matter because of this masking action we used to have to find goals with ticks instead of rocket reads when the top ris and their accumulated mass are gone you are ready to roll right down the bank and back up again the pc gets ta ta ta now hes got new problem we are in new gpm and can go get it

because middle of session was the earliest use rudiments of session are less employed today because of the discovery that all dirty needle phenomena is usually traced to the auditor having cut the pcs communication to get rid of dirty needle one usually need ask only have i cut your communication or do an arc break assessment if that doesnt work dirty needle continuously agitated always means the auditor has cut the pcs itsa line matter what elsehas happened chronically comm chopping auditors always have pcs with dirty needles conversely pcs with high tone arms have auditors who dont control the itsa line and let it over restimulate the pc by getting into lists of problems or puzzlements but high tone arm also means heavy service fac whereas dirty needle seldom requires mid ruds or

question of how much tone arm action is adequate must be answered these are rough answers based on direct observation of pcs after sessions tone arm action is measured by divisions down per 212 hour session or per hour of auditing ta action is not counted by up and down only down is used usually the decimal system is used but fractions can also be employed needle falls are neglected in the computation only actual motion of the tone arm is used one can add up or approximate the total down tone arm motion after session if an auditor is keeping good reports of ta motion one adds up all the divisions and fractions of division of down motion not up and the result is known as total ta for the session needle gives about 10th of division of motion in one sweep across the dial but as above is not used in his computation needle action is neglected in the addup example as noted in the ta column of an auditors report 45 42 48 40 35 gives you 3 8 5 gives you 16 divisions of ta action for that

processes can get into creak of bypassed goals or ris which make him uncomfortable although ta action has been good or even excellent case analysis will locate the bypassed charge on any auditing where charge has been bypassed but ta action was good the pcs subjective reality on gain will not seem to compare with the ta action gotten in the auditing but the moment the by passed charge is

hco bulletin of 8 october ad13 central orgs franchise scientology i to iii how to get ta analysing auditing there are several distinct forms or styles of auditing there was first the old finger snapping handling of engrams then there is formal auditing for which we still have trs 0 to 4 then there is tone 40 auditing still used today in the cchs these are distinctively different styles and good auditor can do one or another of them without mixing them up just as tone 40 auditing is still used so is formal auditingin fact scientology 4 on the gpms must be run only with formal auditing and the old trs and other training are still used to develop it in the student now there has emerged new auditing style it is listen style auditing and the first thing to learn about it is that it is new style of auditing and that it is distinctly different from formal auditing and tone 40 auditing naturally an auditor who can do this new style can also do other styles better but the other styles are themselves and this new style is itself listen style auditing is peculiarly fitted to undercut formerly difficult cases at the lower levels of scientology and to get the necessary ta action listen style auditing has or is developing its own trs it has its own technology and this leaves the technology of other auditing styles still valid and untouched some of the data of listen style auditing is 1 the definition of auditor is one who listens 2 the pc is always right 3 the task of the auditor is to get the pc to command to itsa 4 the success of the session is measured solely by tone arm action 5 the style applies to scientology levels i to iii 6 as the level in which it is used is increased the amount of auditor direction of the pcs attention is increased the gap becomes very wide in control between level iii and iv so much so that only formal auditing is used for gpms as this material is all subitsa for the pc the basic crimes of listen style auditing are 1 not getting tone arm action on the pc 2 cutting the pcs comm 3 cutting evaluating or invalidating the pcs itsa 4 failing to invite itsa by the pc 5 itsaing for the pc 6 not getting tone arm action on the pc these are some of the major musts and crimes of listen style auditing while some of these also apply to formal auditing to show you how different the new style is if you tried to use only listen style auditing on scientology iv and failed to use formal auditing at that high level the pc would soon be in great big mess so the style has its uses and exactions and it has its limitationsnow realizing it is new style not whole change of scientology the older auditor should study it as such and the new studentas mainly listen style will be taught in academiesshould spend some earnest time in learning to do it as itself i have had to learn every new auditing style and sometimes have taken weeks to do it i can still do them all each as itself it took two weeks of hard daily grind to learn tone 40 auditing until i could do it with misses its like learning different dances and when you can polka and also waltz if youre good you dont break from waltz into polka without noticing the differenceor looking silly so the second thing to learn well about listen style auditing is that it has to be learned and practised as itself listen style auditing is peculiarly fitted by its simplicity to analysis by an instructor or student or oldtimer the steps are 1 learn hco bulletin of october 1 1963 2 muck along with what you learned bit 3 tape 1 hour session you give on tape recorder 4 analyse the tape youll be amazed at the amount of miss until you actually hear it back these are the points to look for 1 did the auditor get dirty needle continual agitation not smooth flow up or down if so the auditor cut the pcs comm this is entirely different from cutting itsa just how was the pcs comm cut listen to the tape whether the auditor got dn or not do this step how many ways was the pc prevented from talking to the auditor particularly how did the auditors actions cut the comm with auditing or unnecessary action how was the pc discouraged from talking what was said that stopped the pc from talking 2 establish whether or not the auditor got good ta action by adding up the sessions total down ta see hco bulletin of september 25 1963 if the auditor did not get good ta action he or she either cut pcs itsa or b restimulated nothing for the pc to itsa which was it the odds are heavily on listen to the tape and find out how the auditor reduced the pcs itsa note that itsa is entirely different than comm was the pc given anything to itsa was the pc permitted to itsa it how much did the auditor itsa for the pc did the auditor attempt to change the itsas 3 by various ways by direct invitation sounding doubtful unconfident challenging an auditor can make pc whatsit the amount pc is made or allowed to whatsit reduces ta action how many ways did the auditor make the pc whatsit give problems confusions as answers or just plain put the pc into questioning attitude how doubtful or worried did the auditor sound how much did the auditor make the pc worry over ta action or other things all of which add up to making the pc whatsit thus reducing tone arm action 4 how much did the auditor invite unwanted communication about confusions problems by silence how much did the auditor prevent wanted communication by various actions5 what errors in the session are obvious to the auditor what errors are not real to the auditor 6 does the auditor have another rationale or explanation for not getting ta action or for what causes ta action does the auditor consider there is another explanation for getting dirty needles 7 does the auditor consider ta action unnecessary for session gains 8 does the pc in the taped session agree with the faults discovered may be omitted such tape should be made periodically on an auditor until that auditor can get 35 divisions of ta at any level from i to iii on any pc l ron hubbard lrh drrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6310c15 shspec312 essentials of auditing the relay of information from one mind to another is communication education therefore the arc triangle operates if you can take effort out of the comm line you can normally get fast accurate comm line but when comm line loses enough mass it becomes unstable that is what happens with verbal data line sometimes there is data on tapes but not in bulletins this is unfortunate since sometimes there is data in the tapes that could make all the difference but you cant hold duplicatable standard because it isnt down anywhere in writing with nomass data eg verbal data it gets altered in the relay there is always some data that escapes the solid comm lines so you cant get all the data for this reason you have to reduce things to their fundamentals keeping what is important you can always have communication of fundamentals both for educational purposes and because to reduce something to fundamentals makes one understand it better the relay of data from mind to mind b is susceptible to many alterises there are almost as many sets of alterises as there are minds for the data to be transferred through this also occurs on the timestream we probably have very little grip on what was thought in 1800 there was tremendous change in manners in the us because of the telephone movies radio tv and the automobile you can overload comm line by putting too great volume of data on it so that it doesnt communicate the door to learning can be shut that way too students sometimes feel overwhelmed by data and long for some fundamentals an overloaded comm line is overloaded because of insufficient time to peruse the material being communicated you can also have too little or too varied communication scientologys data is basically research data at present it is not yet sifted and clarified into fundamentals and less fundamental data we started with the definition of an auditor as one who listens and computes thirteen years later it turns out that listens is the fundamental not the and computes which was part of the original definition in the meantime lot of other data got added which in fact was only added because there was insufficient understanding of the original definition there is datum in the sciences subject has arbitrary data in it in direct proportion to its distance from the actual comprehension of its basics so you get into pure opinion and arbitraries as in art there is nothing actually known about subject when the subject is nothing but opinion opinion present is proportional to knowledge absent for instance when psychological testing requires the opinion of the tester you know that nothing is known developmental line is an ambitious selfcritical line which is trying to achieve parsimony of information the data keep condensing and becoming more fundamental with importances well evaluated this evaluation factor is missing in other philosophies eg that of krishnamurti krishnamurti on time is great but it is not evaluated for importance by him it isnt true that you are studying lrhs case the struggle has been to rise above ones case and the colorations given by the condition of this planet etc this has been quite successful whenever things get more fundamental bucketful of items drop out which can make one wonder what is stable from the past the stable data are the axioms the logics and prelogics the fundamental material of the philadelphia lectures and the behavior of thetan the only thing changed was the idea of exteriorization what will person do when brought to point where he doesnt have to be in body we used to think that he would move out of his body this is not what he will do he will move his body off of him because we have changed him upscale to where he could hold position the factors and arc triangle and scales of all sorts these are stable what has altered is applied technology not the theory better more efficient ways of applying the theory have been discovered it is reevaluation of data as applied tech that you are seeing and because you are studying to become an auditor not theoretician you need to know application what gives you headache if anything is trying to apply the theory to case so as to get result all your bulletins are addressed to this subjectthe data that you are using to square away an aberrated student or pc has to be absolutely fundamentally true the project 80 hcob actually hcopl 21aug63 change of organizational targets project 80 preview p 1 where scientology is defined as the common peoples science of life and betterment drew some criticism because of one phrase the common peoples science of the mind oddly enough this is the one inaccurate phrase in the bulletin the critics didnt spot that fact they just objected to the phrase the mind tends to fixate on those things that contain an alteris of truth and an alteris of truth is the thing that most resists the truth of the situation it is an aberrated stable datum where you have slightly altered truth that you try to give to someone who has already got an altered truth on the same subject the two will come into conflict which promotes all sorts of bad applied technology it is like trying to drive truck through truck when you have two alterised truths in conflict to try to understand an aberrated datum through another aberrated datum results in complications so if you are studying body of data that has any alteration from the fundamental that should be there and you have an alteration that is contrary to the altered datum that you are trying to assimilate you get dogs breakfast you never look at what is wrong with the datum that you are trying to assimilate the conflict wont resolve because you have vested interest in trying to make it fit with an aberrated datum you get conflict of aberrated data against each other overlaid with opinions you have pc who is gold mine of aberrated stable data if any datum which you are using to solve that case is the least bit curved the case wont resolve but will develop new complications therefore the mass of technology that grows up in scientology is centered around applied technology you get masses of data that subside when fundamental is clarified so the greatest possible truth has to be used in application hence research is directed at finding the clearest fundamental possible we have gone long way and have made great gains but we still have to cope with the randomity in the person who is assimilating and trying to apply the data if you in assimilation of data are assimilating to the slightest degree data up against miscomprehension or an allness which you are putting in place of the auditor you dont get an assimilation you have difficulty assimilating the data but you can assimilate the data your trouble comes when you turn around and take the data youve assimilated and altered in some fashion and then try to apply it to the case that is sitting in front of you the alterises in that data will then bring about nonresolution of that case you are confronted with the only solvent is truth even though absolutes are unobtainable truth in very refined form the purest possible is the only thing that will resolve cases all the way because it is the one thing that the aberrated case cannot argue with therefore you as an auditor desiring results have business twisting the technology there is fortunately considerable zone of tolerance that permits the tech to work even when it is imperfectly applied as long as you stay within this zone of tolerance but the tech has to be as nearly perfect as possible the tech heretofore was too imperfect ever to work it has been lrhs task to bring about recognition of fundamentals that is sufficiently great and tech that is sufficiently great to overcome lot of this alteris this task is thousand times greater than the task of simply presenting what is necessary to resolve the case we have to present if so accurately that the pc can still alter it and the auditor alter it and still have resolution of cases this is an heroic problem the amount of difficulty that you have with cases is directly proportional to the amount of aberration or alteris that you are adding to the data that you are trying to apply it is also inversely proportional to the purity and assimilatability of the material that you are asked to study that is tough one but it is pretty well handled the way you solve solutions is solutions wherever lrh has made little mistake or wrong emphasis there has been trouble because the additional alteris added by the auditor takes it far enough from truth to make it flukey to apply lrh in describing some horrendous auditing error says its good thing kids that im almost indestructible these things usually get done to firstlevel iv makes an ot but it cant be varied 118th of an inch from its procedure and still work there was hole in it that appeared when it was imperfectly applied there are three types of goals that will rocket read 1 an actual goal with gpm connected with it 2 an implanted goal 3 an actual gpm any gpm can have in it up to hundred actual goals plus the goal of the gpm but there is another source of rocket read 4 phrase in an engram this wont necessarily rocket read but it might even pcs life or session goals can be free actual goals every now and then one will rocket read it is probably lock on an ri if you run it as an actual gpm goal you can even find items from the nearest implants or other gpms or locks but there was gpm there in the first place so when you find goal rocketreading you should check on the meter 1 is this an actual gpm 2 is this an implant gpm 3 is this gpm auditors have been asking is this an actual goal etc instead this can wrap you around telegraph poles because you will be trying to oppose it when it is lock on something and you can do this pulling things all out of place for awhile until the pc crashes in flames the three comm lines in session include the itsamaker line the pcs line into the bank the whatsit line and the itsa line it is an error to cut the pcs comm line to the bank in order to put in the itsa line this stems from misunderstanding of the auditors role as listener the error could also have come from failure to communicate the importance of the pc to bank itsamaker line since it was obvious to lrh that that was what auditing is all about he didnt mention its importance it is where the itsa line comes from without it the itsa line has nothing to carry the auditor is actually there to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the reason why that communication wasnt accepted or didnt go through is the reason why the auditor is having trouble auditing education is acceptable to technical end only when it is conceived pretty purely and relayed well technical data must 1 be conceived purely 2 be relayed well 3 be received accurately its test in scientology is results auditors can also have trouble because they have glommed onto some older datum and made it an all but there is this overriding fact that datum i give you is substitute for you thats the burning thing to remember as an auditor datum wont audit pc the only thing that can handle auditing is live thetan because that is all that can handle the complications that come up youve got to have technology but the live thetan in the chair is necessary to audit the pc6310c16 shspec313 the itsa maker line the itsamaker line is the line you are guiding as an auditor which sorts out the things in the case and gets the material that is reported to the auditor as itsa the itsa occurs at the end of this line the line from the pc to the auditor is the itsa communication line itsa is the identification of isness or wasness it is simple commodity until an itsa is recognized it is only potential itsa auditors can make mistake by thinking that there is potential itsa where there is only nothingness this is the commonest method by which an auditor refutes itsa the meter version of it is cleaning clean this is demanding more than the pcs got if you repeat the question this makes the pc feel as though you havent accepted his itsa when you do this in effect you deny the itsa that you have received you have cut the itsa comm line by refuting the itsa that was offered you may think that the arc break was caused by your cutting the comm line but it was really the invalidation of the pcs itsa that did it the auditor is likely to try to cure this situation by asking whether he has interrupted the pc that is also cleaning clean so the arc break intensifies you havent interrupted the communication you have enforced it you have to keep in mind what you are trying to do which is to get ta action all the significance on the case will have to be handled at level iv anyway so at levels i ii and iii what counts is ta action for description of these levels see p 462 above see also recent tape on level iv pp 524526 above everything wrong with the pc except how and why he started to make time track in the first place comes out of his gpms anyway level iv is the scientologists level the preceding levels mainly set the pc up for level iv i dont think that anyone will make ot except trained auditor trained auditors confront is up he knows what he is dealing with etc probably the basic barrier on the track in mental sciences has been specializing in results without also trying to make everyone into pro causer pcs have been audited on level iv in hgcs they have understanding of what is occurring they arc break easily they dont have the confront mainly they arent educated enough to understand what is going on so they get upset by reason of unknownnesses there is only one way that gpms can be run you must find and run the pt gpm first then keep going on down the track to prime postulate then repair you cant do it as you have been previously told to because you will get items out of other gpms you cant repair gpm until you have gone through the whole thing but you cant afford to make single mistake because you will spend amazing amounts of time correcting it youve got tremendous processes at levels i ii and iii so you should be able to sit down with raw public pc and turn out 35 divisions of ta in your first 2 12 hours on any pc anyplace if you cant do this it is because of lack of understanding of one of the basic points of auditing like the itsamaker line you might have some wild idea about something basic it might even be scientology datum magnified out of all proportion to its true importance for instance you may think pcs never answer the auditing command so you always get the itsa from the meter and leave the pc out thus destroying the itsamaker line you and the meter can act as substitute thetan perceiving things in the bank that the pc isnt perceiving at level iv the material is subitsa you have to depend on the meter at level iv because the pc cant itsa what is in the gpm without some assistance the auditor can undercut this with the meter and find out what the goal is because it rocketreads but if we rely too much on the meter we cut the pcs itsamaker line you still have to stay in comm with the pc and avoid invalidating his itsa and cutting his itsamaker line this doesnt mean that you should be very careful it just means that you should know what you are handling and how to handle it get observant so that you can tell when the pc is introverted when he has said all he wants to say etc in session means not only 1 interested in own case but also 2 with the itsa maker line in on his case not on the auditor but under the auditors control the top of the gpm is hard to run it is resistant to processingsince the itsamaker line is invisible to the auditor the auditor has to synthesize what is going on the itsaline is not unit area thinkthinkthinking it is an actual line between the thetan and real thing the bank an auditor who attracts or rapidly shifts the pcs attention to himself has moved the itsamaker line to himself and it has become whatsit whats wrong with the auditor etc the itsa maker is what makes ta occur it is the pcs attention line an arc break is caused by sudden shift of attention you should be aware that perfection in the control of the pcs attention and perfect handling of the itsamaker line is impossible you will make couple of mistakes in this per session even if you are an expert what counts is how adroitly you can wriggle out of whatever you get into not how careful you are to stay out of trouble it helps to spot the birth of an arc break well in advance of its overt appearance an arc break is much easier to handle early on and you wont have audited over the outrud if even implicitly you give the pc an order to shut up and let you write the pc will do it and keep doing it pcs and the bank generally do what the auditor apparently wants nonverbal behavior may communicate an auditors desire to the pc auditors main goofs consist of giving apparent orders that they arent aware of and dont intend like stop inspecting your bank and put your attention on the emeter this may occur when the auditor fiddles with the meter lot fumbling takes away the auditors control of the itsamaker line by shifting the pcs attention to the auditor and the goof the bank always does what the auditor orders it takes combination of the auditors orders and the pcs inspection to get the bank handled randomity will occur the auditor who is allergic to unforeseen circumstances would do better to go to an old ladies home to get bank inspected 1 the auditor must direct the itsamaker line 2 the pc must put in the itsamaker line how does an auditor straighten these things out for one thing he can audit smoothly getting good ta so that he has cushion to use in working with the pc dont fix something when the pc is running well something that upsets you does not need to be handled if the pc wasnt concerned as long as the itsamaker line isnt affected in other words dont repair nonexistent situation if you try to repair something that didnt upset the pc you are cleaning clean and you will get an arc break sometimes the auditor gets consciencestricken this should not be remember that when you ask pc about something you put his attention on it you can also put pc on whatsit by being so conscientious that you are always looking for what is wrong you should only repair auditing when auditing isnt occurring case repair is otherwise an interruption of auditinghubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 16 october ad13 central orgs franchise r3sc slow assessment ian tampion of the melbourne org just completing the shsbc reports on itsa and slow assessment dear ron over the past couple of weeks i have had some good wins auditing pcs on r3sc slow assessment so i thought id write out what ive learned about it from your lectures bulletins mary sues talks and d of p instructions and from my experience in auditing my only doubt about what ive done is that i may have been combining r1c itsa line with r3sc but anyway it worked so if ive got my data straight you may like to pass it on to other auditors here it is aim to keep the pc talking itsaing about his present time environment getting as much ta action as possible for as long as possible without finding and running glum area that makes the ta rise to do this an auditor should be aware of and able to use the following definitions pc itsaing pc saying what is what is there who is there where it is what it looks like ideas about decisions about solutions to things in his environment the pc talking continuously about problems or puzzlements or wondering about things in his environment is not itsaing present time environment the whole area covering the pcs life and livingness over definite period it may be the last day the last week the last year depending on the pc glum area that area which when the pc is supposedly itsaing about it makes him glum and the ta rise indicating that service facsimile is doing the confronting on that area and not the pc the following diagram and the explanation below illustrate just what is taking place in slow assessment and how the definitions given above apply while the pc is talking about football he can say itsa game itsa played by two teams itsa played on field etc etc etc the same applies to the areas tv work wife club garden house and mountains all this will give nice ta action and good gains for the pc now when he starts talking about cars he will say i often have punctures i wonder why my car will only do 100 mph etc etc while hes talking like this there will be ta action or rising ta and if the auditor lets the pc continue he will get steadily worse so the auditor must put in an itsa lineeg what have you done about this and the ta will start moving again and the pc will get brighter as now he is itsaing before he wasnt later or earlier the pc will start talking about taxes his problems worries puzzlements wonders about taxesthe ta will rise and the pc will become glum then even though the auditor puts in an itsa line as with the subject of cars the ta continues to rise and the pc remains glum this is because the pc cant itsa this areahes got it all made ignore them and this does all his confronting for him in other words the service fac is substitute confront and so the ta rises note the old rule about rising needle equals confront this is glum area so the auditor lists in this lifetime what would be safe solution regarding taxes completes the list nulls it gets the service fac ignore them runs it on r3sc and soon the pc will be able to itsa on the subject of taxes this area could be found in the first 5 minutes in which case it may be possible to just note it down and get the pc on to areas he can confront and come back to this one later the assessment should go on for hours and hours and hours with excellent ta action and the pc gaining in his ability to itsa all the time however it wont go that way if the auditor doesnt get the pc to really itsa what is in his environment eg the auditor shouldnt be content to have the pc say he lives out in the suburbs he wants the address its distance from the city the type of house how many rooms what the street looks like the names of the houses occupants who the neighbours are etc etc etc itsa itsa itsa also it wont go that way if the auditor tries to list safe solutions every time the pc starts talking about his problems in an area as in the example given above with the car problems are not itsa itsa itsa itsa equals ta action ta action ta action equals pc better pc better pc better good gains i hope you find this all okay and pass it on ron as its sure doll of an auditing activity very best ian tampion ps i found out how most of this goes in auditing by making mistakes first so i learnt the hard way l ron hubbard lrh dwrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6310c17 shspec314 levels of auditing getting ta motion is common denominator of all scientology activities the state of case of the pc has practically nothing to do with your ability to get ta motion on him some day you will cognite that if you dont yank the pcs attention off of his case and if you give him something to itsa and if you dont stop him he will get ta motion you can reduce ta motion by being unpredictable as an auditor eg by varying the form of model session keep the session drill constant and predictable from session to session or the pc will start running whatsit on the auditor then the auditor runs itsa on the pc and you get ta the auditor not the pc is in complete control of the bank the bank always does what you tell it to do the pc sometimes does and usually tries to when new style of auditing is released like listen style auditors at first go to pieces they will start introducing some listenstyle into formal auditing you should let the pc itsa the item or goal but thats all if you let the pc itsa the bank you will have sick pc on your hands the ta might move for awhile but the overrestimulation that the pc could get into will lock up the ta pretty soon the things that you are handling in the bank are the things that prevent itsa so letting the pc itsa around in the bank isnt effective the pc will restimulate that which prevents him from itsaing so he wont be able to itsa level iv is all subitsa but when you give the pc an item do let him cognite and itsa on it or you will stack up missed withholds bpc and high and stuck ta this presents bit of problem since eg when the auditor stops the pc from wandering into the wrong gpm there is bpc which can produce fierce arc break what you have to do is to audit fast enough and positively enough so that the pc never gets chance to wander the two great dangers in level iv auditing are 1 the tendency for goals list to be underlisted 2 the tendency for an item list to be overlisted when you fumble command you are not in control of the pcs itsaing of his bank but you are in absolute control of the bank so if you fumble list the bank will fumble so the bank fumbles unseen to you the pcs attention line is on the point where you fumbled therefore the bank has shifted under that scanner and the pcs attention goes off onto other things because you have shifted other things into his view with your fumbling soon after such fumble the pc will add something to the session some kind of yipyap not necessarily critical you did something that showed that you did not have control of the pcs bank you distracted the pcs itsamaker line and shifted the bank underneath it with this goof so you are going to get some other stuff it isnt neat and clean the pcs attention will now be somewhere you dont want it if there is any bpc lying around the goof or cutting the itsa line will key it in and you will get an arc break you will get dispersal of attention the itsa goes all over the time track there is always bpc in session you cant avoid it the bpc is either from past auditing or from this session the keyin of bpc is always some communication failure eg cut comm or refuted itsa on the part of the auditor you could even get wrong goal and if you audited very smoothly you could audit without giving the pc single arc break because it takes cut comm line to restimulate any bpc even when it is there the fact that there is bpc does not mean that there has to be an arc break but the fact that there is an arc break does mean that there was some bpc bpc via rough spot in auditing via session keyin cut comm etc gives rise to an arc break wrong goal may cause very uncomfortable pc but need not cause an arc break whether there is an arc break from bpc is entirely dependent on the auditor of course the more bpc there is in the session the tinier the mistake could be that could key it in the cycle of any arc break is1 bypassed charge 2 rough spot that gives the pc little dispersion 3 cut line on the rough spot 4 the arc break dead on the arc break you will find little misdemeanor but ten minutes to 1 12 hours earlier you will find nice nasty misdemeanor for instance you might find that some sort of forcingness was going on guide the pcs attention dont force it the bank does move to whatever the auditor says running an engram is like developing picture just have the pc look at it you can move his attention over it repetitively this procedure will develop his picture of whatever was there lrh did this with pc who was dead in his head lrh moved the pc to nonsignificant date and moved him through the next half hour over and over the pc got to where he was reading the mail that he had read at the time that lrh moved him to word for word if you get the date and duration of any picture on the back track the picture will turn on the only thing that fouls this up is 1 the comm line is too lousy for the pc to report that he has done it there are several ways to prevent pc from reporting what he sees you can also foul up the comm line by refusing to take the pcs data you could fail to believe that you were moving the date under the pcs attention 2 the track is stuck in something you can demonstrate the above phenomenon by taking some nonsignificant date and getting the pc to pick up everything in it by moving him through it enough this is even easier than getting aberrated incidents since there is charge debarring it running chargeless incident is test of an auditors tech because there is nothing there but the auditing if you dont go goofy and demand more than the pc has you can get the picture you may not get the pcs state of consciousness in the incident unless you spend long time on it it would be good test of auditing there is upset present except what the auditor introduces if your auditing is rough you will find that when you are trying to get the pcs attention on the rough stuff of level iv his confront will be lowered his confidence will suffer and his ability to itsa will be lessened the pc will only have difficulty on what he can confront and do if you make difficulty for the pc additions to the comm cycle do make trouble for the pc so keep itsa where it belongs when youve got nice long item list 20 items long give the pc his item let him look at it and cognite when he has done so you can show him the list and ask him how the other items relate now you will get more ta and more confusion blowing off once you have learned how to audit level iv it will seem easy the fast way to arrive at that point is to do it6310c22 shspec316 the integration of auditing your difficulties in auditing are all made manufactured by you in this universe difficulty always has to be manufactured living beings are theta beings they have to work pretty hard to be entheta beings one may not be aware of the labor involved but it is still being done there would be mass in the bank if it were not being created in the instant in which it has an effect on the individual thetan creates his own bank it is not that thetan has created his own bank it is that he is creating his own bank at this instant there is such thing as continued creation all creation must be done at the moment it is perceived there can be utterly unconscious creation that is the source of the reactive mind the reason thetan is creating is contained in the things he is creating trickily enough the thetan creates the item creativeness which then forces him to create person generally cant confront what it is that is causing him to create or what he is creating to cause himself to create he is not confronting the fact that he is creating it so it is gone notised not asised the difficulty with this creativeness is that in view of the fact that the thetan can create so much automatically he cannot differentiate what he is creating so he cannot asis what he is creating the easiest thing someone can do is to create an artist who is sweating over his creation has put some arbitrary barriers there such as time barrier eg it must be done in fortnight or economic barriers eg he has to sell it or he cant eat and possibly material barriers eg the paint he has must be used even if it is suboptimal you could sort this out with him easily this action taken to its final form is r4 you audit out all the gpms and ris youre auditing out the barriers which person has put in his own road in order to prevent imagined oppositions from having an effect upon him game of shadows we tend to poohpooh the trouble that the bank causes him because it is shadows but the individual does in fact have to be bailed out if groups etc are going to be made effective anything thats wrong with an organization is being created now by the organization it is the same with the individual difficulties in auditing are all made in this universe difficulties have to be manufactured except for the question of succession benevolent monarchy is the most nearly ideal form of government people wont accept it because it might fail next year benevolent people is preferable to benevolent monarchy you cant work with anything but the individual if you want to succeed the individual is the only thing there and the only thing that will ever be there so hes got to be in good shape in any given organization there is enough theta to make it whiz unless someone is keeping it from whizzing livingness is monitored by the amount of arbitraries to which it is devoted the amount of livingness present is reduced by the amount of livingness invested in notlivingness in arbitrary factors it isnt really reduced strictly speaking because it is all recoverable by auditing by asising the notlivingness auditing is recovering the water from the mud pies the theta from the arbitraries the entheta and enmest ta action is the flow of theta coming out of the mud the mud is the bank why cant you audit pc who has screaming ptps because there is too much attention theta invested in the ptps entheta an auditors action is to find some entheta and to invest it in an orderly fashion to recover more theta from entheta when there is never any theta present you have psychology and psychiatry when there is theta present you have overrestimulation and you get ta action there has to be some pc there if the pc is unconscious ie all mud you have to run some cch type process to get him aware enough to be audited take pc who is pinned down in fox hole he is out of food and ammunition with mortar shells beginning to bracket him in that is how some pcs feel they dont dare take their attention off of pt all you can do is to find out what the mind is doing and parallel itin routine 4 pc can get so keyed in that he doesnt want to continue auditing on r4 person with heavy ptp on the perimeter of his consciousness that you have eased off with lowerlevel processes who was doing fine at getting ris before now wont run as well he gets fewer items they dont fire etc this happens because the pc has attention invested in ptps the same thing happens at lower levels with the ta being stuck there is free attention with which to asis aberrated stable data at levels i ii and iii the pc can run into level iv when neither the auditor the pc nor the process are equipped to handle level iv because there is actually more potential overrestimulation of the pcs ptp on the pcs track than there is in his present time environment when you look at gpms and their ris there is more potential restimulation on the track than there is in present time so the pc could be more restimulated by reason of keyedin gpms and ris than by simply getting knocked off in present time this liability is answered by auditing goals with in this lifetime prepchecks if the pc has given you some goal you could get rid of the level iv potentiality with such prepcheck probably but you will find while doing level iv that prepcheck of this kind is messy to work with when you have already found the pt goal you get to the bottom of the second gpm and end session with the ta at 30 week later the pc comes in with the ta at 50 something has keyed him in midruds dont handle 2wc on what has happened in the intervening week doesnt handle so you go on to list for the next goal and the ta goes down it was the next goal that had the case restimulated the pc went around talking about it i told joe it was _______ or _______ one of them at least was wrong goal and finding the next goal was the only thing that would bring the ta down so auditors at levels i ii and iii should be able to assess an arc break assessment that includes goal restimulated and item restimulated if you hit one of those the ta will come down ptps almost always appear on the goals channels the pc thinks that he is influenced by one or two ris and that his character is formed by one goal in reality it is the whole bank that influences him ptp usually occurs as keyin of an ri or gpm of one or another of the pcs goals chronic ptp is keyedin gpm out of sequence that can cause psychosomatic illness an educated pc will respond to an l4 or case analysis that spots the fact that gpm concerning that illness has keyed in if with good smooth spoton auditing there is ta action then r4 has gotten in the road spend session or two analyzing the case dont try to date gpm because it may span trillions to the x power of years you can date the top and the bottom of the gpm this will cause the gpm to move in find by case analysis what caused some chronic illness an ri gpm an implant gpm an actual goal etc actual goals stick on gpms as locks by themselves they are not aberrative gpms out of sequence gives psychosomatic illness ris can pull chunks of gpms along with them when the pc gets into the wrong gpm because of some similarity the bank isnt all chaotic it is actually pretty neat basically it consists of thirty bricks laid end to end each composed of forty subsections ris when you start thinking of the mind as vehicle of thought you are already licked in handling it it is not vehicle of thought it is made out of things like bricks and tar the spots of tar on the bricks are the implant gpms actual goals thousands of them are stuck onto each brick like lumps of dough the gpms look like black energy masses thats why thetans get restimulated by black energy masses the gpms can get shoved out of order say bricks five through eight have been inserted in between bricks 19 and 20 etc level i auditors dont have any business trying to straighten out gpms the meter is necessary because pc restimulated by the bank cant perceive the bank and can audit it hence there are three essential parts of auditing 1 the pcs body 2 the emeter3 the auditor level ii and iii auditors should be skilled in arc break assessments they can prepcheck goals in this lifetime and can do level ivtype arc break assessments if they can bridge the comm gap with the pc there is one case that cannot be patched up well at levels ii and iii case that has been run badly on r4 that has been thoroughly loused up can only be remedied by having class iv auditor straighten it all up you could prepcheck or analyze wrong goal and find out what it is and perhaps where it belongs etc any case that has had goals run would probably do very well with list 4 and case analysis to sort things out and slip them back into line the bank is full of pictures but the gpms are what need to be sorted out and gotten rid of at lower levels you dont disturb the gpms as rule as you go up you get closer to them until at level iii with service facs you could get rocketreading goal which you may or may not be welladvised to do anything with since it may be the fifth goal back everyones ability to create is so good that they can keep creating whole bank they underestimate their own power to create and stop themselves people get stuck in their own mazes and are now lost in their own creations they will never sort themselves out of the maze by themselves they dont want to be this way even though they are creating what entraps them every now and then thetan in the betweenlives area tries to sort out the stuff but this stuff is all subitsa and without meter or anyone to itsa it to it is hopeless even now knowing all about the gpms one couldnt make it without body or meter cf the buddhist conception that the only condition from which one can reach enlightenment is that of being in human body lrh has tried meterless systems but none has ever succeeded an auditor is necessary because thetan restimulated by his own bank cant see it but an auditor not restimulated can see it with an emeter as an auditor you must realize how slight the barriers are in fact until r4m2 longer seems difficult or complicated to you lrh knows that auditing at this level can happen because he has been through it all the way from the complication to the simplicity so you start at the top and start going back goaloppose ris ris ris making mistakes when things go all weird you straighten it all out and come back up to pt with it all aligned there are different types and styles of auditing but keep in mind the fact that it is the same bank matter what level or what pc you are auditing level iii is the only level that is really dicey since you are moving ris and gpms around in your search for service facs you can audit the only reason you feel you cant is because of difficulties that you conceive to existtape

zones of auditing and applied scientology 1 basic auditing 2 case analysis 3 routine 4 so there are three zones of expertise which you should recognize as separate areas of performance to be expert the auditor must be good in all three zones someone could do technique perfectly but lacking basic auditing and understanding of what the mind consists of he will not get anywhere lrhs auditing is perfectly mechanical and bythebook doing r4 he goes along doing it until the pc either gets to the end of the processing cycle or until the pc has fallen on his head in the latter case he becomes case analyst using different set of data namely how do banks go together the pc can say anything he likes about the situation as long as there is ta when the pc is done the case analyst goes looking for why the list is misbehaving having done an analysis the auditor knows that the accuracy of the analysis is subject to question because of the charge on the case so any charge gotten off will make more accurate analysis possible until all charge is gone only factors that are present now are analyzed former analysis is relied on analysis is valid after its date of inception because more charge may meanwhile have been taken off the case the accuracy of case analysis depends on the pcs ability to itsa so caseanalyses shift they are always conditional and timespecific there is trick of not speaking invalidatively while not buying something the pc is selling the pc says that x is his goal you say fine ill check it out calls the goal im sorry that didnt read in case analysis you look at the source that you got list from as well as the possibility that the pc was arc broken or not answering the auditing question etc when you find the right answer you will get some ta action it will correct to something like it should be when you reach that point you go back to being an auditor being mechanical etc and you give the question you go back to what you were doing you never wear both hats at the same time just wear the hat that is needed at the time there is one hat that you wear all the time the basic auditing hat lacking that it doesnt matter how good you are at the other two basic auditing is giving someone something to talk about letting him talk letting him know that he has said it when he has and running an emeter all the while the basic auditing hat includes 1 trs acknowledge at the end of the complete cycle of action if the answer involves only one itsa ack at the end of one itsa if it occurs after fifty itsas ack after 50 itsas 2 the auditors code 3 metering 4 itsa line handlingall basic auditing actions are coordinated with the pc there are four elements to what happened in session 1 what the pc did 2 what the auditor did 3 what the bank did 4 what the meter did the auditors actions in the session are relatively unimportant the most unseen character in the world is an auditor in session he is about as visible as drop of water in stream this is an almost perfect example of thetan with mass the important actions in the session are the performance of the pc the pcs bank and the emeter the auditors actions only matter to the degree that they interfered with the pcs actions an auditors actions can be anything so long as they are not destructive to the session an auditor runs mostly on lack of action auditing is third dynamic activity the auditor merely runs it basic auditing is like the firebox of the ships engine thetech is like the generating equipment the big engine is the bank this is not so great an analogy all an arc break means is that something has gone wrong in the case analysis department not in the basic auditing department wrong goal found can be listed smooth as silk but any later slip will produce an arc break basic auditing can always be improved it is not bunch of dos and donts it is thetan sitting in the auditing chair running the pc and the pcs bank verifying it on the meter and keeping up both the small and the large auditing cycles there are rules or tricks in it anywhere that solve all its problems because it is not complicated action you make it far more complicated than it is the zone of auditing called r4 mentioned earlier in the lecture p 539 above is really technique of any sort these three zones of auditing apply at lower levels too in the same order of use and importance basic auditing then technique and case analysis if you get confused in your own mind about whats what you will think that you need new technique when your technique is fine but your basic auditing is out you think that you are being trained as auditors when in actuality you are simply being untrained from all the complications which during the vast vistas of time you have accumulated with regard to human relationships and minds person believes that if he takes too much responsibility for one of these sectors it is liable to go wrong that is just because he is unconfident the think on it is it is best to let the pc run the session because hidden datum if anything goes wrong then it isnt really my fault and this is called making the pc selfdetermined or the opposite think can occur the pc doesnt know what he is talking about he will get himself in trouble and i will be to blame so therefore i had better do everything in the session and not permit the pc to do anything in the session because if you depend on the pc that will make him guilty and that is like blaming the pc you really shouldnt do that so we will relieve the pc of all responsibility we will get our itsa from the meter but what is all this worry about it going wrong an effort not to have wrongness is not session there is very little to teach in basic auditing there is the pcs attention line you keep it on some area of the bank until he has said all that is there and when he is finished you see that he is and you tell him that he is done you can produce ta action with do birds fly with good basic auditing surprisingly enough auditing is doing basic auditing running process and having an analysis of the case that justifies running the process and that tells you when the process is flat auditing is these three departments the most important part of the session is the pc the next most important part is the pcs bank the next is the meter and its verification of what is going on and the least visible part though the most important part as far as the beingness of the session is concerned is the auditora session is an irreplacable section of time that will never occur again so what happens in the session is important the important questions for session are 1 what actually happened in the session 2 was there ta action 3 was the pcs ability to itsa and confront improved 4 was the pcs bank straightened out those are the important things not whether you appear in session in costume so long as when you appear in session your appearance doesnt impede the session appearance is only important in that it could be distracting or disturbing basic auditing training is simply the average action best calculated to produce result in session with minimal impedance of session gain there is completely proper auditing action except as measured against these elements all your selfcriticism is badly spent it is whether you produce results that really matters6311c07 shspec322 relationship of training to ot you are very fortunate people to come all the way down the track having done all those stupid things and to wind up here with chance out the chance is as good as you can audit and not bit better the number of rawmeat pcs that will go out through the roof is nonexistent unless they become fully trained auditors they wont make it the raw meat case is very easy to audit but what you are doing is auditing the charge off the top ris scientologist appears to be tougher case because the charge is off of those you will have to find the two top ris now and go on down the bank you cant go on and run the bank on someone who hasnt clue about his mind who doesnt know what is there frontwards and backwards the pcs ris only disintegrate when found in their right locations even though they can be found out of position so dont worry about case getting messed up by ris being found in the wrong place goals which have already been run can mess things up all you can do if an ri or gpm has been run is to date them even after you have run an ri you can verify it by dating the reason for this is that in running it you pulled it little out of its own timesphere so you can still get bit of bang on dating it and reorienting it you are just getting the idea of it which is still there in position the mass is already gone sooner or later someone will take lot of clay and work out the mind with the pc an unusually smart pc who will get it and go on being audited with understanding but this will be very rare occurrence getting someone to be responsible for session occurs on gradient the people who start on an hca course etc are already preselected just by the fact that they enrolled any of them including any upperlevel auditor including lrh gets nervous over pcs wondering if the ta is moving the pc doing ok etc that is to be expected people who persist into upper levels of training are further predetermined by their willingness to continue in the face of struggle and disappointment there is an additional problem where do you take over the pcs itsa so as to allow him to itsa just enough neither cutting it short nor letting the pc wander around mucking things up these points vary from pc to pc and with the same pc as he gets more able some pcs have good perception and if they say it is so it probably is so with other pcs you can count on it that if they say its _______ it isnt you should be increasing the pcs perception of and confront on his own bank so as the pc gets closer to ot you should have him in good enough shape so that he can perceive what is there to be run next where you can deduce change in the pc you are of course changing the values by which you audit also the pcs itsa can deteriorate if he has had some loses and the case is going sideways and backwards you will have to take over more responsibility for directing his attention until he is fixed up cases are always different from one moment to the next lowlevel cases run on fat they have charge leaking out of their ears when you have gotten off the fat that exists on the two top ris you have got the whole bank to deal with now you have to be genius to find some fat to get off the case and the case is more likely to get arc broken from the aspect of cleaning cleans this makes you very good auditor what happens when someone is in the position of doing r4 they are probably somewhat trained by now but they will need more training the surest way to get to be ot is to be highly trained auditor for various reasons including the aplomb that it takes to confront the bank case is on its way to ot when the first gpm has been run out this can take up to two years after finding the first not necessarily the most recent goal running out that first top gpm is more hell for the pc than anything the thetan has thought of confronting and this is true for several reasons the state of the technology the hazards of the auditing possible errors previous errors the lack of the pcs perception of the pt gpm because of its pt restimulators etc etc raw meat not understanding what is happening wont put up with it they cant confront iteven though goal is an incorrect goal it could be that only its position is incorrect not its wording you can get wrong items wrong line plot for an implant gpm without turning off the rocket read but if you take an actual gpm and try to run it on an implant pattern it turns off the rocket read right now and it turns off any other meter phenomena as well there is another horrible datum an actual goal invalidated will now behave like wrong goal it will turn on the same creaks as really wrong goal the pc will arc break the same way it will read as wrong goal it will turn off arc breaks when indicated and so forth so now after you do case analysis prepcheck everything found so that you dont discard an actual goal it is possible that wrong goal sufficiently asserted and validated might behave like right goal one thing will still be the case any actually wrong goal or an actual goal run as an implant goal will turn off the rocket read within two or three items this saves you from running wrong goal you wont have any rocket read to run it with what is dangerous is that an actual goal thoroughly invalidated will be consistently discarded by the auditor he and the pc agree that to spit is wrong goal and they continue looking for the next gpm in line or the pt gpm but they will never find it many are called and few ever hit the top of the bank these are the sorts of errors that can occur and that make r4 hell for pc and auditor nothing will make it easier because that is happening with all the data the besttrained auditor and the most educated pcs r4 takes high degree of skill compounded with phenomenal degree of luck with hindsight one can see how things got off the track but as one proceeds one is walking in the dark with thousandth of millimeter peephole what takes time in r4 is the mistake the worse r4 goes the harder it gets for the pc and the auditor to see what is the true state of affairs however dont put attention on not making mistakes because the effort not to make mistakes will produce mistakes directly and indirectly most of the auditing time is consumed in handling mistakes and most of the mistakes you make are in trying not to make mistakes anything that can make meter go out or any condition that can get you an erroneous read is then susceptible to throwing out case analysis and your own efforts to straighten out case analysis are susceptible to throwing out case analysis and case analysis can be wrong in the first place ok those are the nerves with which you live so the only questions for case analysis and the only points of randomity should be 1 exactly what is happening with this bank that i am handling 2 exactly how is it going together 3 what are the contributive data i have with which to make up my mind about the situations in this bank so you have to have basic auditing and techniques down to the noattention state because there are enough hazards and difficulties in case analysis so that you have attention to spare for anything else the ideal scene with the auditor and the pc is still going to be porcupine juggling act you should be able to think bank so as to be able to parallel the pcs mind well enough to figure out what is happening with the bank in front of you that is plenty to confront and handle therefore training is vital part of becoming an ot thus in the short run many are called but few are chosen though eventually all can make it by the training routehubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 november ad13 central orgs franchise routine 3 r3 model session revised amended from hco b of may 21 ad13 here is the new routine 3 model session as outlined in hco bulletin may 13 ad13 all other model sessions are canceled herewith this form is to be used in all auditing in the future session preliminaries all auditing sessions have the following preliminaries done in this order 1 seat the pc and adjust his or her chair 2 clear the auditing room with is it all right to audit in this room not metered 3 can squeeze squeeze the cans please and note that pc registers by the squeeze on the meter and note the level of the pcs havingness dont run hav here 4 put in r factor by telling pc briefly what you are going to do in the session start of session 5 is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running owif it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttons here is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds has anything been suppressed is there anything you have been careful of is there anything you have failed to reveal has anything been invalidated has anything been suggested has any mistake been made is there anything you have been anxious about has anything been protested has anything been decided has anything been asserted in using the first three buttons suppressed careful of and failed to reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds usesince the last time you were audited has withhold been missed on you since the last time you were audited is there anything someone failed to find out about you since the last time you were audited has someone nearly found out something about you body of session 8 now go into the body of the session end body of session9 is it all right with you if we end the body of the session now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do so end of the body of the session smooth out session 10 smooth out any roughness in the session if there has been any favouring suppress failed to reveal protest decide overts assert using prefix in this session goals gains 11 have you made any of these goals for this session thank you for making these goals or thank you for making some of these goals im sorry you didnt make all of them or im sorry you didnt make these goals have you made any other gains in this session that you would care to mention thank you for these gains or im sorry you didnt make any gains havingness 12 after adjusting the meter please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not all right the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response ending session 13 is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session 14 is it all right with you if i end this session now 15 end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast but it is all necessary the random rudiment here is what happened session mid ruds are simply protest assert and decide ri rudiments are suppress and invalidate arc break handling is in accordance with hco bulletin of march 14 1963 dont continue session until you find out why the arc

dirty needle if its dirty needle its cause lies in basic auditing not in technique errors this rule is invariable the apparent exception is the session arc break that keys in by passed technique charge example pc has wrong goal session arc break caused by cleaning clean on the meter this keys in wrong goal auditor does an l4 arc break assessment over dirty needle finds wrong goal pc brightens up bit auditor thinks he has found all the by passed charge but actually continues session with somewhat gloomy pc whose needle occasionally gets dirty the session arc break was left in place this makes the auditor think wrong goal can cause dirty needle the heavy charge keyed in and that had to be gotten fast was the wrong goal but the session ii arc break caused the dirty needle an auditor whose basic auditing is poor who qs and as cuts itsa invalidates or evaluates or who misses meter reads on rudiments or prepchecks or cleans cleans or misses withholds can be spotted by his pcs dirty needle its an invariable sign if the pc has dirty needle the basic auditing of the auditor is bad that auditor ought to put one of his sessions on tape and listen to it and analyze it as per the earlier hco bulletin oddly enough an auditor could run perfect technique on goals and yet be so poor in basic auditing that the pc is always arc breaking this would be spotted by the pcs chronically

franchise all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysis all processing can be broken down into three separate parts for any level of auditing these three parts are 1 basic auditing 2 technique and 3 case analysis basic auditing the handling of the pc as being the auditing cycle the meter comprise the segment of processing known as basic auditing if an auditor cannot handle this segment or any part of it well trouble will develop in the other two segments technique and case analysis when technique and case analysis seem to fail even when done by the book the fault commonly lies in basic auditing one or more of the five faults elsewhere listed will be present and these faults effectively prevent any technique or case analysis from working where scientology isnt working the wrong first places to look are technique and case analysis the right place to look is basic auditing until an auditor can handle pc in session easily handle meter smoothly and accurately and is flawless in his auditing cycle he or she should have hope of making any technique work or of analyzing any case for anything in smooth basic auditing lies the open sesame to all cases for only then do technique and case analysis function the gun barrel is basic auditing technique and case analysis form the ammunition and sight poor basic auditor using fine technique is firing ammunition with gun it doesnt go anywhere there is level of basic auditing for every level of scientology at the lowest level it is only the ability to sit and listen it grows in complexity from there up to the fabulous co ordination of pc auditing cycle and meter so flawless that neither auditor nor pc are aware of the presence of basic auditing at all but only the actions of the technique and the guidance of case analysis and between those two practices of basic auditing lie many gradients basic auditing is the rock on which all gains are built technique the techniques of scientology are many spread out over 13 years of developmenta technique is process or some action that is done by auditor and pc under the auditors direction the lowest technique is the single coaudit question given by the supervisor to let the pc itsa the highest is the complex listing of goals and gpms technique is patterned action invariable and unchanging composed of certain steps or actions calculated to bring about tone arm action and thus better or free thetan there have been thousands of techniques less than hundred at guess are in common recommended use for the various levels of auditing techniques have their place in various levels of auditing today rather than various differences of case as cases may be audited only at the level in which they are trained by modern ruling and as several techniques exist at each level for choice out of case analysis it will be found quite simple to select technique and get results with it safe auditing and good sense dictate such selection and classing of techniques and trouble only results when someone sells himself out of his level to high fast flounder techniques exist in tables and texts for the various levels and it will be found that these give the best case results applied in that way case analysis case analysis establishes two things what is going on with the case and b what should be done with it case analysis is new subject to auditors at this time it is commonly confused with techniques and the gravest fault is treating case analysis as only another assessment technique there is level of case analysis for every level or class to compare with the basic auditing and technique of that class my first development in this new segment of processing was programming this is the consecutive techniques or actions case should have to get adequate tone arm action and achieve new plateau of ability but case analysis itself has steps like and b above there is also an invariable sequence of application in more advanced case analysis these steps should be very very well known by trained auditor since all case analysis fits into them 1 discover what the pc is sitting in 2 have the pc detail what assumptions and considerations he or she has had about it and 3 identify it fully and correctly the it above can be as slight as worry as bothersome as present time problem or as overwhelming as goals problem mass whatever it is the case analysis steps would be the samein the first step the survey may be very brief it should certainly have certainty in it for the pc it can be very general it can be part of case or geographical location the pc could be clear or insane the sequence or the 3 steps would be the same the next step 2 gets the lies off giving ta action and thus clearing away charge for more accurate assault in 3 this second step can be very lengthy as in level two or very brief as in ot auditing techniques but it must exist whether short or long otherwise the analysis is heavily hindered by the lies and these will read on the meter and upset the analysis or they will cloud the pcs perception on which all itsa depends so the lies must come off in any case analysis usually this is quite permissive and gently done but it can amount to also pulling missed withholds it all depends on the level on which the analysis is being done and what is being analyzed this step 2 becomes itself technique at lower levels it is just spatter and promise at high level auditing the third step can be long or short but must always be there here with the charge gone in 2 the auditor and pc can now identify the thing much better and the pc can have final certainty on it usually at lower levels the certainty is only that it is gone the familiar how do you feel about that problem now what problem is lower level result of case analysis at the highest level on checking the meter i find that is wrong item would be the auditors final 3 statement so case analysis at any level has as its action establishing what the pc is in what it has been supposed to be and what it now is or isnt anything from habit to headache could be analyzed in this way at the lowest levels it could occupy an intensive at the highest levels five minutes arc break handling has been the most familiar tool of case analysis case analysis handles the momentary or prolonged problem determines the technique to be used and is always done with basic auditing an auditor has three hats one is his basic auditors hat this he never takes off the other two are his technique hat and his case analysis hat and these he switches back and forth at need these are the three segments put together well they make successful auditing l ron hubbard lrh drrd copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6317c27 shspec330 tvd 25 auditing demo and comments by lrh lrh critiques three student tvds during and after the tvds the sessions are ruds and havingness sessions if pc gives himself the auditing question he is selfauditing so the auditor should reassert control by giving the question half dial havingness isnt enough the needle should bounce twice for saint hill student if the havingness isnt that good then it is too low for the pc to be audited the pc is hungry tired has ptps or mainly he has withholds so run some ow run havingness and fix it up missed withholds cause low havingness as well as environmental and other causes on auditing in general modern faults fall under not knowing model session well enough letting the pc itsa is one thing but sitting silently and inviting itsa without having asked question is another there is happy medium between cutting the pcs itsa and doing nothing at all you clean clean by sitting and looking at pc who has nothing to say or who has said all or when you havent asked question the pc will arc break failures in basic auditing are the usual reason for progress of case you cannot apply technique in the absence of basic auditing6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing this is combined lecture and demonstration to show the presence of auditing and what basic auditing is auditors have misunderstood what itsa is giving rise to awful results they are getting their pcs to draw pictures giving the pc nothing to do and handling nothing the place to get your basic auditing together is at class ii basic auditing handles the pc handles the session handles the auditing comm cycle and handles the meter regardless of what else is occurring it is different at class ii than at class iv lrh has been improving his own auditing for the past few months basic auditing should be very smooth lrh has been improving his basic auditing in the area of observing the pc to see when he has said all that he is going to say then acknowledging him one can play it safe by saying nothing but that is cleaning clean comm lagging inviting more itsa when there is nothing there stringing out bunch of unnecessary acknowledgments is also comm lag keep the session rolling that is what gets good ta just sitting there listening is level i auditing it doesnt work at higher levels lrh found that he was causing the pcs dirty needle he also found that he had to increase the pcs ability to itsa by using the meter to get information only when the pc couldnt supply it he found that it is necessary to remain silent while the ta is in fast motion but one doesnt wait after that to see if the ta will move again at level vi the motion you get after the bd on an item is coming from the next level taking up and handling the pcs problems at session start during the session or at end of session is part of basic auditing basic auditing is 1 getting the pc to itsa 2 promoting and increasing the pcs itsa by letting the pc find data not relying on the meter to do it however dont give the pc the feeling that he is getting help 3 not talking while the ta is in fast motion but not waiting for the ta to stop jumping around 4 handling any ptps at session start as they arise or at session end the tvd tape follows with lrh auditing msh the tape is intended to show basic auditing as well as technique it starts out with ruds then gets into goaloppose list lrh finds the pcs pt goal finds where the pc is in the gpm and finds her top terminal he finds the wrong top oppterm technical note the top oppterm of the pt gpm unlike any other in the whole bank should blow up and shouldnt keep on reading it should just go and it didnt so the auditor knows by now that it is wrong item since it didnt blow and that the pc is selling it so here we get into tremble and scramble the pc is getting arc breaky because the pc has wrong item if you missed the itsa once here you would get screaming arc break because the out session rud would key in the bpc of the ot process they do some more work with the top oppterm pc still wont agree that the top oppterm is incorrect however they do verify the correct terminal listing it straightened it out the top oppterm turned out to be being disobedientlrh points out the basic auditing of the session letting the pc itsa not leaving the pc with nothing to itsa the pc should have been arc broken by taking the wrong top oppterm and abandoning the right terminal the pcs ability to itsa is the road out keep the session driven keep it going take action promote and increase the pcs itsa it is the auditors job to make session out of it6312c05 shspec327 basic auditing some of the data in this tape is also to be found in hcob 26nov63 all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysis the problems of auditing are divided into three categories 1 basic auditing 2 technique 3 case analysis technique means the exact patter and procedure for getting something audited on the pc we have dug up lots of old processes all of them are still valid except mockup processes processes like spot three spots in your bodyin the room run long enough tend to exteriorize people another exteriorization process is where arent you these processes are ok if they are not run to exteriorization exteriorizing someone tends to result in his coming back into his body more solidly because he becomes alarmed he is unstable this occurs at higher levels eg levels v or vi the pc tends to come back in and hold harder actually what upsets him is the energy masses that he is going through which exert certain emotional responses upon him the liability of these old lowerlevel processes is that they run the pc into gpms and can pull ris out of line eg the liability of tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting is that you could run into the ri forgetting but such an occurrence is very rare people coming up through level iii are in the charge of the top ris but they are getting destimulated as they get more oriented and wiser in their environments just remember when running repetitive process that there is some danger of restimulating an ri especially if the process has fancy or oddball wording you even run this risk at level i when you ask what solutions have you had to that since the track is just series of solutions what saves your bacon is the pcs lack of reality on other lifetimes starting at level iii you would be wise to preface processes with in this lifetime do this for sure at level iv since the pcs awareness has come up and he will slip back on the track pretty easily your main problem will be the manic at level i who insists on running only past track this came up in elizabeth nj with the first foundation when couple of coauditors could only find pastlife engrams to run on each other joe winter parker morgan and john campbell tried to pass motion to make research on or mention of past lives offlimits because it had bad public presence they found out then that lrh could get mad public presence has nothing to do with the truth there is such thing as acceptable truth that is really just lie there is room in pr or public image for truth pr is nice but dont build on it build on truth with most pcs any attempt to go backtrack before their ptps are handled will produce nothing but disaster you are asking them to confront big new datum when they cant even confront their environment most processing failures come from the attempt to process someone higher then his class the classifications are laid out on gradient scale of increasing responsibility for self and the dynamics the processes laid out in any given class form gradient scale too plotted against increasing responsibility so it starts with motivators and ends with overts all this is still techniques the programming of techniques is based on case analysis every level has its own case analysis the three basic steps of case analysis are 1 find out what the pc is sitting in2 get the pc to tell you about it fully get any lies off 3 handle it by locating and indicating charge as accurately as possible that is the pattern that you would use at any level this delivers the whole world of healing to us it was research target set last january and it has been met at level i this could consist of getting the person to talk about some illness that they have had at levels ii and iii you would find what incident the person was sitting in in dianetics this was done with an ageflash at level vi it is done with all the tech of case analysis asking if it is an actual gpm an implant gpm etc at level 0 it is how do you feel today what have you done about it do you feel better as pc runs actual gpms the subitsa and the pcs ability to itsa come closer and closer together on case analysis they fold over about half way to ot where the pcs ability to itsa surpasses the meter if the pc doesnt say itsa the meter wont read the meter depends on mass and shortcircuits in the mass you will eventually reach point where the person is self determined enough that unless they think it it isnt so somewhere along the line you will also run into their recognition that they are creating all the mass what you will do there hasnt been worked out you will have to get across it and back to the beginning and the earliest postulates with regard to the making of mass and the creation of all this type of bank it is rough go unless your basic auditing is superb your basic auditing at levels ii and iii has to be magnificent because the pc doesnt know what you are talking about he has nomenclature he has reality on it he cant put these things together smoothly the whole burden therefore is on basic auditing on handling the pcs itsa improving the pcs itsa never give the itsa to the pc on the meter when he can give it to you dont refuse to check the meter if he asks but wean him off it the only things that vary in basic auditing are the addition of more complicated metering as you go up the levels note that at levels v and vi you never use sensitivity higher than 8 other wise the needle is too loose improving ones basic auditing is the way to improve the amount of ta that one gets given particular technique used dirty needles come solely from out basic auditing see hcob 25nov63 dirty needles on level vi the ta moves around so much that you cant wait until the ta stops to say something you have to talk when it slows down the pc will get heat during bds which will be suppressed if you talk so that you will have to get the suppress off the heat to get it to turn on again if there is nothing going on it is up to the auditor to start something if there is something going on with the pc then there is need for the auditor to start something at the upper levels basic auditing had better be as free from attention as walking this sounds obvious but it is horribly true youve got plenty to do with the meter you dont have time to record ta except when you give the question and when the ta blows down when the pc gives the item apart from that you need ta counter to keep record of it just dont move the ta while the pc is moving around or you will get falsely high count youve got to stop the needle at set with your thumb in order not to cut the pcs itsa while centering the needle you will put in comm lag if you delay while centering it and the pcs attention will go to the meter there are numerous tricks that you can do with meters for instance you can brake the needle to stop it from wobbling know the needle well enough to be able to spot missed withhold without asking for it or to repair havingness without having to run any by getting the pc to spot what upset his havingness etc you can know ta behavior well enough to spot trouble before it arrives so that you are not startled when the pc erupts at level vi technique is an alldevouring monster you can spare attention for the meter or for basic auditing aspects such as the comm cycle there is zenith on how good your basic auditing can getyou could probably make some mistakes with techniques and case analysis not many but you cant afford to make any mistakes with basic auditing especially if you do make mistake in another area nothing very serious will happen to pc because of technique or case analysis errors especially below level vi but basic auditing errors will pitch the pc on his head the only serious things that can happen to pc occur because of out basic auditing pcs feel badly when basic auditing is out invalidation is the only way to turn on somatics at level vi ot processes are as rough as there is invalidation it isnt that items turn on pain it is that if you invalidate right item or goal the pc can get good and sick this makes the steps of case analysis mandatory but if your basic auditing is in such that the pcs itsa is in you are less likely to make these mistakes because the pcs opinion and knowingness are consulted the greatest dividend you can get from training is improvement of your basic auditing to point where you can relax and get technique and case analysis to hum get it perfected and your tone arm motion will triple6312c12 shspec329 summary of ot processes this is fast and rapid summary of ot processes this is matter of record not so much matter of education this gives the record of the final technology of bank running which is now complete and unvarying the technology is very precise it is extremely crisp you do not vary from it some pcs become fixated on parts of the bank and argue with you about structure for instance seeing two ris the pc may think that he has two and only two gpms there are variations as far as which implants someone could have someone might not have the helatrobus implants for instance but everyone on this planet has the train implant there is whole set of implants around trillions 2 which are similar to the helatrobus implants and for which we dont have the pattern you can get variations at level v but none at level vi or the person wouldnt be here one person has not made different types of actual gpms than another you dont get variations at level vi but lack of data and an overburdened case could bring about an apparent difference in the case the differences are only mistakes made by the auditor andor the pc every actual gpm is similar to every other actual gpm in basic composition the goal as an ri is always the first ri in the bank it then runs on up the line on solve basis not on an oppose basis each item is problem with its opposite item going on up the bank but those masses are actually very huge spheres they are all the accumulated energies that anyone ever had anything to do with on this particular subject they have been lived through and they have been accumulated now an actual gpm has varying numbers of ris on the middle track the gpms have 16 to 18 ris in them late on the track closer to pt they go to 22 to 24 ris each one has crossover the middle pair of ris if gpm has 20 ris at number ten you will generally get the crossover the crossover is very important that is where the pc ceases to be for the goal and starts to be against it on the oppterm side you get progression up through the crossover point from the bottom oppterm which is dead opposed to the goal to the top oppterm which is dead for the goal and on the terminal side you have the goal as an ri at the bottom and it progresses up to the crossover for the goal and then on gradient scale goes against the goal the top terminal of actual gpm is dead against the goal if the goal were to be strong the top terminal would be something like weak or being weak that pattern has to be understood or the pc will get in trouble the patterns are all similar matter what the gpms position on the time track is as you go earlier on the track however there is this change you get more items for the goal ie the crossover point drifts higher but the position of the crossover is also monitored by whether the pc as thetan liked the goal or not the crossover would occur very near the bottom of gpm whose goal the pc detests eg to be obedient you can have the crossover appear almost at the goal on goal that the pc detests perhaps in the first couple or three pairs but this is not an important eccentricity dont be alarmed by it that is the only variation in cross over another variation in actual gpms is that earlier on the track the time span for gpm is longer eg modern gpm could span only billion years an early gpm could span trillions 20 to trillions 30 years there are about as guess 26 gpms in bank very few the closesttopt gpm can be expected to be truncated which makes it difficult to enter the track because the pt gpm may have any number of items in it in case analysis you can only count on what blows down the ta the emeter is not wholly reliable here the meter is only of relative use if all is perfectly correct on the meter you have chance of being right gpm when found will read but not forever it does give you nice long rocket reads and blowdowns when you find it but dont expect it to read forevernow the pt gpm being truncated will have less than full complement of ris which makes it hard to find its top the present gpm has some top short of total attainment of the goal on the oppterm side and short of total opposition to the goal on the terminal side how short is the pt gpm dont cut your throat if you find after 75 hours that it only had two ris or if you find that it is really the second gpm and is there in full you may not find out that this is the case until you reach the eighth gpm you cannot be sure that you have the pt gpm or any other particular gpm you do the best you can and always suspect that there are more ris into pt once the thing can be repaired and you are getting charge off all the way it is not fatal to make mistakes in doing this but dont underestimate the ability of these processes to nearly kill the pc if mishandled say you skipped two gpms and started to run out the one below it the pc would feel like hell pc never feels worse than on r4 done wrong but he can live through it it is the auditor who is in danger wrongly worded gpm will shut off the rr the pt gpm is the one you are working for but it may not show up until you have run an earlier gpm the programming is done only one way in running these things that is you find the pt gpm you find its top terminal you list the top terminal for two items the first oppterm and the second oppterm from the second oppterm you get the solves it by asking who or what would it solve and you go on down the bank so it is always the same you find the pt gpm you run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm and get its top oppterm and then run all items out of it and find the next gpm etc until you get to the beginning of the time track you can cut in and find the second gpm first by accident and find out later on that it is the second gpm and then by doing goal oppose of it you can find the actual first gpm but that is at the risk of the game that is just fixing mistake properly you find the pt gpm or something that you could believe was the pt gpm you then run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm you get its top oppterm and run all items out of it then you go on down the bank to the beginning of track and that is the only program that is successful taking any gpm that fires and then trying to goaloppose it to pt is not hard to do it is impossible you end up with messedup track you do this same program on every case including cases that have had goals found and run out in various ways you start with listing for the pt gpm what is your present time actual gpm this can be long list it follows goals list format when you get fifty items past the last rr seen on listing and you are getting ta while listing the gpm is on that list somewhere and you find it by elimination this sounds impossible but this pattern has been successful whenever tried pcs come up with the pt gpm every time of course it has to be an educated pc if not you dont have prayer it takes terrific stability on the part of the pc to hang in there when things get tight an untrained person wouldnt stand for it it is not that he couldnt be gotten into it but he will panic when things go wrong and he feels terrible he wont have the security of knowing that he can get out of what he got into it is basically understanding that will carry him through here is tabulated summary of the r4 procedure as outlined in this tape 1 do pt goals list and get goal list for the pt gpm using what is your present time actual gpm you use goalslisting procedure that is you list fifty items past the last rr seen on listing if the ta is all run out then the list is complete you then find the item by elimination 2 try to count the number of ris in the pt gpm then plot it up accordingly and observe where the top of this gpm sits in relation to the crossover point eg say youve got 12 risthen you know that the top pair is one pair past crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal 3 find the top terminal by listing what terminal are you sitting in now 4 list two lists from this same top terminal to get the top oppterm and the second oppterm of this truncated gpm charge will expire on the top oppterm so then you will get the second oppterm because that is the way the pattern progresses going down into the bank after getting the top oppterm list ww wd solve top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm 5 solve this across and continue to the bottom of the gpm 6 do goaloppose list to find the goal of the second gpm using goalslisting procedure 7 take the goal as an ri from the pt gpm and list who or what would it solve to find the top oppterm of the second gpm 8 take this top oppterm and list who or what would solve the top oppterm to get the top terminal of the second gpm 9 solve it across to get the second oppterm of the second gpm 10 run all the items out of that gpm in similar manner and continue on down the bank using steps 6 to 10 above to the beginning of the track it is the pc who comes up with the answers he finds out what is going wrong if you can get off any bpc he will start giving you some good data about what has gone wrong eg the pcs next gpm is found but wont read so gpm has been missed there is so much inval on the goal that it reads as wrong goal so the pc says that some inval is present so the auditor prepchecks the goal and on the rocket read comes and off they go but repair is too complex to do without help from the pc however pc can sell an item and if the auditor buys it it can land the pc in the soup also if the rr doesnt pack up in the first five items down the bank dont let the pc sell you on the idea that it is wrong goal wrongly worded or misworded lrh once let pc sell him on the idea that goal was wrong goal he listed and found two new goals without realizing that the pc had merely gotten into dramatization of one of the items of the goals gpm and therefore so despised this goal that the pc wanted nothing to do with this goal rule if it is running all right keep running dont make trouble until trouble happens since it is trouble that consumes session time take up trouble as it comes if the pc does get in trouble dont try to force the pc on stop and find out what is wrong and fix it otherwise you can invalidate goals and items and make them read like wrong goals and items the read you get on listing actual gpm items and goals is like nothing you have seen elsewhere it is not an rr and it is not fall and it is not anything else you have seen elsewhere tick will never be the item the real item hits rubber bumper and forces its way through like breaking through stone wall and then falls on through to bd these are item reads only an item read looks that way nothing else does it goes the whole dial and brings about blowdown the rule in itemfinding is to list as long as the pc wants to list and then find the item on the early part of the list that has variation the item could be wrongly worded early on the list and reappear correctly worded later on the list so that it looks as though it actually appears later on the list the item lists are short especially compared to most goals lists you might have shorter goals lists however when the pc gets pretty educated he can spot the goal right away the meter blows up heat comes off etc etc here is an example of an lrh bank the goaloppose question who or what would destroy oppose gave the next goal which was to worship to create was rocketreading implant gpm worship had nothing to do with religion it was too early the earlier you go on the track the simpler and more direct the goals and items are as you go later the items get more dispersive and complicated items like certainty and predictability and solved by unpredictability it will be less neat pattern the thetan is thinking more complexly more involvedly he is in more dispersed state on the middle and back track the thetan is simpler as you get back to the middle track word like the goal appears in 80 of the items on earlier track word with the sense of the goal appears in almost 100 of the items close to pt you get tremendous variation in items and more complex goals that are hard to get oppositions to with the goal almost never appearing in the items the hard end of the track is the pt end the thetan has less scope the gap is less wide between opposites there is more dispersion the thetan is nattery picky and so forth you can see the dwindling spiral of the thetan as you look over these gpms the chances are far against getting simple goals in pt middle track goals are simple when you get two or three gpms back you start getting simpler goals on the middle track for instance you get goals like to do to think to postulate in later gpms there are more items and greater complexity the items disperse more quickly from the basic goal area as was said earlier the goal word appears less frequently in the items but the pattern doesnt change the top oppterm is definitely the goal and the top terminal is definitely against the goal the hard things to list are the top terminal and the bottom oppterm thats shootin into the blue the top terminal is very often but not always controlled by the goal that you are about to get ie the next goal up the top terminal may or may not be similar to the next goal it could be quite disrelated you can get fooled here the pattern might not hold eg the next goal might be the goal to postulate and the top terminal might be sitting you cant predict the top terminal except that it is opposite to the goal of the gpm that it is in the bottom oppterm is the reason he done it of course the real reason he done it is the gpm he just lived through but his particular penchant is usually expressed in the bottom oppterm because it is opposed by the goal as an ri the bottom oppterm is going to say what the person is mad at in the pt gpm like civilization or financial institutions this one is hard to get so the pc might miss it like mad the two bottom oppterms and the two top terminals in the gpm forecast some difficulty the toughest to get are the bottom oppterm and the top terminal how do you list one of these things first do your pt goals list and get goal then try to count the number of ris in that gpm the presumptive pt gpm then plot it up accordingly observe where it sits in relation to where the crossover point is say youve got twelve ris so you know that you are one pair past the crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal you can get the top terminal of the pt gpm by listing what terminal are you sitting in now if you want to ask why dont you list for the top oppterm it is the same as asking why dont you try to list the bank its the same question the pc doesnt know whats there relative to the top oppterm but he is sitting in and intimately connected with as himself this top terminal because that is the one that he is living through life in therefore it is easy to list for the top terminal so list for the top terminal and find it then list two lists from this same top terminal and get 1 the top oppterm 2 the second oppterm you are able to do this because charge will expire on the top oppterm when you have found it and therefore there wont be any more charge on this oppterm you then get the second oppterm because that is the way the bank progresses going down into the bank gpms always proceed downwards from the top oppterm why this pattern for running the gpm because if you get this higgledypiggledy in the first gpm you are going to be kittycorner from the oppterm to the next terminal below it and that doesnt solve the bank doesnt run that way and it doesnt solve that way and you will be in trouble so you get the two top oppterms 1 and 2 sometimes you almost wreck yourself by getting both opptermson the same list both firing but you really need two listings so you can tell which is which so after getting the top oppterm do who or what would solve the top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm solve it across and go on down the bank that way now items always solve goals always oppose never do goals solve list eg what goal would solve goal the goal as an ri sounds like goal but it is an item and that would be an item solve list for the next lower top oppterm so after you get the whole of the top bank now do goaloppose list to get the goal of the 2 gpm you now assess by elimination to get that goal thats the end of all oppositions until you are up to the point of getting the goal for the next gpm but you still have an unsolved ri which is the goal as an ri at the bottom of the top gpm opposing the goal as an ri is the most critical action in the whole operation take the goal as an ri and list who or what would it solve and get the top oppterm of the next gpm using nice beefy long list on this one that is the touchiest part of the bank if you get it wrong it will be wrong from then on out if you get wrong top oppterm you will go all over the place you will have the wrong gpm it is also the easiest to get wrong because it looks the simplest the top oppterm is the final achievement of the goal that you have just gotten from the goaloppose list the pc is now against it eg on goal to sneeze the top oppterm would be sneezing or people who sneeze or sneezers or having to sneeze etc if you get the top oppterm slightly misworded you have had it so do nice long top oppterm list you want 20 or 30 item list so dont take an item as the top oppterm just on the pcs sayso you can tangle the whole bank dont promote the pcs itsa on this one if you buy the pcs delighted itsa you are likely to get the third terminal from the bottom and get the whole bank upside down the other place where you disregard the pcs itsa is when you are halfway through gpm with the rr still on and he tells you that it is not his goal so get the list on listing for the top oppterm null it with the pcs attention on it ask which item had heat look around the area of that item on the list especially few items above the item that he mentioned see if you can get that area to read get the top oppterm and check it out mow be very careful when you get the top terminal the wording is critical the terminal has an opposite meaning to the bank at large when you have the two top ris make sure that both of them are absolutely correct before you go on the alternative is to get circular invalidation going where you are leaving wrong items behind you and listing from wrong items correcting and going ahead into messedup areas as you correct one item another gets messed up when you find wrong item behind you accept items that you found after you found the wrong item redo all the later lists the way you check out bank when looking for wrong item is to go back over it from the top reading the items off with mathematical precision with the session ruds in the wrong item that you left behind you will tick or rocketread that is proven rule if it reads it is wrong item invariably it is not that it wasnt opposed being wrong it reads and throws into question all succeeding items any items that occur after that if they are right are so merely by coincidence so you have to list again through muddiedup bank to correct the wrong item take the list you got it from and look earlier or later if it was the first or second item on the list or the list could be incomplete but two items reading in the same items list means nothing listing rules dont apply to items lists listing rules apply to goals lists and only to goals lists you can have six items reading on an item solve list and it doesnt mean that the list is incomplete one of the six reading items is the item and you dont continue the list on wrong goal everything you write down reads for awhile then nothing reads the only thing that shuts off an rr is wrong goal wrong item will not do so you can overrun the gpm and run into gpm for which you have goal the only thing that shuts off an rr is not having the goal what shuts down the rr is not having the goal and this is the only way to shut off an rr even slightly misworded goal will turn it off so if the rr continues youve got the right goal so relax and once you get your goal dont call it again until you get to the goal as an ri refer to it by number and dont use the wording how does this rirelate to the goal use how does this ri relate to this gpm or to gpm _______ the reason for this is that every time you call the goal you pull the goal as an ri up towards pt and disarrange the bank you save it so that if you have to use it later to prepcheck off inval in straightening things out you can or you might want to save it for use in later cleanup even then you still say the goal as little as possible if you are prepchecking gpm goal use on this goal dont keep repeating the goal as this will drive the pc to the bottom of the gpm there are lots of things to know lots of indicators but only few simple rules and they are dead on for instance you ask is this an actual gpm after you have found the goal you always check it out when you have run five or six gpms you get response on the meter until the pc says it then it reads as you go down the bank the items will read when the pc says it not when you call it at first when the case is unburdened with r3sc etc the sub itsa comes up towards the surface however further on down the line you lose the subitsa again the subitsa line reverses with the itsa line eventually basic auditing must be very well in and the pc must be easily auditable youve got to promote his confidence and itsa so that when you run out of the emeter the pc can handle it youve got to be able to talk to the pc and the pc has to be able to talk to you because in few cases itsa is all that you will have to guide you through the only thing that makes bad basic auditor is person who is afraid of becoming ot or who sees great deal of harm in being exteriorized or in being set adrift alone without body or the idea of setting people adrift or alone without body restimulates all those people that they have held down and stuck spears in the stomachs of that is exteriorization too someone whose basic auditing is poor at levels ii iii or iv will have it fly out at upper levels because he gets so restimulated at the idea of exteriorizing exterization restimulates murder so you get the idea that he doesnt deserve to be clear etc dont look for the significance to explain fear or terror of exteriorization it is just gpms shifting around and colliding caused by the thought of exteriorizing you can set someone up so they will do flawless basic auditing for one session by running ow this shows that they consider auditing to be an overt this was first tested in melbourne in 1960 there are arc breaky pcs there are only bad basic auditors the pc who is dangerous is the one who goes into propitiation or lower when arc broken such pc is harder to handle than one who screams any pc audited beyond an arc break will go into the sad effect you could audit the auditor on ow for short session and he would give flawless sessions this is very important tape the exact patter is on the demo tape of last wednesday probably 6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing pp 551552 above lrh also mentions color movie with all the tech in this area and

years ago auditor touches on and b goes into restim out of pcs consciousness this causes an irritated arc breaky upset feeling the pc reacts very badly he has been hit by mystery there is apparent reason to him why he feels this way this is what bypassed charge means earlier charge restimmed and not seen would be another name for it one handles it by noting the fact that it happened one tells the pc an earlier incident went into restimulation this usually cools it off l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1972 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 27 may 1963 cenocon franchise all auditing star rating hco bulletin for academies and shsbc cause of arc breaks lucky is the pc whose auditor has understood this hco bulletin and lucky is the auditor may his own case run well i have just narrowed the reason for arc breaks in auditing actions down to only one source rule all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge rule to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge charge can be bypassed by 1 going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic example looking for the pcs first automobile accident finding the fifth instead and trying to run the fifth accident as the first accident which it isnt the by passed charge here is the first accident and all succeeding accidents up to the one selected by the auditor as the first one or the one to run to greater or lesser degree depending on the amount the earlier material was restimulated the pc will then arc break or feel low or in low morale one can run later incident on chain briefly but only to unburden earlier incidents and the pc must know this 2 unknowingly ignoring the possibility of more basic or earlier incident of the same nature as that being run after the pc has been restimulated on it or bluntly refusing to admit the existence of or let the pc at an earlier incident 3 cleanly missing gpm as one between two goals run consecutively in the belief they are consecutive 4 missing an earlier gpm and settling down to the assertion there are earlier ones 5 cleanly missing one or more ris not even calling them 6 failing to discharge an ri and going on past it 7 accidentally missing whole block of ris as in resuming session and not noticing pc has skipped commoner than youd think 8 accepting wrong goal missing the right one similarly worded 9 accepting wrong ri not getting the plot ri to fire 10 misinterpreting or not understanding data given to you by the pc andor acting on wrong data11 misinforming the pc as to what has or has not fired and discharged 12 locating the wrong bypassed charge and saying it is the source of the arc break 13 failing to follow the cycle of communication in auditing these and any other way charge can be restimulated and left prior to where the auditor is working can cause an arc break charge left after later nearer pt than where the auditor is working hardly ever causes an arc break the burden of skilled auditing then is to get ris and gpms and incidents discharged as close to basic first incident as possible and always be prowling for something earlier in contradiction of this is that any gpm fairly well discharged by rrs unburdens the case arc break or arc breaks and any incident partially discharged lets one go earlier the pc never knows why the arc break he may think he does and disclaim about it but the moment the actual reason is spotted the real missed area the arc break ceases if you know youve missed goal or ri just saying so prevents any arc break an arc breaky pc can always be told what has been missed and will almost always settle down at once example pc refuses to come to session auditor on telephone says theres more basic incident or ri or gpm pc comes to session the auditor who is most likely to develop arc breaks in the pc will have greater difficulty putting this hco bulletin into practice perhaps i can help this such an auditor qs and as by action responses not acknowledgments after understanding action can be on an automaticity in the session so this hco bulletin may erroneously be interpreted to mean if the pc arc breaks do something earlier if this were true then the only thing left to run would be basic basicwithout the pc being unburdened enough to have any reality on it drill and many drills can be compiled on this would be to have lineal picture of time track the coach indicates late incident on it with pointer and says pc arc break the student must give competent and informative statement that indicates the earlier charge without pointing since you cant point inside the reactive bank of pc with pointer drawn time tracks showing gpm series of engrams along free track series of gpms all plotted against time would serve the purpose of the drill and give the student graphic arc break experience the trick is to find and indicate the right bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it it is not do that heals the arc break but pointing toward the correct charge rule finding and indicating an incorrect bypassed charge will not turn off an arc break an automaticity as covered later in this hco bulletin is rendered discharged by indicating the area of charge onlythis is an elementary example pc says i suppressed that auditor says on this incident has anything been suppressed pc arc breaks auditor indicates charge by saying im sorry moment ago i didnt acknowledge your suppression arc break ceases why because the source of its charge that triggered an automaticity of above the pcs tone was itself discharged by being indicated example auditor asks for joburg overt pc gives it auditor consults meter at once asking question again which is protested giving new read pc arc breaks auditor says i did not acknowledge the overt you gave i acknowledge it arc break ceases example auditor asks for ri 173 on first series line plot pc arc breaks giving various reasons why such as auditors personality auditor asks meter have i missed an item on you gets read says to pc ive missed an item arc break ceases whether the missing item is looked for or not is immaterial to this hco bulletin which concerns handling arc breaks if an auditor always does in response to an arc break such as instantly looking for specific earlier items that auditor has missed the point of this hco bulletin and will just pile up more arc breaks not heal them dont be driven by arc breaks into unwise actions as all you have to do is find and indicate the missing charge that was bypassed that is what takes care of an arc break not taking the pcs orders if the arc break does not cease the wrong bypassed charge has been indicated the sweetest running pc in the world can be turned into tiger by an auditor who always qs and as never indicates charge and goes on with the session plan some qs and as would be source of laughter if not so deadly here is q and artist at work and an arc breaky pc will soon develop and this auditor will soon cease to audit because its so unpleasant example auditor have you ever shot anyone pc yes i shot dog auditor what about dog pc it was my mothers auditor what about your mother pc i hated her auditor what about hating people pc i think im aberrated auditor have you worried about being aberrated pc why did the pc arc break because the charge has never been permitted to come off shooting dog his mother hating people and being aberrated and thats enough bypassed charge to blow house apart this pc will become as this keeps up unauditable by reason of charge missed in sessions and his resulting session dramatizations as overts find and indicate the actual charge bypassed sometimes you cant miss it it has just happened sometimes you need simple meter question since what you are doing is obvious sometimes you need dress parade assessment from list but however you get it find out the exact bypassed charge and then indicate it to the pc the violence of an arc break makes it seem incredible that simple statement will vanquish it but it will you dont have to run another earlier engram to cure an arc break you merely have to say it is thereand if it is the bypassed charge that arc break will vanish example pc i think theres an incident earlier that turned off my emotion auditor wed better run this one again pc arc breaks auditor consults meter is there an earlierincident that turns off emotion gets read say what you just said is correct thank you there is an earlier incident that turns off emotion thank you now lets run this one few more times pcs arc break ends at once dont go around shivering in terror of arc breaks thats like the modern systems of government which tear up their whole constitution and honor just because some hired demonstrators howl soon they wont be government at all they bend to every arc break arc breaks are inevitable they will happen the crime is not to have pc arc break the crime is not to be able to handle one fast when it happens you must be able to handle an arc break since they are inevitable which means you must know the mechanism of one as given here how to find bypassed charge and how to smoothly indicate it to leave pc in an arc break more than two or three minutes is just inept and be welldrilled enough that your own responding rancor and surprise doesnt take charge and youll have pleasant auditing arc break processes we had several arc break processes these were repetitive processes the most effective arc break process is locating and indicating the bypassed charge that really cures arc breaks repetitive command arc break process based on this discovery i just made would possibly be what communication was not received expanding this we get new arc straight wire what attitude was not received what reality was not perceived seen what communication was not acknowledged this process is not used to handle session arc breaks but only to clean up auditing or the track if the pc arc breaks dont use process find the missed charge indeed this process may be more valuable than at first believed as one could put in auditing on the front of each one and straighten up sessions and perhaps you could even run an engram with it the last has not been tested in auditing the three questions was wonderful on test 2 div ta in each 10 mins on very high ta case arc break straight wire of 1958 laid open implants like band saw which is what attracted my attention to it again many routine prefixes such as in an organization or on engrams or on past lives could be used to clear up past attitudes and overts we need some repetitive processes today cases too queasy to face the past cases messed up by offbeat processes cases who have overts on auditing or scientology or orgs cases pinned by session overts the bmrs run inside an engram tend to make it go mushy and class i auditors are without an effective repetitive process on modern technology this is it repetitive process even though not looking for basic implies that the process will be run until the charge is off and therefore creates arc breaks unless left unflat therefore the process is safe if flattenedrudiments nothing is more detested by some pcs than rudiments on session or gpm or ri why the same rule about arc breaks applies the charge has been bypassed how consider the session is later than the incident naturally ask for the suppress in the session you miss the suppress in the incident earlier by far result pc arc breaks thats all there is to arc breaks caused by session bmrs or mid ruds example scrambleable eggs wont rr auditor says on this item has anything been suppressed pc eventually gets anxious or arc breaks why suppress read yes but where was the suppress it was in the incident containing the ri the pc looked for it in the session and thereby missed the suppress charge in the incident of the ri which being bypassed charge unseen by pc and auditor caused the arc break remedy get the suppress in the incident not the session the ri rrs also the more ruds you use the more you restimulate when doing routine 3 because the suppress in the incident is not basic on suppress and if you clean just one clean even to test bang there goes the charge being missed on suppress and bang bang arc break lightly auditor lightly q and arc breaks q and causes arc breaks by bypassing charge how the pc says something the auditor does not understand or acknowledge therefore the pcs utterance becomes bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release as the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it the original utterances charge is built up and up finally the pc will start issuing orders in frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge this is the source of pc orders to the auditor understand and acknowledge the pc take the pcs data dont pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data when the pc goes to where the auditor commands dont say are you there now as his going is thereby not acknowledged and the going built up charge always assume the pc obeyed until its obvious the pc did not echo metering the pc says you missed suppress its and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for suppress that leaves the pcs offering an undischarged charge never ask the meter after pc volunteers button example youve declared suppress clean pc gives you another suppress take it and dont ask suppress again thats echo metering if pc puts his own ruds in dont at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in that makes all his offerings missed charge echo metering is miserable auditingmissed withholds needless to say this matter of bypassed charge is the explanation for the violence of missed withholds the auditor is capable of finding out so the pcs undisclosed overts react solely because the auditor doesnt ask for them this doesnt wipe out all technology about missed withholds it explains why they exist and how they operate indication is almost as good as disclosure have you ever had somebody calm down when you said youve got missed withholds well its crude but it has worked better is some auditor failed to locate some charge on your case or we must have missed your goal but only meter assessment and statement of what has been found would operate short of actually pulling the missed withholds apparent bad morale there is one other factor on bad morale that should be remarked we know so much we often discard what we know in scientology but way back in book one and several times after notably 880 we had tone scale up which the pc climbed as he was processed we meet up with this again running the helatrobus implants as whole track fact the pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale he or she comes up to degradation up to apathy and it often feels horrible and unlike an arc break and the sad effect is not cured except by more of the same processing people complain of their emotionlessness well they come up long ways before they even reach emotion then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad they even come up to feeling pain and all that is gain they dont confuse this too much with arc breaks but they blame processing and then one day they realize that they can feel apathy and its win amongst wins before it was just wood and this has an important bearing on arc breaks everything on the whole know to mystery scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect these are all on automatic therefore the pc in an arc break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident now fully on automatic the pcs anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc but the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor none is more amazed at himself or herself than the pc in the grip of the arc break emotion the pc is helpless rag being shaken furiously by the emotions he or she felt in the incidenttherefore never discipline or q and with an arc broken pc dont join hands with his bank to punish him just find the bypassed charge and the automaticity will shut off at once to everyones relief running routine 3 is only unpleasant and unhappy to the degree that the auditor fails to quickly spot and announce bypassed charge if he fails to understand this and recognize this his pcs will arc break as surely as ball falls when dropped if an auditor has arc breaky pcs only one thing is basically wrongthat auditor consistently misses charge or consistently fails to anticipate missed charge one doesnt always have to run the earliest but one had better not ignore the consequences of not pointing it out one doesnt have to discharge every erg from an ri always but one had better not hide the fact from the pc the adroit auditor is one who can spot earlier charge or anticipate arc breaks by seeing where charge is getting missed and taking it up with the pc that auditors pcs have only the discomfort of the gradually rising tone and not the mess of arc breaks it is possible to run almost wholly without arc breaks and possible to stop them in seconds all by following the rule dont bypass charge unknown to

hallmarks sign of an expert auditor of any scientology classification is the ability to talk the ta down if it is high at start of session it is not new technique it has been done for many years by well trained auditors and is done at flag simply and expertly as needed if one understands the anatomy of the human mind and what is bypassed charge he will understand this simple but important technique scientology auditors of all levels should be able to talk the ta down quickly and simply without restimulating the pc further the ta is not talked down by getting overruns ruds or arc breaks it is not done by rehabbing former releases it is done by the simple time honored action of asking the right question getting it answered andletting the tone arm blow down by letting the tone arm blow down it is meant that the auditor does not have any attitudes or ridges toward the preclear and lets him blow off charge which will bring the tone arm down the auditor never interrupts the pc while the tone arm is moving to ask the right question on this technique you must first know what you are trying to accomplish why do you want to bring the ta down the answer is simply that the ta being high 35 or above indicates that there is some mass the preclears attention is on you want that mass out of the way so that you can direct the preclears attention where you want it so what you simply do is get the preclear to tell you what is in restimulation so that it will key out without driving the preclear further into his bankand thus restimulating more mass you must not further restimulate the preclears bank because it already is restimulated by something the mass is right there you can see it reading on the meter but as this is not the mass you came into session prepared to run it would be q and to change the cs and program by running it so you must destimulate the pc by having him tell you what it is that his attention is on and thus free his attention so that you can run the major action briefly in talking the ta down you are freeing the preclears attention from where it is so that you can then direct it where you wishhow talking the ta down is done talking the ta down is simply starting the session as usual and if the ta is high35 or aboveasking the pc question such as one of the followingusing good arc excellent trs granting the pc beingness not soppy or sugary but being there comfortably and even pleasantly if the preclear is not upset some of the questions you could ask are do you have your attention on any thing is there anything youd care to tell since your last session has anything happened youd like to tell about how have things been going lately how have things been going since your last session or on occasion you could ask have you had any wins lately the question should be phrased to limit the time period to just what the preclears attention is on and not to drive him into his bank by restimulating new things it is lightly lightly with one eye on the pc and one eye on the meter so you can see if the tone arm blows down and what it blows down on this does not get wild and complicated there is q and perhaps the pc will say and the question will not have any reaction on the meter try another question but stick to one of the types given if the meter reads and the pc says nothing and the tone arm is not blowing down you could ask what was that or did you have thought there see fishing cognition drill you will also find certain subjects the pc mentions give blow down these can be used by noticing them redirecting the i cs attention to them when the pc changes the subject and the ta starts up example he says mother ta blows down he goes on to father ta starts up casually ask him about his mother again and it will go on down this is dangerously close to q except it manipulates the ta little of this goes long way when all else fails look back on your ws for the lowest ta read and redirect the pcs attention to that subject and you may get your fn dont get accusative or abusive or evaluative the preclear will answer you and the tone arm will start blowing down sometimes the preclear will not answer but will be looking and the tone arm will start falling never interrupt while the tone arm is blowing down even if the preclear isnt talking write down on the worksheet whatever names items events or whatever it was that blew the tone arm down and circle ithubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 16 february 1972 remimeo all tech terminals cs series 74 all auditors

botched it therefore saves time if other auditing is not done when the ta is high in general practice it will now be considered standard for an auditor dianetic or upper class to not start session over high ta but to call for cs and where there is cs it will be considered standard for an auditor seeing high ta to at once do cs 53 method 5 assessing it all and then handling there are exact

cleared up in other words the quoted cses above are only examples each of the above four general types can have great number of different questions the cs must be very familiar with the four types given in capitals above on his part the auditor can vary the css question around to get different slants on it the auditor doesnt have to get an fn on the 2 way comm session but often does the auditor can introduce curve an alteris by q and with the pc and by evaluation the drill on 2 way comm is the old ask and listen q and is of course echoing the pcs statement example pc i never liked my father auditor what about your father pc he was cruel auditor what about cruel people pc i dont like them auditor what else dont you like and so on and on correct session is for the auditor to hold to the css main line of questioning matter how he phrases it and listen to and write down what the pc says evaluation in auditing 2 way comm is the other deadly the auditor asks and listens he doesnt explain anything to the pc example pc i didnt dig the process auditor well you see that process was intended to and here we go on evaluation even an auditors facial expression can be evaluation ask and listen and ack prompt only by varying the original question now and then thats what the good 2 way comm auditor does ws the 2 way comm worksheet is rather more detailed as to what the pc says than process

of first stage release or first stage thetan exterior or released ot poorest but easiest of these is plain itsa itsa probably will not recover floating needle but will pull down the ta when its down stopdont press your luck too far the real technical job other than itsa requires expert metering and thorough knowledge of dating on meter and smooth comm cycle best at it would be an auditor who himself was former release and who had himself or herself recovered the state the technically correct procedure is unfortunately delicate one which requires good command of tech on the subject of the time track and perception of the pc and meter alert enough to stop exactly when rerelease occurs and say thats it never say end in such sessions remember all recovery must be by keyout not erasure keyouts are done by finding keyins it is destimulation not restimulation therefore all must be smooth and jolly with forcing or overrun the exact tech follows to regain former release or thetan exterior or keyedout ot released ot 1 loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred 2 get in suppress invalidate buttons on the session or time 3 get in unacknowledged or what was unacknowledged 4 indicate anything found to the pc as bypassed charge 5 find the keyin that was keyed out in that time or session the person went release because something keyed out in that time or session 6 when this is found and recognized by the pc the pc will then return to release or released ot 7 if this does not happen find what keyed in that ended the state and repeat 1 to 6 on it this is all rough to communicate to the pc who is not well trainedthis datum will help standard datum of early dianetics the analytical mind when it becomes aware of point in the reactive mind makes it vanish in other words one needs but become aware of the actual cause of an aberration to have it vanish we see this mainly in cognitions but it is the backbone of all auditing when the person was originally released he had become aware of something that caused the reactive mind to destimulate at that point or become weak and so he released you have to find that point of sudden awareness again as in i to 6 above and if you miss it you can at least find 7 you could find both and in lot of cases will probably do so but if you win on i to 6 for heavens sakes dont go on to 7 if you do 7 you may suddenly turn up with 5 when youve done it realize youve done it and come off of it dont overrun when you have done it tell the person to get trained so he or she can go on to actual clear liability the liability in all this is finding the original thing that was keyed in which when keyed out gave release if this happens you have new keyin in the session you are running right now it is new keyin and is handled as one tech comment this tells us that finding and running out keyins will make first stage release out of someone who has never been one standard grade processing does this l ron

released and then the moment of keyin afterwards and then get the pc to itsa these alternate points one after the other with bit of guiding when you see fall telling the pc who is thinking the needle fell by saying whats that and then if you get off any unacknowledgment by the auditor in the rehabilitation session and if you handle all such moments in the pcs auditing history recent or distant you will get the ta down and momentary floats of the needle then if you end it with the pc happy and all well in the release rehabilitation session the pc will feel terrific and you will probably have regained the floating needle remember it isnt repetitive alternate question what was keyed out then what was keyed in then but use of these and any such wording one after the other as itsa invitations until you get the ta off it and the ta down and not up again on session comm cycle goofs by hitting the keyout then the keyin in that former session where the pc went release he or she really gets the charge off it and youve regained it i daresay you could take stuck ta at 5 on an oldtime pc and by locating the moments when he or she felt good in sessions and handling each one in turn until you get the pc happy he or she has got it you would eventually get the ta to clear read and momentary or continuously floating needle its gentle the only goof you can really make aside from comm cycle and code breaks is not to quit when the needle floats in your rehabilitation session the rule of all processing is never run process further than it produces floating needle with the ta between 2 and 3

actions covered only in the above hcobs and this one one only does those actions given in these hcobs 3 rough comm cycle the roughness of the auditors comm cycle can prevent not only release from

in which it release occurred this means meter dating by loosely is meant to the year month and day not the minute you can of course locate to the houradd as the primary step to hcob 30 june 65 1 list and exactly date by meter each and every time the pc has attained state of release in this lifetime that should dispel any doubts about what rehabilitation of former release is aiming to do add also as paragraph in hcob 30 june 1965 if the pcs needle goes free with the tone arm between 2 and 3 on calibrated meter cease rehabilitation at that instant and declare do not continue beyond the floating needle on rehabilitation either if pcs needle floats doing the hco policy letter form 26 june 65 cease at that instant and send to get the state declared do not keep on doing the form past floating needle either in fact dont continue any process or auditing beyond floating needle you can shift from process to process free needle attained on each only in power processing and only on r6 gpmi an auditor must also realize that handling current matters and all on former release in rehabilitation is violating further the rule dont audit past floating needle the whole trouble with the pc was auditing beyond release therefore in rehabilitation even ruds are just more auditing arent they you can only do hcob 30 june 65 and its further hcobs 5 not recognizing floating needle floating needle free needle are the same thing what does one look like once youve seen one youll never make mistake on one again for it floats it ceases to register on the pcs bank it just idly floats about or wont stand up even at low sensitivity the ta goes to any place between 2 and 3 and the needle floats differences in cans used as electrodes and not keeping the meter calibrated with 5000 ohm and 12500 ohm resistors clipped between the two cans and setting the ta to f and m can lead an auditor to find floating needle at ta 38 but ignore it because the meter is out also two meters used can both be out particularly if the wrong cans are used steel cans chromium plated or tin plated like ordinary vegetable soup tin cans are the best electrodes 6 not getting them all not getting every time the pc has been release in this lifetime can be big goof sometimes the last one is just yesterday but omitting it can halt rehabilitation getting whole track before this lifetime former release periods is of questionable benefit but cannot be ruled out 7 pcs own purposesthe leader in making high state of being collapse given an r6 bank is the pcs own purposes person shot up scale can postulate postulating going down scale or an attack on something can collapse state of release protest wanting to get even revenge are some things that pc postulated that made him go back into the bank its goof for pc to postulate himself down scale or to postulate himself right by showing another he is wrong this is why class iv processing service fac can so easily make 1st stage release 8 declare errors sometimes pc is not rehabilitated yet is so declared this causes serious upset sometimes the examiner fails to detect the flaw that the pc doesnt think he was released and passes the pc sometimes the examiner challenges and fiddles about too much this is withhold of acknowledgment of the state and will cause an upset before it can be awarded 9 unalert org an org which is not alert to the way sps go for new releases when the release is still finding his or her feet will make very few that remain stable if an org develops lazy attitude toward auditor and personnel discipline then two things happen auditors and execs alike think it is all right to audit past floating needle on form action or process or b start declaring people who arent released either way is catastrophe the middle road of honest and precise tech is vital auditors with sloppy comm cycles almost never release anyone to floating needle such begin to believe it is all gas so it doesnt matter what they do an org not alert to what bad comm cycle can do to prevent release is for it as tech will fade summary for fifteen years auditors have made and then undone keyedoutclearing all over the world we can then assume that as they had the data about floating needles in 1958 and did not heed it we will have this battle with us from here on the end product of all auditing right up to clear is floating needle there is other

bang bang marking the reads and go through the list of reading items until you are left with one reading item that is the item to get clue as to what happened the cs prepares list and the auditor starts assessing with the list already written out the auditor calls out each item and notes its read as followslions x big game sf cats x felines sf tigers x bearers x trucks x elephants x killing camping x three items are now reading after the first assessment the auditor continues to assess the reading items on the list by elimination down to one item on the second assessment the list looks like this lions x big game sf x cats x felines sf x tigers x bearers x trucks x elephants x killing f lfbd camping x now the item left in is killing it is circled that is the item the cs now knows where the charge lies this item is prepchecked or done on an l1 as subject or otherwise handled as directed by the cs sometimes some items will read three or four times but the action is the same the auditor assesses the reading items by elimination down to one item and that is all there is to it if the item killing also had an fn the item would not be handled further as the charge will have blown listing and nullinglisting and nulling is an action whereby the pc gives items in answer to the auditors listing question it is the preclear who lists listing and nulling is listed by the preclear this is done precisely per the laws of listing and nulling hcob 1 august 1968 there is listing and nulling drill in the book of emeter drills the auditor asks the listing question if it reads he asks the pc the question the pc answers item item item item the auditor writes the items down as the pc gives them noting the read or read as the pc gives the item the auditor then nulls the list per the laws of listing and nulling in listing and nulling there should be only one reading item on the list after nulling you dont go over and over the reading items by process of elimination you may extend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling in its finest form listing and nulling is done to lfbd fn the auditor says the listing question to the pc checks whether it read and notes the reads per number 6 of the laws of listing and nulling ideally the following would happens the auditor checks the question who got shot it gets long fall so it is reading well auditor writes the read beside the question then the auditor gives the pc the question with good tr 8 and pc gives items the auditor writes the pcs items down noting whether the item read and the read as the pc gives it the first reads therefore is always the read the item gave as the pc said it who got shot lf x joe x bearers elephants x tigers the buffalo x ind the white hunter lfbd fn bearers f x elephants f x tigers f x the buffalo x x extthe dog x x ind the white hunter lfbd lfbd fn the white hunter will bd fn because it is the item the auditor gives the item to the pc the pc will have cogs and vgis it might happen that the pc tells the auditor that this is the item at which point the auditor would pleasantly say thank you the white hunter is your item of he could just smile and say thank you in acknowledgment but the point is that he would never chop the pcs cog or enforce his presence on the pc while this is happening good trs are vital and this is the way you do listing and nulling you get an lfbd fn while listing or while nulling if youre flubless auditor it is the finest hand that gets it while listing and never has to get to the nulling stage however both are excellent list that has to be nulled to cm lfbd item is acceptable but not worthy of praise there is of course one other place where you could get an lfbd fn in listing and nulling which is while checking the listing question for read before listing you could get an fn on checking the question and the pc could start cogging and blow the whole subject when that happens the subject has blown dont do anything more with it indicate the fn and let the pc have his cog and vgis listing and nulling is so simple have perfect trs know the laws of listing and nulling and do it as shown above any auditor who consistently cannot get an lfbd fn while listing and nulling should retrain on listing and nulling it is more than likely hell find he has bought some one elses misunderstoods or considerations on the

incompetent persons the cs should look for these especially when such campaigns are in progress he should suspect them as possibility when case bogs cs must be sure all such papers and worksheets get into pcs folders common repair action is to 1 do an assessment for type of charge 2 handle the charge found by the assessment done 3 fly all the reading items found on such assessments by 2wc or direct handling 4 suspect listing errors on any why or purpose or product found even though list exists and reconstruct the list and l4b and handle it 5 handle word clearing of any type in or out of session with word clear correction list done in session by an auditor 6 when word clearing is too heavy on the pc or doesnt clean up suspect he has been thrown into implants which are mostly words or the words in some engram as implants are actually just engrams handle it with an l3b listing any item found out of session or by nonauditor is suspect of being listing and nulling ln error even though list was made today correct ln item must bd and fn so treat such items as you would list errors and try to reconstruct the list and either confirm the item or locate the real item may have been invalidated and suppressed or extend the list and get the real item the real item will bd fn one can establish what the situation is with post purpose why or product or any other such item by doing an l4bself auditing the commonest reason for self auditing is wrong or unfound ln item people can go around and self list or self audit trying to get at the right why or product or purpose after an error has been made reaction nothing produces as much case upset as wrong list item or wrong list even rarely dianetic list can produce wrong list reactions ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy or blows or attacks the auditor all of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists nothing else produces such sharp deterioration in case or even illness out lists therefore when one gets sharp change in case like lowered tone violence blows determination to go on in spite of the supervisor long notes from pcs self csing etc etc the cs suspects an out list this outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to bd fn it can occur in coffee shop out of session auditing of someone or by est or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life pts when such actions as finding items by nonauditors are done on pts people the situation can be bad so one also suspects the person to be pts to someone or something pts does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says someone or something is hostile to you and you are connected to someone or something that doesnt agree with dianetics or scientology repairs the main things to know when doing such repairs are that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and b that it is up to the cs to suspect detect and get them handled in regular session do not ignore the possible bad influence as the good outweighs the bad in such cases it is not correct answer to forbid such actions it is correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folderone can also persuade the d of t or qual to gen in the people doing such actions and do not ignore the effect such actions can have on cases and do not neglect to include them in cses before going on with the regular program they can all be repaired lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron hubbard all

on 99 pages with the pc protesting getting upset this is called dead horse list because it gave item the reason it didnt was that the list question itself didnt read one does an l4 on the pc to correct the situation and gets unnecessary action on list that is getting item you dont extend you correctly use l4 or any subsequent issue of it if you extend dead horse list you just make things

broken leg yet it might not read on meter it would be charged but below the pcs reality so it wont read things that dont read wont run the case supervisor always counts on the auditor to test questions and items for read before running them the auditor when question or item doesnt read can and should always put in suppress and invalidate on this question item has anything been suppressed on this question item has anything been invalidated if either one read the question or item will also read the case supervisor also counts on the auditor to use suppress and invalidate on question or

that the correction of lists very vital piece of tech has been source of confusion in the field as it apparently has never been written up in an issue it really is simple if you know your laws of l n verifying list the correct procedure for verifyingcorrecting past l ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct then do an l4bra on each list where the item is found to be incorrect you would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item you do not direct the question to see if it read and dont just do an l4bra and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such nulling list one nulls list when he doesnt get bd fn item on listing the laws of l n strictly apply an l4bra would be used if the action bogs with still item found one would also null lists the pc made where item had been found such as 2wc which turned into listing action with the pc giving off items or list the pc somehow made while not on meter in these cases there is item to verify with the pc as correct just cull the items into list work out with the pc what the question was if its not already noted and null the list reconstructing list sometimes you just dont have the list and cant get it or its an old why finding or pts interview for which there are worksheets in this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item probably was already on the list and you dont want the pc to get into newly listing the question in pt and then getting into an overlisting situation just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get bd fn item if you dont get the item that way then you can extend the list selflisting watch it on these as every random stray thought person has about why this or that does not mean its selflist but do look for it on person who is manifesting the horrendous bpc an out list can generate who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the ethics officer just dont get into trying to make list out of some nonstandard listing question that wont give you an item and actually the usual reason for selflisting is prior wrong l n item or an item not found people will selflist to try to find the right item so find and correct the earlier out list list correction blowupwhen you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get big pc blowup and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you probably are not correcting the list that is out and youd better find out which list it is there is usually an earlier out list to be found if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset lists not reading when you start getting key lists such as grades iii and iv not reading and items found its time for that auditor to get thorough overhaul on his metering eyesight and to get off all his mus on l n you also could be setting the pc up for selflisting situation as he has been given the listing question but item has been found so be very sure the question did not read even with suppress and inval and trs were in before getting off key l n process use of l4bra the prepared list l4bra corrects l n lists it can be run on old lists current lists general listing when pc is ill after listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after always suspect that listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the laws of listing and nulling for example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted if this didnt go then an l4bra would be done on the list handling an l4bra you handle reading questions on the l4bra by the directions under the question that read you dont just 2wc these questions for example say question 4 read on the l4bra is list incomplete sf you then ask the pc what list is incomplete locate it and get it completed to bd fn item you dont just 2wc incomplete lists to an fn and leave it at that by the way the l4bra is missing line which is was it the first item on the list this is being added as its quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed do it right an out list can create more concentrated hell with pc than any other single auditing error so its imperative that listing errors get properly corrected the best thing to do is to have the laws of listing and nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later l ron hubbard founder assisted by cs45 lrhjedr copyright 1977 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 16 october 1962 central orgs franchise routine 3ga listing the reason some pcs go to clear on listing and the reason some dont at once lies entirely with the auditor the dominant rules are two 1 dont force the pc to list more items than he has and 2 dont prevent the pc from giving items the number of ways an auditor can dream up or overlook to violate 1 and 2 above are countless example if pc cant answer the line easily skip omit or change it dont tiger drill it to force an answer listing is not prepchecking you dont wait for the pc to say he has more before you stop asking line the auditor regulates his question by the pcs comm lag when the pc first comm lags without asking for repeat of the line wording the auditor comes off the line the auditor doesnt ask the line again just to make sure or ask the pc do you have any more asking it again when the pc has comm lagged leaves amongst other things an unanswered auditing question the line is asked the pc answers until he or she comm lags the auditor then acks and goes instantly to next line if the pc says he has more on the old line the auditor says sorry and takes them line is run to first comm lag how long is comm lag it is the pause before the strained grope pcs decline in answering goes as follows 1 bright rapid giving 2 comm lag while looking 3 groping for more 4 comm lag while groping 5 cant quite say it 6 starts picking up and rejecting from 3 above onward the auditor is at fault right at the end of 2 the auditor acks and gives the pc the next linethe auditor takes only the bright easily gotten flows if the pc goes fumbling and groggy the auditor is at fault and is doing wrong listing is rapid action the way to keep it rapid is to deftly see that the pc has given all and then get out of there auditors whose pcs dope and grope will soon have pcs that mope the auditor avoids q and the auditor never repeats an item back to the pc or asks if it fits on the line the auditors role is permissive with good presence if the auditor does not understand an item he or she says so but does not include any repeat of the item in saying so thats evaluation listing is slightly contrary to early auditing philosophy then if the pc protested the auditor forced the pc to answer in listing this is never done then if the pc comm lagged the auditor flattened it in listing one never flattens comm lag one shifts the moment the first comm lag appears but without startling the pc listing auditing is different the pc is always right in listing if you trick pc into more items and prevent the pc from giving those items he has readily to hand the whole case may have to be patched up before it will clear it is so easy to list right as an auditor that many will fumble all over the place before they get the knack and almost all errors will be additive errors listing is the biggest barrier to clear now that we can find goals other listing methods may appear but these

facsimile is computation generated by the being not the bank an example of this is all horses sleep in beds such computation locked away in the mind will obviously precipitate many compulsive doingnesses beingnesses and havingnesses an example of doingness precipitated by the above computation would be making beds for horses if on assessing for service facsimile you get making beds for horses as the service facsimile please note that it is doingness and not computation so if you fit the doingness into the bracket of service fac commands ie how does making beds for horses make you right how does making beds for horses make others wrong etc then observe very carefully exactly what the preclear says because he might give the exact words of the actual service facsimileall horses sleep in beds and observe very carefully and note all meter reaction to what he or she says note all of this remembering that you were not running real service facsimile in the first place and that in order to really flatten all the compulsive doingnesses beingnesses and havingnesses precipitated by the basic computation you will have to run the exact computation in the service fac bracket if the doingness you run is basic one then it is possible that the preclear will blow all the charge on the service fac and this you will assess by pc indicators and meter phenomena ie free needle it is obviously best to get real service fac computation and taking beingnesses doingnesses and havingnesses as service facsimiles if done by auditors must be thoroughly understood service facsimile

use of something the action or result of giving assistance or advantage work done duty performed computation that aberrated evaluation and postulate that one must be in certain state in order to succeed service facsimile the service facsimile is that computation generated by the preclear not the bank to make self right and others wrong to dominate or escape domination and enhance own survival and injure that of others note that it is computation not doingness beingness or havingness we could call this service computation but we will maintain the term we have used to describe this phenomenon throughout the technology service facsimile it is computation that the pc adopted when in an extreme situation he felt endangered by something but could not itsa it it is called service facsimile because he uses it it is of service to him aberration anybodys aberration on any subject has been of some use to them at some time or other you can trace it back its been of some use otherwise they wouldnt keep mocking it up but now if you put it up against survival standards youd find it very nonsurvival the pc adopted this because he couldnt stand the confusion in situation so he adopted safe solution safe solution is always adopted as retreat from the environmental restimulation he adopted safe solution in that instance and he survived his safe solutionbecame his stable datum he has hung onto it ever since it is the computation the fixed idea he uses to handle life his service facsimile how the service facsimile becomes fixed an idea is the thing most easily substituted for thetan an idea doesnt have any mass connected with it basically and it appears to have some wisdom in it so its very easily substituted for thetan thus the idea the stable datum he has adopted is substituted for the thetan how does this stable datum become so fixed it gets fixed and more and more firmly as time goes on by the confusion it is supposed to handle but doesnt the stable datum was adopted in lieu of inspection the person ceased to inspect he fell back from inspecting he fell back from living he put the datum there to substitute for his own observation and his own coping with life and at that moment he started an accumulation of confusion that which is not confronted and inspected tends to persist thus in the absence of his own confronting mass collects the stable datum forbids inspection its an automatic solution its safe it solves everything he longer has to inspect to solve so he never anises the mass he gets caught in the middle of the mass and it collects more and more confusion and his ability to inspect becomes less and less the more he isnt confronting the less he can confront this becomes dwindling spiral so the thing he has adopted to handle his environment for him is the thing which reduces his ability to handle his environment those things which do not respond to routine auditing that routine auditing wont change are rooted in this mechanism therefore it is important to find the idea on which he is so fixed pull the fixed idea and you free the individual for broader perimeter of inspection in service fac handling the reason you get tone arm action when the fixed idea has been pulled is that the confusion which has been amassed and dammed up for so long is now running off rightwrong dominate and survive right and wrong are the tools of survival in order to survive you have to be right there is level at which true rightness is analytical and there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical or comprehensible when it drops below that point its aberration the point you degenerate from survive to succumb is the point you recognize you are wrong that is the beginning of succumb the moment one becomes worried about his own survival he enters into the necessity to dominate in order to survive it goes the insistence upon survival followed by the necessity to dominate followed then by the necessity to be right these postulates go downhill so you get an aberrated rightness or wrongness the game of domination consists of making the other fellow wrong in order to be right that is the essence of the service facsimilethe reason the service facsimile isnt rational is because you have aaas along the whole line coming down the line it works itself back and forth in an aberrated aaa if the individual is surviving he must be right and people will defend the most fantastic wrongnesses on the basis they are being right in pt and at any point along the track the fellow is trying to be right trying to be right trying to be right whatever hes doing hes trying to be right in order to survive you have to be right more than youre wrong so you get the obsession to be right in order to survive the lie is that he cant do anything else except survive it isnt that trying to be right is wrongits obsessively being right about something thats obviously wrong thats when the individual is longer able to select his own course of behaviour when he is obsessively following courses of behaviour which are uninspected in order to be right there is nothing sane about service facsimile there is rationality to it the computation does not fit the incident or event occurring it simply enforces exaggerates and destroys freedom of choice over the exercise of ability to be happy or powerful or normal or active it destroys power destroys freedom of choice wherever that zone or area is youll see the individual worsening he is on dwindling spiral but he himself is generating it the intention to be right is the strongest intention in the universe above it you have the effort to dominate and above that you have the effort to survive these things are strong but were talking here about mental activity thinking activity an intentional activity survivalthat just happens dominationthat just happens those are not intended things but you get down along the level of intended and its right or wrong the strongest intention in the universe it is always an aberrated solution it always exists in pt and is part of the environment of the pc hes generating it its his solution overwhelmed as he is by it he is still generating it its aberrated because its an uninspected solution and it is something that everyone unintentionally or otherwise is telling the pc is wrong and causing him to assert that it is right the perfect solution when he first got hold of it but now it monitors his life its living his life for him and it doesnt even vaguely begin to take care of his life that is the anatomy of the service facsimile you are going to find these on any pc you audit service facsimile is the clue the key to pcs case the route to succumb which he blindly asserts is his route to survival and every pc has more than one of these fortunately we have the tech to salvage him we are the only ones who do l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights

service facsimile is brother to rses and evil intentions this is easily seen when one understands the anatomy of the service fac and the rightwrong dominate and survive computations that enter into it and when one understands that an rs always means hidden evil intention and that the total reason for an rs is to make wrong in order to get someone to succumb they have to be wrong way back up there the idea preceding the service fac was right really right then it came down bit and was method of survival and then it was method of dominating and then it was method of being right in order to make others wrong and in that contest one got enough overts so that the communication line took switcheroo what was right about it is now wrong about it and what was once wrong is now right aaa enters into the situation where rightness becomes wrongness all of his overts get piled up on one of these fixed ideas or what we call service facsimile it isnt actually facsimile at all its the guy himself keeping facsimiles in restimulation because he knows whats best the person himself is generating the fixed idea it is not the bank it isnt what aberration the individual is dramatizing its what aberration does the individual dredge up in order to make somebody wrong it isnt the accidental thing you think it is its intended the intention is to be right and make others wrong to dominate others and escape domination oneself to aid own survival and hinder the survival of others that is the service facblood brother to the hidden evil intention that is behind the rock slamthis does not mean you will necessarily see rses on every service fac you run it does mean that where pc is rsing in an area you have an area of heavy severe service fac know when you see an rs that the individual is in the grip of an evil intention which he himself is generating he intends that area or subject on which he is rsing nothing but harm calculatingly covertly he will go to great lengths to carry his intentions out at all times carefully concealing the fact the evil intention is not limited to terminals hes not rsing on terminal hes rsing on the evil intention the evil intention can associate with many terminals the rs dominates the individual it is the person he has been overwhelmed by it in that area he has ability to reason he has freedom to choose the evil intention is substituted for livingness it is his safe solution to life his service facsimile the service fac does not respond to ordinary auditing because in the course of ordinary auditing it does not get inspected it by its nature forbids inspection but when addressed at the rightwrong level the pc gives it up easily because in that area he has power of choice more than one service fac per pc we have had for many years service fac processing with which to handle these obsessions and thus to handle the person who rses but it is not just finding one service facsimile you find many service facs which then add up to the big one at saint hill in the mid60s this was commonly associated with rses it was what the pc had done with the service fac to make others wrong which was important not just finding it early on the tech included auditing them out with dianetics and you found many many more than one on each pc we used to get complete character changes with this the full tech on this has been submerged over the past several years it is probably this omission of requiring several service facs to be run and then auditing them out with dianetics that has resulted in so many rsers going on up undetected as of this writing the full tech has been exhumed and we have now new era dianetics tech to help strip these packages down and take them apart at their basics so we not only have more thorough means of handling service facs than ever before we also have more reliable route to the handling of an rser but its more than one service fac per pc you may audit off one two or three apparent service facsimiles that all answer up to the complete description of service fac and they will run but all are actually leaning on the central service fac that is in restimulation in pt as you take these lesser service facs off the central one comes to view on the first ones you find the most you can hope for is you found something that blew the ta down and moved you closer to finding the main service fac so you take them if youve found service fac the needle will be looser and the ta in reasonable range and it will run on the rightwrong etc brackets and the pc will get off automaticities when youve finally found several and walked it all the way through to the service fac its as if all theother service facs youve been peeling off are like the bands of trees and sod that lie up against the mountain peak so you take the service facsimiles and run them as you find them you unburden the cliffs before you pull the mountain out by the roots as youre running out the first service facs youre reversing the dwindling spiral youre restoring the individuals ability to handle his environment because hes now seeing it hes now beginning to confront it and by the time youve pulled the main onethe mountainout by its roots youve returned him to sanity he is now able to inspect he longer needs safe solution it is the most dangerous thing in the world to have safe solution because that is the hole

service facsimile running at saint hill in the mid60s many many service facs were found on each pc and the earliest service fac running included the use of dianetics this was later omitted from service fac procedure and service facs were handled solely with scientology tech by running off the automaticities on the computation to cognition fn and vgis in the pc phenomenal gains and case changes were made on pcs with that tech aloneall of them valid that tech has been retained as vital action to service fac handling now with the advent of new era dianetics service fac handling has been restored to its full technology new era dianetics has opened the door to more complete and finite handling of service fac with precision and exactness than we have had heretofore we longer just find service fac audit off the automaticities key it out and forget it we audit it out fully and terminatedly using new era dianetics to take it down to its basics and erase thosethis in way contradicts the fact that there were many pcs who with service fac found and the automaticities taken off were able to actually then blow the service fac computation upon inspection what it does make possible is the actual erasure of service fac and its residuals on every pc one for one and not just one service facsimile per pc but many an auditor who has been trained on service fac running prior to this bulletin will need the tech he already has plus an excellent command of new era dianetics tech if he has not done the new era dianetics course it will be required before attempting to run routine 3sca class iv auditor who has already done the new era dianetics course need only review it in order to be able to handle all the steps of the new full service fac procedure service facsimile handling revised by steps before you can run flows on service facsimile you must first find it you want the pcs service facsimile you dont find service facsimile by listing for it on flows you find the pcs service facsimile and run it on the flows the sequence is you list for the pcs service fac find it run the automaticities off it then you run the service fac itself on r3ra engram running by chains it is run to basic and full dianetic end phenomena you dont leave service fac until you have taken it apart and blown it at its very roots then you list for another service fac using different listing question and handle it fully and another and another pc can have many many service facsimiles you peel them off until you find the main service fac at the core of the case and you handle that one fully as you do the others per the steps above needless to say you are going to see some remarkable results full service facsimile procedure preliminary steps 0a put in the r reality factor with the pc telling him briefly what is going to be done in the session 0b clear computation very thoroughly with the pc use the tech dictionary hcob 23 aug 66 service facsimile and any other reference you feel the pc may need have him demo it until you are certain he fully understands it 0c clear the bracket commands rightwrong dominate survivalfirst using birds fly as sample service facsimile clearing the bracket commands is done at this point so you will be able to use these questions immediately when the service fac is found without putting stops on the pcs first rush of automaticities coming off 0d then clear the listing question steps of the procedure list and null for the pcs service fac using the question in this lifetime what do you use to make others wrongyou want bd fn item that is computation not doingness beingness or havingness when you get it indicate the item then indicate the fn then despite the bd fn go on to the next step of the handling b run the service fac found in 1 on the brackets 1 in this lifetime how would service fac make you right 2 in this lifetime how would service fac make others wrong 3 in this lifetime how would service fac help you escape domination 4 in this lifetime how would service fac help you to dominate others 5 in this lifetime how would service fac aid your survival 6 in this lifetime how would service fac hinder the survival of others these are run as follows give the pc the first question in this lifetime how would service fac make you right and let him run with it he will have rush of answers answers coming too fast to be said easily at this stage dont repeat the question unless the pc needs it just let him answer 1111111 he may give you as many as 50 answers until he comes to cognition or runs out of answers or inadvertently answers question 2 then switch to question 2 in this lifetime how would service fac make others wrong treat this the same way ie let him answer 22222222 until he cognites or runs out of answers or starts to answer question 1 then switch back to question 1 same handling back to question 2 same handling as long as pc has answers coming easily upon cognition and fn acknowledge indicate the fn and end off on 1 and 2 now give him question 3 in this lifetime how would service fac help you escape domination and let it run by the same method as above when this seems cooled off use question 4 in this lifetime how would service fac help you to dominate others use questions 3 and 4 as above as long as pc has answers coming easily upon cognition and fn acknowledge indicate the fn and go on to the next bracket using the same method as above give him question 5 in this lifetime how would service fac aid your survival when hes run out on 555555 switch to question 6 in this lifetime how would service fac hinder the survival of others use questions 5 and 6 as above as long as pc has answers coming easily let him get off all the automaticities and come to cognition and fn acknowledge and indicate the fn at this point it is safe to end off on running the brackets the idea is not to beat the process to death the pc will have automaticities coming off thick and fast early in the run these must be gone and the pc bright fning and vgis when you end off you are only trying to end the compulsive character of the service facsimile found and get it off automatic and get the pc to see it better at this stage not to bleed the process of every bit of ta action running the service fac in the brackets will result in major cognition which could occur at any point during this running when it does occur it is the ep of this step of the service fac handling end off and go onto the r3ra step note in running dianetic clear on service facs you would end off running this service fac at this point when the pc had reached good cognition fn and vgis donot run the dianetic actions of service fac handling on dianetic clear as these pcs are not to be run on dianetics when you have completed one service fac on steps and b you can then list for another service fac and repeat the procedure note if the service fac found on any pc did not run on the brackets it would need to be prepchecked see sections when running off the automaticity and when to prepcheck below c run the service fac r3ra quad each flow to ep it is not run narrative and it is not preassessed otherwise full new era dianetics tech is used per hcob 26 june 78r ii new era dianetics series 6 routine 3ra engram running by chains the service fac phrase itself is used as the running item the commands for running service fac on r3ra quad flows are flow 1 locate time when you used service fac example locate time when you used all horses sleep in beds flow 2 locate an incident of your causing another to use service fac flow 3 locate an incident of others causing others to use service fac flow 0 locate an incident of you causing yourself to use service fac take each flow down its chain of incidents to the basic and full dianetic ep fn postulate postulate off erasure and vgis that will be the end of all vestiges of that service fac d list for another service fac on the pc using the listing question in this lifetime what do you use to dominate others when you have the service fac repeat steps b and c above find another service fac on the pc with the listing question in this lifetime what do you use to aid your own survival handle the service fac per steps b and c above f continue to find and handle service facs on the pc using in order the following listing questions 1 in this lifetime what do you use to make yourself right 2 in this lifetime what do you use to escape domination 3 in this lifetime what do you use to hinder the survival of others further listing questions which can be used are given on hcob 30 nov 66 assessment for service facsimiles you will need to find and handle several service facsimiles on the pc which will then add up to the big onewhen listing for the service facsimile you are listing for bd fn item write down each computation the pc gives you exactly as he states it verbatim with its read matter how improbable non sequitur or inane it may sound the service fac operates like magnet as youre listing youve given the pc the question and as the question is in the vicinity of the service fac youve already ticked it it draws the pcs attention to it hes listing along and suddenly hell put non sequitur item on the list it doesnt make sense it doesnt even answer the question but there it is because his attention is being pulled to this inevitably youre asking him for answers and he gives you the rightest answer he knowspeople always jump off the empire state building thats the solution that solves everything it blows the ta down thats the service fac indicate the item to the pc then indicate the fn youre now ready to run it in the brackets when running off the automaticity if youve found service fac the pc wont be able to stay out of it i guarantee you the first question is always how would it make him right never how would it make him wrong never never never the automaticities should start with the first question if not ask him how it would make others wrong you almost always enter it at the level of rightwrong but dont make the blunder of thinking it cant be service fac if it doesnt enter at that level try it on the other levels it can enter at the level of dominate it might enter at the level of survival but ifon one of thosethe pc doesnt immediately jump in and swim into the whirlpool its not it if he tells you well lets see make right hmmmm or escape domination doesnt make sense thats not it if he says that isnt it then that isnt it dont hang him with wrong service fac because its too easy to find right one they abound if he hasnt jumped in and swum madly to the center of the whirlpool and gotten embroiled in this thing its not it because thats the first thing they want to do with service facdrown when you have the right one youll get the automaticities coming off thick and fast dont stop the avalanche with acknowledgements dont stop it with new question let it run out its not one auditing question for one answer its one auditing question for one waterfall when to prepcheck when the item found as service fac wont run on any of the brackets you prepcheck it to ep fn cog vgis ref hcob 14 march 71r fn everything rightnesswrongness computation doesnt surrender to normal auditing because it is service fac the pc has vested interest in holding onto it he wont be able to itsa it on prepcheck thus service fac if present will turn on mass on prepcheck the prepcheck is series of types of decisions thetans make about things so if it doesnt prepcheck the prepcheck must be in conflict with the rightness and wrongnessreversely if its not service fac it will prepcheck and you polish it off by that method to ep then go back to the list and find service fac that will run completing service facsimile handling with r3ra even when the pc has gotten off the automaticities has cognited and is comparatively free of the compulsive character of the service facsimile there is more to be handled running the service fac using r3ra enables him to run out what he has done with it to make others wrong etc these will be the actual most charged incidents in which hes used it which will have accumulated in his wake as he went along substituting the service fac for himself and never inspecting the consequences he will now be free to inspect those parts of the track as himself and to inspect as well the effects of the service fac on the other flows finally the use of r3ra engram running by chains enables him to fully erase the somatics and engram chains which have their roots in the service fac or vice versa as well as the postulates underlying them ending service fac running service fac running can be ended off when you have fully run many service facs which will lead to the main service fac when the main service fac has been run to full ep service fac handling is complete note it might happen rarely that you get the main service fac on the pc on your first listing and nulling it will be rare because the main one does not usually come to view until the others have been taken off you run it of course any service fac run produces change but on this one you will see the pc changing character before your eyes the results are quite astounding but realize that he does have other lesser service facs which do not simply dissolve because the main core service fac is now gone even though they have been leaning upon it you will need to ln for these and completely clean the pc of service facs the main core service facsimile will be the one the pc has used as solution to all of life when found and run it will be unmistakable to both the pc and the auditor when this one has been completed on all the steps above as well as the lesser service facs surrounding it you will have attained the ep on service fac running you will have brought about complete character change in the individual returned his freedom of choice and his freedom to inspect and enabled him to be truly right and that is the stuff of which sanity is made this level is actually the sanity level lrhdr l ron hubbard copyright 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved
