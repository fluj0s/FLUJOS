background and issues for congress ronald orourke specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary unmanned vehicles uvs are viewed as key element of the effort to transform httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21294 us military forces the department of the navy may eventually acquire every major kind of uv navy and marine corps uv programs raise several potential issues for congress this report will be updated as events warrant introduction unmanned vehicles uvs are viewed as key component of us defense transformation1 perhaps uniquely among the military departments the department of the navy don which includes the navy and marine corps may eventually acquire every major kind of uv including unmanned air systems uass which include unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and armed uavs known as unmanned combat air vehicles or ucavs unmanned surface vehicles usvs unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and unmanned ground vehicles ugvs section 220 of the fy2001 defense authorization act hr 4205pl 106398 of october 30 2000 states it shall be goal of the armed forces to achieve the fielding of unmanned remotely controlled technology such that 1 by 2010 onethird of the aircraft in the operational deep strike force aircraft fleet are unmanned and 2 by 2015 onethird of the operational ground combat vehicles are unmanned 2005 report by the naval studies board nsb recommended that the navy and marine corps should accelerate the introduction of uavs and uuvs ugvs the report made several additional recommendations concerning don uv

navy and marine corps uv programs3 navy uavs and ucavs 4 the navy unmanned combat air system n ucas is the navys program for acquiring uas that can operate from aircraft carriers and penetrate enemy defenses to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance operations or suppress enemy air defenses sead the navy plans to demonstrate the aircrafts suitability for carrierbased operations in 2013 and have it enter service in 2021 as penetrating surveillance and reconnaissance system the nucas program was initiated as the ucavn program in conjunction with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in december 2002 the department of defense dod decided to merge the air force and navy ucav programs into joint unmanned combat air system jucas program in october 2005 management of jucas was transferred from darpa which had managed it since october 2003 to joint air forcenavy office led by the air force in february 2006 dod announced that it was restructuring the j ucas program into navyoriented ucav program the effort became navy program once again at the start of fy2007 details about the jucas program are being defined5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21294 the broad area maritime surveillance uas bams uas is the navys program for acquiring an unmanned persistent multisensor radar electro opticalinfrared and electronic support measures maritime isr system that can cover any part of the world bams uas is to work with the navys planned p8 multimission aircraft or mma the navys planned successor to the p3 orion maritime patrol aircraft competitors for bams uas include variants of the existing global hawk and predator uavs and possibly an unmanned version of the gulfstream 550 the navys fy2008fy2013 aircraft procurement plan calls for procuring the first four bams uass in fy2011 and four more each in fy2012 and fy2013 the first bamss are expected to enter service in 20136 in support of the bams uas program the navy under the global hawk maritime demonstration

submerged minedetection and classification sensor suite the navy originally envisioned procuring at least 12 systems for use on at least 12 ddg 51class aegis destroyers but in fy2003 reduced the program to 6 systems for 6 ddg 51s additional rmss are now to be deployed from lcss the office of naval research onr reportedly is developing two usv prototypes as future options for common usv or family of usvs10 the navys spartan scout usv program uses an unmanned 7 meter 23foot or 11meter 36foot boat capable of semiautonomous operations that can be launched from surface ship or shore the craft can be equipped with modular payload packages for missions such as mine warfare and antisubmarine warfare asw the navy accelerated deployment of spartan the first system was deployed in october

system ldmruuvs is large clandestine uuv for launching from submarines lcss and amphibious ships that is to be used for conducting multiple missions including mine countermeasures including neutralization delivery of payloads for special operations forces persistent isr and limited asw in areas denied or inaccessible to other navy systems the navy is currently developing requirements for

the semiautonomous hydrographic reconnaissance vehicle sahrv sponsored by ussocom is small manportable vehicle to be used by navy special warfare nsw forces ie navy seals for hydrographic reconnaissance and mapping operations in very shallow waters the navy states that sahrv has completed all phases of the acquisition cycle to the point of fielding and sustaining 17 operational units as such the sahrv has achieved full operational capability foc defined by ussocom and continues to fulfill critical requirements capability of nsw forces in the war on terror the navy plans to improve

in early fy2007 issues for congress potential issues for congress regarding naval uvs include the following what implications might uvs have for required numbers and characteristics of naval ships and manned aircraft and naval concepts of operations since the current navy ucav and gladiator ugv programs will likely fall far short of meeting the goals established by section 220 of pl 106398 should the these programs be accelerated so as to come closer to meeting the goals or should the goals in section 220 be amended how will the restructuring of the jucas program into the navyoriented ucav program affect the navy ucav effort are the marine corps uav and ugv programs adequately coordinated with those of the army is the marine corps plan for using upgraded pioneers as an interim tactical uav the best approach legislative activity in 2007 the department of the navys proposed fy2008 budget with funding for various navy and marine corps uv programs was submitted to congress in february
