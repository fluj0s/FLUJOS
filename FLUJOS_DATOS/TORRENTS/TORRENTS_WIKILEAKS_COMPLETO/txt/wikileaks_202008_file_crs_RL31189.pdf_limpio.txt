divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189individuals with disabilities education act idea identification and misidentification of children with disabilities summary this report discusses issues related to the identification and misidentification of children with disabilities misidentification can result from failing to identify those with disabilities from identifying children with disabilities they do not have and from delaying identifying children with disabilities congress has been and continues to be concerned about problems of misidentifi cation these concerns have been reflected in provisions of special education legislation most notably the individuals with disabilities education act idea that seek to ensure that children with disabilities are identified and receive speci education and related services and that children not be incorrec tly identified for example congress has included provisions in idea funding formul as to discourage states from attempting to increase their shares of federal f unding by overidentifying students with disabilities some disabilities such as visual or hearing impairment are relatively easy to recognize and are less susceptible to misid entification the identification of other disabilities for example learning disabilities depend on more subjective measures and are more prone to misidentificati on students identified with these more subjective disabilities account for most of the schoolage special education population the distribution of disabilities is not uniform in the schoolage population students with speech and language impairments predominate in the early grades students with learning di sabilities account for most st udents with disabilities beginning in the middle elementary grades and continuing into high school as students with milder disab ilities graduate or drop out of school those with more severe disabilities account for most of the population although at these ages 1922 most individuals with disabilities are long er part of the elementary and secondary school population most of the concern about misidentifi cation has centered on the perceived over identification of african american students especially african american males while african americans account for bout 15 of the population age 621 they account for bout 20 of students identified with disabilities although some portion of this higher rate might be explai ned by factors related to the occurrence of disabilities for example greater poverty among african americans such factors may not be the full explanation of the rates at which african american students are identified as mentally retarded nearly 35 of all such students and emotionally disturbed more than 25 of these students other factors such as teachers subjective judgments are likely to be involved there is disagreement on what should be done about identification problems some argue that idea provides ample tool s to deal with these problems and only better implementation and more rigorous forcement of current law are necessary others argue that idea needs to be reformed for example by requiring states or school districts to devise corrective plans if there is evidence of overidentificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189contents v r v i w 1 congressional background 1 the 1975 act 1 c u r r n t l w 2 continuing concerns about

idea identification and misidentification of children with disabilities overview for years congress has been concerned about the identification and misidentification of children with disabilities these concerns have been reflected in provisions of special education legisl ation most notably the individuals with disabilities education act idea that seek to ensure that children with disabilities are identified and receive special education nd related services and that children who are not disabled and do not require special education not be misidentified and mislabeled three general kinds of misidentification can occur underidentification that is failing to identify children who have disabilities and need special ducation to succeed in school overidentification that is classifying students with disabilities they do not have and late identification that is delaying identification of students withdisabilities until later in their schooling when special education services may be less effective misidentification has costs for students wrongly identified and for their families as well as for the country as whole fa ilure to identify means that child will not receive the services and rights that idea guarantees such children without services the child with disability may be less likel to succeed in school and as result faces the possibility of diminished success in later life the child who is wrongly classified as disabled may be stigmatized by being labeled may be separa ted for large parts of the day from his or her peers and as resu lt may receive an inferior education the child for whom identification and therefore services is delayed will miss the opportunity for early intervention which some argue can prevent more severe problems from developing as the child matures and may prevent the child from requiring special education in later grades congressional background the 1975 act misidentification of students with disabilities has concerned congress for decades central congressional concern that led to the enactment of the education for all handicapped ch ildren act of 1975 pl 94142 the previous nomenclature for idea was that most disabled children were beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs2 1for further information on congressional intent behind pl 94142 see crs report 95 669 the individuals with disabilities educ ation act congressional intent by nancy lee jones this report is currently available from the crs website 2hrept 94332 to accompany hr 7217 p 12 this stipulation was based on the assumption that students with disabilitie s accounted for about 12 of the schoolage population note that states had to serve all children with disabilities even if that group accounted for more than 12 of the schoolage population 3the new formula has been in effect since fy2000 for discussion of the formula see crs report rl30810 individuals with disabilities educa tion act issue regarding full funding of part b grants to states by richard n apling 4srept 10517 p 9 house report language is identicalinadequately served in pub lic schools or were being ex cluded altogether from public education1 in addition to ensuring that all children with disabilities have available free appropriate public educati on and related services c ongress was concerned that distributing funds to states based on the number of students w ith disabilities would create incentives to overidentify therefore congress stipulated that in the reporting of the number of handicapped children being served for purposes of the formula for allocation state may report more than 12 percent of its total population of children aged five to 172 current law at the time of the 1997 reaut horization of idea pl 10517 congress continued to be c oncerned about misidentificati on to address this issue the 1997 legislation authorized new form ula which fo r funds in excess of trigger appropriation approximately 49 billi on would base allocations on states population and poverty3 the senate report explains this formula change the committee developed the change in formula to address the problem of over identification of children with disabilitie s when the act was first passed in 1975 states were not providing educational services to many children with disabilities therefore congress proposed to distribute federal funds for special education services in order to encourag and reward states for serving eligible children today the growing problem is over identifying children as disabled when they might not be truly disabled the challenge today is not so much how to provide access to special education services but how to appropriately provide educational services to children with di sabilities in order to improve educational results for such children this problem is most intense with minority children especially africanamerican males overidentification of minority children particularly in urban schools with high proportions of minority students remains serious and growing problem in this na tion the problem also contributes to the referral of minority special education students to more restrictive environments4 in addition to formula changes the current idea statute has other provisions intended to prevent misidentifying children with disabilities these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs3 5the department of education in its final re gulations for part b grants to states has declined to define significant disproportionality on the grounds that it is expected that the determina tion of disproportionality will involve consideration of wide range of vari ables peculiar to each state including income education health cultural and other demographic characteristics in addition to race prescribing how the states should determine disproportionality and take corrective action would not reflect the varied circumstances existing in each state and is not consistent with discretion afforded to states under the statute 64 fr 12652 march 12 1999 6remarks as prepared for delivery by us secretary of education rodney paige to the learning disabilities summit washington dc august 27 2001 emphasis addedrequirements relate d to eligibility evaluation nd reevaluation procedures mandating multiple valid techniques including local assurances that tests and other evaluation materials used to assess child are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on racial or cultural basis 614b3ai requirements of states and the secretary of the interior regarding services forindian children with disabilities in schools operated and funded by the secretary of the interior annually to collect examine and report to the secretary of education data to determine whether significant disproportionality is occurring with resp ect to race if evidence is found the state or the secretary of the interior must review and revise as necessary relevant policies procedures and practices 618c 5 authorization of the secretary of education to obtain through competitive grants knowledge related to the over or underidentificati on of children with disabilities 672a3 continuing concerns about misidentification congress and the administration continue to be concerned about identifi cation issues for example in recent speech secretary of education rodney paige noted in idea as with esea president bush re alizes that money is ineffective if it is not tied to accountability money alone will not improve student performance reform needs money but money also needs reform if he just wanted money he wouldnt ve bothered to ask superintendent to be his secretary of education he asked for because he wanted reform and reform is what he will get we will take systematic look at issues like discipline finance models disproportionate placemen t of minority students overidentification and late identification 6 with respect to late identification of students with disabilities as discussed below this concern has been raised most often with regard to students identified as learning disabledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs4 7section 6023 at state and local discreti on for

of children v 6 1 spring 1996 p 42 hereafter cited as reschly identification and assessment categorizing disabilities discussion of identification and identification requires an understanding of how idea defines who is eligible for special educati on to be eligible student must be identified with one or more specified disabilities see box below and as result must require special ducation and related services7 1 mental retardation 2 hearing impairments including deafness 3 speech or language impairments 4 visual impairments including blindness 5 serious emotional disturbance 6 orthopedic impairments 7 autism 8 traumatic brain injury 9 other health impairments 10 specific learning disabilities some disabilities have obvious physical manifestati ons such as visual or hearing impairments that suggest even to an untrained individual that child has disability for example sherwin nuland scribes the reactions of mother to her newborn child with down syndrome but as soon as i looked at him i knew i told myself theres something wrong this child has down syndrome the obstetrician said i was mistaken but i knew better few hours later they came in and told i was right8 other disabilities such as learning disabilities mental retardation and emotional disturbance which account for about 70 of schoolage children served by special education programs are not so easily identified for these disabilities identification depends on parent or teacher referral professional judgment criteria set by states or local educational agencies leas and often test performance as result the determination of who is disabl ed and thus eligible for special education can differ from one time to another from state to state and possibly even from school to school reschly points out that it is entirely possible for students with identical characteristics to be diagnosed as disabled in one state but not in another or to have the categorical designation change with move across st ate or school district lines9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs5 10reschly identification and assessment p 42 11ysseldyke james bob algozzine and martha l thurlow critical issues in special education 3rd ed p 100 hereafter cited as ysseldyke et critical issues 12it is important to realize that mild disab ilities are not trivial or necessarily shortlived for example learning disability that inhib its the ability to read can constitute formidable barriers to both education and occupational ttainment and significantly limit adult career opportunities reschly identification and assessment p 45 13 ysseldyke et critical issues p 10for example determination of mental retardation usually is based at least in part on performance on an iq test reschly notes that state iq cutoff scores for mental retardation vary from 69 to 8510 thus child may be judged to be mentally retarded and receive special education and related services in one state but after moving to another state might longer be eligible for special education even though the iq score remains unchanged state criteria may be influenced by sta ndards set by profe ssional associations when professional standards change stat changes may follow and some who were considered disabled may longer be for example the american association of mental retardation aamr recommends an iq cutoff score for determining mental retardation and this sc ore has changed over time from 1959 to 1973 student scoring one standard deviation below the mean was likely to be classified as retarded after 1973 when the aamr changed the cutoff to two standard deviations below the mean that same student was not considered retarded thus many students ceased to be retarded simply by pen stroke of the american asso ciation of mental retardation11 although learning disability mental re tardation and emo tional disturbance appear to be discrete disabilities students categorized with mild forms12 of one of these disabilities may share many similar characteristics with those categorized as having mild forms of the other disabilities as ysseldyke et observe students categorized with one of these disabilities often exhibit low academic achievement including problems with reading mathematics and writing delayed language acquisition and hyperactivity or inattention13 in addition the services provided those id entified as learning disabled mentally retarded or emotionally disturbed might be very similar reschly points out instruction for these groups often utilizes the same principles and often the same procedures intensive individualized instruction along with cl ose monitoring and feedback regardless of whether the student is classified as learning disabled mildly mentallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs6 14reschly

s10 hereafter cited as sri how are they doing it is important to note that the degree of school failure among students classi fied as emotionally disabled may not carry over to postschool experience the sri study found that these students were as likely as other youth with disabilities to be employe d to earn comparable wages and to live independently 16us department of education to assure the free appropriate public education of all children with disabilities twentysecond annual report to congress on the continuedretarded seriously emotionally distur bed slow learner or educationally disadvantaged14 although children with similar characteristics may be identified with different disabilities or with disability the educational prospects for those in various categories may be different children with very similar characteristics might be classified as learning disa bled in one school district as emotionally disturbed in another district and as educationally di sadvantaged in third each of these children might receive similar educationa l programs although only the first two would be considered disabled under idea and thus covered by all the legal protections of the act however teachers and parents perceptions of these children could be quite different resulting in different stigmas and potentially quite different educational outcomes the first child might be seen as having normal ability but needing to cope with or compensate for learning disability the third child might be seen as slow learner or late bloomer who may catch up in the future but the child categorized as emotionally disturbed might face more limited educational prospects for example th sri international national longitudinal transition study of student s with disabilities found that youth classified as emotionally di sturbed demonstrated pattern of disconnectedness from school they often were absent from school they had lower grade point averages than youth in other disability categories and were more likely to have failed courses and to have been retained in grade at the end of the year this disconnectedness and academic failure culminated in youth with emotional disturbances having the highest dropout rate of all youth with disabilities15 thus the classification of child can have significant effects numbers of students served by special education data on the number of children serv ed under idea and how they are classified are helpful in examining the identification and possible misidentification of children with disabilities each year the us department of education ed collects data from states pursuant to 618 of idea on the characteristics of children receiving special education and publishes report to congress based on these data the current annual repor t to congress the 22nd provides data for school year 1998 1999 and is the major source of data for this report16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs7 16continued implementation of the individuals

do not have picture of single c ohort of children as they pass through the education system if we did have such longitudinal perspective over 20 years we would probably see similar pattern of ebb and flow 18these data are collected and reported by age the grade level for most children of given age can be obtained by subtracting 5 years from their age thus most children age 6 are in 1st grade most

age school year 19981999as background to discussion of identif ying students with disabilities it is useful to have some sense of the flow of children into through and out of the special education system in school year 19981999 approximately 55 million students ages 322 received special education and related services figure 1 which depicts the number of children served at each age in 19981999 shows that the number of students in special education is not evenly distributed across ages17 in the preschool years ages 3 and 4 relatively few children are served between 100000 and 200000 the number grows in the early elem entary grades peaking about the age 10 5th grade18 at over 500000 thereafter the numbers served decline the number of those served who are 16 is below 400000 at age 18 fewer than 200000 are served at older ages those served number only few thousand for example only 3000 of the students served are 22 years of age source ed 22nd annual report table aa8 what explains the growth and declin in students served part of the explanation is the larger patterns of school attendance for example the numbers ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs8 19dropout rates can vary considerably depending on the method of calculation thus it is important to use comparable calculation when comparing groups the national longitudinal transitional study of special education youth appears to have calculated comparable national drop rates in the mid1980s for students with disabilities 429 youth with similar demographic characteris tics as students with disabilities 316 and youth in the general population 244 sri how are they doing table 51 p 56 20part of the decline at age 18 probably results because californias mandatory age limit for serving disabled students is 18 21see ysseldyke et critical issues p 76 and idea regulations at 300541disabled children served decline by age 16 in part because students are dropping out both students with disabilities and those not classified as disabled alt hough students with disabilities are more likely than their peers to drop out of school19 numbers drop further at ages 17 and 18 as students with disabilities like their peers graduate or complete high school finally some 19 20 21 and 22 year olds are served because of state laws providing special education for those ages20 numbers of children with various disabilities important trends emerge if the ebb and flow of students into and out of the special education system is examined by disability type figure 2 shows the numbers of students at ages 622 identif ied with the most widely recognized disabilities specific learning disabilities speech or language impairment mental retardation and emoti onal disturbance figure 2 also combines other disabilities defined in idea see box on page 4 into single category all other disabilities several patterns are evident the rapid increase and then decline of children categorized as learning disabled the high initial level and then declin of those with speech and language impairments the less pronounced increase and declin of the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed categories and the relatively constant number of those with other disabilities the most notable pattern in figure 2 is the initial relatively low number of students identified as learning disabled in 1st and 2nd grades ages 6 and 7 the rapid growth between ages 8 and 13 grades 3 to 8 in that category and the decline thereafter initially children identified as learning disabled account for less than 50000 special education students at age 6 or about 12 of the overall special education population by age 13 ther are about 300000 students identified as learning disabled or more than 60 of the total special education population this pattern may result at least in part from the method often used to identify learning disabilities learning disabilities are often defined as discrepancy between childs ability and his or her achievement in areas such as reading listening writing and mathematics21 although multiple measures are required tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs9 22idea section 614b2a and b require that variety of assessment tools and strategies be used to evaluate students for eligibility and prohibits the use of any single procedure as the sole criterion for determining whether child is child with disability 23for an exposition of this argument see reid lyon g et rethinking learning disabilities in chester finn jr et rethinking special educa tion for new century the thomas b fordham foundation and the progressive policy institute may 2001 p 259307determine eligibility for sp ecial education under idea22 predominant approach to determining whether child has learning disability is comparing an iq test score as measure of ability with an achievement test score for reading or math substantial difference in scores is used to determine that child is learning disabled some researchers point out that these ki nds of comparisons cannot be made much before 4th grade when meaningful scores can be compared thus child might be learning disabled or be at risk of developing specific learning disability but not be identified and receive special education and rela ted services until he or she is well into elementary school the data shown in figure 2 supports the view that learning disability identification is delayed some argue that alternative early identification perhaps by kindergarten and early intensive intervention could prevent learning disability from developing into condition requiring special education those supporting this position also argue that waiting until the child is well into his or her schooling can mean that the disability is more intractable and that th learning disability may well persist into adulthood23 different pattern is evident for students identified with speech or language impairment in the early grades 1st and 2nd grades ages 6 and 7 they number more than 200000 and account for more than 50 of all students receiving special education and related services by ag 14 they number about 20000 and account for about 4 of all special edu cation students this pattern results because most speech and language impairments are mild and tend to diminish or disappear as these children mature and receive speechlanguage therapy in short many children outgrow these disabilities and longer re quire special education only those with more severe impairments continue to require and receive services patterns of growth can also be seen for those identified as mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed although these patterns are overshadowed in figure 2 by the pronounced swings in learning disab ilities and speechlanguage impairment for those age 6 1st grade about 22000 are identified as mentally retarded and 9000 are identified as emotionally disturbed by age 13 8th grade the number identified as mentally retarded doubles 53000 and the number identified as emotionally disturbed has grown to nearly 49000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189 crs10 050000100000150000200000250000300000350000 6789 1 0 1 1

issues p 72 in many states the increase in the number of students with other health impairments was primarily due to increas ed provision of services to students with attention deficit disorder it is also due to improved health care technology babies with significant im pairment are living well beyond infancy 25recall that the overall service population is declining because of dropping out and graduation thus children in these other categories account for higher percentages of much smaller total disabled student population 26for further discussion and references to st udies see us depart ment of education to assure the free appropriate public education of all children with disabilities twentieth annual report to congress on the implementation of the individuals with disabilities

about 4 of the service population at all ages until the last few years of sc hools in those years ages 1922 these students account for growing percentage nearly 13 of the 22 year olds served25 many of these students have relatively severe disabilities and c ontinue to receive services until they reach the age when eligibility ends gender differences among students identified as disabled even though males and fe males account for roughly the same percentages of schoolage population males are more fre quently identified as disabled figure 3 shows that males account for s ubstantially higher percenta ges of the more prevalent disability groups male stude nts make up about 70 of l earning disabled about 60 of mentally retarde d and about 80 of emotionally disturbed males also account for higher proportions of several other di sability groups ed posits several possible explanations for higher male identification physiological differences such as higher rates of birth defects among boys and slower maturation rates teacher bias eg evidence that female teachers are more likely than maleteachers to refer boys for special edu cation coupled with the predominance of female teachers in the teaching force especially in the elementary grades assessment bias eg girls may be underrepresented in the category of emotional disturbance because asse ssment instruments are often poorly designed to detect some emotiona l problems such as depression that evidence suggests occur at higher rates among girls than among boys26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs12 27data for hispanics in figures 4 5

census african americans ac count for about onethird of poor children below the age of 18 the statistical relationshi p between low income and disability is clear for example the sri national longitudinal study found that about 35 of youth with disabilities had family incomes below 12000 while about 18 of all youth came from families with incomes below that level based on 1987 data sri how are they doing table 216 p 226although figure 5 gives some perspective on possible over and under representation among racial and ethnic groups clearer picture can be obtained by dividing each groups percentage share of disability category by the groups percentage share of the total population ages 621 this provides common metric for each group and allows comparisons between groups that account for vastly different shares of the overall populati on for example comparing whites and american indians which is difficult w ithout common metric because the former accounts for nearly 70 times more of the popul ation than does the latter based on this metric the measure for group will be 100 if its share of disability category is the same as its share of the total popul ation less than 100 if its share of the category is less than its share of the to tal population possibl underrepresentation and more than 100 if the category share is greater than the population share possible overrepresentation figure 6 shows these comparisons for the four groups in figure 5 plus whites the first vertical bar in each gr oup compares groups share of all students with disabilities with the groups share of the total population ages 621 for american indians the share of all disa bled students is about 125 times the groups share of the total population for asian amer icans the share of all disabled students is less than 50 of the groups share of the total population for african americans the ratio is about 135 to 100 for hispanic s and whites the ratio is close to 100 to 100 that is both these groups account for about the same shar of students with disabilities as they do of the total population ages 621 once again the most noticeable features of figure 6 are the ratios of african americans shares of students identified as ment ally retarded about 225 time s the share of the overall population and as emotionally disturbe d about 175 times the share of the overall population while comparing shares of overall popul ation to shares of disability groups is useful it is important to note that ratio above 100 does not necessarily indicate that group is being systematically ove ridentified or that ratio below 100 necessarily means systematic underidentification becau the occurrence of some disabilities are correlate d with individual characteristics such as poverty one would expect the incidence of disabilities to be higher among groups with greater incidence of those characteristics thus for example it is not unreasonable to expect that american indians and african americans given their higher rates of poverty on the whole would account for somewhat higher proportions of some disability categories than of total population28 although it may be possible to explain some groups relatively high rates of disabilities based on povert and other factors related to disabilities it is difficult to conclude that the high rates of african americans categorized as mentally retardedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs17 29see ysseldyke et critical issues p 74 noted here very low scores on an iq test should not be the only justification for identifyi ng student as mentally retarded adaptive behavior ie how well student functions in the social environment should also be considered however judging adaptive behavior is subjective whereas an iq score is an objective measure 30ysseldyke jim reflections on research career generalizations from 25 years of research on assessment and instructional decision making exceptional children v 67 3 spring 2001 p 303and emotionally disturbed can be completely explained by such factors alone for one thing if general disadva ntage were the main explan ation one would expect the rates of identification for racial or ethnic group to be similar across various disabilities however african americans for example account fo r nearly twice the percentage of students with mental retardation as they do of students with learning disabilities 34 vs 18 in addition one might expect that identification rates would be similar for all disadvantaged groups however for hispanic students who tend to have poverty rates similar to african americans the share of students classified as mentally retarded is less than their overall share of the student population moreover it is impor tant to remember that th data are for aggregate groups even if whites for example repres ent about the same pe rcentage of students with disabilities as they do of the overall student population this does not necessarily mean that white student is misidentified as disabled or is misclassified regarding the type of disability while aggregate state data suggest some areas of misidentification of students with disabilities and may mask other problem areas it would appear that the areas of most concern are the unusually high rates of identification of african americans as mentally retarded and as emotionally disturbed and the comparatively low rates of identification of asian americans and pacific islanders as students with disabilities while there is complete explanation for such outcomes many maintain that substantial numbers of african americans ar being incorrectly identified as mentally retarded and as emotionally disturbed the explanation for some misidentifica tion may be selecti on procedures in the case of mental retardation the use of iq tests which may exhibit subtle bias against some minority groups as the predominant tools for identifying students as mentally retarded could be contributing factor29 the subjective judgment of teachers could be another f actor ysseldyke and his co lleagues have done extensive research on the process by which students are referred to and evaluated for special education they have found that it is likel student will be deemed eligible once classroom teacher or parent has referred child for evaluation they are disturbed by the direct link between re ferral and eligibility because referrals often are unrelated to students actual behavior and abilities we have demonstrated repeatedly that teachers refer students who bother them different teachers are bothered by different kinds of behavior so the process is very unpredictable30 to the extent that eligibility for special education follows from teacher referral that may be based on preconceived notions bothersome deportment or prejudice ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs18 31arguably contributing factor is the mism atch between growing minority populations in many public school districts and teaching forces in most districts that are predominately white for example data show that students from minority backgrounds account for nearly 70 of total enrollment in lowincome urban school districts while the teaching force in those districts is about 70 white clewell b c and m villegas introducti on special issue on diversifying the teaching fo rce to improve urban schools

bothers teacher and classification as mentally retarded or emotionally disturbed means the student will be placed outside the regular classroom one can imagine that referral for eligibility assessment could be seen as an easy remedy for removing trouble maker31 there is less extensive explanation for the low rates of identification for asian americanspacific islanders is the actual occurrence of

special education programs at the department of education at hearing before the house education and the workforce committee october 4 2001 33ibid pp 34 for an overview of how curre nt law addresses misidentification see the discussion of current law earlier in this report 34for example fact sheet from the house education and the workforce committee dated september 10 2001 states that congress will turn its attention to reauthorization and reform of idea once the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act is completedpossible policy alternatives congress has recognized problems of misidentification and has provided many remedies in the original act and added to those remedies in the current idea in general an overarching im of idea has been and is to ensure that children with disabilities are properly id entified and provided with free appropriate public education the extensive statutory and re gulatory provisions related to child find evaluation and reevaluation and the individualized edu cation program process are all intended and designed to fulfill this aim given that congress approved extens ive idea amendments relatively recently june 1997 and final regulations have been in effect for less than 3 years march 1999 some argue that further ame ndments to idea to address issues such as misidentification of children with di sabilities should be postponed until current law and regulation can be fully implemented and evaluated32 related to the view of postponing furt her changes in idea is the possibility of improved enforcement of current law thomas hehir at recent hearing on over representation recommended imp roved monitoring and enforcement of idea as one remedy though there are powerful monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in idea they are not self implementing they require an active federal presence the history of federal enfo rcement of idea has been relatively weak one reason for this is the relative small size of the federal work force devoted to this issue about fifty people though i believe significantly larger workforce is jus tified in this area the more important factor is the willingness of both administrations sic and congress to support strong federal enforcement when i was at osep office of special education programs at ed members of congress from the states involved in enforcement actions i mmediately opposed several enforcement actions brought by the department of education given the fact that idea now addresses the issue of overrepresentation this committee should seek significantly enhanced federal m onitoring and enforcement role and support the department in doing its job33 others maintain that idea require s further consideration to address misidentification and other issues34 while comprehensive review of possible legislative action is beyond the scope of this report some possibilities include httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31189crs21 3564 fr 12652 march 12 1999greater

have received few increases in recent years as some have argued earlier assessment and identification of disabilitie s coupled with earlier intervention could reduce the prevalence of some

misidentification under 618c of id ea for example requiring states to develop and implement corrective action plans that would be submitted to and approved by the secretary as suggested by one commenter on the idea regulations35 additional requirements for teacher preservice and inservice training ofteachers especially the training of regular classroom teachers in proper identification of children with disabilities for referral for evaluation and with respect to better strategies for accomm odating children with disabilities in the regular classroom so that regular classroom teachers are more confident in serving children with disabilities and less prone to refer them for evaluation in the hopes of removing these children from regular classrooms further research regarding for exam
