key element of us bilateral investment treaties and with the inclusion of investment obligations in most us ftas it has become feature of these agreements as well the dispute settlement provisions of

itself has not yet entered into force4 statestate dispute settlement chapter twentyone statestate or general dispute settlement is set out in chapter twentyone of the proposed tpa which applies to disputes involvi ng the interpretation or application of the agreement or wherever party considers that an actual or proposed measure of the other party is or would be inconsiste nt with the tpa that the ot her party has violated the tpa or that an enumerated tpa benefit owed th party eg tariff reduction is being nullified or impaired by nonviola tive measure of the other party consultations the proposed tpa allows party to initiate consultations with the other party regarding matters arising under the agreement if matter is not resolved within 60 days of the initial request 15 days for matters involving perishable products or another period that the pa rties may agree upon either pa rty may request meeting of the usperu free trade commission an ad ministrative body blished under article 201 consisting of cabinetlevel officials of the parties or their designees see art 215 n1 which if it decides to c onvene would assist the partie s in promptly resolving the dispute if the

person or circumstance which is inconsistent with any law of the united states shall have effect see also 102b of the statute regarding the relationship of the tpa to state lawcommission may request that an arbitral pane l be established an arbitral panel is automatically establishe d upon delivery of request to the other party panels dispute panels consist of three mbers the complaining and defending parties appoint one panelist each if either fails to do s the panelist is to be selected by lot from roster established under the proposed agreement the parties are expected to agree on third panelist to chair the panel but if they cannot agree the chair will be selected by lot from roster members who are not nationals of either of the disputing parties panel selection is subject to timelines set out in the agreement unless the disputing parties agree otherwise the panel is to present its initial report to the disputing parties within 120 days after th last panelist is selected the report is to contain 1 findings of facts and 2 the pa nels determination as to whether disputing party is in compliance with its tpa obligations or whether measure is causing nullification or impairment of tpa benefits as the case may be or any other reque sted determination the report must also contain recommendations for resolving the dispute if requested by the parties after considering any written comments or requests for clarifications by the parties the panel is to issue its final report the final report is due 30 days after the initial report is presented unless th parties agree otherwise implementation on receiving the final report the disputants are to agree on the resolution of the dispute which should norma lly conform with the panels findings and recommendations if the panel has found that the defending party is not in conformity with its tpa obligations or that it is causing nullification or impairments of benefits the resolution should be to eliminate the nonconf ormity or the trade injury compensation suspension of benefits and monetary asse ssments are allowed as temporary measures pending compliance for purposes of us law dispute settlement results under trade agreements are considered to be nonsel fexecuting and thus where federal law or regulation is faulted and the executive br anch does not have sufficient delegated authority to act legislation would be needed to comply5 compensation and suspension of benefits if the defending party needs to take action and the disputing parties cannot agree on resolvin g the dispute within 45 days after receiving the final report or within nother agreedupon period the defending party must enter into compensation negotiations w ith the complainant if the parties cannot agree on compensation within 30 days or if th ey have agreed on compensation or means of resolving the dispute and the defending pa rty has not complied with the agreement the complaining party may suspend benefits f equivalent effect eg impose tariff surcharges on selected imports from the defe nding party the complaining party must notify the defending party of its intent including the amount of proposed retaliation if the defending party believes that the amount is manifestly excessive or that it has complied in the proceeding as the case ma be it may ask the pa nel to reconvene to consider the issue if the panel determines that the proposed suspension of benefits is excessive it must determine th proper level of re taliation the complaining party mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22752crs4 suspend benefits up to this vel or if the amount has not been arbitrated the level that it originally proposed unless the defending party has been found to be in compliance monetary assessments the complaining party may not suspend benefits if the defending party notifies the complainant by given date that it will pay an annual monetary assessment the di sputing parties are to consult on the amount but if they are unable to agree within 30 days the assessment will be set at level in us dollars equal to 50 percent of the level of be nefits the panel has determined to be proper or if there has not been panel determina tion 50 percent of the amount originally proposed by the complaining party unless the usperu free trade commission decides otherwise the assessment is to be paid to the complaining party in equal quarterly installments under the proposed tpa the commission may decide instead that the assessment be paid into fund and expended at its dir ection for appropria initiatives to f acilitate trade between the disputing parties if the defending party does not pay the assessment the complaining party may suspend benefits as arbitrated or proposed as the case may be compliance review if the defending party believes that it has complied in the proceeding it may refer the matter once again to the panel the panel is to issue its report within 90 days after the defending party notifies the complaining party of its panel request if the panel decides in favor of the defending party the complaining party must promptly terminate any trade retaliation and the defending party will longer be under an obligation to pay any monetary assessment it has agreed to private rights of action the proposed tpa prohibits party from providing private right of action under its domestic law against the other party on the ground that the latter has failed to conform with its tpa obligations as has been the practice with past ftas peru tpa implementing legisla tion includes provision precluding private rights of action under the agreement pl 110138 102c labor and environment disputes both chapter seventeen the labor chapter of the tpa and chapter eighteen its envir onment chapter contain special consultation provisions that must be invoked before part may resort to chapter twentyone dispute settlement unlike most earlier ftas with labor and environment chapters however the tpa does not limit the use of its general dispute settlement procedures to specified provisions of those chapters or limit initial remedies for noncompliance to the payment of an annual monetary assessment see eg drcafta arts1667 17107 20171 labor disputes the proposed tpa differs from earlier ftas with regard to its substantive labor obligations and the extent to which its general dispute settlement procedures apply to labor disputes while the tpa like earlier ftas requires each party to not fail to effectively enforce its bor laws in manner affecting trade or investment between the partie s it further requires that each party adopt and maintain in its statutes and regulations and practices enumerated labor rights as stated in the 1998 international labor organization ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work to establish violation of this provision however party must also show that bilateral trade or investment is affected art 172 n1 the tpa also requires parties not to waive or otherwise derogate from ilorelated implementing measures in manner affecting bilateral trade or investment where the derogation would be inconsistent with fundamental labor right and includes w ithin its domestic labor law enforcement requirement laws adopted or maintained in accordance with the new ilorelated provision while most earlier ft as allowed general dispute settlement procedures to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22752crs5 6 listed meas are the convention on internati onal trade in endangered species the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and conventions on wetlands pollution from ships and various marine species the tp also generally requires parties not to derogate from environmental laws in manner that weakens protections afforded in those laws in manner affecting bilateral trade and investment and c ontains an annex on fore st sector governance 7 chapter ten includes obligations relating to inter alia national mostfavorednation and minimum standards of treatment expropriation and transfers of investmentrelated funds into and out of the host country parties have exem pted specified existing and future nonconforming measures from certain chapter ten obligations see tpa art 1013 special dispute settlement provisions apply when restrictive measures invo lving transfers are at issue tpa annex 10einitiated only with regard to their labor law enforcement requirement tpa general dispute procedures apply to chapter sevent een without such limitation before party may invoke these procedures for labor issue however it must first seek to resolve the matter under chapter seventeen c onsultation provisions if the parties fail to resolve dispute within 60 days after consultations are requested the complaining party may seek consultations or meeting of the u speru free trade commission under chapter twentyone and following this ma invoke the rest of the chapter environmental disputes as is the case with labor issues the proposed tpa differs from earlier ftas with respect to substantive environmental obligations as well as the extent to which its general dispute settlement procedures apply to environmental disputes like earlier ftas the tpa requires each party to not fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws in manner affecting trade or investment between the parties it also places new require ment on each party to adopt maintain and implement laws regulations nd all other measures to fulf ill its obligations under listed multilateral environmental agreements meas and includes laws implementing the meas within its domestic enforcement obligation6 to establish violation of the mea implementation requirement however the complaining party must also demonstrate that the other party has failed to act in manner affecting bilateral trade or investment art 182 n1 chapter twentyone dispute ttlement procedures generally apply to disputes under chapter eighteen articles but wher dispute arises under the latter the complaining party may not resort to chapter twentyone unless it first seeks to resolve the matter under chapter eighteen consultation provisions if the pa rties fail to resolve dispute within 60 days of the initial consultation request the complaining party may seek consultations or meeting of the usperu free trade commission under chapter twentyone and may then proceed under the chap ter if it so chooses if dispute panel is convened and the dispute involves an obligation the panel must follow specified directions in chapter eighteen in making its findings and dete rmination
