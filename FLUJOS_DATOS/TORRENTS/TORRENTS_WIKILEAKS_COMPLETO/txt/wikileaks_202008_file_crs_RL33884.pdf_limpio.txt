dangerous weapons as well the possession with intent proscription already includes coverage of both firearms and dangerous weapons the existing statute has definition that excludes small pocket knives from the term dangerous weapon36 yet it describes dangerous weapons as any item capable of inflicting serious injury when used to describe the objects that may be impermissibly used in an assault its breadth is understandable in such circumstances it has been understood to include shoes37 belts38 rings39 chairs40 desks41 teeth42 screwdrivers43 and host of other ordinarily innocent objects that could be misused to inflict serious injury when the definition makes it crime to possess such items in federal courthouse regardless of how innocently they are used practical problems may arise if the courts read the definition out of the statute for purposes of simple courthouse possession prosecutions they may take the small knife exception with it and be left to their own devices to define what constitutes dangerous weapon the same incongruity however appears to have escaped notice in the case of simple possession of dangerous weapon in federal facility other than federal courthouse under 18

criminal cases79 those guidelines once binding upon the courts are now simply advisory although the courts must continue to consider them and the guidelines continue to carry considerable persuasive force80 the commission may enter into contracts in fulfillment of its responsibilities81 as general rule appropriated funds are available for obligation under contract or otherwise only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated82 there are several exceptions to the general rule for example the heads of executive agencies may contract for services that begin in one fiscal year and end in the next83 they may also enter into multiyear contracts84 and with sufficient security they may make advance payments on contract obligations to be fulfilled at later date85 in the judicial

to which such judge was appointed the amendment may present an interpretative challenge the problem is that only united states district court judges retire under section 371b the judges in the virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands retire under section 373 so does the amendment intend to add only senior united states district court judges to the co re of judges who may participate in the decision to appoint magistrate judges for their districts probably but that intent would have been more clearly demonstrated if the parenthetical had been added immediately after the phrase united states district court such reading might be thought to render the amendment redundant since the prior section vests senior judges with share in the appointment of magistrate judges for their districts but it can also be read as simply confirming the operation of the previous section or does the amendment intend to permit both united states district court senior judges who retired under section 371b and territorial judges who retired under section 373 to participate in the appointment magistrate judges of their courts possibly but read literally it would mean that territorial judges could participate as long as they had elected eligibility for senior status upon retirement regardless of whether they had been actually recalled or does the amendment intend only to permit appointment by senior judge in the district court of the northern mariana islands who retired under section 373 very unlikely for while it is perhaps the most grammatically faithful reading it would mean affording senior judge of the northern mariana islands authority that is denied the other territorial district courts moreover senior judges of the northern mariana islands retire under section 373 rather than 371 as stated in the amendment g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g8g146g151g142g156g561g139g162g561g8g152g155g150g142g155g561g18g155g146g156g152g151g142g155g156g561 federal courts that
