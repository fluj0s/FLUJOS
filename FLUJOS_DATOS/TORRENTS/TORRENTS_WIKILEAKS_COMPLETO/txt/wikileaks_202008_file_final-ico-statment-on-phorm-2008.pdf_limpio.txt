with t he first principle of the dpa when considering whether or not the processing in this context is fair the commissioner takes into consideration the extent to which users are made aware that t he processing will take place any choice that they are able to exercise over whether or not t he processing takes place the ease with which they can object and the affect of the processing upon the individual although the products have not yet been rolled out and th upcoming trial by one isp has not yet taken place from the information available at this point it appears that users will be presented with an unavoidable statement about the product and asked to exe rcise choice about whether or not to be involved on that basis in addition we are told th at users will be able to easily access information on how to change their mind at any point an d free to opt into or out of the scheme at any point thereafter which should involve the same degree f transparency and choice on the basis of our understanding of the explanation pro vided to us there does not appear to be any detriment to users in the operation of the phorm system s those who choose to be involved will only have the information used to match them against an advertising category and then present them with targeted advertising while browsing the i nternet the isp does not create lasting records of browsing habits in this context and do n ot seek to link living individuals to that information as it profiled and sent to phorm it also appea rs that users who opt out do not have their web browsing habits profiled and will be in the same position as regards the processing of their personal data as before the phorm systems were introduced question has been raised by the some individuals about whether or not the phorm products entails an unlawful interception of communications under the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 ripa the home office is responsible for compliance wi th ripa and phorm has approached the office directly and had written response so organisations have stressed an alternative view that the scanning of the content of websi tes by the isp on route to the user will entail an interception of communication during transmission th is is matter that the home office takes the lead on and the commissioner will not be taking any further action phorm and the isp will also have to comply with the pecr even where they do not process personal data under regulation 6 of pecr user must be i nformed when cookie placed on their computer given clear and comprehensive information about the purpose of the storage and given the ability to refuse it being placed on the system the information we have seen so far indicates that users will be informed by the isp about th use of cookies as part of the process of being told about the service and given choice about whet her or not to participate users will also be able to configure their internet browser to block all cookies from phorm and therefore prevent any profiling without cookie being loaded how this operates in practice will not be apparent until the trials by the isp get underway or the product is roll ed out but it should be possible for phorm to achieve compliance with regulation 6 regulation 7 of pecr will require the isp to get the conse nt of users to the use of their traffic data for any value added services this strongly supports the view that phorm products will have to operate on an opt in basis to use traffic data as pa rt of the process of returning relevant targeted marketing to internet users whether or not the phorm products are concern for the commi ssioner will depend on the extent to which the assurances phorm has provided so far are true the commissioner has reason to doubt the information provided by phorm but some technical exp erts have publicly expressed concerns the commissioner welcomes the efforts phorm is making to engage with concerned technical experts and believes that it is only by allowi ng its technology to be subject to detailed scrutiny by independent technical experts that it will be able to prove their assertions regarding privacy which will be important for the commercial success of the product in the view of the commissioner phorm can operate webwise and oix in way which is in compliance with the dpa and pecr but must be sensitive to the concerns of users the commissioner will keep the phorm products under review as they are rolled out and his view will be strongly influenced by the experience of those users who choose to participate in any trials and the way in which they are able to make that decision the commissioner will also continue to be interested in the dialogue between technical experts and phorm about the way in which the system operates v12 08040841708 438 pm phorm webwise and open internet exchange page 3 of 3 httpwwwicogovukabout_usnews_and_viewscurrent_topicsph orm_webwise_and_oieaspxrelated downloads view the
