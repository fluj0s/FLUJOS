of witnesses 2 page 3 h keith henson 4 direct by mr berry 436 10 index of exhibits 11 marked 12 defendants exhibit 470 page 411 1 monday may 11 1998 2 whereupon the following proceedings were held out 3 of the presence of the jury 4 mr berry first of all your honor id like to 5 apologize for my lateness the planes were delayed 6 the court ill accept that 7 im not very happy with the time i received your 8 brief which was after noon today when i asked for it last 9 week 10 in any event lets go over things quickly before we 11 bring the jury in 12 i have read mr berrys trial brief on issues 13 regarding the admissibility of evidence and related matters i 14 believe that the first paragraph of the introduction misstates 15 somewhat what i had indicated before with respect to what is 16 admissible and what is not however the record speaks for 17 itself 18 id like to cover now the specific paragraphs in the 19 offer of proof let start off by saying what is relevant is 20 mr hensons state of mind at the time of his posting as to 21 whether or not he was infringing the copyright owners rights 22 the relevant factors are whether he had facts 23 suggesting that the material was not copyrighted this could 24 include for example information about the copyright itself 25 such as it had expired it belonged to someone else and they had page 412 1 given license to someone or as weve discussed before if 2 mr henson in both subjective good faith and objective 3 reasonable belief believed that nots 34 constituted the illegal 4 practice of medicine and that if it did it in some way trumped 5 or overrode copyright law he can present those facts 6 whether mr henson had information or thought that 7 scientology is or was criminal cult guilty of other crimes or 8 the like is irrelevant and highly prejudicial 9 specifically with respect to paragraph the 10 material contained in paragraph is irrelevant 11 paragraph b its irrelevant except to the extent 12 that mr henson had facts that showed that mr mayo owned the 13 copyright this would be information he had at the time he 14 posted 15 what action scientology may or may not have taken 16 against mr mayo is irrelevant 17 paragraph c is irrelevant 18 paragraph d is irrelevant 19 paragraph is irrelevant 20 paragraph f is irrelevant 21 paragraph g is irrelevant except to the extent that 22 mr henson was aware at the time of the posting that nots 34 23 had actually been followed in the treatment of particular 24 patient 25 paragraph h is irrelevant page 413 1 paragraph i is irrelevant 2 paragraph j is irrelevant 3 paragraph k is irrelevant 4 paragraph l is relevant to the extent that 5 mr henson read something that suggested nots 34 constituted the 6 illegal practice of medicine prior to the time that he did his 7 march 30th posting 8 paragraph m is irrelevant 9 paragraph n is irrelevant 10 paragraph is irrelevant 11 paragraph p is irrelevant 12 paragraph q is irrelevant 13 paragraph r is irrelevant 14 paragraph s is irrelevant 15 paragraph t 16 mr berry your honor i think theres reference in 17 the actual posting itself to some of the these things that are 18 in s for example 19 the court its irrelevant to the issues in this 20 case mr henson is not being sued because of anything other 21 than the posting of nots 34 22 paragraph t is irrelevant 23 paragraph u is irrelevant 24 paragraph v is irrelevant 25 paragraph w is irrelevant except as to facts page 414 1 mr henson had that showed that david mayo may have authored 2 nots 34 and that any copyright protection longer exists 3 and x same comment its irrelevant except as to 4 what mr henson knew prior to the posting regarding the 5 authorship of nots 34 and any copyright resulting therefrom 6 paragraph is irrelevant except as ive previously 7 indicated 8 and i want to make it clear that i do not want 9 testimony pertaining to those matters that ive said are 10 irrelevant coming out during the course of examination 11 with respect to exhibits i indicated or at least 12 implied that i would allow the defense to offer the posting 13 that was made by mr henson on march 30th and i will allow 14 that and i have made copies should the defense need copy 15 i am not going to permit at least at this point 16 the introduction of any other exhibits from the defense i 17 think review of the history of this case will show that the 18 defense had more than ample opportunity to list exhibits but did 19 not do so 20 november 14th 1998 sic the original pretrial 21 conference statement was filed there was exhibit list from 22 mr henson 23 february 5th 1997 pretrial conference there was 24 exhibit list from mr henson 25 april 22nd 1998 pretrial conference mr henson page 415 1 indicated he hadnt filed any lists yet the parties were given 2 until april 24th to file supplemental exhibits and none were 3 filed by mr henson 4 and although i dont have all the transcripts or 5 records before i believe there was an acknowledgment at some 6 point after the 28th that mr henson on or after the 28th that 7 mr henson did not have any exhibits 8 i have handed out to you the proposed jury 9 instructions which we can discuss after the testimony is 10 concluded this afternoon 11 all right is everybody ready to go 12 mr rosen one or two quick things number one i 13 would ask that your honor again inquire of the jury before we 14 start as to whether they have had any exposure or seen or heard 15 anything respecting this case or any of the parties in this case 16 over the long weekend 17 the court i dont think there was anything in the 18 paper that had any at least i didnt see anything that had 19 anything to do with scientology or mr henson or anything else 20 mr rosen my concern is that the last day we were 21 here was last thursday and it was in that days san jose paper 22 and it may be that when the jurors went home that evening they 23 may have had the paper at home 24 i think if your honor would inquire simply whether 25 theyve seen or heard anything i would appreciate that page 416 1 the second thing is we had filed short document 2 this morning your honor on the confidentiality of nots 34 3 as you can see we have room full of people today 4 if as mr berry i believe has indicated hes just going to put 5 it in and show it to the jury so that nobody behind the railing 6 is going to see it then i dont have any problem 7 but if mr henson is going to be quoting or 8 paraphrasing parts of it or explaining it then i would ask that 9 the transcript not only be sealed but that the courtroom be 10 cleared 11 the last item is 12 the court i did not see that memo 13 mr berry i object to that your honor i cant 14 conduct this examination without going through the document 15 itself 16 the court go ahead mr rosen 17 mr rosen we are with respect to the documents 18 that we had subpoenaed i understand mr henson has given your 19 honor some of them 20 how has your honor planned on proceeding are you 21 going to take break after the direct and then determine what 22 to give 23 the court i have not seen the documents 24 so i would ask at this time mr berry did you file 25 those or whats the story with the documents page 417 1 pause in proceedings 2 mr berry the witness tells your honor that 3 he forgot to bring them but he can bring them tomorrow morning 4 he has the tax records only the tax records that he has 5 the court with him or not 6 mr berry not with him 7 mr rosen your honor in that case im going to 8 move to preclude the defense of inability to pay 9 there was timely objection to the subpoena 10 there was motion to quash the subpoena and i believe your 11 honor bent over backwards in terms of accommodating and asking 12 that the documents be submitted in camera so as to protect 13 whatever confidentiality would not be relevant to claim of 14 inability to pay 15 there has been compliance mr henson stands 16 guilty of contempt of the subpoena 17 mr berry your honor we briefed the issue of the 18 subpoena being untimely and improper 19 the court ive read your brief let read this 20 other memo 21 anything else 22 mr rosen your honor one other thing i did hear 23 that you instructed mr henson or you instructed counsel i 24 guess respecting outbursts 25 as we went over the transcripts of last wednesday page 418 1 and thursday there were 50 instances in which either mr berry 2 in his questions or his opening statement or mr henson had 3 gratuitously volunteered largely nonresponsive answers to 4 questions that got into scientology and the attacks upon 5 scientology 6 if this happens again and i would hope that it does 7 not your honor we have brief to hand up on why the 8 appropriate remedy should be the defense has finished the 9 defendants just rested if thats the case 10 your honor has told mr henson about this at least 11 twice last week 12 in view of the rulings today i dont expect that 13 there will be compliance i hope that there is but i dont 14 expect it and i would ask your honor to note and this is what 15 really gets us upset you held paragraph h of mr berrys offer 16 of proof to be irrelevant 17 i just want to point out that mr henson according 18 to mr berry is going to testify that the murder of attorney 19 ford green and scientology critic cynthia kisser had been 20 discussed in the kendrick moxon law firm of which mrs kobrin 21 is partner 22 mr berry has accused two attorneys of discussing i 23 guess conspiring to commit murder two murders 24 mr ford green is an attorney in marin county who 25 unless he died within the last hour or so is alive and well page 419 1 and indeed was on mr hensons original witness list 2 the other person named ms kisser is as far as we 3 know alive and well 4 and this is just simply an outrage and it portends 5 continuation of what happened last week 6 so i would ask your honor to make the admonition 7 clear to mr henson in terms of the consequences of him blurting 8 out gratuitous comments that are not that your honor has ruled 9 are not relevant 10 mr berry your honor first of all the court has 11 already said its irrelevant and cant be admitted and we 12 shouldnt be referring to it 13 secondly i havent accused anyone of anything 14 mr garry scarff testified about that so that misrepresents 15 whats in that record 16 but the court has indicated that we cant go into 17 it so we wont be going into it 18 and im requesting the court that we have five 19 minutes now so i can go over this with mr henson 20 the court i will give you those five minutes 21 because i think its important 22 mr rosen your honor respecting the document you 23 are reading that i referred to moment ago your honor i 24 think already knows this from the history of these cases 25 substantial amount of rtcs copyrighted page 420 1 confidential works were originally released by mr berry in 2 filing of an affidavit in an open court file in the fishman 3 case 4 i would hope that by the examination on nots 34 in 5 this courtroom that the people in this courtroom including i 6 see mr ward sitting here are not going to say ahhah it has 7 now been placed on public record 8 i understand that it is not trade secret in the 9 sense of having the protection because of what occurred and 10 being entitled to trade secret protection but that does not 11 mean that it is not subject to confidentiality protection under 12 rule 26 13 mr berry your honor it gets little tiresome 14 having to correct the record but i was not the person who filed 15 the fishman declaration it was mr fishman he was pro per 16 at the time and my staff accommodated him by actually taking it 17 down to the courthouse and that was the extent it of he wrote 18 it 19 pause in proceedings 20 mr rosen your honor we have another problem 21 the nots 34 which mr berry intends to put in is found in the 22 letter to your honor if the purpose is to put in nots 34 to 23 demonstrate that mr henson believed it was the illegal practice 24 of medicine thats one thing 25 the commentary in the letter to your honor does not page 421 1 belong in the exhibit 2 the court this is the posting of march 30th 3 right 4 mr rosen thats correct 5 mr berry your honor this is becoming absurd 6 the court lets do one at time please 7 mr rosen the posting is in the form of an open 8 letter to your honor which has lot of commentary including 9 things that your honor has just ruled are not even relevant 10 but the point is it would involve this court in the 11 sense of mr hensons negative option that i if you disagree 12 with judge then please let know 13 the court thats not what this letter says this 14 is an open the one that i believe is the march 30 posting is 15 purportedly an open letter to that obviously didnt come 16 until after the posting because its an open letter to 17 mr rosen this is posting of copy of the 18 letter 19 if i understand mr hensons deposition testimony 20 and his position in this case this is march 30th posting of 21 copy of letter he had previously attempted to deliver to 22 chambers or to your law clerk 23 and youll see at the end of it this letter this 24 purports to be copy of the letter given to your honor and the 25 letter has many many things in here which should not be before page 422 1 the jury 2 the issue is whether or not mr henson thought nots 3 34 was the illegal practice of medicine and put up nots 34 4 but to say to put in this letter with all of its 5 other commentary including the last sentence addressed to your 6 honor if you feel that tro does preclude examples please 7 let know i think that it just unnecessarily and improperly 8 involves the court in dispute that is not relevant to this 9 case 10 mr berry your honor the plaintiff continues to 11 try and make farce of this trial and an international mockery 12 of this court 13 this court there is better indication of his 14 state of mind than what he posted at the time and what he gave 15 to this court which was the same as what he posted at the time 16 and the court has always indicated throughout during this 17 trial that we can put this document in in its entirety because 18 in its entirety it is the context of his state of mind at the 19 time 20 the court i will allow as i said before the 21 posting that was made on march 30th to be admitted 22 depending on whats testified to i may also give an 23 instruction that explains that the court is not allowed to give 24 legal advice 25 mr berry i would have objection to that your page 423 1 honor i think its highly appropriate 2 the court with respect to testimony concerning 3 nots 34 mr berry you previously said that you had 4 objection to the jury being given copy of the posting and 5 that you would not attempt i believe to read nots 34 out loud 6 during the course of the proceedings 7 the document is according to plaintiffs 8 confidential at least to the extent that it has not been 9 according to them published by its author or its by rtc its 10 owner 11 if you need to refer to particular point for 12 example why dont you both approach the bench for minute 13 mr berry can this be on the record your honor 14 the court yes 15 sidebar discussion on the record 16 the court mr hensons posting says or 17 references the term blowing bts 18 mr berry if i may assist 19 the court if you were going im sorry go 20 ahead 21 mr berry if i may assist the court this document 22 is so confidential plaintiff introduced evidence of it being 23 posted numerous times last week worldwide 24 the court thats not the point 25 mr berry secondly mr hensons extremely limited page 424 1 defense requires to go through this in minute detail as to 2 what he read what he knew at the time and what he concluded 3 this document meant on the basis of what he knew 4 so we will be talking about bts clusters blowing 5 bts and all sorts of other things that appear on the face of 6 this document 7 the court what other things because your 8 posting my understanding from the posting is the only thing 9 he had problem with or what he was concerned about was the 10 expression blowing bts and the phrases cease to read and 11 longer read and that they refer to cease to read and 12 longer read refer to auditing with an emeter 13 mr berry thats not the only thing theres 14 references on every other line almost 15 the court but what are you going to ask him other 16 than what does auditing mean as used in nots 34 17 mr berry its going to be tied to the emeter 18 judge gesells decision an injunction which is every bit as 19 serious as this injunction as the injunction issued by this 20 court ill be talking about handling clusters bts ceasing 21 to read items running systems again engrams valence 22 auditors line by line 23 there is reference to the things that led mr henson 24 to decide that this was nothing more than the practice of 25 medicine without one single reference to seeking medical advice page 425 1 if the process doesnt work leading him to conclude it was 2 contributing to the deaths of people who he knew had died such 3 as roxanne frinn 4 the court but what is it that you need to quote 5 out of nots 34 in your examination that you cant just say 6 what 7 mr berry mr henson turning your attention 8 mr henson to the second page several lines down it talks of 9 the item being handled by blowing off bts and clusters when 10 you read that what did you understand that to mean 11 for example further down it says the item says 12 cease to read when you read that what did you understand 13 that to mean 14 ceased to read on the emeter 15 did that lead you to conclude did you reach some 16 conclusion in connection with judge gesells decision 17 yes 18 what was that conclusion 19 that the emeter was being used to treat medical 20 condition 21 how do bts in the body part what does that refer 22 to 23 it refers to problem youre having with lung 24 cancer whether its cancerous cyst or broken leg 25 what about bts and clusters being handled page 426 1 that involves the use of the emeter to inquire 2 into the bts and for example the valence down here that 3 refers to past lives going back through past lives as to their 4 as to the conditions theyve had in their past lives 5 its right here in the document 6 the court all right thats what youre going to 7 do all right mr berry stay here 8 mr berry all right 9 the court theres reason you cannot confine 10 this to specific portion of his testimony so that if we 11 decide that we should clear the courtroom for that portion you 12 can do it in that time 13 mr berry yes i can do that 14 the court mr rosen 15 mr rosen thats fine 16 i just want to say one thing and i dont make this 17 allegation lightly i want to tell you what is coming 18 mr henson has testified that he never read anything 19 about scientology in 1995 when he got involved the very first 20 time he read nots 34 was after your honor enjoined mr ward on 21 i believe the 27th of march the first time he ever read it 22 everything that mr that mr berry intends to 23 elicit from mr henson as to what he knew or understood these 24 terms to mean he got from mr berry afterwards 25 mr berry not so your honor page 427 1 mr rosen excuse after the posting 2 mr berry excuse mr henson told your honor in filing 3 declaration that the only thing he had read was nots 34 he 4 started to read nots 35 put it down it wasnt of interest to 5 him thats it 6 everything in here explaining these terms this is 7 this is verbatim affidavits mr berry has filed in other courts 8 for other clients attacking scientology 9 the evidence is going to be unless mr henson is 10 going to lie the evidence is going to be that he told your 11 honor after march 30th in preliminary injunction hearing he 12 had not read anything except nots 34 and part of nots 35 which 13 has nothing to do with this 14 and now mr berry is going to elicit that he knew at 15 the time he posted it what body thetans were 16 mr berry your honor this is once again 17 misrepresentation of the record and id like to correct it 18 the court im not going to get into that 19 mr berry i think im entitled to at least explain 20 that is not true 21 the court mr berry you have done nothing but 22 foul up this court by being late 23 im going to let you do what you want to do im 24 going to let you ask him about those im just asking you to 25 confine it to particular portion page 428 1 im going to clear the courtroom except for 2 parties and im specifically making stating that i am not 3 making finding as to whether or not this document is trade 4 secret or confidential but finding that there is enough of an 5 issue about it that i am going to temporarily clear the 6 courtroom and seal the record if any party wants to make 7 motion to unseal they can do so after proper briefing so 8 thats what im going to do 9 all i can say is without getting into it im not 10 suggesting in any way the truth or lack of truth of either 11 sides position i am hopeful and mr henson to large extent 12 i shouldnt even say to large extent mr henson to my 13 knowledge has not made an untruthful representation to this 14 court and i hope that remains on both sides part 15 mr berry and i would add your honor that the 16 contents of much of what were going to do is contained in his 17 first amended answer and his deposition 18 the court but the issue is as of march 30th what 19 was his state of mind 20 mr berry yes yes but hell testify to that 21 the court okay 22 in open court 23 the court mr berry when we get to the portion of 24 your examination where youre going to discuss specifically the 25 wording and the contents of nots 34 i want you to alert page 429 1 before you start 2 mr berry very good your honor 3 the court okay anything else 4 mr rosen your honor 5 the court okay ready 6 mr berry you wanted five minutes with your client 7 mr berry please your honor 8 the court all right then well start 9 recess 10 whereupon the following proceedings were held out 11 of the presence of the jury 12 the court with 13 mr berry there is one issue your honor on the 14 briefing and that would be relating to the testimonial 15 flipflops that i refer to anew as being part of his state of 16 mind that ms kobrins email claiming valid copyright was not 17 necessarily definitive 18 the court im not going to allow that 19 mr berry it goes to his state of mind as to 20 the court ive made my ruling 21 mr berry prima facie 22 the court ive made my ruling 23 theres couple matters that i didnt specifically 24 address before we broke 25 one is with respect to the documents mr henson was page 430 1 supposed to supply to the court i am going to allow the 2 examination as to mr hensons financial condition if mr berry 3 wants to present it with the understanding that documents will 4 be provided 5 how far mr berry how far does mr henson live 6 from the court mr berry 7 mr berry one moment 8 pause in proceedings 9 mr berry at this point your honor without 10 further advising the court were going to stay away from 11 finances 12 the court all right fine then ill understand 13 that is what youre going to do youre not going to get into 14 that issue 15 mr berry not without alerting the court and 16 giving mr rosen time to respond adequately and i dont believe 17 were going to change our position on this regard 18 the court im going to accept that as youre not 19 going to get into it and youd have to make an awfully 20 persuasive showing because at this point i was going to try to 21 do some curative thing that dealt with the production of 22 records but if youre not going to get into it it makes it all 23 academic 24 mr berry right 25 this document here your honor indicating is page 431 1 printout of all the references to the organizations criminal 2 conduct of that mr henson had in his possession before he 3 posted nots 34 can we at least refer to this 4 the court but the criminal conduct is what ive 5 ruled is irrelevant except with respect to the issue that i 6 specifically addressed and that was the alleged illegal 7 practice of medicine 8 mr berry i think we explained in our brief your 9 honor that it was state of mind that encompassed his belief 10 that the entire organization 11 the court but didnt you hear before say that 12 that was irrelevant 13 mr berry i did your honor thats why im 14 raising it again your honor especially in light of the time 15 magazine article that he read 16 the court but that goes to show that he had facts 17 in his mind that scientology was criminal organization or rtc 18 or someone associated with them was criminal organization 19 that is not relevant to the issue of whether nots 34 20 was copyrighted and whether or not there was an infringement of 21 the copyright by the posting of nots 34 22 mr berry in one final effort your honor id 23 submit its relevant to his use of copyright defense 24 the court ive made my ruling 25 if you have something that he specifically wants to page 432 1 say dr smith i read on march 1st 1996 an article by 2 dr smith that indicated that nots 34 was the illegal practice 3 of medicine and that formed my helped form my belief as to 4 that that is something that he could get into 5 but its the alleged illegal practice of medicine 6 that ive indicated is relevant area 7 or i learned from x from posting that was on 8 the internet that the nots 34 was copyrighted in suchandsuch 9 date and the copyright had expired 10 something along that line if there were evidence to 11 that would be relevant thing that would go to the state of 12 mind thats at issue in this case 13 mr berry thank you your honor 14 the court okay oh with respect to the letter 15 that is the subject of the march 30th posting i just want to 16 make sure people are clear 17 i understood and maybe i was mistaken that 18 mr henson was referring to some letter that was written prior 19 to or earlier he referenced some letter prior to the one 20 thats the subject of the posting which says according to 21 mr rosens characterization of it something thats little 22 different than whats in the march 30th posting 23 so just to make clear i understood that mr berry 24 was not going to offer and ive already indicated i wouldnt 25 allow evidence other than what was listed to be offered to try page 433 1 to admit letter that was written prior to the march 30 2 posting but it was 3 mr berry im sorry i missed the would not 4 try to what 5 the court you had told earlier that you did not 6 have letter that was written prior to the march 30 posting 7 and unless youve found such letter you werent going to seek 8 obviously to offer it 9 i have always and i thought that was something 10 different than the letter thats in the march 30 posting ive 11 always said you could introduce the march 30 posting 12 mr berry because the march 30 posting contains 13 the prior letter to this court written on april 26th 14 the court well i dont thats where i was 15 confused the april 26th 16 mr rosen march 26th 17 the court march 26th 18 mr berry march 26th 19 mr rosen i dont think mr berry intended to say 20 april your honor 21 the court march 26th if thats one and the same 22 letter i will allow the march 30th posting to come in 23 mr berry yes because that repeats the march 26th 24 letter in toto 25 the court i thought that was something different page 434 1 because the march 30 letter does not say exactly what it was 2 represented to say 3 it doesnt as i recall give some sort of 4 alternative that if i dont respond within certain number of 5 days mr henson will take particular action i dont think it 6 says something like that 7 mr berry it merely mentions that he will be in 8 the court your honor 9 the court okay well it says what it says 10 mr berry yeah 11 the court all right lets get started 12 bring the jury in 13 whereupon the following proceedings were held in 14 the presence of the jury 15 the court good afternoon everyone i apologize 16 for the delay but we had an unexpected delay because of airline 17 flights and then couple of issues came up that i didnt 18 anticipate and i had to deal with those before we were able to 19 start this afternoon 20 i think everybody is ready to go 21 before we start let just confirm i assume 22 nobody has seen or read any articles pertaining to this case or 23 any of the parties to it over the weekend 24 jurors shake heads back and forth 25 the court okay mr berry did you want to page 435 1 proceed 2 mr berry yes your honor by calling mr henson 3 to the stand 4 the court all right 5 h keith henson defense witness resumes the stand 6 the court mr henson just to remind you youre

been involved with reporting number of 24 different cases particularly one involving couple in milpitas 25 that was entrapped in my estimation by postal inspector in page 437 1 memphis i reported that one for the net shortly before i got 2 involved with this scientology business 3 and then after this got started for more than 4 year i would report occasionally the activities of this court 5 in the grady ward excuse in the erlich case and then 6 following that i started to report on the grady ward case 7 q have you testified to congress 8 yes 9 mr rosen objection your honor 10 the court i think were getting little far 11 afield i allowed the other because i thought it was relevant 12 to his state of mind and understanding of copyright law 13 if its something that relates to his understanding 14 of copyright law prior to his march 30 posting i will allow it 15 otherwise i think its irrelevant 16 the witness your honor its freedom of 17 speech 18 the court theres not question pending 19 by mr berry 20 q have you been involved in the formation of and 21 practice of certain organizations 22 yes 23 q which organizations have you been involved with 24 i was founder of the l5 society 25 q and what is the l5 society page 438 1 it was in it was an organization to promote the 2 settlement of space this was 1975 it was based around the 3 ideas of gerard k oneill of princeton 4 q does it still exist 5 it merged into another similar organization called 6 the national space institute forming an organization called the 7 national space society im still on the board of that one 8 q and have you been involved with the development of 9 cryonics 10 yes quite bit ive been involved with that 11 although im not currently on the board im very active in it 12 q and last week mr henson mr rosen read you 13 little poem was that correct rendition of that poem 14 mr rosen objection i didnt read the poem the 15 witness recited it 16 the witness thats true 17 the court wait minute i think there is an 18 objection that in essence the question misstates the prior 19 testimony 20 i would ask you to put your 21 mr berry i stand corrected 22 the court objections in legal terms mr rosen 23 the objection on the legal basis that it misstates 24 the evidence is sustained 25 rephrase the question please page 439 1 by mr berry 2 q who wrote that poem that you read 3 it is credited in the book great mambo chicken as 4 being written by curtis henderson im not absolutely certain 5 that thats true and i did manage to fluff one line in it 6 slightly 7 q and for the sake of accuracy would you please 8 requote it 9 hum 10 q for the sake of including all the lines which make 11 it more in context would you please 12 the line i fluffed was 13 mr rosen your honor 14 the court wait minute please 15 strike the comment about making it more complete 16 he can read the whole thing 17 i think were getting off the point of this case i 18 wondered why it came up before im wondering why it comes up 19 again 20 since it came up before if you want to read it to 21 put it in complete context what you feel is ill let you read 22 it whether that puts it in context or not i dont know 23 mr berry i withdraw your honor 24 q have you done writing on technical areas 25 number of them page 440 1 q can you please explain to the jury what areas youve 2 written in 3 its an eclectic bunch of things ive written 4 extensively in support of patents and electronics antilog 5 multipliers 6 when i got in the space business my first patent 7 there was on the design of space agriculture 8 i also wrote patents on construction of enormous 9 structures in space one called in vapor phase fabrication 10 and another one on using pseudofluid made its of mix 11 of dust and little bit of gas in order to use it as heat 12 transfer fluid 13 ive then written extensively on the field of 14 memetics memetics my wife actually named the field it 15 is it is the study of information patterns which infest 16 human beings kind of the way computer viruses infest computers 17 q any other areas in which youve written 18 probably ive written lot much of it has been 19 published 20 q any other patents youve been granted 21 mr rosen objection your honor this is 22 copyright case relevance 23 the court well i think were getting little off 24 point 25 if you want to explain that he has applied for and page 441 1 obtained patents thats fine but to get into details of them 2 i think is beyond the scope of this case 3 the witness six patents in variety of fields 4 by mr berry 5 q now have you been involved in the establishment 6 development and expansion of the internet 7 to minor degree my interest in the internet has 8 been primarily issues of free speech which is consistent with 9 my prior interest 10 q and how has this interest in free speech on the 11 internet manifested itself 12 well among other things with posting of nots 34 13 q well why before you got involved with ars 14 well i was involved as i mentioned before with 15 the cyber punks and their anonymous remailer networks and 16 reporting of various free speech issues on the net 17 q now did there come point in time when you became 18 aware of an internet use group called altreligion scientology 19 or ars 20 yes 21 q and when was that 22 i believe that it was january 11th 1995 23 q why does that date sorry withdrawn 24 why do you recall that date so so clearly 25 because afterwards although im not very good at page 442 1 recalling dates afterwards i remember having read number of 2 times the posting or rather the control message which was an 3 attempt as i believe was an attempt to destroy ars and of 4 course cut off the free speech rights of anybody who wanted to 5 discuss that particular topic 6 q was that an issue that disturbed you 7 oh yes 8 q and why did it disturb you 9 it was supremely unfriendly kind of an of 10 gesture for somebody to make i use the word gesture 11 because 12 mr rosen your honor this is redundant weve 13 had this exact testimony before 14 the court overruled but the jury can consider it 15 for the purposes of explaining why he remembers the date and why 16 he started monitoring or participating in ars 17 whether or not the action actually took place or who 18 did it its not offered for that purpose 19 by mr berry 20 q how did you become aware of the socalled remove 21 command 22 the information about it having happened spilled 23 into number of other groups im fairly sure that the group i 24 was monitoring at that time was one called comorgefftalk 25 but i was also watching miscellaneouslegal and it may have hit page 443 1 there as well 2 q and as result of becoming aware of the remove 3 group command did you monitor any other news groups 4 at least i dont believe that i started 5 watching any other groups as result of that 6 q there came point in time where you became aware of 7 the remove group command 8 yes 9 q did that lead you to investigate other news groups 10 mr rosen objection leading 11 the court overruled 12 the witness its actually possible that i looked 13 at news admin because it was that was one of the groups where 14 things like this get discussed in fact actually if i think 15 back i probably did look at that group 16 by mr berry 17 q how did you come to become aware of ars 18 by this act action 19 q and having become aware of ars did you proceed to 20 read any of the ars postings 21 tens of thousands of them 22 q when did you start reading ars 23 roughly the same time within day of that date 24 q were there for the sake of better word 25 affiliated news groups and internet sites to ars page 444 1 i do not remember if there were any web sites at 2 that time but there were there was and still is an 3 associated news group called altclearing technology 4 q and have you followed and participated in that news 5 group 6 not to any extent whatsoever there are 7 occasionally messages crossposted into there from altclearing 8 technology to altreligion scientology but other than those i 9 dont believe that i have ever looked in altclearing technology 10 to speak of 11 q have you how would you describe ars 12 raucous 13 q and what do you mean by raucous 14 it is one of the more intense groups that you will 15 find around in terms of many people posting on both sides of 16 the of the issues and some of them who are hard to even 17 classify its it even goes to far as to say that the group 18 gets vicious at times 19 there are number of people that i wont read at 20 all in that particular news group and because of number of 21 different reasons particularly those that post stuff which is 22 just bad enough i dont want to see it at all 23 q what happens sorry withdrawn 24 are you familiar with term called kill file 25 oh yes kill file or as i usually refer to it page 445 1 twit file 2 q and what do you mean by kill file 3 mr rosen your honor i object were going very 4 far afield this has nothing to do with the posting or the 5 issues that are being tried 6 the court it appears that we are going pretty far 7 afield mr berry so ill sustain the objection 8 by mr berry 9 q you referred to issues in connection with ars what 10 do you mean by issues on ars 11 well usually it starts out as threads in ars which 12 are long series of postings and typical thread might start by 13 someone posting an affidavit 14 i wont give specific example because anyway 15 but then people will follow up on that and people will say i 16 had very similar experience to that and will give times and 17 dates many of these stories are pretty gruesome 18 the other things that will be posted typically is 19 transcripts of television and radio shows court papers there 20 are thousands of court papers that have been posted on it the 21 proceedings of this court for example have been extracted and 22 posted on it 23 mr rosen your honor im going to object to this 24 and move to strike it the best evidence of what was posted are 25 copies of the postings page 446 1 the court overruled go ahead 2 by mr berry 3 q and once posted do these materials sometimes remain 4 elsewhere on the internet 5 very often they remain for considerable length of 6 time theres service called deja news that collects postings 7 and indexes them for people to be able to search later and you 8 can search back long way six months typically and sometimes 9 into years back for things which have been posted on the net 10 before 11 q is that something youve done from time to time 12 ive occasionally searched back into that ive 13 done it relatively seldom but i have done it 14 q and do some of the participants in ars have their 15 own internet sites 16 mr rosen objection foundation 17 the court overruled i think he can testify as to 18 that 19 the witness yes i believe im sure that is 20 true number of people are actually like the sys ops or 21 owned or own the systems on which theyre posting from 22 by mr berry 23 q and are some of the documents that you have read on 24 ars available on other sites or web sites or web pages 25 fairly large number of them almost everything page 447 1 thats that has longterm significance court files fbi files 2 first person stories of their experiences all those things tend 3 to get webbed they tend to get extracted from ars and wind up 4 on longterm storage on web sites 5 theres vast amount of material out there it is 6 in the its in the equivalent of tens of thousands of books 7 q now in between january 11 1995 and march 30 1996 8 when you posted the nots 34 document how frequently would you 9 say that you accessed ars 10 sometimes more than daily i would sometimes sign 11 on twice day i seldom spent less than say 45 minutes on 12 it 13 q and what sort of things did you learn when you 14 accessed ars during that interval between january 11th 1995 15 and march 30 1996 without going to some of the things weve 16 talked about before 17 mr rosen objection 18 the court could you narrow that question little 19 bit please im not sure what youre getting at 20 by mr berry 21 q did you review posts that dealt with the alleged 22 unlawful practice of medicine by the church of scientology on 23 the internet between january 11 1995 and march 30 1996 24 many of them 25 q can you recall some of these posts page 448 1 mr rosen your honor i object to the question to 2 the extent were going beyond nots 34 if he wants to talk 3 about what he read 4 the court all right youve made your objection 5 by mr berry 6 q did some of these postings 7 the court wait minute youve got to wait for 8 ruling 9 lets limit the question at this point to nots 34 10 by mr berry 11 q during that 14month period of time did you see 12 references to nots 34 on ars 13 yes certainly in fact nots 34 itself was posted 14 many times 15 q and how were you 16 mr rosen objection your honor i move to strike 17 that 18 the court overruled go ahead 19 by mr berry 20 q and how were you aware of that 21 this is little bit this will take little bit 22 of explanation 23 i read really fast which is the only way you can 24 keep up with reading something which runs to the equivalent of 25 novel or two per day and i skipped through lot of this page 449 1 material 2 occasionally when i run across something which looks 3 reasonably interesting but is too long to be interesting while 4 reading it on the screen i will snag it into buffer and save 5 it 6 the scientology stuff thats posted for very long 7 time though i snagged it snagged nots 34 into buffer several 8 times as it was posted as pieces of other material and i saw it 9 obviously as it went by it didnt make lot of sense because 10 it takes an enormous amount of context in order to have any idea 11 of what some highly esoteric kind of document like nots 34 12 would mean 13 so i dont know whether that really answers the 14 question or not but it gives you the background for what i had 15 i did 16 q did you become aware of something called an emeter 17 oh yes emeters are fundamental to the 18 scientology processing and for that matter dianetics 19 processing 20 q and would you explain your understanding of what an 21 emeter is and how it is used 22 mr rosen objection 23 the court all right sustained hed have to 24 have some foundation for his understanding 25 what were interested in is what facts or purported page 450 1 facts he learned prior to his posting 2 by mr berry 3 q in connection with the emeter did you learn what 4 it is from reading the news group ars 5 yes 6 q and what did you learn in that regard 7 the emeter is resistance meter 8 q and what do you mean by that 9 it is the kind of thing that engineers would use in 10 order to measure whether light bulb had been burned out or the 11 value of resistor you can do your own emeter by grabbing 12 you can make your own emeter by grabbing the leads an on 13 ometer and squeezing them its it will deflect the needle 14 when you do this 15 q when you say itll deflect the needle what do you 16 mean by that 17 current flows through your body human bodies are 18 somewhat conductive especially when your hands are sweaty 19 and you can by squeezing them at various amounts 20 you can do various vary the amount of conduction that the 21 meter sees and reduce the resistance from oh if youre 22 touching them lightly say 100000 ohms down to maybe 20000 or 23 10000 ohms if you squeeze them slightly 24 q from what you read on ars about the emeter can you 25 describe in essence what it is page 451 1 well total hocum 2 q beyond that 3 mr rosen your honor i object to that 4 the court sustained stricken 5 he can tell us what specifically he read so that we 6 can know what his state of mind was but his characterization of 7 something as hocum or not hocum is really not helpful 8 by mr berry 9 q are you able from what you read on ars did you 10 form conclusion as to what an emeter is 11 yes i did 12 q and in your mind what is it 13 its device 14 q im sorry in your mind prior to march 30th 1996 15 what was it 16 its basically an ometer that has that they use 17 couple of soup cans on as contact points for people to heal 18 them 19 q and what is an ometer 20 an ometer 21 q yeah 22 its just sorry its just thing to measure 23 its also known as wheat stone bridge but its mechanism 24 that measures resistance and thats really all that an emeter 25 does to people page 452 1 q now from your review of ars postings did you form 2 belief as to whether the emeter had some place in the church 3 of scientology 4 yes it is absolutely central to the practice in 5 scientology called auditing 6 mr rosen objection foundation and to the 7 extent it is being offered as truthful there is basis for 8 this 9 the court all right let instruct the jury 10 what mr henson is testifying to now is what he 11 indicates he learned from reading material on this ars news 12 group 13 whether or not what he learned is true or not true 14 what he says is not evidence of that and whether an emeter is 15 or is not what he says it is is not really relevant issue in 16 this case 17 the relevant issue in this case is mr hensons good 18 faith and reasonable belief at the time he posted nots 34 19 so mr hensons description of what an emeter is 20 cannot be considered for the truth of the statement as to what 21 an emeter is in other words is that in fact what an 22 emeter is it can only be considered for determining what 23 mr hensons good faith reasonable belief was at the time he 24 posted it 25 by mr berry page 453 1 q and at the time you posted nots 34 mr henson what 2 was your belief regarding the place and use of the emeter by 3 the church of scientology 4 it is used it is widely used for number of 5 things in scientology it is used for for auditing and it is 6 used for something thats called security checks or sec checks 7 q what are sorry at the time you posted nots 34 8 what was your understanding of sec check 9 mr rosen objection may we approach 10 the court all right 11 sidebar discussion off the record 12 by mr berry 13 q now on march 30 1996 what was your understanding 14 of sec check in the church of scientology 15 its its well i have to be very 16 constrained about what i say 17 but when somebody is believed to have committed 18 crime against scientology they are subjected to sec checking in 19 order to the emeter itself is one component of lie 20 detectors and they tend to use it in the direction of using it 21 to find out whether or not someone is telling the truth about 22 the money that disappeared from the petty cash fund 23 mr rosen your honor i move to strike this this 24 has nothing to do with nots 34 and this is scurrilous his 25 testimony page 454 1 the court please make your objections just in the 2 legal form 3 whether or not mr henson is accurately describing 4 the practices of scientology is not the issue in this case 5 again were dealing with the issue of his state of 6 mind at the time he posted nots 34 did he believe that he was 7 posting someones copyrighted work or did he post in reckless 8 disregard of finding out whether the work was copyrighted did 9 he reasonably believe that it was not copyrighted did he have 10 good faith belief that if it were copyrighted good faith 11 and reasonable belief that he had defense to copyright 12 infringement action if in fact the document he posted was 13 copyrighted as of the date he posted it those are the issues 14 the beliefs of scientology are not relevant to the 15 issues in this case other than the beliefs that mr henson had 16 in his mind as to what scientology or what nots 34 meant at the 17 time he posted it and whether or not it meant what he thought 18 it did that provided any sort of trumping or defense to 19 copyright infringement action if he believed the material was 20 copyrighted and he recklessly disregarded whether it was 21 copyrighted 22 go ahead 23 by mr berry 24 q now as of march 30 1996 what had you learned from 25 ars regarding the process known as auditing page 455 1 vast amount by that point 2 q well first of all on march 30 1996 what was your 3 understanding of auditing itself 4 the court as related to nots 34 5 mr berry well im going from the general to the 6 specific your honor 7 the court well it really doesnt have any bearing 8 on the issues in this case unless were relating it to nots 34 9 the witness it does 10 mr berry i mean 11 the court cant you narrow the question and get 12 what youre after 13 mr berry not really your honor its its 14 closely intertwined 15 the court all right go ahead but im going to 16 strike it if its not relevant to our issues 17 by mr berry 18 q what is your understanding of what auditing is 19 auditing is process where somebody is the 20 person whos being audited sits holding the two cans from the 21 emeter and is typically asked long series of questions many 22 of which have been posted ad nauseam on altreligion 23 scientology they ask questions have you ever enslaved 24 race have you 25 mr rosen your honor i object to this this has page 456 1 nothing to do with nots 34 2 the court sustained 3 the witness its long its process 4 mr rosen your honor theres question pending 5 the court i think there is the question is what 6 is the auditing process 7 the witness auditing typically is this process 8 where you sit there holding these cans and somebody asks you 9 very long series of questions it involves intense focus of 10 attention between two people and that itself has strange 11 psychological effects on people that i could go into 12 mr rosen objection 13 the witness if i could 14 the court all right that last part of the answer 15 is stricken theres foundation for that comment 16 by mr berry 17 q now as of march 30 1996 had you learned of 18 court decision delivered by judge gesell from your reading of 19 the postings on ars 20 yes 21 q and first of all who is judge gesell 22 he was federal judge and i say was because hes 23 been dead for some years now who was involved with rulings when 24 the food and drug administration filed suit against 25 scientology in the late 60s page 457 1 q and from your readings prior to march 30 1996 what 2 was your understanding of what that case was all about and how 3 it concluded 4 the court let just make clear that this is his 5 understanding this should not be considered for whether or not 6 thats what the ruling said this is just his understanding 7 the witness my understanding of the ruling which 8 i had read before that point in time before march 30 was that 9 scientology had agreed whatever organizations whatever parts 10 of scientology were being parties to this lawsuit they had 11 agreed to put sticker on the emeters saying specifically that 12 they have curative or otherwise powers involving practicing 13 of medicine 14 and that also they were forbidden scientology and 15 all related kinds of organizations were forbidden forever in 16 making claims that they that auditing could cure physical 17 illnesses 18 by mr berry 19 q what was your understanding as to who brought this 20 lawsuit 21 the food and drug administration 22 q what was your understanding as to how scientology 23 was forbidden from making curative claims in connection with the 24 emeter 25 they were as far as i could tell completely page 458 1 forbidden from making such claims 2 q and in what manner did the court forbid them 3 i do not remember the exact details of the wording 4 that the judge used in that case but the gist of it was that 5 they were forbidden from making such claims 6 q was there an injunction in that case 7 oh yes it was in the form of permanent 8 injunction 9 q was it your understanding in march on march 30 10 1996 that the judges injunction in that case was every bit as 11 constraining as the judges injunction on you in this case 12 mr rosen objection form 13 the court sustained 14 rephrase the question 15 by mr berry 16 q on march 30 1996 was it your understanding that 17 that injunction carried with it possible criminal and financial 18 and civil penalties 19 as far as i know all injunctions do that 20 q now 21 i did actually mention that 22 the court theres question pending 23 the witness okay 24 by mr berry 25 q prior to march 30 1996 from your review of ars and page 459 1 other documents and sites had you become aware of something 2 known as scientologys upper level or advanced materials 3 oh yes 4 q and without describing their contents could you 5 indicate briefly what your understanding in that regard was 6 mr rosen objection to the extent its beyond nots 7 34 8 the court ill allow the question in very general 9 terms but this case obviously doesnt concern anything other 10 than nots 34 11 so just give very basic description 12 the witness the material which was the reason i 13 knew about the material was because it had been posted widely 14 upon the internet many times by 15 the court thats not the question mr henson 16 answer the question please 17 the witness my understanding of the material it 18 has to do with scientologys world view which you absolutely 19 have to have in order to have any understanding of what nots 34 20 is about 21 by mr berry 22 q had you for example heard of some documents called 23 ot i through ot viii 24 yes i had 25 q and did you acquire an understanding prior to march page 460 1 30 1996 that the emeter and auditing process processes were 2 involved with those levels 3 yes i had 4 q and prior to march 30 1996 had you become aware of 5 some documents called nots 6 i had been vaguely aware of them back as far as 7 almost year before that because they had been posted on the 8 net as part of scamizdat 3 which was dated around april of 95 9 q and what was scamizdat 3 spelled scamizdat 10 it was one of series long series i think it 11 went up to 11 of documents that were posted by parties unknown 12 on the net through the anonymous remailer network 13 q and without describing the contents of the nots 14 series did you have any understanding as to whether they were 15 part of the scientology upper levels 16 yes they were 17 q and 18 that was my understanding rather 19 q and had you become aware of the use of the emeter 20 and auditing in connection with the nots portion of the upper 21 levels 22 mr rosen objection your honor foundation 23 that this relates to nots 34 we keep oh ill save the 24 commentary 25 mr berry ill withdraw the question your honor page 461 1 the court all right 2 by mr berry 3 q had you was it your understanding as of march 30 4 1996 that nots 34 was part of the nots portion of the upper 5 levels ot i through ot viii 6 it is actually much more complicated than that 7 q could you explain why 8 this is again my belief which it may not be 9 accurate but if i if i understand this correctly the 10 operating thetan or ot levels originally went up to viii the 11 levels above iii were withdrawn and replaced by nots and i 12 really dont know exactly where how the various nots documents 13 replace what sections of the 50 some odd nots documents replace 14 what sections of the ot levels 15 its sufficiently complicated that im not sure that 16 there are too many people who are not scientologists who 17 understand it and im not sure that they all do 18 q was it your understanding that auditing and the 19 emeter was used in connection with the nots series of 20 materials 21 mr rosen objection both leading as well as 22 relationship to nots 34 23 the court overruled 24 go ahead 25 the witness im sorry could you repeat page 462 1 by mr berry 2 q was it your understanding prior to march 30 1996 3 that proper use of the nots materials involved auditing with an 4 emeter 5 yes it has to do with the wording that is in nots 6 34 7 q well come to that later 8 how many people generally are used sorry 9 withdrawn 10 explain audit for moment for the jury little 11 more does auditing involve one or two people 12 mr rosen objection foundation this witness 13 knows anything about it 14 the court again it can be offered solely for his 15 state of mind 16 i would ask you to rephrase the question as to his 17 understanding prior to the time that he posted on march 30th 18 and again its offered for his understanding not 19 whether its true or whether its an accurate statement of what 20 goes on in auditing in the scientology religion or not 21 the witness as i understand there are two 22 varieties of auditing one of them which uses what was called an 23 auditor person supposedly trained in this business and the 24 other one which is called solo auditing where person watches 25 the emeter by themselves page 463 1 by mr berry 2 q now when one is using an auditor how many people 3 are involved in that process 4 two 5 q is an auditor was it your understanding that just 6 anyone could be an auditor 7 the court again this refers to before march 30th 8 1996 your understanding 9 the witness there are i understood this as well 10 as i could there are many levels of auditors as well as many 11 levels of operating thetans within the scientology 12 and whether somebody can in theory audit someone 13 on the various levels depends on their the level the person who 14 is auditing is to the best of my understanding of the matter 15 by mr berry 16 q prior to march 30 1996 had you acquired any 17 knowledge as to whether the emeter could be used in connection 18 with claims of medical cures and processes and treatments 19 scientology is simply full of this and yes i had 20 seen 21 mr rosen objection your honor 22 the witness hundreds 23 mr rosen i move to strike this 24 the witness the answer is yes 25 the court the legal objection is page 464 1 mr rosen relevance to nots 34 2 the court sustained 3 youll have to tie it into nots 34 4 by mr berry 5 q were going to come to nots 34 in detail later but 6 as of march 30 1996 was it your understanding that nots 34 7 involved the practice of medicine 8 yes 9 q was it your understanding as of march 30 1996 10 that nots 34 involved the use of the emeter in the auditing 11 process 12 yes 13 q was it your understanding that there were other 14 documents in addition to nots 34 that dealt with medical 15 claims and practices of scientology 16 mr rosen objection 17 the court answer that yes or 18 the witness yes 19 by mr berry 20 q did you acquire any knowledge prior to march 30 21 1996 as to what other scientology documents might relate to the 22 unlawful practice of medicine 23 mr rosen objection 24 the witness yes 25 the court sustained were talking about nots 34 page 465 1 by mr berry 2 q prior to march 30 1996 had you acquired any 3 knowledge as to whether the emeter and auditing process could 4 be dangerous 5 yes 6 q and how did you acquire that knowledge 7 hundreds to thousands of postings that i read 8 q and from those postings what did you learn in that 9 regard 10 mr rosen objection not limited to nots 34 11 the court i think hes testified that he 12 understood that nots 34 involved the use of the emeter in 13 auditing 14 i would ask you to break down the question as to 15 what he learned if anything with respect to whether the use of 16 an emeter in auditing and in connection with nots 34 was 17 dangerous 18 by mr berry 19 q prior to march 30 1996 did you acquire any 20 information leading you to believe that the use of the emeter 21 in medical treatment such as nots 34 could be dangerous 22 mr rosen objection 23 the court sustained 24 rephrase the question please 25 by mr berry page 466 1 q prior to march 30 1996 did you believe that the 2 use of the emeter in connection with nots 34 could be 3 dangerous 4 yes 5 q and what did you learn in that regard 6 the witness your honor could i briefly talk to my 7 lawyer on this because i if i answer this question im 8 afraid ill violate 9 mr berry may i approach your honor may i 10 approach the witness your honor and find out what his problem 11 is 12 the court why dont we take short break at this 13 time well be in recess for ten minutes 14 recess 15 the court all right mr berry you may proceed 16 mr berry i think at this point your honor i 17 want the jury to get the unexpurgated version of nots 34 and 18 commence the examination of the actual contents of the document 19 and i have copies for the jury 20 the court could i see what you have please 21 mr berry yeah handing 22 the court mr rosen 23 sidebar discussion on the record 24 the court mr berry 25 mr berry yes page 467 1 the court what youve handed is not my 2 understanding of what was posted on march 30th this is what i 3 understand was posted handing 4 this is what he handed to handing 5 mr berry okay okay thats fine by your 6 honor i can work with that 7 the court do you disagree thats the 8 mr berry yes thats certainly what it says 9 the court thats the posting that was the basis of 10 the summary judgment motion i believe 11 mr rosen how many copies does the court have 12 the court i made enough for everyone 13 mr berry okay nicely threehole punched i 14 would envision wed call it defendants exhibit 15 the court thats not what hes offering do you 16 agree mr rosen that this is the posting that was taken 17 from just so both sides will know from the summary judgment 18 motion is my understanding 19 mr rosen yes this is what was posted on march 20 30th 21 the court okay 22 mr rosen i do just for the record i think im 23 probably redundant i think ive noted my objections both to 24 nots 34 per but also to posting of the material surrounding 25 it which is the with mr hensons comments and his letter to page 468 1 the court 2 the court i understand 3 mr rosen i said i think im being redundant 4 the court i appreciate your objection 5 mr berry handing 6 in open court 7 the court all right at this time i would ask 8 that except for the parties to this action the courtroom be 9 cleared 10 and just to make clear the reason im doing it is 11 that theres going to be some discussion of nots 34 which the 12 plaintiff rtc considers confidential unpublished document 13 obviously mr berry and his client mr henson 14 disagree with whether its confidential document 15 i am making determination of that issue but in 16 light of the contention of the parties and information that has 17 been presented to i think there is basis for clearing the 18 courtroom without prejudice to anyone seeking to petition the 19 court for copy of any information that has been filed in this 20 case or to review any sealed portion of the transcript 21 but at this time i would ask those other than 22 parties to the action to please step out of the courtroom 23 courtroom cleared only parties present 24 mr berry your honor can mr hensons wife 25 remain page 469 1 the witness its okay 2 the court everybody i think it applies to 3 everyone or rather it does apply to everyone 4 mr berry is there one extra your honor so i 5 make sure i work off the same chart here 6 the court yes handing 7 all right well mark that defendants exhibit 8 i dont think we wrote on that its defendants 9 exhibit if you want to write that on it you may 10 defendants exhibit was marked for identification 11 12 by mr berry 13 q mr henson i have placed before you and the jury 14 now has before it document that has been identified as 15 defendants exhibit 16 is defendants exhibit true and correct copy as 17 far as you can tell of the internet posting regarding nots 34 18 that you made initially on march 30 1996 19 well again with the fact that this has been out of 20 my hands and i cant really authenticate it without 21 characterbycharacter comparison for the purposes of this i 22 would say it almost certainly is it looks i dont see 23 anything out of place on it 24 q now when you posted nots 34 to the internet on 25 march 30 1996 had something occurred which prompted you to do page 470 1 so 2 yes 3 q and what was that 4 i had talked i had delivered letter to the 5 court some i guess four days before that and then had talked 6 to the to judge whytes clerk after the after hearing with 7 grady ward it specifically said after talking to the court 8 today i feel safe in posting this letter 9 q now what had occurred in connection with grady ward 10 that led you to eventually post nots 34 11 well its written into the letter itself the 12 church of scientology had sued grady ward and temporary 13 restraining order had been issued against grady ward and all 14 persons in active concert and i was i wrote the letter 15 originally in the interest of asking for clarification on it 16 q had prior to posting nots 34 did you attend 17 hearing in the ward case 18 yes i did 19 q and what occurred during that hearing 20 to the best of my understanding of it mr ward was 21 enjoined from posting nots 34 and all other bits and pieces of 22 scientologys upper level materials 23 q and had the extent of that injunction become part of 24 the court record 25 i believe it did and it had also more important page 471 1 for my purposes it had become part of the record on 2 altreligion scientology because it is my recollection although 3 i may be wrong on this that ms kobrin posted posted this 4 material onto altreligion scientology sort of as blanket 5 notification 6 q now did you copy any portion of the courts files 7 in the ward case 8 i might have but i dont i know i did later but 9 i dont believe i had done so at that time 10 q did something cause you to download nots 34 from the 11 internet 12 actually its described in here what i did in the 13 what the second paragraph on the second page 14 q so when you say its described in here referring to 15 defendants exhibit 16 right 17 q does the last paragraph of the first page and the 18 first two paragraphs of the second page describe what you did 19 why and how 20 right it specifically says it was the letter 21 was addressed of course to judge whyte and upon reading it i 22 sorted the list of documents attached and ran text search 23 this is much like you would do if you had word 24 processor open and you wanted to find all the cases of some word 25 that showed up in document that you were working on page 472 1 so i ran similar kind of character on whats 2 called the news spool on netcom netcom has the material which 3 is in the news spool in particular place its in i dont 4 remember the exact thing but its in 5 newsaltreligionscientology and when you get down to that 6 final directory inside of that directory theres thing which 7 is equivalent to thing which is equivalent to text search 8 across large number of documents and its called grep 9 its short for get regular expression and i ran 10 that particular command in there with some set of key words that 11 had showed up in the tro itself in order to see if the 12 material that had been that grady ward had been enjoined from 13 posting was still on the news spool at netcom 14 it was very often not there because it had either 15 expired or somebody had canceled it but it was in this case 16 i found actually if i remember two there were two 17 postings to altreligion scientology that contained nots 34 and 18 several other of the nots series documents 19 q now in paragraph 1 you refer to 100000 people 20 perhaps reading it where did you get that figure from 21 its as they say wild guess it was it 22 was judge whytes or rather yes judge whytes tro was 23 posted across four news groups that are pretty big active news 24 groups comporgefftalk comp dot org dot eff dot 25 talk for example has an estimated readership thats in page 473 1 the tens of thousands 2 q and this injunction among other things enjoined 3 all persons in active concert as you state in paragraph 1 4 correct 5 thats the way it read 6 q now did that lead you to do something 7 well yes i got i wrote this letter to 8 judge whyte 9 q now why did you write this letter to judge whyte 10 well its pretty much selfexplanatory but i was 11 curious because it seems to that the way it was being 12 presented on the internet by being posted on the internet it 13 seemed to that it was at least implying that it was it was 14 to apply to all people on the net at least that was the way 15 that many that i interpreted it the explanation around it 16 which had been written by ms kobrin 17 mr rosen objection your honor 18 the witness thats the way i interpreted it im 19 sorry 20 the court go ahead wait for the question 21 by mr berry 22 q you wrote to judge whyte what did you do with the 23 letter 24 i printed the letter off and i brought it down to 25 the court and i turned it in at the clerks office page 474 1 q and when was that 2 i believe it was the 26th 3 q and what was your intent sorry 4 was your intent in doing that set forth in the 5 letter defendants exhibit 6 i believe it is it was primarily clarification 7 that i was requesting at the time i did not understand that 8 you really cant ask judge question like that 9 q and 10 the court this is probably an appropriate time to 11 instruct the jury 12 judge is not permitted to give legal advice 13 therefore it is inappropriate for judge to advise person 14 who is not party in case as to the affect or interpretation 15 of court order 16 by mr berry 17 q and on march 30 1996 had you received response 18 from judge whyte to your letter 19 and i now understand why 20 q had you spoken to anyone at the court regarding the 21 letter you sent to judge whyte 22 yes i did it would have been on the 29th there 23 was hearing before judge whyte on grady wards case and i 24 asked the i asked his clerk about the letter and the letter 25 itself promises within the letter promises that i would page 475 1 friday i will provide to you letter from mr arnie lerma from 2 mr arnie lerma about the stocks belonging to mr lerma in 3 related case 4 and i printed that letter out which if i remember 5 correctly was quite pain because it didnt come through very 6 well and i gave that letter to the judges clerk 7 and i also asked her if the judge had read my 8 letter and i didnt get definitive answer on that but the 9 only thing i did get from the clerk was the obvious observation 10 that i was not party to the case 11 q now from being told that you werent party to the 12 case did you form any conclusion in your own mind as to whether 13 the judges injunction applied to you 14 well it says on the very first right after it 15 says shelley thomson posted after talking to the court today i 16 feel safe in posting this letter because i was not identified 17 as party to the action 18 q and on march 30 1996 was it your state of mind 19 that if the court had disagreed with your position you would 20 have heard from the court 21 i fully admit that i was wrong in that opinion at 22 the time but that was my opinion at the time what can i say 23 im wrong 24 q so you had provided the court with nots 34 in the 25 erroneous belief that if you couldnt post it you would be page 476 1 hearing from the court telling you that correct 2 mr rosen your honor i think were getting to the 3 point 4 the court well 5 mr rosen leading questions 6 the court i think its leading so ill sustain 7 it 8 by mr berry 9 q on march 30 1996 not having received response 10 from judge whyte 11 mr rosen objection misstates the testimony the 12 witness just said he got response from your law clerk on march 13 29th 14 the court i dont think thats what he i think 15 you said law clerk i dont think he said law clerk theres 16 distinction between the two 17 mr rosen clerk 18 the court clerk 19 mr rosen im sorry clerk 20 by mr berry 21 q on march 30 1996 having spoken to the court clerk 22 not having received an actual response from judge whyte did you 23 reach conclusion in your own mind as to whether or not you 24 could post nots 34 to the internet 25 yes i did page 477 1 q and what was that conclusion 2 my conclusion was that it it looked like i could 3 safely post it to the internet under my own name pointing out 4 what it was about 5 q now turning your attention sorry withdrawn 6 between january 11 1995 and march 30 1996 had 7 you encountered nots 34 on the internet 8 yes i had 9 q on about how many occasions 10 oh 20 maybe 11 q and had you become aware of anyone being sued for 12 posting nots 34 13 mr rosen objection what relevance does that 14 have to this case 15 mr berry to his state of mind your honor 16 the court i think it arguably goes to his state of 17 minute ill allow it 18 the witness i dont believe that anyone had been 19 sued during that time with the exception of grady ward there 20 were certainly other lawsuits going at that time 21 by mr berry 22 q and had 23 over other materials 24 q and during your view of nots 34 during that 25 intervening 14 months had you formed any conclusions in your page 478 1 own mind regarding the nature of nots 34 2 actually not my i had i had obviously seen 3 it come across it number of times and it had not made any 4 sense to without the extensive context that you need to 5 understand document like this 6 and so my actual my actual point at which i 7 understood what it was about was actually probably on the 20 8 somewhere after the 20th because i dont think i i think i 9 wrote this letter over maybe one or two days 10 so the grady ward tro had been posted i went 11 looking for the various things which were on it to see what they 12 were about and i looked at it at that point although i had 13 seen it before it had just gone by on my screen and i had never 14 really paid much attention to it 15 q and referring to paragraph two of your letter 16 exhibit defendants exhibit the second paragraph on the 17 second page nots 34 was the first document that turned up 18 yes it was 19 q and you said that it didnt make any sense during 20 the preceding year or so that you had become familiar with it on 21 the internet could you briefly explain why that was 22 well theres lot of stuff in here that doesnt 23 make lot of sense i mean blow all these off for example 24 what on earth would that mean handle all such bts and 25 clusters by blowing them off page 479 1 it wasnt until i had read ot iii and bunch of 2 other peoples explanation of this material that i had any idea 3 of what of what it was i probably could have understood nots 4 34 lot earlier than i did perhaps six or eight months 5 earlier but like i say i was not inspired to do so until the 6 grady ward tro 7 q and why did that inspire you to do so 8 well i became curious although in actuality the 9 same material had been enjoined in the erlich case and i 10 probably had seen it much much well i know i had seen it at 11 least in april of 95 but at that point it didnt make lot 12 of sense 13 but the reason i was inspired was because here was 14 somebody who to the best of my knowledge was the only thing 15 that hed been doing was fairly vicious criticism of 16 scientology and here he was being sued for an amount for 17 mr rosen objection your honor this is the ward 18 case that the witness is testifying to now 19 the court whats the relevance of that 20 mr berry the what led him to post it your 21 honor and i think its probably on here that he felt it 22 constrained his first amendment 23 the court well lets let him testify not you 24 ill allow the question 25 go ahead page 480 1 by mr berry 2 q did you post did you have any intention of making 3 money from posting nots 34 4 5 q did you have any intention of using nots 34 as part 6 of scientology processing on your own 7 definitely not 8 q what was your intent in posting nots 34 on march 30 9 1996 10 its pretty much written into it it was 11 question was it your intent speaking to judge whyte for 12 this order to apply to random persons on the internet such as 13 myself 14 and then if so i believe the tro is 15 violation of my first amendment rights to discuss the criminal 16 activities of the cult of scientology 17 q now as of march 30 1996 you had begun to 18 understand what nots 34 was all about is that fair to say 19 absolutely 20 q lets turn now to nots 34 as contained in your 21 letter defendants exhibit and it starts off hubbord 22 communications office saint hill manor 23 did you have any understanding as to what hubbord 24 communications office at saint hill manor was 25 oh yes page 481 1 q and what was that understanding 2 mr rosen can we have the basis of this 3 understanding your honor and again limiting instruction that 4 this is not 5 the court obviously his understanding of this nots 6 34 and information on it theres foundation that he has 7 basis for knowing that 8 as matter of fact the question is what 9 information had he been provided that led him to have good 10 faith and reasonable belief to whatever was in his mind at the 11 time of the posting 12 let see if i can give you an example to explain 13 that further if your child came home from school and said 14 or maybe i shouldnt say your child because that kind of colors 15 it little bit 16 if somebody comes up to you on the street and said 17 i saw the bank robbed next two streets over well you could 18 consider that evidence for determining whether the person that 19 heard that had good faith belief that the bank two streets 20 over got robbed 21 but the person who heard that comment would not be 22 in position to testify as to whether or not in fact the bank 23 got robbed because all hes learned is what somebody else has 24 told him he has personal knowledge himself 25 so what mr henson is testifying to is what he page 482 1 learned from others that who apparently according to him told 2 him certain things and what he may have read that somebody 3 identified as some documents related to scientology 4 whether or not what those persons told him is 5 accurate or not or whether what he read were actually 6 scientology documents you cannot consider his testimony for 7 that purpose 8 by mr berry 9 q now all these questions im going to ask you are as 10 of march 30 1996 11 understood 12 q okay what was your understanding in connection 13 with hubbord communications office saint hill manor 14 it was the place that hubbord was living or at 15 least running the business that he was running at that or 16 rather running scientology out of at that point in england 17 q and what was your understanding of what an hco 18 bulletin of 14 november 1978 was 19 these things are specified by dates they were 20 actually produced over period of time and distributed very 21 often by telex and other kind of means they were sort of 22 continuous stream of this material which came out over an 23 extended period of time couple or three years 24 and they theyre dated and theres bunch of 25 standard kinds of format on them like this this is one of page 483 1 this is the 34th one in the sequence 2 most of them ive actually have seen all of them 3 by now but most of them 4 mr rosen your honor im going to object to 5 anything that the witness is going to gratuitously offer as to 6 what he learned after november 30 excuse after march 30th 7 the court confine your answer to march 30th and 8 before 9 the witness this is 34 out of about 50 of them 10 by mr berry 11 q it actually said ned for ots ots series 34 correct 12 yeah that expanded means new era dianetics for 13 operating thetans 14 q what is an operating thetan according to your 15 understanding 16 nothing 17 q what is your understanding of its meaning in 18 scientology 19 operating thetan is level so when you reach it 20 youre supposed to have various powers 21 q and on the basis of your understanding what is 22 thetan in scientology 23 mr rosen your honor im going to object to this 24 this has nothing to do with the issue of whether nots 34 is 25 as the witness has now page 484 1 the court lets confine the questions to what in 2 this if anything he believed at the time he posted it was 3 illegal or unauthorized practice of medicine 4 mr berry id submit its foundational your 5 honor but ill move on 6 q on the left of this document dated 14 november 1978 7 theres three lines do you see that 8 yes 9 q do you have any understanding as to what those three 10 lines meant 11 i cannot swear to that it was obviously addressed 12 to various people by categories in various organizations there 13 were number of organizations number of places where this 14 material was made available to members of scientology 15 q and theres reference to auditors in that group 16 of that three lines there 17 yes 18 q when you read it did you reach any conclusion as to 19 what that meant 20 well it was obviously addressed to auditors that 21 had certain fairly high level in this in this business 22 q now underneath ned for ots series 34 are the 23 words the sequence for handling physical condition 24 thats right 25 q did that did those words lead you to page 485 1 conclusion 2 mr rosen objection your honor this is leading 3 the witness yes 4 the court i dont think that question is 5 objectionable on the basis of leading theres fine line on 6 that issue but i think its just directing him to particular 7 language 8 go ahead but yeah go ahead 9 the witness repeat on there what 10 by mr berry 11 q having read those words did you reach conclusion 12 not just from the words although you have to kind 13 of have little bit of feeling for the specific word for 14 handling for example 15 many many things in scientology have to be handled 16 and its word of great importance for them you have to it 17 implies that you have to deal with something 18 q so as well all these questions are as of march 19 30 1996 20 so what was your understanding of the word 21 handling as it applied in scientology 22 mr rosen your honor i object i thought the 23 the court weve got to have some basis for where 24 this comes from what he just read and understood 25 mr berry well let try and shortcut this your page 486 1 honor 2 mr rosen your honor my objection went to an 3 additional point the ruling you made few moments ago and 4 that is what is there in this document that mr henson believed 5 was illegal 6 mr berry well were getting to that counsel 7 the court well address please not each 8 other 9 i would like to focus on that issue because i think 10 thats one of the issues that you raised in this case and i 11 dont want to get sidetracked into considering other aspects of 12 scientology that dont have any relationship to whats at issue 13 in your mind with respect to nots 34 14 mr berry well your honor with all due respect 15 its i need to go sequentially in order to bring out the 16 the court all right go ahead but just keep the 17 focus please 18 by mr berry 19 q in connection with your knowledge on march 30 1996 20 where had you acquired that knowledge regarding nots 34 21 well from reading thousands of postings on the net 22 which got you into the jargon of scientology handle and 23 fully handle and those are the kinds of words 24 but you cant really read this thing bit at time 25 and really i dont believe you can read it bit at time and page 487 1 understand it very well its gestalt if you will 2 q and what is gestalt 3 its its an overall understanding of whats 4 involved here 5 q and from the overall document did you reach 6 conclusion as to what its purpose and function was 7 yes 8 q and what was that conclusion 9 well in the intervening time in fact shortly 10 before that i had read the gesell judge gesells decision on 11 this and it dawned on that i had smoking gun because this 12 is the sequence for handling physical condition and then 13 its you know for handling all steps must be done in the 14 sequence to fully handle the condition 15 lot of this is just redundant in the style of the 16 author but you start reading down into cures for illness and 17 protests for cures of the illness the body parts such like 18 that the item producing the physical condition dust and 19 irritants the item is handed by finding and blowing off bts and 20 clusters 21 all of sudden blowing off bts and clusters is 22 procedure which you really need to understand within the context 23 of auditing and not just dianetics kind of auditing where 24 theyre trying to get rid of the reactive mind but you have to 25 understand it in the context of ot iii and above where youre page 488 1 dealing with if you will infestations of space cooties 2 mr rosen your honor i move to strike that this 3 is becoming 4 the court what troubles is i want to know i 5 want you to point out specifically what it is that he saw or 6 read or heard on the internet that caused him to come to 7 specific conclusions the fact that he may 8 mr berry okay 9 the court thats what we need to know 10 mr berry okay 11 the court whether or not there was reasonable 12 belief on his part at the time he posted and what that 13 reasonable belief was and how that affected his belief as to 14 whether there was defense to copyright infringement 15 by mr berry 16 q what had you learned about bts and clusters 17 mr rosen objection 18 the court legal basis 19 mr rosen objection not only not limited to march 20 30th but also what is it about this document which the witness 21 thinks is illegal 22 the court all right 23 mr berry first of all 24 the court i would ask you to confine the question 25 to before march 30th 1996 im assuming that youre going to page 489 1 tie that up ill allow the question 2 mr berry and by way of explanation your honor 3 we have already established 4 the court lets not have an explanation lets 5 hear from the witness 6 mr berry all questions are before march 30 7 q so once again all your answers are to be prior to 8 march 30 1996 9 well i obviously had fair degree of understanding 10 of the document because if you go through to the end of the 11 thing you read that please note that point 4 states that this 12 process of blowing bts cures illness 13 the phrases cease to read and longer read 14 refer to auditing with an emeter the church 15 of scientology is under court order stemming from 16 fda actions in the early 1970s actually it 17 would have been late 19 or late 60s or early 70s 18 against making such claims involving the use of 19 emeters this bulletin assuming it is real is 20 written evidence of level of contempt the church 21 of scientology has for the courts 22 and i had an understanding of the material which was 23 in here in this that this was used and it had it had of 24 course dawned on as well that although i cant get into it 25 i had other evidence available that page 490 1 mr rosen i object your honor 2 the court sustained lets not get into things 3 that youre not supposed to get into if in your mind youve 4 been instructed not to get into 5 the witness i had extremely good reason to believe 6 that this material could be lethal 7 mr rosen your honor i move to strike this 8 the court well the question is again what it is 9 in nots 34 that reflected the illegal practice of medicine 10 and again thats not the ultimate issue the 11 ultimate issue is even if it were does that in some way 12 provide defense if he understood that the material was 13 copyrighted or was in reckless disregard of copyright 14 mr berry im going to handle that area when the 15 courtroom when the public comes back 16 q but what is it in this document that led you to 17 believe that it involved the use of the emeter 18 the words in there handle all such bts and clusters 19 by blowing them off theres many other places in here that it 20 does 21 q lets take them one by one lets go through the 22 entire document nots 34 and point out each reference that you 23 referred was to the auditing process and the emeter 24 the well 25 q explaining if you wish how you concluded that page 491 1 in step one for example the items handled by 2 finding and blowing off bts in cluster who are being the item 3 resisting the item the item will then cease to read reading 4 is something which refers directly to the emeter 5 q and what was your knowledge in that regard 6 the emeter was used in this particular case 7 q and what is it about cease to read that connects 8 that phrase to the emeter 9 it is process whereby typically something is 10 repeated and many many times until the person quits flinching 11 and grabbing and tensing up on the cans when theyre reading it 12 thats what it means 13 it means basically that for example you could 14 if it were polygraph it would mean that you could tell lie 15 without it showing on the polygraph 16 q is there something on the emeter that you were 17 aware of that someone can read 18 mr rosen your honor theres foundation that 19 this witness ever even saw an emeter 20 the court you can ask that on cross examination 21 but i do think the question as to where he got his understanding 22 would be helpful 23 by mr berry 24 q how did 25 i thought weve been through this your honor page 492 1 where did you acquire your understanding in 2 connection with nots 34 being the unlawful practice of 3 medicine 4 well that i acquired almost exclusively out of nots 5 34 itself but the understanding of this material was from 6 thousands of other postings 7 q and where did you obtain your understanding about 8 the nature and function of the emeter 9 there were hundreds of discussions and descriptions 10 of the emeter including with people such as ken long who 11 insisted that thoughts had mass and other kind of things i 12 engaged in many of those discussions over an extended period of 13 time 14 the court this was prior to march 30th 15 the witness way prior 16 by mr berry 17 q why is ken longs name significant to you 18 he was one of the this is not the ken long we 19 have here this is another ken long that was on altreligion 20 scientology in the early days 21 and there were quite extended discussions of 22 emeters and how they worked and ken longs gripes with 23 scientology 24 q well what is it about blowing off bts and clusters 25 that in your mind involves the emeter page 493 1 thats thats there is extensive description 2 of this material on altreligion scientology there was vast 3 amounts of material about these processes these auditing 4 processes if you will of getting rid of the body thetans and 5 such things 6 q did you have an understanding of body thetans 7 yes 8 q what was that understanding 9 mr rosen objection your honor unless it goes 10 to the illegality or alleged illegality that this witness 11 perceived of nots 34 its not relevant 12 the court overruled 13 go ahead 14 the witness i cant really get into body thetans 15 without explaining their origin 16 the court i think you can if it has something to 17 do with the process that you think is described in nots 34 that 18 is the illegal practice of medicine in your mind 19 the witness okay body thetans are if you will 20 parasitic spirits from an event 75 million years ago that 21 scientologists believe in 22 and the point to these body thetans and the reason 23 that they are related to nots 34 is that scientologists in 24 general it is my understanding that scientologists believe that 25 their problems medical and psychological are all the results page 494 1 of incidents which occurred in the remote past 2 mr rosen your honor im going to object to this 3 it has nothing to do with illegality the witness is 4 the court all right youve made your objection 5 the objection is overruled it has to do with his 6 state of mind plus the issue of this case is statutory damages 7 and i think his reasons for posting have some relevance to that 8 consideration 9 go ahead 10 the witness under any circumstances i had i 11 had an understanding of this material as to what it was what 12 they were doing 13 these are people the people that this was being 14 applied to are people who are convinced that they are if you 15 will infested with large numbers of these parasitic spirits 16 and the process of blowing off and such things is getting in 17 contact with these spirits telepathically and convincing them to 18 leave 19 it isnt it would be very familiar familiar 20 term would be exorcising in the christian tradition 21 q turn your attention to steps two three four five 22 and beyond what is it about those steps the emeter the body 23 thetans that led you to conclusion that this document deals 24 with the practice of medicine 25 the court all right lets rephrase the question page 495 1 if the steps that youre looking at are the same ones im 2 looking at they do not specifically use the term emeter are 3 you asking him what about steps one through eight 4 mr berry yes 5 the court okay 6 by mr berry 7 q what states that the emeter is being used in 8 connection with practice of medicine or the curing of physical 9 ailments 10 the court if anything 11 the witness well for example take step the top 12 of the second page handle bts being the body part handle 13 bts essentially means with an emeter in these auditing 14 sessions get in contact with and which the contact with is 15 means that when they ask questions about these about these body 16 thetans these spirits this stuff it means that when you get 17 in contact with these you then convince them to wake up and 18 leave 19 and so lets see again the next line down 20 includes the negative of bts being body part that one 21 mystifies to some extent 22 bts stuck in and on the body part area of the 23 body for example in another one which i had read about the 24 same time thats that is explained affecting the body part 25 or area page 496 1 in other words if you have pain in an area its 2 because theres body thetans stuck there 3 and so the point of all this is to get 4 telepathically in contact with these with these body thetans 5 and convince them that its time for them to blow or to leave 6 when you have managed to do this the last part of 7 this one all such body thetans and clusters are handled this 8 is handled meaning dealt with by this telepathic auditing with 9 the aid of the emeter the body part will longer read 10 which refers to the needle swinging back and forth when theyre 11 asked questions 12 q was it your understanding that there was needle on 13 the emeter 14 oh yes its meter an emeter has got meter 15 movement on it that is basically like volt meter on it 16 or an ometer in this particular case and thats what read 17 means in context here 18 step three the next action to handle illnesses of 19 the body part you know how can you illness of body part 20 this means to this has the connotation of it being 21 substitution for medical practice ie body thetans and 22 clusters being sick lungs or being condition of the illness or 23 disease of the body part 24 the jargon is really dense on this stuff and if the 25 members of the jury are having bit of problem with it im page 497 1 not bit surprised 2 mr rosen your honor may we spare the witness 3 spare the commentary to the jury 4 the court yes please just answer the questions 5 mr henson 6 the witness the next step four is cures for 7 illness 8 now how can anybody youre dealing with 9 illnesses and cures for illnesses how can anybody read 10 illnesses and cures for illnesses and not say this is medical 11 the court okay youre arguing mr henson 12 the witness im sorry 13 the court tell us what your belief was and whats 14 the basis for it 15 the witness my belief was that this stuff when i 16 read this thing with the new level of understanding that i had 17 acquired over period of good number of months some of it 18 gets bit difficult to understand even at this remove but i 19 havent really done whole lot of study on this 20 but to it looks to protest of cures for 21 illness body part now find the original part now to be 22 reading again reading is indicative of using the emeter 23 handle all the bts and clusters 24 and the next line down there this is on step six 25 until theyre handled and the body part just fns that means page 498 1 floating needle 2 by mr berry 3 q and does that indicate the use of the emeter 4 oh absolutely thats one of the one of the 5 emeter one of the definitions of what it is 6 in fact theres probably you had scientology 7 definition and floating needle is probably defined in there 8 and again it just when i read it its when i 9 read it it is you know to this is this is the use of 10 auditing in here because i read it understanding all these 11 words which mean which are essentially cannot be done without 12 the use of the emeter and auditing in here 13 when i read all this stuff to its quite clear 14 that this is this is document that is used for the 15 substitution of medical its substituting scientologys 16 auditing practice for proper medical care 17 q was it your belief then that nots 34 dealt with 18 physical illnesses and conditions 19 well the very title of it the sequence for 20 handling of physical condition yes indeed 21 q and did you anywhere within nots 34 see any 22 reference to seeking medical attention in connection with the 23 handling of physical condition 24 not within this document 25 q did you see any reference within the document nots page 499 1 34 to seeking medical attention if the process had not been 2 effective 3 4 q did you acquire had you acquired information that 5 had led you to conclude that scientology processing if not 6 effective could lead to dangerous physical conditions 7 many such cases 8 q what sort of dangerous conditions could this lead 9 to 10 mr rosen objection 11 the court sustained 12 youre going to have to ask him about some specific 13 information he had rather than just some conclusion or hearsay 14 statement he may have heard 15 by mr berry 16 q prior to march 30 1997 1996 had you heard of 17 woman by the name of roxanne frinn 18 mr rosen objection 19 the court sustained mr berry leading 20 by mr berry 21 q had you heard of anyone who had suffered as result 22 of emeter processing prior to march 30 1996 23 mr rosen objection 24 the court you can answer that yes or 25 mr rosen the question page 500 1 the witness yes 2 mr rosen is about nots 34 3 the court okay go ahead 4 by mr berry 5 q and in connection with that knowledge was it your 6 belief that nots 34 had at least in part been responsible for 7 that condition 8 mr rosen objection 9 the court sustained 10 youre going to have to have some specifics for what 11 it was and basis for the belief that it was as result of an 12 emeter and nots 34 not just something that somebody read on 13 the internet where somebody made that accusation 14 weve got to have some degree of its got to be 15 something that would be reasonable to person in with the 16 knowledge available to someone like mr henson at the time 17 by mr berry 18 q what knowledge did you have that nots 34 could be 19 dangerous 20 mr rosen well your honor im going to object 21 because i think the question needs to be focussed as to whether 22 he had any specific knowledge not what he read on the internet 23 but did he have any specific knowledge 24 the court what specific knowledge did you have 25 that someone had been injured by the use of the procedure page 501 1 outlined in nots 34 2 the witness i had watched tape 3 by mr berry 4 q and what was the tape that you had watched 5 it was tape of the sally jessie raphael show 6 q and what and did that form part of your belief 7 that nots 34 could be dangerous practice 8 mr rosen objection may we approach 9 the court yes 10 sidebar discussion off the record 11 by mr berry 12 q what else what else about nots 34 led you to 13 conclude that it involved the emeter in the practice of 14 medicine 15 its the easiest thing to do is to just let them 16 read it with the understanding that of some of the scientology 17 jargon thats involved in it 18 preot for example on point on like the third 19 page in one two lets see one two three fourth paragraph 20 down first line the step one is found by asking the preot 21 this is asking them when theyre on the emeter theyre holding 22 the cans what caused or produced the condition what would most 23 likely be the first item given by the preot 24 that means when they come up with some answer be 25 alert for getting into listing or getting an outlist listing page 502 1 is big factor involved with auditing 2 theres lists have been posted ad nauseam to the 3 net i generally look at page or so of them and skip the 4 thing 5 invalidated this item was invalidated by going past 6 it or overlisting past it where the item was found and 7 audited previously but not fully handled again resulting in 8 the item being suppressed or invalidated 9 all these are technical terms involving emeter kind 10 of stuff 11 q well at the end of the document it states the 12 steps are repeated here in short form for auditor use 13 right 14 q did the phrase auditor use lead you to conclude 15 anything in connection with an emeter 16 mr rosen i could say leading but counsel has 17 been testifying the whole time 18 the court mr rosen just make your comments 19 mr rosen i object your honor 20 the witness well obviously 21 the court you can answer the question 22 please watch your questions mr henson i mean 23 mr berry and ask him questions dont ask him to confirm what 24 your state of mind is 25 mr berry the question is withdrawn page 503 1 q almost at the end of the document there is phrase 2 above list of eight things which includes auditor use do you 3 see that mr henson 4 yes 5 q did you read that at the time you or prior to your 6 posting of the document 7 oh absolutely 8 q and having read that those two words did you reach 9 any conclusion as to what they were referring to 10 yes 11 q and what was that conclusion 12 auditing is done with an emeter so my conclusion 13 was that the auditor use means that this is an list an 14 instruction manual if you will for an auditing process on 15 preot 16 although actually that doesnt make entire sense to 17 either because normally by the time someone is at this level 18 they will already be at more than the ot iii level i think 19 this fits in after ot iii 20 q do you have any belief in whether or not handling 21 physical conditions involves the practice of medicine 22 that would be my analysis of it 23 q so your answer would be yes 24 yes 25 mr berry i think weve been we can reopen the page 504 1 courtroom your honor 2 the court okay would you tell anybody thats 3 outside that wants to come in that theyre welcome to please 4 courtroom open 5 the court how much longer do you have mr berry 6 mr rosen thats what i just asked 7 mr berry half an hour to an hour 8 the court well were running out of time so you 9 can well go another 20 minutes today but ill check times 10 but i think both sides will have about used their time 11 mr rosen has little left for cross examination 12 by mr berry 13 q now mr henson as result of reviewing nots 34 as 14 you have just explained did you reach any conclusion in 15 connection with your understanding of judge gesells 16 injunction 17 i believe i mentioned this somewhere in it that im 18 fairly sure that i mentioned lets see somewhere i thought 19 there was mention in there in this thing of the yes 20 the church of scientology is under court orders 21 stemming from the fda actions in the early 1970s 22 against making such claims involving the use of 23 emeters 24 q and youre referring to the paragraph immediately 25 after the nots 34 text is that correct page 505 1 right that was my reference i may not have 2 remembered it by name at that time but i i believe the 3 subsequent posting that i made in response to helena kobrins 4 posted mentioned it by name so i had it on the tip of my tongue 5 at that point 6 q so was it so did you reach any conclusion in 7 connection with criminal activity 8 well my conclusion 9 q yes or 10 yes 11 q and what was that conclusion 12 my conclusion was that nots 34 was direct 13 violation of judge gesells orders 14 q and did you consider that to be criminal conduct 15 i really dont know whether i reached conclusion 16 on that particular matter or not there was enough other 17 q well do you recall filing an answer shortly after 18 sorry withdrawn 19 after you posted nots 34 did the church of 20 scientology file lawsuit against you 21 they sure did 22 q and after they filed that lawsuit did you file an 23 answer to that lawsuit 24 yes i did 25 q and did you later file first amended answer page 506 1 yes i did 2 q and in that those answers do you recall saying 3 anything about your belief as to criminal conduct 4 mr rosen objection 5 the court the question is what he believed at the 6 time that he posted not what he may have said later it may or 7 may not be but the question was what his belief was at the time 8 he made the posting 9 by mr berry 10 q was your belief at the time of the posting 11 consistent with the matters you set forth in the first amended 12 answer 13 mr rosen objection your honor 14 the court sustained 15 you can just ask him what his belief was at the time 16 he posted 17 by mr berry 18 q mr henson what was your belief at the time you 19 posted nots 34 concerning medical practice the emeter and what 20 that constituted 21 well i believed it was one i believed it was an 22 example of criminal activity on the part of scientology 23 q now you knew that scientology claimed copyright 24 over this document correct 25 actually i page 507 1 q yes or 2 3 q had you after you posted that document did you 4 receive an email from ms kobrin 5 from the hkk account at netcom 6 q did you believe that sorry 7 did that email contain copyright claim 8 yes it did 9 q did you have any belief as to whether that copyright 10 claim was proper or not yes or 11 12 q did you did you what was your reaction to 13 receiving that that letter 14 surprise as much as anything else because i had 15 concluded that this thing was smoking gun matter of 16 criminal activity and it surprised to some extent that it 17 would that i would even get response from scientology 18 q did you have belief as to any public duty that you 19 might have that was greater than your obligations to copyright 20 law 21 mr rosen your honor i object 22 the court sustained 23 mr rosen counsel is testifying 24 the court well i dont know that hes yes 25 that question is very leading page 508 1 but the question is did he have any understanding 2 with respect to copyright law at the time he posted and what 3 affect did that law have with respect to any legal obligations 4 he had at the time he posted 5 the witness may i answer that question 6 mr berry yes i think the judge has put it 7 better than i can 8 the witness my my understanding of copyright 9 law is heavily predicated on my on my experiences with the 10 internet 11 and the internet itself takes copyright very 12 seriously indeed people customers on the internet take 13 copyright very seriously 14 but its primarily taken very seriously in terms of 15 crediting where credit is due rather than the internet 16 provides forum in which it is assumed that material which has 17 been posted on the internet will be commented upon and large 18 pieces of it brought into your own posting and then additional 19 material added to that 20 with the particular example here i believed that 21 there was an overriding interest in exposing not merely the 22 document itself because it was widely available on the 23 internet but exposing my understanding of the document as to 24 what it meant and what the consequences of it were both with 25 respect to it being dangerous piece of material if carried page 509 1 out perhaps even lethal and it being very bad precedent to 2 use copyright law to suppress the public discussion of what i 3 view to this day as criminal activity 4 the court the question though mr henson was did 5 you believe that there was something about copyright law that 6 trumped or preempted or that was trumped or preempted if the 7 person who posted thought that the document reflected the 8 illegal practice of medicine 9 the witness yes i did 10 the court and where go ahead 11 by mr berry 12 q what was that belief 13 my belief in this was based at least to some 14 extent on the actions which were going on at the same time with 15 respect to the vast amounts of documents that had been exposed 16 in the tobacco litigation 17 q and how did that impact upon your belief in 18 connection with nots 34 19 the tobacco litigation was the exposure of trade 20 secret and if not criminal very close to it activities going 21 on inside the tobacco companies 22 and in my estimation nots 34 and my exposing of 23 it was the exposure of what i considered to be criminal 24 activity going on inside of scientology 25 mr rosen your honor page 510 1 the court that doesnt really answer the question 2 what did that have to do with copyright law 3 the witness i believed your honor that copyright 4 law had to fall in the face of more important things like public 5 safety 6 the court the tobacco litigation did not involve 7 copyright law to your understanding did it i just want to 8 understand what youre saying 9 the witness of course it did your honor 10 mr rosen i didnt hear that 11 the court did it 12 the witness everything is copyrighted the minute 13 it is created thats the way thats the nature of the 19 14 of the law that went into effect in 1978 15 so the tobacco all these internal papers on the 16 tobacco litigation were copyrighted they just never had the 17 chutzpah or however its pronounced to claim copyright and to 18 try to suppress the documents on the basis of copyright 19 mr rosen your honor i move to strike this 20 the court i think were getting pretty irrelevant 21 at this point 22 mr berry its one of the factors your honor 23 that 24 the court go on to your next question please 25 by mr berry page 511 1 q now in your answer you referred to rosco pound 2 correct 3 mr rosen objection 4 the court sustained 5 by mr berry 6 q did you read any learned 7 the court you can ask him about what his belief 8 was at the time he posted and why he felt that if it werent 9 were an illegal practice of medicine which i think hes 10 discussed it was not covered by copyright law he can answer 11 that question 12 i dont want you to just ask him was this part of 13 your belief was this part of your belief 14 he can tell us what his belief was at the time he 15 posted and the jury can draw conclusions from that 16 the witness okay well put your honor 17 my belief at the time i posted this was that laws 18 are not absolute even laws for such things as murder because i 19 can remember for example number television productions and 20 such things that where somebody was acquitted of murder for 21 someone throwing person out of lifeboat in situation 22 where had they been had they stayed in the lifeboat it would 23 have killed them all 24 and the point is that laws are not absolute 25 they if for example it is for example expected that page 512 1 if an ambulance pulled up behind you at stop light that you 2 will go through the stop light away from the ambulance even 3 though going through stop light is matter of breaking the 4 law 5 in this particular case i figured that there was 6 very fair probability that i was breaking copyright law on it 7 but in my particular feeling at the time and for that matter 8 to this day i feel that the exposure of much more serious 9 potentially lethal public safety problems is more important 10 than the copyright laws 11 and if that is not the case i suffer for it 12 by mr berry 13 q had you reached did you have any belief as to 14 whether the copyright laws could be used to conceal criminal 15 conduct 16 the court im sorry would you repeat that 17 question 18 by mr berry 19 q did you have any belief as to whether the copyright 20 laws could be used to conceal criminal conduct 21 mr rosen your honor continuing to lead 22 the court sustained 23 by mr berry 24 q what was your belief in terms of the proper scope of 25 copyright law page 513 1 actually i am one of the people who has read the 2 constitution and even the piece on the little tiny fragment on 3 copyright and the purpose of copyright itself is to secure to 4 limit for limited time to the inventors in patent and the 5 writers in copyright the benefits of their work 6 in particular i remember the words something like 7 to advance the useful arts and sciences 8 well the use of copyright law to cover up in my 9 estimation or to try to prevent the discussion of criminal 10 activity going on inside of scientology in my estimation is an 11 improper use of the law 12 q did you have any knowledge as to whether copyrights 13 exist for all time 14 its complicated subject but it was discussed 15 extensively on ars and the answer is yes 16 q and what was that knowledge once again as of 17 march 30 1996 18 the copyright laws changed right around the point 19 where nots 34 was written and at the time i posted it on in 20 march 30th of 1996 im not sure whether i knew which of the 21 copyright law sections it fell under 22 q did you have any understanding on march 30 1996 as 23 to whether copyrights expired 24 yes 25 mr rosen your honor again more leading may i page 514 1 object on form basis 2 the court please stay away from leading questions 3 by mr berry 4 q what was your understanding on march 30 1996 as to 5 whether nots 34 was validly copyrighted 6 mr rosen objection 7 the court overruled 8 go ahead 9 the witness there was considerable question in my 10 mind about that because there about the concept of whether 11 this was valid copyright on nots 34 and there still is in my 12 estimation and it 13 the court were talking about as of march 30th 14 1996 15 the witness as of that date there had been 16 extensive discussions of irregularities in the copyright 17 procedures on ars 18 by mr berry 19 q and what were those discussions 20 discussions primarily around the matters of trying 21 to renew copyrights after they had expired 22 q and were those discussions in relation to any 23 particular works or body of works 24 yes 25 q what works or particular body of works did those page 515 1 discussions involve 2 various advanced technologies its called 3 materials inside scientology 4 q and was the nots 34 document in your mind part of 5 those materials 6 mr rosen objection your honor still leading 7 the court overruled 8 go ahead 9 the witness i believe that it was although i 10 believe there was less question about nots 34 than there was 11 about many other documents 12 by mr berry 13 q and what sort of information withdrawn 14 what information did you acquire in connection with 15 this copyright discussion regarding scientologys materials 16 the court with respect to nots 34 you just said 17 there was distinction between nots 34 and others lets limit 18 it to nots 34 19 by mr berry 20 q did your knowledge of the discussion about other 21 documents impact upon your belief in connection with the 22 copyright of nots 34 23 mr rosen i object 24 the court sustained 25 by mr berry page 516 1 q what was your belief in connection with the 2 copyright of nots 34 on march 30 1996 3 i felt that it was probably valid 4 q did you believe it was proper 5 i dont believe that it is at all proper to 6 copyright criminal instruction manuals 7 the court okay lets break for today 8 ladies and gentlemen well see you tomorrow at 800 9 oclock i still anticipate the case will be submitted to you 10 tomorrow 11 so youre excused for the day 12 counsel ill meet with you in about five minutes 13 mr rosen did you say five minutes 14 the court five minutes 15 recess 16 whereupon the following proceedings were held out 17 of the presence of the jury 18 mr berry your honor before the court continues 19 id like to put something on the record 20 the court all right 21 mr berry we had sidebar at which the court 22 commented with respect to the sally jessie raphael show that 23 mr henson could not reasonably base belief on nots 34 and 24 scientology practices leading to this by something he saw on the 25 sally jessie raphael show and i said i had i didnt i page 517 1 hadnt been alive during the holocaust but id read about it 2 and believed it happened 3 as the jury was leaving the courtroom and the judge 4 was leaving the courtroom mr rosen came over to and audibly 5 said if you mention the holocaust once more at sidebar im 6 going to smash your head 7 mr rosen absolutely false 8 mr berry then you said youd break my head 9 mr rosen 10 and i consider that highly offensive thing to be 11 said in this courtroom 12 the court well i ill start one at time 13 i think i made some comment to the effect at sidebar 14 that i didnt think person could come to reasonable belief 15 about subject merely from information they heard on some show 16 like the sally jessie raphael show 17 you indicated at that point in time although you 18 werent there you believed the holocaust happened or words to 19 that effect because youd read about it 20 i think that in essence was the sidebar was it 21 not mr berry 22 mr berry yes your honor 23 but my greater complaint is to counsel telling 24 im going to have my face smashed in in this courtroom 25 the court well mr rosen do you want respond page 518 1 mr rosen yes its not true 2 mr berry fortunately they heard it bring them 3 up one at time and let them testify 4 the court would you be quiet and let mr rosen 5 have his say i had him be quiet while you had yours 6 mr rosen i said to mr berry quietly after the 7 jury and your honor were out i said at sidebar today is the 8 second time you have made joke or an inappropriate comment 9 about the holocaust i am jewish i take that offensively if 10 you do it again i will be in your face 11 thats what i said to him and i mean it 12 we have history with mr berry he is as much an 13 antisemite as his client is an antiscientologist and ive 14 just had enough of it i dont have to be insulted and have 15 this 16 the court all right ive had enough 17 mr berry well your honor i have been accused 18 the court ive had enough from this day forward 19 if you are going to speak to one another ill just order you 20 not to speak to one another except specifically with reference 21 to issues in this case 22 and if you want to talk with the other one about 23 something else you can make an arrangement and do it in my 24 presence 25 this is the kind of conduct that should not go on page 519 1 between counsel 2 i wasnt there im not going to make judgment on 3 who said what to whom 4 i do think that you ought to be able to act as 5 professionals in this court whether im in here or not if i 6 hear anything more maybe i will conduct hearing and try and 7 get to the bottom of things 8 im not going to do it with respect to this matter 9 because i think weve got to get on with more important things 10 at the moment 11 but lets keep the emotions in check its very 12 emotional case on both sides lets leave it at that 13 what i want to do before we leave this evening is 14 two things 15 one mr berry you can have about 40 more minutes 16 of examination 17 mr rosen you can have approximately 55 minutes 18 further of examination and then the case is concluded 19 mr rosen your honor you told us at the beginning 20 that we had five hours including opening statement and we have 21 been clocking it so far i have used three hours and 35 22 minutes excluding the break times 23 the court i will check my calculations i thought 24 i was doing it accurately 25 mr rosen we can give it to you for each day your page 520 1 honor from the opening to the last morning of examination 2 minus the breaks and such 3 the court what do you have for mr berry 4 mr rosen we havent been keeping score on 5 mr berry we were only concerned about our being able to 6 comply with your five hours 7 the court i will double check my time 8 mr berry have you kept track of time 9 mr berry your honor but i think ive said 10 less than mr rosen and conducted less examination 11 the court its impossible that you both could be 12 right because counting the hours from when we started to where 13 we are now there has to have been more time i will double 14 check my calculations 15 frankly it strikes that whether my calculation 16 is right or wrong and i will double check it before you leave 17 tonight that that should be more than adequate for both sides 18 to complete their presentations in this case 19 but lets turn to the jury instructions now 20 one thing that i will mention because it came up 21 little bit in openings i dont want anyone arguing their 22 personal opinion in closing argument if you do that i will 23 stop you 24 you can argue what you feel the evidence shows but 25 you cant say something like i believe that mr henson did page 521 1 this or i believe mr henson did that 2 you can argue what the evidence shows but attorneys 3 arent witnesses and i dont want them either vouching for the 4 believability or the lack of believability or the character of 5 the parties 6 all right mr rosen do you have any objections to 7 the instructions the court intends to give 8 mr rosen yes your honor should i go through 9 each one and indicate which ones i dont have objections to so 10 we can do it all at once 11 the court sure 12 mr rosen would that be helpful 13 the court sure 14 mr rosen okay i dont have any objection to 15 instruction number 1 objection to number 2 objection to 16 number 3 objection to number 4 or 5 objection to 6 17 7 i believe is as your honor gave at the beginning 18 of the case but i havent had chance since we got this when 19 we came in 20 the court 7 is its very similar to what i 21 gave at the beginning of the case and its very similar to your 22 proposed instructions which mr berry said he had objection 23 to 24 i changed couple of very small items i believe 25 i think i dropped out reference to the dianetics book and it page 522 1 being best seller because i thought that went beyond what the 2 jury needed to know 3 i put in the language i had in my preinstruction 4 with respect to fair use defense and i believe that i changed 5 the references that you had to i to the court feeling that 6 it was inappropriate to try and personalize something to 7 i think those are basically the changes that are 8 made i cant imagine well i shouldnt say that 9 i wouldnt think either side would have any 10 objection to the instruction as given given that you didnt 11 have an objection to the one that was proposed by rtc but ill 12 take look at that 13 mr rosen your honor im not saying i do i was 14 only indicating i had not had since we got it when i came in 15 i had not had chance to review it as against the original 16 number 8 is fine 17 number 9 raises conceptual question and that is 18 your honor has combined within one instruction the subject of 19 willful infringement and in the process has put in both the 20 claims as well as the defense 21 since mr henson bears the burden of proof on the 22 defense to willfulness in other words we make out prima 23 facie case by showing that mr henson knew or should have known 24 that the work he infringed was copyrighted period end of my 25 case page 523 1 and what were trying now is his defenses to which 2 he has his burden of proof and therefore your honor we ask 3 that you give our 2a and 3 which are the two instructions on 4 the test for finding willful infringement which go to what our 5 burdens are 6 and then so the jury would not be confused we 7 drafted these in anticipation of what the case would be as 8 presented by the defense and now that the defense has put in 9 the case if i may hand up our requests number 11 through 14 10 the one that is most pertinent here your honor is 11 number 13 because what 13 does is it breaks out separately the 12 defendants burden to overcome case of willful infringement 13 and makes it clear that the defendant bears the burden of proof 14 by preponderance of the evidence on each of the four elements 15 the two reasonable the two subjective tests and the two 16 objective tests handing 17 the court i just want to find out for the moment 18 what objections you have to the instructions i propose to give 19 mr rosen okay we object to 19 20 the court to 9 you mean 21 mr rosen i mean to 9 i apologize your honor 22 we object to 9 and ask that your honor would give 23 2a 3 and 13 24 the court instead of 25 mr rosen say again page 524 1 the court instead of 2 mr rosen instead of thats correct 3 the court okay 4 mr rosen with respect to 10 5 mr berry im sorry which one instead of 6 the court hes saying that instead of 9 rtc wants 7 2a 3 and 13 8 mr rosen we have objection to 10 your honor 9 we have objection to 11 we have objection to 12 we have 10 objection to 13 11 and i will we have other ones we want you to 12 give but as i understood you want to hold that until we get 13 to those 14 the court right 15 mr rosen okay 16 the court so the shortcut of what you just said is 17 that instead of number 18 mr rosen 9 19 the court 9 you want 2a 3 and 13 20 mr rosen thats correct 21 the court all right before we get to additions 22 mr berry are there any instructions that the court intends to 23 give that you have objection to 24 mr berry your honor 25 and wed object to the substitution that has been page 525 1 requested 2 the court okay and the basis of the objection 3 is 4 mr berry i think we set it forth in our brief on 5 friday i need to find my copy of 2a and 3 6 mr rosen theyre in the book mr berry the 7 binder 8 mr berry im having some difficulty in finding 9 them your honor i thought i had them with 10 pause in proceedings 11 the court mr berry if you cant find it i can 12 go get my copy and let you look at it 13 mr berry i might have to impose upon the court in 14 that regard your honor 15 the court all right 16 mr rosen is the issue 2a your honor 17 the court yeah 18 mr rosen he wanted to see 2a 19 the court yeah 20 mr berry the requested substitute instructions 21 the court 2a and 3 and 13 22 mr rosen 13 is right there indicating 23 mr berry first of all your honor i think in our 24 brief submitted today we point out that the authorities are 25 that the burden of proof on willfulness is on rtc page 526 1 the court okay so you object to the placement of 2 the burden of proof in their 2a and 3 instructions 3 anything else 4 mr berry i was referring to 13 then your honor 5 i object to 2a your honor 6 the court basis 7 mr berry the basis is that its repetitive its 8 belated and it fails to and its incomplete 9 in other words its slanted in favor of rtc without 10 putting the additional elements as to mr henson 11 the court okay and 3 12 mr berry i think 3 your honor we stated on 13 friday we had additional language that should be put in to 14 indicate that it is basically the subjective and the objective 15 elements that are at issue what he believed himself and whether 16 that belief was reasonable on the basis of the information that 17 was known at the time to someone in mr hensons position 18 the court okay thank you 19 all right what additional instructions do you 20 want mr rosen other than what you indicated with respect to 21 13 2a and 3 22 mr rosen yes your honor we ask that you that 23 your honor give instruction number 5 financial benefit 24 necessary to finding of willful infringement particularly in 25 view of the direct examination already of mr berry eliciting page 527 1 from mr henson 2 the court eliciting what 3 mr rosen he said did you get any financial 4 benefit from posting nots 34 5 the court okay im sorry 6 mr rosen and did you expect any 7 6a the additional factors in determining the amount 8 of statutory damages 9 7 10 the court okay slow down just second 11 mr rosen sorry 12 the court 6a 13 mr berry i dont have those in front of 14 either your honor 15 mr rosen your honor theyre in the book we 16 handed mr berry in the court awhile ago 17 mr berry some days ago and i can take my time 18 and ill find them but 19 mr mervis there you go mr berry handing 20 mr berry thank you 21 the court 6a and what else 22 mr rosen 7 your honor essentially statutory 23 damages available where proof of actual damage 24 the court okay anything else 25 mr rosen 8 page 528 1 mr rosen 8 really goes with 13 your honor 13 2 is an expansion of 8 and that is an unreasonable belief is not 3 defense to willfulness 4 10 post hoc defenses and i think weve had 5 evidence of that your honor and were certainly going to have 6 evidence tomorrow in the cross examination 7 next is 11 12 14 8 the court those are the ones you just handed up 9 right 10 mr rosen yes your honor based on the testimony 11 today 12 the court okay does that cover it 13 mr rosen there are couple more 14 were going to ask for the charge that it is 15 unreasonable as matter of law to rely on what you hear on 16 television talk show 17 were going to ask for and this just came up 18 your honor im sorry i dont have charge prepared for it 19 were going to ask for charge based on statement 20 mr henson in mr hensons testimony that there is certain 21 way of doing things on the internet and the suggestion that the 22 internet somehow overrides copyright law and we want charge 23 that the internet does not override copyright law or whatever 24 people do on the internet is not an excuse or defense to 25 copyright infringement page 529 1 the court okay youre going to have to propose 2 to specific instructions on those 3 mr rosen as i said they just came up today on 4 the direct your honor and ive been obviously sitting here i 5 havent had chance to draft them but those are the two that 6 we will be asking for 7 the court okay is that it 8 mr rosen i think so subject to whatever oh 9 im sorry theres another one which goes which is akin to the 10 sally jessie raphael one 11 it is unreasonable as matter of law to rely on 12 what on what people post to the internet as factual predicate 13 for believing something 14 and that is in mr hensons testimony his reliance 15 is entirely upon the internet postings 16 and your honor unless there is something that comes 17 up tomorrow in mr hensons the completion of mr hensons 18 examination i think that thats it 19 the court okay mr henson or mr berry anything 20 further that you want to offer 21 mr berry lot your honor 22 the court excuse 23 mr berry lot first of all 24 the court i would tell both sides that the time 25 for submitting instructions was some time ago i said i would page 530 1 allow some late which i did and i got today 2 its hard for to believe that anything thats 3 being brought up now wasnt something that was fully 4 anticipated 5 but go ahead mr berry 6 mr berry that says in part what i was about to 7 say that we are somewhat blind sided the court made it clear 8 to the defense that we had failed to submit timely jury 9 instructions and that we had very limited opportunity to review 10 and comment upon those which had been submitted 11 now we are day after day receiving mountains of 12 jury instructions from the plaintiff sauce for the goose 13 apparently in their mind is not sauce for the gander 14 not only are we receiving mountains of them but 15 they are containing complex issues and cases which i havent had 16 an opportunity to review 17 the court the question was what additional 18 instructions if any do you have that you wish to offer 19 mr berry i took the court at its word your 20 honor that we would be wasting our time in spinning our wheels 21 drafting instructions 22 the court so the answer 23 mr berry so we have none because we relied on the 24 courts consistency and evenhanded approach to both sides 25 the court would you tell in addition to your page 531 1 objection to the lateness of the recent submissions what other 2 objections if any you have to the instructions hes proposing 3 mr berry 11 your honor i submit is plain wrong 4 and should not be offered in any manner 5 12 i will have to research but i dont believe that 6 the business and professions code exempts the church of 7 scientology from practicing medicine without license which is 8 what it implies 9 mr henson has not made an argument that the 10 internet is removed from the copyright law he has not 11 suggested that the copyright law does not apply to the internet 12 and all of these instructions are belated untimely 13 and attempt to unfairly influence the jury without the defense 14 being given the time the opportunity to do likewise 15 the court all right i will take look at whats 16 been offered i will 17 mr berry and one additional matter your honor 18 if were going to get into the sally jessie raphael show here 19 is the tape cued to the point indicating 20 and i submit your honor that it is not the law 21 that you cannot rely reasonably on what you read as the basis 22 for your state of mind 23 the court i never said that 24 mr berry im not commenting it to the courts 25 statement im commenting to the arguments of counsel page 532 1 the court youll both have your opportunity to 2 argue what is reasonable and what is not reasonable 3 all right i will look over the additional 4 instructions keeping in mind the time theyre submitted and i 5 will have in the morning what i intend to give 6 well take short break at the conclusion of the 7 evidence and let you put on the record any additional or any i 8 shouldnt say additional any objections that you still have 9 after i make whatever changes if any i make to what i propose 10 but i do intend to conclude the evidence tomorrow 11 and go forward with arguments and instructions 12 i will go right now and check time so that well 13 have an understanding as to time remaining for each side 14 it seems to that you ought to be able to keep 15 your arguments at 45 minutes or less plaintiff has an open and 16 close and it can divide it with some in the opening and some in 17 the closing but certainly the bulk should be in the opening 18 and 45 minutes side it seems is more than reasonable to 19 mr rosen acceptable your honor 20 the court okay but what that basically means is 21 that i would expect your rebuttal not to be more than 15 22 minutes so you can use less than that if you wish and more in 23 your opening or less overall 24 mr rosen i understand its not unlike the 25 argument in the ninth circuit page 533 1 the court well 2 mr rosen make choice in advance as to how much 3 time you want to save 4 i understand your honor 45 minutes is acceptable 5 the court all right mr berry 6 mr berry thats acceptable to the defense your 7 honor 8 the court okay let go check on time and then 9 ill be right back 10 recess 11 whereupon the following proceedings were held out 12 of the presence of the jury 13 the court all right looking over my 14 calculations and you know its always possible ive made 15 mistake but i show and this is not attributing basically 16 any time for delays that normally i attribute to the parties 17 and i think in this case weve not been using some of the jury 18 time for matters that we should have been using it for but even 19 not attributing time to your to you for that i show rtc with 20 actually 60 approximately 60 minutes left and mr henson with 21 45 minutes left 22 mr rosen your honor i can give you the run down 23 from the first and from first day my opening statement 24 the court ill compare with my notes go ahead 25 mr rosen first day my opening statement was 45 page 534 1 minutes i then started my direct examination of mr henson at 2 1105 we broke at 1205 thats one hour so running count is 3 an hour and 45 minutes 4 i resumed at 1215 and we went until 105 which is 5 another 50 minutes that brings it to two hours and 35 minutes 6 and on thursday we started at 810 my examination 7 concluded at 910 which is one hour so thats three hours and 8 35 minutes 9 and i would your honor i would not be raising 10 the point except i will need an hour and 25 minutes of cross 11 examination and that totals five hours 12 the court you have your time im sorry on day 13 two as what 14 mr rosen 810 to 910 that was last thursday 15 pause in proceedings 16 the court didnt you examine from about 1050 to 17 1120 18 mr rosen ill tell you in second we have the 19 transcript 20 pause in proceedings 21 mr rosen your honor are you talking about 22 wednesday or thursday 23 the court this would have been thursday my 24 mr rosen we stopped at 1200 oclock on 25 thursday your honor page 535 1 the court yeah im talking about 1050 to 1120 2 mr rosen your honor i cant tell from the 3 transcript im thumbing through the pages which dont have 4 times on them obviously 5 the court well but you finished your calling him 6 as an adverse witness then mr berry questioned mr henson at 7 some length then you went back and you questioned him some 8 more and i think there may have been couple of back and 9 forths 10 you have not included any of that time after you 11 concluded your original examination of him i dont believe 12 mr rosen is that oh is that part is that 13 on thursday your honor 14 the court yes so in any 15 mr rosen okay and what does your honor have for 16 that time 17 the court my total time for you actually was 227 18 minutes which i rounded off to 230 im sorry so that would 19 give you 70 minutes 20 mr rosen ill take it judge thats fine 21 the court and mr hensons side i have at 253 22 which i rounded off to 255 so that gives them 45 23 mr berry i have problem your honor with 24 redirect with finishing direct and redirect in 45 minutes 25 the court okay and i appreciate that page 536 1 well see you tomorrow 2 mr rosen your honor the additional charges that 3 arose today which i indicated we have not yet had chance to 4 draft can we send them over 5 the court you can send them over whether i will 6 give them or not is another question 7 and i want mr berry to receive copy at or before 8 the same time i do 9 mr rosen sure we always do that judge 10 the court do you have fax number 11 mr rosen yes the fax to the court 12 the court the chambers fax 13 mr
