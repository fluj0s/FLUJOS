7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl326061 generally the term economic sanctions is defined as coercive economic measures taken against one or more countries to force change in policies or at least to demonstrate countrys opinion about the others policies not everyone agrees that the withholding of foreign aid is an economic sanction some contend that foreign assistance is not an entitlement country should expect its availability the denial of foreign assistance is included in this discussion because it fits the definition used that is denial of foreign assistance to force the government of sudan to change its behavior is in keeping with coercive economic measures taken for more on the use of economic sanctions see crs report 97949 economic sanctions to achieve us foreign policy g

zaghawa massalit jebel aranga and other socalled african tribes the international commission of i nquiry at the same time however concluded that the government of the sudan has not pursued policy of genocide the crucial element of genocidal inte nt appears to be missing at least as far as the central government authorities are concerned the commission does recognize that in some instances individuals including government officials may commit acts with genocidal intent whether this was the case in darfur however is determination that only competent court can make on case by case basis emphasis added12 the report of the international commission of inquiry ambiguous in its findings of genocide lack of genocidal intent but acts possibly committed with genocidal intent and its call for competent court to evaluate the evidence led to flurry of internationa l debate and diplom atic maneuvering the united states called on the united nations either to establish new accountability tribunal or refer criminal investigations to the special tribunal in tanzania that oversaw cases related to the 1994 massacres in rwanda deploy peacekeepers and impose economic sanctions that would have an impact on sudans oil exports most other security council members supported the international commission of inquirys recommendation to have the international criminal court in the hague oversee
