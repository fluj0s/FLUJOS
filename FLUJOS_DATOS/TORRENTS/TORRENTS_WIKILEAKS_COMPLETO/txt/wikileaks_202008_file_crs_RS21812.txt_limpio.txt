march 11 terrorist attacks in spain during the morning rush hour of march 11 2004 bombs hidden in 10 backpacks exploded within 15 minutes of each other on four trains along ninemile stretch of commuter line from the suburb of santa eugenia to the busy atocha rail terminal in madrid three other backpack bombs were defused by police the explosions killed 191 persons and wounded over 1800 others the death toll was by far the largest ever for terrorist attack in spain and was the largest in europe since the 1988 bombing of pan am airliner over lockerbie scotland the attacks took place exactly two and onehalf years after the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the spanish government led by prime minister jose maria aznar of the rightof center popular party pp quickly insisted that the attacks were the work of the basque terrorist group eta and downplayed any suggestion that islamic extremists could be involved in justifying their view spanish officials noted that they had stopped an eta effort to place bombs on trains on christmas eve 2003 and had intercepted on february 29 madridbound van loaded by the eta with one thousand pounds of explosives on the day of the attack at spains urging the security council passed resolution 1530 which condemned etas alleged role in the bombing however skeptics noted that the scope of the attacks the detailed planning and precision needed to carry them out and congressional research service the library of congress crs2 above all the huge casualty toll were more likely to be hallmarks of qaeda or an qaedalike organization not eta the credibility of the government began to crumble quickly as indications emerged of the possible involvement of islamic extremists in the bombings less than four hours after the attacks police found several detonators and an audiotape of verses from the koran in an abandoned van in the town of alcala henares through which the bombed trains had passed about 12 hours after the attacks police found cellphone from an unexploded backpack bomb they traced it to business owned by moroccan immigrant named jamal zougam who was suspected of having links to qaeda despite these discoveries on the day of the attacks the government continued to insist publicly that eta was responsible until hours before the polls opened on march 14 when police arrested zougam as well as two other moroccans and two indians suspected of involvement in the attacks1 the governments perceived mishandling of the crisis sparked outrage among many spaniards critics of the government charged that it had deliberately tried to focus blame on eta rather than qaeda knowing that if the public believed that eta had httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21812 committed the attacks the governments popularity could be enhanced due to the broad public support for its hardline stance against eta on the other hand if qaeda or an affiliated group was responsible critics asserted the government feared that it would lose support because many voters would believe that it had brought the attacks on spain by its highly unpopular support for the war in iraq spanish police have made progress in breaking up the terrorist cell responsible for the attack on march 30 spanish interior minister angel acebes said that the government suspected the qaedalinked moroccan islamic combatant group with involvement in the attacks spanish and moroccan officials believe the group was also involved in may 2003 suicide bombing attacks in casablanca morocco which killed 45 people including several spaniards on april 2 an unexploded bomb was found on railroad tracks between madrid and seville on april 3 seven men suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks were killed when they blew themselves up after they were surrounded by police the dead included the alleged leader of the terrorists serhane ben abdelmajid farkhet known as the tunisian police found evidence that the group was ready to commit additional attacks police have said that the group financed its activities through drug trafficking and other crimes in june 2004 italian police arrested rabei osman sayed ahmed known as mohammed the egyptian ahmed former explosives instructor in qaeda training camps was one of the principal planners of the march 11 attacks according to police by september 2004 nearly two dozen persons charged with involvement in the attacks were in police custody parliamentary commission began an investigation into the march 11 attacks and the governments response to them in june 2004 1 leslie crawford and joshua levitt place in the history of infamy how the governments assumption and misjudgement shook spain financial times march 26 2004 15 crs3 spains march 14 election the terrorist attacks took place just before spains march 14 parliamentary elections leading some observers to conclude that they may have been intended to influence the vote in public opinion poll taken in february 2004 twothirds of those polled said that the war in iraq had increased the threat of terrorism and 85 were concerned about possible terrorist strike against spain2 nevertheless although the opposition socialist party psoe led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero campaigned in part on the strong public opposition to the governments iraq policy the ruling pp appeared to be poised for narrow victory based on its record of largely successful economic policy and its tough stand against eta the pp campaign was led not by aznar who is retiring from politics at the end of his term but by his successor as pp leader mariano rajoy although the pp held lead in opinion polls in the weeks prior to the election its projected margin of victory shrank steadily according to the final opinion polls published on march 7 spanish law imposes blackout on public polls five days before an election pp was expected to win 42 of the vote and the psoe 38 these totals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21812 would have meant that the pp would likely have lost its absolute majority in parliament but would have likely stayed in power in coalition with smaller regional parties another late poll taken before the bombings put the pps lead at 25 internal polls of both parties on the day before the attacks reportedly had the two parties in virtual dead heat3 the results of the election surprised many observers the socialist party of spain psoe won 425 of the vote to the pps 376 the socialists won 164 seats in the congress of deputies up from 125 in the previous parliament the pp won 148 seats down from its previous total of 183 seats the socialists fell short of an absolute majority so they will have to form coalition perhaps among the united left tiny hardline communist party and several regional parties the pp maintained control of the senate the regionallybased house of the parliament turnout for the vote was 772 up from 687 in the 2000 elections it should be noted that this turnout while high is not unprecedented in spains recent electoral history and is often associated with changes in government turnout in 1996 was 7738 and 7997 in 1982 each case corresponding to victory by the opposition of the time4 some spanish observers attributed large part of the psoes success to the votes of about 2 million young firsttime voters madridbased observers noted that the news of the arrest of qaedalinked figures on the evening of march 13 was transmitted rapidly among young people by cellphone as was the exhortation perhaps encouraged by socialist supporters to punish the government at the polls5 2 apipsos poll

fidalgo elecciones generales 14m resultados evolucion voto mundo march 16 2004 p 17 crs4 implications victory for terror or spanish democracy after the elections delicate issue raised by political leaders and analysts in spain and throughout the world has been did qaeda win this election by intimidating the spanish electorate thereby perhaps setting troubling precedent for other countries or did the election result demonstrate the strength of spains democracy some spaniards especially supporters of the socialists said that the result did not reflect desire to appease terrorists but was due to public anger at an allegedly arrogant government that had made decisions on iraq and other issues without the support of the spanish public they note that public opinion polls had shown that up to 90 of the public was opposed to the governments support for the war in iraq and rejected link between the war on terrorism and the war in iraq the effort to blame eta for the march 11 bombing was the final straw for many voters they assert as for the charge that the terrorist attacks had determined the outcome zapateros supporters point to postelection poll in which only 88 of those polled said that the terrorist attacks had affected their vote6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21812 those critical of the election result note that the government appeared to be headed for narrow victory just days before the attack appearing to make the attack the decisive factor in the result some observers including some in the united states have criticized the election results as dangerous appeasement of terrorists on march 17 house speaker dennis hastert said heres country that stood against terrorism and had huge terrorist act within their country and they chose to change their government and to in sense appease terrorists representative henry hyde chairman of the house international relations committee said the vote in spain was great victory for qaeda7 administration officials have avoided making statements directly critical of the election results perhaps fearing their impact on relations with the new government like their socialist adversaries spanish conservatives reject any implication that the election result revealed cowardice by the spanish people noting spains struggle of more than three decades against eta and its continued commitment to the deployment in afghanistan after may 2003 plane crash that killed 62 spanish soldiers returning from the country however according to one view some spaniards may be laboring under delusion that they can opt out of the dangers of globalization while enjoying the benefits according to this interpretation many in spain may believe that their country is secondary player in world affairs and should not get mixed up in great power politics this supposed attitude is said to be result of spains historical development which has included centurieslong decline from great power status and international isolation under the franco regime these observers believe that this attitude may be bolstered by 6 spanish socialists ten points ahead in first postelection poll agence france presse march 22 2004 7 spanish politicians rebuff us accusations of appeasement associated press march 18 2004 crs5 perceptions among some spaniards that the united states including the bush administration knows little about spain and is insensitive to spanish concerns8 possible impact on the usled coalition in iraq and the war on terrorism on april 18 2004 the day after the new spanish government took office zapatero announced the immediate withdrawal of the 1300 spanish troops in iraq the suddenness of the move came as surprise to many observers because during the campaign zapatero had left open at least the possibility that the troops could stay if certain conditions were met in fiveminute phone call to zapatero president bush expressed regret about the abrupt spanish decision and warned against taking actions that would give false comfort to terrorists all spanish combat troops left iraq by april 27 unnamed us officials sharply criticized the way the withdrawal was planned saying it was done without proper coordination and in an unprofessional way that could unnecessarily jeopardize operations and lives9 given that spains troops made up less than 1 of coalition forces in iraq it may be argued that the longterm military impact httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21812 of spanish withdrawal may not be dramatic however some observers are concerned that the spanish withdrawal could be part of trend of declining public support for the iraq mission in european members which could undermine the coalition in the long run10 zapatero has stressed that his first priority is the fight against terrorism and has called for closer cooperation among eu police and intelligence services in september 2004 french and spanish officials announced joint unit of police and judges to combat terrorist groups including eta and islamic extremists however the new governments commitment to use military force to fight terror may be less certain zapatero has said that military force should be last resort in the war against terrorism claiming that it can never be an effective method for eliminating or fighting fanatic radical and criminal groups11 nevertheless as signal that it is still committed to the global war on terror spain expanded its contribution to the international security assistance force isaf in afghanistan from 137 to 1040 in august 2004 in order to provide additional security for afghanistans october 2004 elections however spain plans to withdraw 500 of the troops after the elections despite afghan pleas to extend the deployment of the entire contingent possible impact on

report rs21794 iraq coalition public opinion indicators in selected european countries by julie kim 11 john diamond zapatero wants to alter war on terror usa today march 22 2004 13 crs6 aznar is unlikely to be repeated with zapatero aznar forged close relationship with the united states in part because he believed that partnership with the worlds only superpower would enhance spains role in the world making it major international player close alliance with the united states also secured us support and aid for aznars tough stance against eta and basque separatism aznars critics said that the spanish leader was motivated by desire to enhance his own personal prestige rather than to serve spains real interests in contrast to aznars closeness to the administration zapatero appeared to be unconcerned that some of his initial remarks might be taken as insults by the white house for example he asserted that president bush had based his iraq policy on lies and suggested that the american people should vote him out of office in november 200412 more recently he suggested that the chances for peace in iraq would enhanced if more countries followed spains example and pulled their forces out of iraq causing the united states to seek clarification of his remarks13 according to zapatero the current focus of spains foreign policy is building closer ties to its european union partners particularly france and germany while still retaining good relations with the united states spains new leaders say they will push forward more vigorously with eu integration zapateros supporters say this policy will be in line httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21812 with the foreign policy pursued by spain in the postfranco era which they view as being based on broad public consensus as opposed to the allegedly autocratic style of aznar on the other hand as in the cases of france and germany which have also had difficulties with washington damage to usspanish relations may be limited by common interests including the fight against terrorism in september 2004 spains attorney general announced that spain and the united states plan to sign an agreement by the end of 2004 under which prosecutors from both countries could share information about islamic militants both the national intelligence reform act s 2845 and the 911 recommendations appropriations act hr 10 call for closer international cooperation in the fight against terrorism including by eliminating terrorist sanctuaries and curtailing terrorist financing question for the future is the use of us military bases in spain the administration was easily able to secure the use of us bases in spain for the iraq operation the bases played significant role in the delivery of men and materiel to the iraqi theater given the criticisms by spains new leaders of the concept of what they view as us policy of preventive war it might be more difficult to secure spanish permission to use the bases in future operations especially if the action did not have prior security council approval 12 keith richburg spains next prime minister says us should dump bush washington post march 18 2004 23 13 zapatero comments on
