transportation security regulations summary since the terrorist attacks of septem ber 11 2001 security measures in and around our nations transporta tion facilities have dramatically increased nowhere has the increase been more noticeable than with respect to air transportation new federal statutes and agency regulations have been implemented each with the purpose of ensuring the safety and security of passengers facilities and workers of our national transportation sy stems not all of these security measures however have been publically disclosed in fact pursuant to its statutory authority the transportation security agency tsa has issued series of regulations relating to transportation security in which majority of the information including rules orders and directives has been classified as sensitive security information ssi and thus withheld from public scrutiny for example the regulation requiring that all passengers produce photo identifi cation before being allowed to enter the airport gate area or board an aircraft bus or train has been classified as ssi and consequently cannot be disclosed to the general public in addition the standards utilized for creating maintaining and requiring airlines to screen passengers against government provided watch lists and nofly lists do not appear to have been made publicly available recently news reports have noted that at least two members of congress have been delayed because of concerns relatin g to similar names appearing on such lists moreover california reside nt has brought suit against the government alleging that the secret nature of these laws vi olates established rights under the fifth amendments due process clause as well as the constitutionally protected right to travel and the first amendment in add

and other transportation security regulations background since the early 1960s the federal governme nt has made it unlawful to engage in behavior that threatens or endangers tran sportation security and safety prior to september 11 2001 many of these restri ctions focused pr imarily on aviation security for instance congress has criminalized the seizing or exercising control of an aircraft by force violen ce or threat of force or violence1 in addition it has long been unlawful to have concealed weapon loaded firearm or any other explosive device on ones person or in ones property while boarding or attempting to board an aircraft2 more recent security measures include protections for flight attendants and crew from interference with their duties physical assault and threatening behavior3 to prevent such incidents before th ey happen congress has authorized the under secretary of transportation for s ecurity to screen both passengers and property for the purpose of assuring safe flight and to permit air carriers to refuse to transport any person or their property if an individual does not consent to search or inspection of his person to deter mine whether he is unlawfully carrying dangerous weapon explosive or other destructive substance4 currently the transportation security agency tsa is charged with assessing current and potential threats to the domestic air transportation system and has the authority to decide on and carry out the most effec tive methods for continuous analysis and monitoring of security threats to that system5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32664crs2 6 aviation and transportation security act pub l 10771 115 stat 597 2002 codified as amended at 49 usc 44903c1 2004 pursuant to its regulations tsa can amend any security plan if the public interest requires see 49 cfr 1544105 and can also issue security directives when it is dete rmined that additional security measures are necessary to respond to threat assessment see id at 1544305a 7 see 49 usc 114h13 2004 8 air transportation security act of 1974 pub l 93366 316 88 stat 409 1974 9 id 10 14 cfr 1911 1997pursuant to the aviation and transportati on security act airport operators are required to establish security progra m adequate to ensure the safety of passengers and to submit the program to tsa for review6 in addition tsa is required to ensure that federal agencies share data on individuals identified who may pose risk to transportation or national security notify airport or airline security officers of the identity of such individuals and establish policies and procedures requiring air carriers t prevent the individual from boarding an aircraft or take other appropriate ac tion with respect to that individual7 these requirements have been impleme nted through series of security directives which are said to include list of individuals w ho are either barred from boarding an aircraft altogether the nofly list or require d to undergo additional screening prior to boarding the selectee list it appears however that these directives have not been disclosed to the public because excep t under narrow circumstances federal law prohibits the disclosure of sensitive security informationssi the law governing ssi dates back to the air transportation security act of 1974 1974 act8 which delegated authority for transportation security to various agencies within the department of tran sportation dot the 1974 act specifically authorized the federal aviation administration faa to prescribe regulations to prohibit disclosure of any information obtained or developed in the conduct of research and development activities if in the opinion of the administrator the disclosure of such information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy b would re veal trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial in formation obtained from any person or c would be detrimental to the safety of persons traveling in air transportation9 the faa implemented this authority by promulgating regulations which among other things established category of information known as sensitive security information ssi in 1997 the dot definition of ssi included records and information obtained or developed durin g security activities or research and development activities10 encompassed within this finition had been airport and air carrier security programs as well as specific details concerning aviation security measures consistent with this grant of authority the faa

the aviation and transportation security act atsa whic h in addition to creating new security mandates established the tsa within dot and transferred the responsibility for aviation security to the under secretary of transportation for security11 among the legal authorities transferred to the under secretary was the protection of certain information vital to transportation security or ssi in addition to transferring ssi authority to tsa the atsa expanded the ssi authority by eliminating the specific reference to air transportation12 this statutory change appears to permit tsa to protect ssi with respect to virtually all forms of interstate travel including airplanes buses trains and boats tsa and its legal authority however di d not remain within the dot the homeland security act of

under chapter 449 of this title if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy b reveal trade secret or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or c be detrimental to the security of transportation14 in addition the homeland security act of 2002 amended the existing dot authority with respect to ssi such that it would be almost identical to the tsa authority the only difference between the st atutes is contained in s ubpart c which provides dot with authority to prohibit disclosure of information that would be detrimental to transportation safety15 by removing any reference to persons or passengers congress has significantly broa dened the scope of the ssi authority as result it appears that the authority to classify information as ssi now encompasses all transportation related activities including air and maritime cargo trucking and freight transport and pipelines initially dhs issued

procedures such as the requirement to show identification before boarding an aircraft the existence of government watch lists and nofly lists as well as any implementation of capps ii or similar passenger screening program the basis for the lawsuit is that the existe nce of these security measures and their classification as ssi violate the fifth amendments due process clause because they are in effect secret laws that cannot be effectively litigated by citizens in the courts25 in addition the suit alleges that th regulation requiring passengers to show identification violates the constitutional right to interstate travel and the first amendments clauses with respect to free association and petitioning of the government the case is currently pending before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit26 fifth amendment due process i n gilmore the plaintiff argues that because tsa has classified its security regulations as ssi they have not been published or made available to the general public in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment the fifth amendment states in relevant part that person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law with respect to the governments duty to make the law known by publication the supreme court has held that inherent within the notion of due process are certain requirements regarding the notice and publication of the law27 even administrative agency regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32664crs6 27 continued us 225 228 1957 joint antifascist refugee comm v mcgarth 341 us

335directives and orders are required to be published and c ongress has generally provided for their publication by statute28 as indicated above however with respect to regulations and directives that cont ain ssi congress has provided an exception to the general publi cation requirements29 the phrase due process of law does not necessarily imply proceeding in court or plenary suit and trial by jury in every case where personal or property rights are involved30 therefore it may be possible to argue that the governments failure to publish or otherwise make available specifi c requirements with respect to airline security deprives citizens of the ability to effectively pursue enforcement of their rights there remains however strong concern with respect to national security divulging specific information related to either airport or airline security measures may result in sensitive information being obtained and used to cause harm to transportation facilities and passengers to evaluate these respective concerns it has been argued that federal courts employ balancing test to determine what if any process is due in this situation in matthews v eldridge 31 case involving the termination of social security disability benefits the supreme court established the following three part test for determining what procedures are constitutionally necessary to satisfy due process first the court must consider the privat interest that will be affected by the official action second the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the probable value if any of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally the governments interest including the function involved and the fi scal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32664crs7 33 see dirksen v dept of health and human servs 803 f2d 1456 1458 9th cir 1986 citing hardy v bureau of alc ohol

and noting that only the latter are likely to contain secret laws and should be disclosed if requested see also caplan v bureau of alc ohol tobacco firearms 587 f2d 544 2d cir1978 holding that the fbi was not required to disclose information contained in their raids and searches manualapplying the first factor to the unpublished security requirements the private interest affected by the governments action appear to be citizens right to legally challenge and fully litigate the constitutionality of such requirements the effective litigation of constitutional rights ofte n relies on access to information and other evidence used by the government by withholding publica tion the government is arguably keeping critical evidence private and thus is thwarting attempts to effectively challenge not only the basis for the regulations but also the procedures being used to implement them with respect to the second factor it may be possible to argue that in light of recent errors regarding the nofly lists th possible risk of deprivation of personal liberty is high while the probable value of additional procedural safeguards such as public notice opportunity to comment pub lication of the process and compilation methods used and the means to challeng inclusion would be great finally regarding the third factor it appears possible to argue that while the governments interest in aviation security is certainly legitimate it fails to rise to substantial enough level to prevent regula tions directives and orders from being made part of the public record on the other hand the government appear s to be in good position to argue that court should never reach matthews type balancing test it may be possible to argue that the due process clause has not been violated by keeping specific security regulations directives and orders from the public this argument rests on distinction between what the law itself requires and what detection or law enforcement techniques the government has chosen to use to enforce the requirements of the law in this case the argument would appear to be that passengers due process rights are limite d to knowing what the law is but do not extend to knowing how the government may tect violations at least two circuit courts of appeal have accepted that distinction of this type exists and have prevented the disclosure of law enforcement techniques33 by characterizing requirements like the presentation of iden tification passenger screening programs and the maintenance of nofly and watch lists as techniques to enforce the prohibitions against aircraft piracy and bringing weapons onto airplanes the government may be able to avoid due process question altogether however should the inquiry extend to matthews balancing test the argument would likely focus on the tests third factor one possible argument may be that in post911 world the interest in maintaining effective control over the security of our transportation facilities and passengers is of such substantial importance that it outweighs any other procedural concerns another possible argument may be that any additional procedural re quirements would create such enormous administrative burdens on the federal government that it would render any transportation security efforts completely unworkable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32664crs8 34 united states v

1972 shelton v tucker 364 continuedright to travel the second basis offered by the plaintiff in gilmore was that tsas security regulations impose unreasonable burdens on common forms of interstate travel by requiring people to show identification and potentially subjecting them to watch lists or nofly lists the government allegedly violates citizens constitutionally protected right to travel while not expressly defined in the text of the constitution the supreme court has stated that the right to travel is privilege and immunity of national citizenship under the constitution34 as well as part of the liberty of which the citizens cannot be deprived without due process of law35 the court has declared that the constitutional right to travel consists of th ree different component s first it protects the right of citizen of one state to ter and to leave another state second it protects the right to be treated as welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second stat and third for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents it protects the right to be treated like other citizens of that state36 in the context of transportation security however only the first prong of the right to travel ppears to be relevant precedent regarding the right to travel has developed along two primary strands the first addresses burdens imposed by state governments and involves the fourteenth amendment while the second strand involves federa llyimposed burdens on international travel and appears to involve the fifth amendments due process clause under the fourteenth amendment cases the right to travel from one state to another has been considered f undamental right under the constitution37 consistent with its status as fundamental right is the requirement that the governments action satisfy the constitutional standard of review often referred to as strict scrutiny or heightened scrutiny38 under strict scrutiny the government must provide compelling state interest for the burden and show that the means utilized are narrowly tailored to the achievement of the goal or phrased another way the least restrictive means

aptheker v secretary of state 378 us 500 514 1964where the state has placed burdens on the act of travel itself in these cases the justification level appears to be much lower40 the court has held that burdens on travel are justifiable as long as they ar uniformly applied and support the safety and integrity of the travel facilities41 thus for example highway tolls and airport fees have been upheld but general tax imposed on all individuals leaving state may impermissibly restrict travel42 conversely in right to travel cases involving federallyimposed burdens on interstate travel which implicate the fifth amendment courts appear to reject the fourteenth amendment fundamental rights analysis and apply less stringent rationalbasis test the rationalbasis test simply requires that laws be rationally related to legitimate government interest43 here again the government appears not to be required to show compelling interest to justify uniformly applied nondiscriminatory travel related restriction44 given that the airlines are seemingly aut horized to refuse service to anyone who fails to present proper identif ication it appears that st rong argument can be made that there is an additional burden imposed on citizens who wish to travel by airplane thus the inquiry should focus on the standard of review that should be applied it appears difficult to argue that passenger safety and transportation facility security are something other than compelling governmental interests thus it seems that regardless of which standard of review is applied the g overnment may be in strong position to argue that not only are the current security restrictions justifiable but also that their burden on the right to travel is minimal and given the present conditions entirely reasonable

judicial dist court 124 sct 2451 2004plane train or bus is violation of the first amendment because the measures infringe on citizens right to freely assemble associate and petition the government the first amendment states that cong ress shall make law abridging the right of the people p eaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances45 the argument that the iden tification require ments and other transportation security regulations violate these rights is hinged on the concept that full exercise of liberties such as thos provided by the first amendment depends on citizens being able to freel move throughout the country46 by imposing burdensome requirements on interstate travel the government has arguably prevented persons who wish to refrain from identifying themselves andor submitting to enhanced security screening from exercising their constitutional rights while it appears that neither the supreme court nor any lower federal court has been presented with an analogous situa tion the court has indicated that anonymity is concept protected by the first amendment for example in thomas v collins sheriff the court invalidated texas statute requiring labor organizers to register and obtain an organizers card before making speeches to assembled workers as incompatible with the guarantees of the first amendment47 as recently as last term the court has upheld the general notion that citizens have right to anonymity especially in situations where citizen is not suspected of crime48 in light of these precedents it may be possible to challenge the identification requirement on the grounds that it violates the first amendmen ts rights of citizens to be anonymous however claims made regarding the rights of association and petition of the government do not appear to ve received the same support although it may be argued that general right of anonymity exists it is difficult to connect the implication of this right to the purpose of the airline safety and security regulations as strong argument exists that the regulations are in way intended to impact persons first amendment rights rather the regulations at issue are aimed at preventing and deterring security threats to transportation facilities and passengers thus these regulations can be said to have arguably at most an incidental or indirect eff ect on rights protected by the first amendment in cases where the regulation at issue was not specifically directed at first amendment rights the court has held such regulations subject to first amendment scrutiny only when

judge and mr barlow must now decide whether to appeal52 conclusion while privacy groups and other opponents of transportation security regulations regarding identification and the existence of watch or nofly lists continue to develop and press constitutional arguments it appears that the government is in position to make reasonable and supportabl counter arguments that protect the validity of the current regulations though it is still unclear precisely how the ninth circuit or other courts will rule it appears unlikely that they will be able to hold the regulations unconstitutional as violations of either the first amendment or the right to travel the fifth amendment due process clause arguments however appear to have greater chance of success nevertheless even favorable ruling on
