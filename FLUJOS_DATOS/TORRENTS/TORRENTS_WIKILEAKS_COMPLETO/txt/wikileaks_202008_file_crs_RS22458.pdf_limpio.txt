issued additional ycgii reports atf had also made trace data av ailable to researchers under contract with disclosure restrictions but such data were onl released after five years because atf did not want to compromise ongoing investigations among other things after reviewing the trace data some researchers suggested that through comprehensive crime gun tracing new findings could be made regarding illegal gun trafficking especially at the regional level6 while others noted methodological shortc omings in the firearms trace data that arguably have precluded maki ng conclusions about crime guns at national level7 methodological limits on firearms trace data atf has defined crime gun to mean any firearm that is illegally possessed used in crime or suspected to have been used in crime an abandoned firearm ma also be categorized as crime gun if it is suspected it was used in crime or illegally possessed8 under this definition most but not all traced firearms are crime guns firearms trace da ta however are limited and may be biased by several factors traced firearms are generally recovered by law enforcement and they may not be representative of firearms possessed and used by criminals there remains significant variation over time and from jurisdiction tojurisdiction as to when why nd how firearm is recovered and selected to be traced and substantial percentage of recove red firearms cannot be successfully traced for several reasons including poor recordkeeping by ffls according to atf the firearms trace database is an operational system designed to aid in ongoing investigations rather than system to capture crime gun statistics9 nevertheless combined with multiple handgun sales reports and other investigative datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22458crs4 10 18 usc

area where the transfer occurred11 furthermore except for information pertaining to persons prohibited from possessi ng firearms federal law prohibits state or local law enforcement agencies from disclosing those records to any person or entity and requires those records be destroyed within 20 days of receipt so that those records cannot be used as registry of fi rearms or firearms owners12 at

frequency in and of itself is not indicative of criminal activity by an ffl in addition with atf data g control advocates began identifying and publishing the names of ffls who in their judgement were bad apple dealers as the data showed crime guns being traced back to their businesses along with mu ltiple handgun sales reports in numbers the gun c ontrol advocates found unacceptable15 as noted above while multip handgun sales reports ong with firearm trace and other investigative data can be strong indicators of illegal firearms trafficking alone they do not constitute proof of crimin wrongdoing on the part of an ffl as required under the appropriations rider which was initially predicated on atfs disclosure policy atf declined to disclose such data to the city of chicago atf argued in part that trace and multiple handgun sales data were exempt from the freedom of information act foia as such data could potentially compromis ongoing investigations while the 7th circuit rejected atfs foia arguments the tiahrt amendment was enacted preventing atf from releasing trace data for any purpose other than bona fide criminal investigation16 lawsuits against the gun industry mayors and other municipal leaders have sought to curb gun violence in their communities by filing civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers based on three arguments 1 the firearms they sold were defective 2 the gun industry had engaged in improper marketing techniques nd 3 the proliferation of fi rearms in certain urban areas constituted public nuisance many lawsuits against the gun industry were dismissed while others were not in some of thes cases analyses of atf firearms trace and investigative data by nongove rnmental parties were s ubmitted as evidence showing liability on the part of gun manufacturers andor dealers congress passed the protecti on of lawful commerce in arms act pl 10992 to limit the tort liability of gun manufacturers and dealers by prohibiting civil

never intended that firearm trace data be used to support civil public nuisance lawsuits against firearms ma nufacturers and dealers opponents of the amendment counter that every tool is n eeded to
