have filed suit against the company this report provides background on the pending litig ation it will be updated as judicial developments warrant complaints for copyright infringement were filed against google inc by variety of authors and representatives of the book publishing industry1 the complaints specifically challenge googles print libr ary project renamed google book search an effort by google in conjunction with veral library partners to scan books into digital format so that they may be searched textually although the case is in its early stages the issues presented have captured national attention once again new technology and traditional principles of copyright law app ear to be in conflict because of the unique facts and issues presented there is scant gal precedent to legitimize googles claim that its project is protected by copyright laws fair use exception to liability for infringement2 thus questions presented may be one s of first impression for the courts googles book search project in december of 2004 google announced partnership with several major libraries to make digital copies of their collections and permit the text of the literature to be searched online by the google search engine3 google is providing its partnering libraries with digital copy of the donor institutions collectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22356crs2 4

initiatives by the company to enhance the breadth of its online search capabilities it was originally component of google book search which included the library proj ect and its partner program an online book marketing program designed to help publishers and authors promote their books by displaying limited number of sa mple pages in connection with users word search the library project is described on its website when you click on search result for book from the library project youll see basic bibliographic information about the book nd in many cases few snippets few sentences showing your search term in contex t if the book is out of copyright youll be able to view and download the entire book in all cases youll see links directing you to online bookstores where you can buy the book and libraries where you can borrow it4 in addition google video offers search vehicle for material fro m archived television programs educational videos personal productions and ot her video media users can search the closed captioning and text descripti ons of its video archive for relevant results however in the case of both the book partne r program and the video program content owners actively submit their material for inclusion in the searchable database only the library project does not seek authorization to copy from content owners hence it is the only program that has been challenged in court after some academic and co mmercial publishers objected to the library project google took brief hiatus from scanning to allow publishers time to identify works that they ie the copyright holders do not want to be included in the digital database this has been referred to an opt out plan the general rule of copyright law requires prospective user to seek permission for use google has reversed the process by announcing its intention to digitize entire co llections of the contributing libraries unless content owner opts out by acting to withhold permission this contributes to the content holders claim that google is engaged in massive copyright infringement the parties positions the complaint filed by plaintiff publishing companies the publishers accuses defendant google of massive copyright infringement by digitizing copyrighted works without per mission google is alleged to violate the copyright holders exclusive rights to copy andor display protected work5 plaintiffs contend that googles project is strictly commercial because it pays for the libraries collections by delivering digital copies back to them and google w ill realize significant advertising revenues as consequence of its enhanced search capabilities defendant google essentia lly contends that its opt out program negates any infringement liability but if

ashcroft 537 us 186 219 2003ninth circuits decision in kelly v arriba soft corp as support for the proposition that internet search engines indexing activities constitute fair use6 the law as stated above copyright law conf ers on the rights holder the exclusive right to control reproduction di splay and distribution of protected work accordingly in order to use copyrighted work one s eeks permission from the owner and negotiates the terms conditions and payments for use google claims that for it to actively seek permission from every rights holder in the multilibrary collections would be impractical and prohibitive the publishers claim that googles opt out program stands copyright law on its head7 one cannot they argue generally announce ones intention to infringe multiple copyrighted works and collectivel offer rights holders the opportunity not to have their work infringed yet the requireme nt that copyright owner act affirmatively to stop nonwillful infringement is not wit hout precedent the dmcas notice and takedown procedures requiring the cont ent owner to notify an internet service provider isp of the existence of infringing content may immunize an isp from infringement liability when it serves as passive conduit8 and at least one court has found that content owner was responsible fo r taking affirmative measures ie using metatags to prevent internet search engi nes from automatically searching and displaying the owners internet content9 fair use assuming court were to find that googles digitization of copyrighted works is infringing the question becomes whether its activities are fair use the fair use exemption derives from common law and the first amendment10 as codified in the copyright act it establishes criteria for court to consider in determining whether an infringing use is fair specifically 17 us c 107 provides that notwithstanding other provisions of the law use of copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching including multiple copies for classroom use scholarsh ip or research is not an infringement of copyright in determining whether the use made of work in any particular case is fair use the factors to be considered shall include 1 the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and 4 the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22356crs4 11 sony corp of america v universa l city studios 464 us 417 448 454 1984 12 in addition to fair use the copyright act contains additional limitations on exclusive rights of copyright holders 17 usc 108 for exampl gives certain reproduction rights to libraries and archives but these provisions are not relevant to the issue discussedbecause fair use is an equitable rule of r eason to be applied in light of the overall purposes of the copyright act other rele vant factors may also be considered11 the court hearing the case will make findings of fact and assign relative value and weight to the fair use factors in its analys is this report will not attempt to predict an outcome in the pending litigation but does make some observations with respect to fair use analysis and the issues at hand the library project has the potential to be great boon to scholarship research and the public in general it is nevertheless commercial in nature because google anticipates that it will enhance its serv ices utilization by the public and concomitantly increase advertising fees with respect to the first factor the purpose and character of use the searching and indexing goal appears to be highly transformative use of the copied text there is little question that indexing ba sic information about any book alone absent copying would not constitute copyright infringement while displaying snippets of text is closer to infringing activity the prospec tive display as descri bed by google does not appear to usurp or negate th value of the underlying work the second factor is the nature of the c opyrighted work digitizing the collections of the named libraries will encompass both factual and creative works the latter being entitled to the highest level of copyright protection how th court views the third factor amount of the portion used will be sign ificant in order to create its mega database google will scan the entire copyrighted work major consideration weighing against fair use but it intends to display ie use at any given time only brief excerpts of the searchable text hence is the dig ital reproduction incidental to an otherwise fair use or is it impermissibly infringing finally what will be the library projects effect on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted works he re google makes strong argu ment that its indexing and text searching capability has the potential to greatly enhance the market for sales for books that might otherwise be relegated to obs curity its sampling of text permits members of the public to determine wh ether they wish to acquire the book the publishers counter that copyright ow ners routinely receive license fees for authorized sampling googles project may prive them of the opportunity to participate in the creation of similar databases over which they ve control and input the publishers have also expresse d concern that the digital edition of the work google returns to the participating library may facilitate piracy andor additional unauthorized uses12 case law although courts finding that ther is fair use exception to copyright infringement is contextspecific it naturally looks to precedent for guidance google asserts that kelly v arriba soft corp supports its claim of fair use and in many respects it does in kelly the court found that arriba softs search engine which in response to users inquiry compiled da tabase of images by copying pictures from websites andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22356crs5 13 some observers suggest

to content owners developing market for the sale of reducedsize images 15 464 us 417 1984 16 92 fsupp2d 349 352 sdny 2000 defendants fair use defense is indefensible and must be denied as matter of law 17 see eg jonathan band supra christopher heun courts unlikely to stop google book continueddisplayed them as thumbnail images was sufficiently transformative use of copyrighted material to be fair use although providing indexing information alone does not implicate copyright infringement displayi ng limited quotes from literary work may be consistent with fair use indeed quote from literary work is far more limited reproduction and display than thumbnail image of fullsi zed one however major distinction between the kelly case and googles library project is that in the former content owners voluntarily uploade d their images to the internet13 here the search engine is copying material to create new database to enable the search capability whether new database and snippet sampling will erode viable new market for authors and publishers remains to be seen14 hence the arguably unique questi on presented is whether apparent prima facie infringing activity that facilitates an arguably legitimate use is indeed fair one in this broad respect the suprem courts decision in sony corporation of america v universal city studios15 is apposite in sony the court held that the sale of the video recording machine to time shift broadcast television for personal home viewing was not contributory copyright infringement the c ourt articulated new category of fair use namely time shifting although the factua l underpinnings and legal precedent of this decision are not particularly relevant to nor controlling in the instant case the sony decision itself stands as landmark in copyright law demonstrating the willingness of the court to balance new technological capabilities against traditional principles of copyright law although sony sanctioned time shifting of inhome television broadcasting neither the us supreme court nor the lower courts have evidenced willingness to expand this judicially created category of fair use in umg recordings v mp3com inc us district court rejected outo fhand the defendants proffered fair use defense as justification for unauthorized c opying of plaintiffs audio cds16 the defendant claimed that its unauthorized copying enabled it

others view googles activity as prima facie copyright infringement with little or extenuating circumstances19 conclusion how the court or courts that consider this case define the issues presented will ultimately determine whether the suit against google sets an important precedent in copyright law viewed expansively the court may find that copying to promote online searching and indexing of literary works is fair use to many observers such holding could be the ju risprudential quivalent of sonys sanctioning of time shifting if the court adopts more narro w view of fair use that precludes googles digitization project searchable literary databases are likely to evolve in less comprehensive manner but with the input and control of rights holders who view them as desirable and participate accordingly
