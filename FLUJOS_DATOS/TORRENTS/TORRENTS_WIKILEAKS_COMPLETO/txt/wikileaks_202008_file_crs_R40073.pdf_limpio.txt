spending plan for the fmmi as part of governmentwide initiative to implement costeffective disaster prevention strategies it stated that many of the fema flood maps were outofdate and inaccurate and that inadequate funding hinders the flood map program 5 it continued that focusing flood reduction efforts on identifying the areas at risk for flooding and steering development away from those areas is lesscostly longterm approach to flood mitigation and that modernizing flood maps would be critical to that effort6 additional spending authority of 585 million was requested by president bush for fmmi he proposed to be offset with federal flood policy fee fpf levied on mortgage lenders he justified that the anticipated collections of fpf for fy2004fy2007 could provide the balance of funding needed to complete the fmmi by fy2008 had congress authorized fpfs in fy2003 the president would have made an initial down payment of almost 359 million or about 48 of the estimated incremental costs

funding for all nonemergency mapmod activities8 congress appropriated 150 million for the fmmf or half of presidents request table 1 congress asserted that it was reasonable appropriation given its fiveyear commitment to fund the fmmi between fy2004 and fy2007 appropriations for fmmi tracked with administration requests for fy2006 in addition to his regular funding request for the fmmf the president requested supplemental fmmi spending authority to be offset by flood map service fees collected for commercial uses of dfirms professional licenses and printed and compact diskbased dfirms which congress approved 9 fy2007 funding levels for the fmmf were about 4 million less than those of fy2006 4 for fy2003 president bush also requested 50 million in spending authorized by the stafford
