bnp language concep ts discipline manual bnp policy research july 2005 politics requires propaganda nd effective propaganda require s selfdiscipline it is essential that all official and preferably unofficial ie public comments by party members bnp co mmunications stick to the partys true message and convey it to the voting public in cl ear and consistent way th enemy wants us to be misunderstood this is why they deliberately lie to th public about what we st and for so we must do everything possible to make it impossibl for the public to misunderstand us therefore bnp policy research has compiled the follo wing rules of language and concepts discipline rule 1 the bnp is not racist or rac ial or racialist or raceconscious or white or white peoples party it should never be referred to as such by bnp activists and anyone else who does so must be politely but firmly corrected the preci sely correct description of what we are in the sta ndard terminology of international comparative politics is an ethnonat ionalist party that is we espouse like many political parties all over the world the interests of the particular ethnic groups to which we belong there is nothing fascistic or unusual about this and we dont have to apologise for it if we must describe our attitude towards race it is racial r ealism as noone can admit being against realism rule 2 the bnp is not fascist or fascistic let alone nazi or neonaz i or national socialist party it should never be referred to as such by bnp activists and anyone else who does so must be politely but firmly corrected the precisely correct descripti on of what we are in the standard terminology of international comparative politics is rightwing populist party that is we espouse like many political parties all over the world the righ tofcentre views traditional to or dinary working people who are not leftists rule 3 the bnp does not apologise for what it is we do repudiate the bad aspects of our past but more need to feel guilty about them than labour does about its tradeunion thugs and ma rxist traitors or the tories about their crooked businessmen and rapacious capitalists activists should be sensitive to peoples misunderstandings about what we are and politely make clear what we do not believe if challenged but fundamentally should project moral c onviction and political confidence rule 4 the three rules above are applicable to the bnp such as it is today in order to prevent our enemies from proving that we are indeed wh at they accuse us above of being it is absolutely necessary for us to draw clear distinction between the bad old days of the party before 2000 and what we represent today today we stand for 21st century nationalism as opposed to the outdated 20th century nationalism which had so many problems without this distinction bad deeds from our naughty past can be used to mischaracterise our present political identity since these bad deeds did occur denying them merely creates an impression of dishonesty while admitting them is disarmingly honest and prevents our enemies from blocking our message by dwelling on our past it is important however to make sure that we do not admit to offences worse than those actually perpetrated rule 5 the bnp does not tell lies about what it stands for what it has stood for in the past and what its intentions are we do not have secret doctrine of wh at we really think which we conceal from the public we make secret of the f act that we are an ethnonati onalist party or that our ul timate goal is the orderly lawful humane and voluntary repatriation of the resident foreigners of the uk activists should never deny or squirm when asked about these things but defend them with good conscience rule 6 the bnp does not espouse or tolerate violence bnp activists must never threaten any person with violence or say things that might be misunders tood as doing so they mu st report anyone who engages in violence to the police for prosec ution and anyone who threatens or advoc ates it to part leadership for expulsion failure on this poi nt exposes the whole party to retaliation by the authorities and is thus very serious matter rule 7 the bnp is not an extreme or extremistparty it must never be re ferred to as such and anyone who does must be politely but firmly correcte d the establishment pa rties which advocate the liquidation of our country are taking the extreme position and we advocating th opposite are the moderate and reasonable ones advocating mere common sense words like revolutionary though permissible when called for must be used with care and it must be ma clear that we are revolutionary in the sense that thatcher or attlee were revolutionary not in the sense that lenin or robespierre were rule 8 arguments for our policies s hould always be couched in terms of the most moderate language and the most mainstream principles sufficient to vindicate them expl anations of what we stand for should be couched first of all in practical not ideol ogical language that refers to problems that ordinary people experience and solutions they can understand but politics is an inescapably ideological business so ideology must also be discussed second rule 9 the bnp stro ngly prefers the term hard right to far right extreme ri ght or radical right hard implies moral seriousness an d firmness of purpose far and xtreme imply we are outside the spectrum of reasonable opinion radical is acceptabl when addressing highly disaffected audience especially when making radical critique s of the present regime but is othe rwise to be used sparingly lest we sound like marxist troublemakers the best term of all is patriotic right as opposed to unpatriotic right or globalist right ie the tories rule 10 the bnp is not antieurope we are antieu or antieuropean union or antibrussels europe being geographical fact is not something anything can be done about furthermore britain is part of european civilisation and th european peoples are our cultural c ousins it is the eu superstate which is an engine of the destruct ion of europe that we oppose rule 11 the bnp is not an antisemitic party we do not believe that jews per are bad though we do of course reserve the right to condemn individual jews that are doing something bad because of the inflammatory nature of this issue as well as the partys past it is best to simply never speak or write of jews at all it is especially important not to use them as cl umsy code word for other th ings if you really mean american imperial ambitions in the middle east or the treasonous propensities of international financiers then simple truthfulness requires that you say so same goes for zionism which means the belief that palestine belongs to the jews and is not general synonym for j ews behaving badly rule 12 bnp activists and writers must never attack wider target than they need to for example do not alienate teachers by attacking the entire teaching profession when the re object of your condemnation is politicallycorrect teachers do not ttack france where mr pen and his front nationale are our friends as such when the real object of your condemn ation is the present government in paris do not condemn the entire membership of ukip when some of they may join the bnp one day similarly do not overpraise persons or things that mo mentary impress because they are ag ainst something we dislike we dont know if theyll be on our side tomorrow and it could prove inconve nient to have verbally endorsed their cause rule 13 when addressing specifi c audience arguments for our policies should always be couched in language calculated to be relevant to the interests of that audience do not bore workingmens audience with those parts of our ideology that derive from oldschool toryism or puzzle an affluent suburban audience with an explana tion of worker ownership of industry equally dont deny that these other parts of our ideology exist they are nothing to be ashamed of and will not ienate any true supporter rule 14 racial and ethnic epithets and insults should never be used if you just want to make trouble join the national front or some othe r psychologically twiste d politically useless nd sometimes criminal organisation rule 15 bnp activists and writers s hould never refer to black britons or asian britons etc for the simple reason that such persons do not exist these pe ople are black residents of the uk etc and are more british than an englishman living in hong kong is chinese collectively foreign residents of other races should be referred to as racial foreigners nonpejorative term that makes clear the distinction needing to be drawn the key in such matters is above all to maintain necessary distinctions while avoiding provocation and insult rule 16 the correct term for the na tive inhabitants of these isles is actually british as opposed to foreigners who inaccurately claim this status rule 17 britain does not have immigrants term proper for use in settler societies like canada argentina and the usa it has guest workers foreign workers or descendants of foreign workers they are depending on who they are racial foreigne rs religious foreigners or persons of foreign religion or ethnic foreigners th last term is meant to apply to pe rsons racially similar to britons but ethnically dissimilar like dutchmen rule 18 the bnp is not hate group and does not hate anybody with the possible exception of members of the corrupt treasonous political establishmen t we merely believe th at certain foreign persons do not have the moral right to reside in this country we are not about hostility we are about political action if some members occasionally forget this thes are their personal feelings and not the policy of the party they belong to rule 19 political party cannot cceed or even attract new members if it takes as its premise the hopelessness of its cause therefore bnp activists and writers must though they should strongly condemn the rotten character of th present british regime and the society it has produced never speak of the situation in britain as hopeless or of british so ciety as corrupt to the point of worthlessness they must always remember that politics at the end of the day is an act of will and our creative vision of what britain ought to be must always be alive in our hearts nd projected with conf idence to the public rule 21 explanations of our ideology should be couched whenever po ssible in terms of specifically british history and the specific national identity of britain for example when discussing rights we should speak of our traditional righ ts or the rights of englishmen not about universal human rights very different concept that is the province of jacobins and their ideological heirs rule 22 successful revolutions from the right have always presented themselves as restoring older traditions therefore we should couch our agenda in restorationist terms whenever possible this should not be misunderstood as meaning we have to sound like oldstyle tories when their ideas do not coincide with ours ours is populist traditionalism not an elitist one
