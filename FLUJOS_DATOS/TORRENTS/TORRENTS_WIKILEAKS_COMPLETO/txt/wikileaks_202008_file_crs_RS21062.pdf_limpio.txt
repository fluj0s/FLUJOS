facilities in reaction to recent us supreme court decision and bsas highly publicized policy of excluding homosexuals from membership several school districts across the nation sought to deny local scouting organizations free use of their facilities by an agreement reached near the end of last session conferees on hr 1 resolved differences between competing house and senate amendments by adopting basic prohibition against excluding the boy scouts from the use of public school facilities due to the organizations refusal to admit homosexuals if other outside youth groups are permitted to use school property school districts are not compelled to sponsor or otherwise support scouting organizations however as arguably might have been required by broader reading of the house measure

of federally funded public school facilities in reaction to recent us supreme court decision and bsas highly publicized policy of excluding homosexuals from membership several school districts across the nation sought to deny local scouting organizations free use of their facilities in dale v boy scouts of america 3 the court held that application of new jersey public accommodations law forcing the boy scouts to extend membership to an avowed homosexual violated the organizations first amendment right to expressive association in effect the new jersey law was found to burden the boy scouts right to oppose homosexual conduct an intrusion which could not be justified by the states interest in curbing discrimination the five to four majority applied threeprong test to determine that the boy scout policy was protected by the first amendment first examination of the scout oath law and various position statements convinced the court that the scouts disapproved of homosexuality as lifestyle choice and forcing it to accept homosexuals as leaders would violate their freedom of expressive association second inclusion of homosexual leaders would signal acceptance by the group and significantly hamper its ability to advocate its public or private viewpoints finally while the state had an interest in eliminating discrimination it could not be exercised at the cost of another groups constitutional rights in other words the state could not compel the boy scouts to express position totally at odds with its views soon after the boy scouts ruling disputes arose in broward county florida new york city and several other jurisdictions concerning continued local school board support of scouting programs in broward county school authorities reportedly evicted 57 boy scout troops and cub scout packs from school property in december 2000 for violating nondiscrimination clause in their agreement for use of the facilities4 the boy scouts responded with federal lawsuit in miami district court challenging the officials action as unlawful viewpoint discrimination the action claims that the school district violated the scouts right to free expression and equal access to public facilities on march 30 2001 in boy scouts of america v till5 the federal judge found likelihood of success by the boy scouts on the merits of its claim and preliminarily enjoined broward county officials from excluding them from school facilities during offhours by allowing multitude of groups to use its facilities on regular basis the school district had created limited public forum and could not thereafter exclude speech for reasons unrelated to the purpose served by the forum nor discriminate against group on the basis of its viewpoint the government as speaker could fashion its own message the court stated and need not assist the boy scouts in the solicitation of members through scouting days and other affirmative acts but despite its own disapproval of intolerance towards homosexuality the school board could not regulate the speech or punish another group for its own messagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21062crs3 6 147 cong rec h2620 daily ed 5232001 7 42 usc 2000d1 8 34

these judicial principles by making equal access to public school facilities by the boy scouts and similarly situated groups condition to receipt of federal education funds the hilleary amendment was agreed to by voice vote in the house on may 23 20016 that measure prohibited the department of education ed from funding any public elementary or secondary school or supervising state or local educational agencies which 1 has designated open forum and 2 denies equal access or fair opportunity to meet to or discriminates against the boy scouts or other youth groups with similar membership or leadership criteria regarding homosexuality or acceptance of the groups oath of allegiance to god and country designated open forum exists whenever school permits one or more youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities outside of normal school hours youth group is any organization serving young people under the age of 21 the equal access requirements were to be enforced administratively by ed by rules and orders consistent with procedures set forth under title vi of the 1964 civil rights act7 with right of judicial appeal to the federal circuit courts generally the office of civil rights ocr at ed enforces title vi by conducting investigations of complaints filed in its ten regional offices or at national headquarters in washington or by conducting compliance reviews compliance reviews are internally generated and are intended as broad investigations of overall compliance by federal aid recipients institutions are targeted for such review by examining information gathered in surveys by ocr and from other sources the surveys are intended to assist the agency in identifying potential areas of systemic discrimination upon finding an apparent violation of title vi or other applicable law ocr notifies the fund recipient ie the state or local educatio n agency and must then seek voluntary compliance8 if voluntary compliance cannot be secured ocr may pursue enforcement through fund termination proceedings within the agency or seek compliance by other authorized means9 the administrative fund termination process entails notifying the alleged discriminatory entity of the opportunity for hearing before an ed administrative law judge any final agency action terminating assistance to an educational institution may be appealed to the federal circuit courts10 alternatively and more often the case the matter may be referred to the department of justice doj with recommendation for appropriate legal action an identical provision was added to the senate version of the bill on june 14 2001 when the helms amendment was approved by 51 to 49 vote11 senator helms described his amendment as follows specifically the pending amendment stipulates that if public elementary school or public secondary school discriminates against the boy scouts of america or anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21062crs4 12 id at s624950 13 id at s6253 14 id at s6274 15 id at s6269other youth group similar to the boy scouts in providing equal access to school facilities then that school will be in jeopardy of losing its federal funds it stipulates that the office of civil rights within the department of education be given statutory authority to investigate any discriminatory action taken by school authorities against the boy scouts of america the office of civil rights was established to handle discrimination problems that occur within the public school system my amendment would direct the office of civil rights to handle cases of discrimination against the boy scouts precisely the same as the department of education currently handles cases of discrimi nation barred by federal law and which may result in termination of federal funds12 but senator byrd was concerned that the language of the helms amendment protecting the boy scouts or any other youth group that prohibits the acceptance of homosexuals was so broad that it could include ku klux klan youth groups or any other hate groups13 so he proposed revision approved by voice vote to narrow its protections to any youth group listed in title 36 of the us code as patriotic society including the boy scouts of america based on that groups favorable or unfavorable position concerning sexual orientation14 the senate then adopted separate amendment offered by senator boxer guaranteeing equal access to meet in designated open forum to any youth group including the boy scouts of america regardless of their views on sexual orientation but without any provision for terminating federal funds to school districts that fail to comply that amendment was agreed to by vote of 52 to 4715 the education reauthorization bill thus arrived in conference with three versions of the boy scouts amendment the hilleary amendment was the broadest both in terms of groups protected and the range of conduct prohibited in addition to equal access and fair opportunity to meet the house measure included general prohibition on discrimination which could reach beyond simple use of facilities to other distinctions between groups involving official sponsorship and other privileges the helms amendment retained most of the features of the house version including the administrative enforcement procedure but as modified by the byrd amendment protected potentially narrower universe consisting of patriotic societies albeit more than one hundred in number and arguably among the most prominent national organizations the boxer amendment by contrast was confined in scope to equal access and fair opportunity to meet but applied to any youth group without restriction but unlike the hilleary and helms version mechanism was provided for enforcement of the boxer amendment whether administratively or by private right of action as emerged from conference and signed by the president 9525 the boy scouts of america equal access act blends aspects of these earlier contending approaches thus the general equal access mandate requires thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21062crs5 16 pl 107110 9525b1 17 nothing in this section shall be construed to require any school agency or school served by an agency to sponsor any group officially affiliated with the boy scouts of america or any other youth group listed in title 36 of the united states code as patriotic society id 9525b2notwithstanding any other provision of law public elementary school public secondary school local educational agency or state educational agency that has designated open forum or limited public forum and that receives funds made available through the department of education shall deny equal access or fair opportunity to meet to or discriminate against any group officially affiliated with the boy scouts of america or any other youth group listed in title 36 of the united states code as patriotic society that wishes to conduct meeting within that designated open forum or limited public forum including denying such access or opportunity or discriminating for reasons based on membership or leadership criteria or oath of allegiance to god and country of the boy scouts of america or of the youth group listed in title 36 of the united states code as patriotic society16 in its formula tion of forbidden practices the statute is patterned on the original hillearyhelms amendment which in addition to equal access and fair opportunity to meet speaks more broadly in terms of protecting the boy scouts from discrimination based on their membership or leadership policies accordingly beyond denial of access to facilities federallyaided schools or educational agencies may be required to avoid actions or policies that adversely affect the ability of scouting organizations as compared with other youth groups to communicate with students or to otherwise operate within the schools whatever else may be intended however the new law makes clear that the nondiscrimination obligation does not compel schools or school districts to sponsor or promote scouting organizations as might otherwise have been the case under earlier house and senate proposals17 procedures for administrative enforcement of equal access requirements termination of federal funds to noncomplying schools and state or local educational agencies and for judicial review of final ed actions are borrowed from title vi of the 1964 civil rights act as described above
