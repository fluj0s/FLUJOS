such devices in s connection with the raid on the church of scientology in washington d c in j january pi this year i v mr brinkmans testimony for the most part pertained to allegations of unamerican

used by the church in its services to register emotional responses of members of the church who are being interviewed by its ministers mr brinkman advised that the fda went so far as to have one of the inspectors pose as student and attended their academy of scientology fora numbe of weeks brinkman noted that they have grounds to believe that electronic equipme was used and that there was possibility of mail cover being placed on their cor re pondence since their mail was delayed he noted that in his 45 years of legal practic j he could not recall when the federal constitution was so

learning that this agent had recording device he conlronted the agent with this information and was advised by him that it was standard operating procedure for fda agents to use such recording device in connection with factory inspections hubbard stated that as result of his subsequent suit against fda instructions have been issued by that agency to its l inspectors that they are longer permitted to carry such recording devices in i nection with making factory inspection at this point in the hearing chairman long raised the following question have you noticed that any small investigative agency who has been given any power at all tends to allow such power to go to its head and has little concern for the rights of the citizen mr hubbard answered is the affirmative j mr rank a1 s testimony at this point was merely to refute statements made yesterday by mr kirkpatrick w dilling attorney for the manufacturer and distributor of vitamin supplements in chicago illinois the next witness was dr fredericks h d from new york univer sity who related how he has been hounded and persecuted by officials of the fda since 1949 when he had the audacity to disagree with them in his radio program cerning nutritional foods he alleged that from that time on through fdas influence with the federal communications commission and the press his radio programs that were once car ied over some 72 stations have been cut bck to some 20 stations dr fredericks comments made mention of any secret recording devices this series of hearings on the fda were recessed with brief state ment from chairman long in which he severely criticized some of the gestapo inves tigative techniques used by fda he noted that it appears that fda inspectors atterv to prosecute individuals at any cost being completely indifferent to the individ uafs ghts in using snooping devices he expressed the opinion that the american public as whole would greatly benefit if fda investigators would refrain from such actions as bugginc schoolteachers raiding churches and harassing small business firms and direct their attention to the larger firms who have in the past produced and sold harmful drugs these hearing have been recessed until may 5 1965 at which time hearings on the federal communication committee jfcc will you might be interested in knowing that senator javits of new member of this committee made

cr dear sir this letter is being written to request your immediate investigation and assaninconnection with critical situation that involves my sonhhhhb i is eo critical that i am literally petrified at this pointnafiie has been brainwashed by the processing he has undergone in scientology to the point where he has become extremely dangerous to himself to members of his immediate family and his friends and eventually could become danger to society three years ago when my was junior in college he was intro duced to scientology he then dropped out of school and since that time has given all of the money he could earn or obtain to this organ ization in san francisco berkeley and angeles it appears that the techniques used result in selfhypnosis and then the brainwashing procedures begin at this point my is concerned about his own sanity but as result of the conditioning through scientology auditing he is so deluded that he has utter contempt for any estab lished form of psychiatry or scientificallyendorsed approach to mental health problems he is now convinced that themly way he can make it is through scientology its founderl rortbubbard and continued auditing until he reaches the state or clear or thetan if anyone interferes or tries to discourage him from continuing his auditing he is instructed to disconnect from them through investigation i have located reports on scientology in the j american medical associations magazine todays health pages 34 to 39 inclusive of the december 1968 issue this article is entitled scientologymenace to mental health by balph lee smith in this article he states few have heeded the warning of the american psychological association that hubbards claims are not supported by empirical evidence they ignore the statement by the late dr william menninger one of the founders of the famed menninger clinic oftopeka kansas that hubbards system and ideas can potentially do great deal of harm cv c ij i quote also from pages 37 and 38 of the abovementioned article what goes on in scientology auditing sessions preclears wont tell youthey are forbidden to discuss tneir experience with anyone they also are forbidden to speak any word of chief federal bureau of investigation wash rc 21373 page 2 disparagement of scientology to the press or to listen to any condemnation of the cult if the preclears superiors think that he is guilty of any conduct undertaken knowingly to suppress reduce or impede scientology or scientologists1 he may find himself labeled ptspotential trouble sourceand charged with high crimes1 the penalty is dis missal from scientology others in scientology who might presumably include his friends andor members of his family are instructed to disconnect from him however the procedures used in scientology auditing are easily obtained without imperiling any preclears hubbard goes into them in detail in his books the first step is toget preclear securely under the auditors command in spite of the action

could have had disastrous consequences i firmly believe that my is hooked and cannot get well unless he receives professional help to remove the auditing brainwashing now imbedded in his mind he has not since becoming involved with scientology been able to hold position of any kind for any length of time he states that he is through scientology going to control his environment and everyone in it i have read some of the scientology literatureboth books authored by l ron hubbard and some of the endless free literature with which my has been bombarded the minute limited investigation i have been able to make of this organization has put at times in state of panic i have seen my sons personality deteriorate and become progressively worse to the point where now there seems to beit chief federal burfcu of investigation wash c 21373 page 3 sanity present in his reasoning run into many thousands of dollarsthe auditing costs have already is this type of organization which calls itself church in this country in other countries i am told they are not permitted to call themselves church licensed to probe into the mind up to the point of removing the socalled reactive mindthe subconscious or uncon scious mind it is my understanding that the subconscious andor the unconscious mind are extremely important to the wellbeing and sanity of an individual my is intending to resume his coursethe auditingwithin couple of weeks and if he does and they are able to remove his reactive mind i am afraid he will be reduced to jbonbie or vegetable they predicate their ability to remove the reactive mind through their auditing processes have you made any reports on andor investigations into this organi zation if so i would like to know where they are available if this has not come under your direct scrutiny i would request some kind of initial investigation immediately it is impossible for to communicate with my on scientology if he brings up the subject i try to avoid becoming at all involved if i should ask any questions about it he displays jaded personality and seems to be obsessed and under the influence of some magnetic force you can see the change in his eyes whenever scientology takes over members of the organization are constantly after him for more money suggesting what will happen if he doesnt continue with it calling him on the telephone and keeping him in constant state of turmoil i urgently request that you recognize and respond to this letter and contact for any further information or assistance in connection with an investigation in an effort to determine what can be done before it is too late i am most sincere about the urgency of the problem i live in dread of what he might do to those close to him whom he is now determined to control i

energy has duplicated any miracle of yesteryear in healing but it is far more than bdenee of healing by it and by it alone could be determined the quality of those who govern man by scientology one can know and predict his fellows he can heal and secure the future of his children he can evaluate tomorrow and learn to rule todayina few hours scientology can make the lame walk the blind see l ron hubbard has been associated with number of organizations having their headquarters in washington dc among those organizations are the hubbard association of scientologists international hubbard dianetic research 2 ilifl 0 foundation and academy of scientology his organizations allegedly advance new method of curing mental illness known as dianetics vk the april 2k 1951 issue of the times herald newspaper washington dc revealed that hubbards wife charged in divorce suit that he was hopelessly insane and subjected her to scientific torture experiments according to the article competent medical advisors recomnended hubbard be committed to private sanitarium for psychiatric observation and treatment for mental ailment known as paranoidschizophrenia in late 19s2 investigators of the us food and drug administration executed search warrant on the head quarters of l ron hub3ard in washington dc the warrant was based on allegations that certain books and publications authored by hubbard and his associates made false and fraudulent claims for certain cures he was also allegedly manufacturing and selling wonder machine which the food and drug administration also claimed had been misrepresented at that time hubbard was in england and arrests were made on february 20 i960 one dr l ron hubbard jr came to michigan city indiana and rented suite of rooms 3o in the spaulding hotel he represented himself as doctor of ianetics and scientology hubbapj claimed he was superior to psychiatrists and could audit peoples minds taking them back to the time they were in their mothers womb for series of five visits dr hubbard charged 500 in spite of the fee hubbard was obtaining patients and doing good business much to the consternation of the local medical society who believed he was

kid naping his wife by force and imprisoning their 13 month old daughter k the founding church of scishtology is self described as follows the founding church of scientology is legally constituted church domiciled in the district of columbia ia 4 j _ j coo it has branches in other states and has many correspondents and members of its sister religious fellow ship in all parts of the world the church of scientology is dedicated to the freedom of the spirit the entirety of the activities of the church of scientology are dedicated to this end to the freeing of the spirit of man scientology believes that the spirit of man is man himself not his body scientology believes that the spirit of man can be saved from the burden of past sins by the counseling and aiding of the spirit our ends are purely spiritual not secular by the means of scientology we believe man can be made free and pure f ree f the taint of past sins and free to do good to himself and his fellows scientology believes in religious freedom as guaranteed by the constitution of the united states of america scientology will extend thehand of friendship to all who are believers in man as spirit scientology is deadly enemy of secular teachings as stated by such latter day philosophers as marx and others of that ilk1 0 _ scientology believes that the united states of america and the world as whole reouires religious freedom to survive the following is statement by the pounding church of scientology dated january 5 193 concerning the seizure of property by the pood and drug administration us department of health education and welfare k wthe seizure of the property and records of our religious organization the pounding church of scien tology at the instigation of the pood and drug adminis tration of the us department of health education and welfare is shockirtg example of government bureaucracy gone mad it is direct and frightening attack upon the constitutional rights of freedom of religion freedom of press and freedom of speech vs without any prior warning or opportunity for officials of the church to appear in court for hearing large force of united states marshals entered church premises and seised property and pamphlets used in the religious work of the church1 6g 0 there is criticism of the court which issued the seizure tiarrant because it is not apparent from the warrant that the court was advised by the government department that the premises and property of church were to be entered and seized nor is it clear that the united states attorneys office was advised by the department officials that church owned or possessed the property and literature that was seized more than two months ago the food and drug administration interfered with the delivery of the church and its affiliated organizations of the imported scientific instruments which are used in connection with certain phases of the churchs teligious activities protest was made with the baltimore office of the pood and drug administration and ample evidence was submitted showing that the detention of the property was in violation of the law and the stitution of the united states but up to this time the church and its attorney have received administrative ruling which could be appealed either within the department of health education and welfare or to the courts v instead there has been subsequent seizure of property without notice or prior court hearing for the 7l 0 church such as might have occurred under stalin or drttschev in russia v if the legitimate work and activities of one religious organization can be ruthlessly attacked and violated by one branch of the united states government other religious organization is safe from similar or like illegal intrusion and attack the question directly raised is are we in america today living under godless government which intends ultimately to destroy all religions and religious organizations there is nothing in the socalled warrant that was issued to indicate that the court was informed as it should have been that civil administrative proceedings were pending and had not been decided the facts are that the district office of the food and drug administra tion in chicago had previously ruled against the seizure or detention of property such as was seized by request of the same government agency in washington on january 4th and previously another government agency the customs bureau had made definite ruling that is in direct conflict with the basic contention of the food and drug administration on which its seizure of the churchs property was founded _ _ s _ 0 __ the auditor monthly journal ofscientology contains an advertisement for the mark v emeter which reads as follows va the hubbard mark v emeter

kennedy my assistance and the help of scientology in 9j j01 0 narrowing the gap in the space race twice in recent years the white house has specifically requested from us presentation of scientology to see what it could do to help the general effort we responded with mass of information as scientology can raise mens ability through the churchs processing procedures it could be of benefit in improving american scientists in their work on technical problems however as scientology fell in the realm of the spirit and refused to consider kan an animal sprung from mud the help was not accepted in august when kennedy had been president awhile i thought it only courteous to make the gesture again i did not realize that there were lesser officials of the government who were evidently imbued with ideas of religious persecution i would greatly like to have conference with mr kennedy on this subject i am sure we could come to some amicable understanding on religious matters extreme measures such as attacking churches and burning philoso phical texts are not going to solve anything it puts america further ahead in the space race religion should 10v v ct _ _ __ 0 not be factor in these matters if scientology can make smarter scientists i dont think we should forego this national victory just because of some point of religious difference if we can make better pilots and astronauts without injuring their faith i dont see why we cant forego the idea that man is an animal for bit the matter should not rise to the heights of religious persecution religious bigotry has place in national victory unless we do something to give american an edge over her enemies she will continue to be bled white by the tax collectors to support some stupid and costly science if by making smarter scientists and we have many cases that say we can we can save america money and give her victory religious persecution should not be used to keep us from doing it however if president kennedy did grant an audience to discuss this matter that is so embarrassing to the government at home and abroad i would have to have some guarantee of safety of person as all of my books have been seized for burning it looks as though i will have to get busy and write another book l ron hubbftrd 11l i 0 the life magazine article mentioned above makes the following observations regarding scientology among believers scientology and it8 founder are beyond frivolous question scientology s the truth it is the path to civilization without insanity without criminals and without war and for the first time in all ages there is something thatdelivers the answers to the eternal questionsand delivers immortality as well so much of credo might be regarded as harmless practically indistinguishable from any number of minority schemes for the improvement of man but scientology is ecarybecause of its size and growth and because of the potentially disastrous techniques it so casually makes use of to attain the truth scientologist surrenders himself to auditing crude form of psychoanalysis in the best medical circumstances this is delicate procedure but in scientology it is undertaken by an auditor who is simply another scientologist in training who uses an emeter which resembles lie detector government report made to the parliament of the state of victoria in australia three years ago

of dlanetic therapy published in june 1950 by hermitage house new york new york contains the following synopsis concerning dianetics the basis of scientology the creation of dianetics is milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch dianctics gr dionouathought is the science of mind far sinv w_m __ _ pjer than physicsor chemistry tt compares with them in the exact ness of its axioms and efonvconsidcrably higher edition of useful ness the hidden source of ail psychosomatic ms and human aberration has been discovered and ikilli have been developed for their invariable cure dianetics is actually family of sciences embracing the various humanities and translating them into usefully precise definitions the present volume deals with individual dianetics and is hand book onuining the necessary skills bod for the handling of inter personal relations and the treatment ol the mind with the tech niques presented in this handbook the pschiatrist psychoanalyst and intelligent layman can successfully and invariably treat all psychosomatic ills and inorganic aberrations more importantly the skills osered in this handbook wilt produce the dianctic cltvr an i optimum individual with intelligence considerably greater than the current normal or the dianetic release an individual who has been freed from his major anxieties or illnesses the release can be done in less than twenty hours of work and is state superior to any pro duced by several years of psychoanalysis since the release will not relapse dianetics is an exact science and its application is on the order but simpler than engineering its axioms should not be fused with theories since they detnonsirably exist as natural laws hitherto undiscovered man has known many portions of dianctio in the past thousands of years but the data was not evaluated foru 17c importance was not organized into bodyof precise knowledge i addition to tilings known if not evaluated dianctia includes large number of new discoveries of its own about thought and th _ mind t 1 t nc txom nwy be found on die end sheets of xhfa volume ut derstood and applied they embrace the field of human endeavo and thought and yield precision rcsuiu the cist contribution of dianctics is the discovery that the prol terns of thought and mcnul function can be resolved within il bounds of the finite universe which is to say that all data needful i the solution of mental action and mans endeavor can be measured sensed arid experienced as scientific truths independent of mysti cism or metaphysics the various axioms 3re_noi assumptions c theoriesthe case of past ideas about the mindbut arc laws whic can be subjected to the most vigorous laboratory and clinical tests _the first law of uanciks is statement of the dynamic principl of existence the dynamic principle of existence is survive behavior or activity has been found to exist without this pritv cipie it is not new that life is surviving it is new that life lias as it entire dynamic urge only survival survival is divided into four dynamics survival can be under stood to lie in any one of die dynamics and by faulty logic can be explained in terms of any one dynamic man can be said to sur vive for self alooe and by uiifah behavior can be formulated hi can be said to survive for sex alone and by sex alone all behavior can be formulated he can be said to survive for the group only or lor mankind only and in either of these the entire endeavor and behavior of the individual can be equated and explained these are lour equations of survival each one apparently true however the entire problem of the purpose of man cannot be resolved unless one admits all four dynamics in each individual so equated the be itavior of the individual can be estimated with precision these dynamics then embrace the activity of one or many men dynamic one the urge of the individual to reach the high est potential of survival in terms of self and his immediate cyrabiotes 18o dynamic two the urge of the individual to reach the high est pbtential of survival in terms of ux the ait and the creation of children and their rearing dynamic three the urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival in tcrmi of the grot whether civil political or racial and the symbiotcs of that group dynamic four the urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival in terms of mankind and the tymbiote of mankind thus motivated the individual or society seels survival and human activity of any kind has other basis experiment investiga tion and long testing demonstrated that the underrated individual the clear was motivated in his actions and decisions by all the above dynamics and not one alone the clear the goal of dianctic therapy can be created bom psy chotic neurotic deranged criminal or normal people if they have organically sound nervous systems hcderoonstrates the basic nature of mankind and that basic nature has been found uniformly and invariably to be good that is now an established scientific foci not artopinion the char has attained stable state on very high plane he is persistent and vigorous and pursues life with enthusiasm and satis faction he is motivated by the four dynamics as above he has at tained the full power and use of hitherto hidden abilities the inhibition of one or more dynamics in an individual causes an aberrated condition tends toward mental derangement and psychosomatic illness and causes the individual to make irrational conclusions and act still in an effort to survive in destructive ways dianetic technique deletes without drugs hypnotism surgery thocl or other artificial means the blocks from these various dy namics the removal of these blocks permits the free flow of the various dynamics and of course results in heightened persistency in life and much higher intelligence the precision oi dianetib makes it possible to impede or release these dynamics at will with invariable results the hidden source of all inorganic mental disturbance and psychosomatic illness was one of the discoveries of dianetics this aource bad been unknown and unsuspected though vigorously ought or thousands of yean that the discovered source it the 19t c ourcc requires less laboratory proof than vould have been nett wry have proven the correctness of william harveys discover of iltc circulation of the blood the proof dues not depend upon laboratory test kith complicated apparatus but can be made in av group of men by any intelligent individual the source of abcrrafioir has been loundtobe hitherto vnsu pected submind which complete with its own recordings undcrlit what man understands to be his conscious mind the concept t the unconscious mind is replaced in dianciics by the discovery tht die unconscious mind is the only mind which is always conscious in dianciics this submind is called die tractive mini holdovc from au earlier step in mans evolution the reactive mind posscsst vigor and command power on cellular jcvcl it docs net reweis bcr it records and uses die jecordings only to produce action 1 does not think it selects recordings and impinges them upon tht conscious mind and the body widiout the knowledge or cornea ofthe individual thccmlyinformation the individual has ol sucl action is his occasional perception that he is not acting rational about one tiling or another and cannot understand why there i tio censor the reactive mind operates exclusively on physical pain an painful emotion it is not capable of discrentutive thought but aa on the stimulusresponse basis this is the principle on which tht animal mind functions it docs not receive its recordings as mem oty or experience but only as forces to be reactivated it receives it recordings as cellular engrains when the conscious mind is us conscious in drugged state when anaesthetized u in an operation whet rendered unconscious by injufy or illness the individual yet bx bis reactive mind in full operation he may not be aware of what has taken place but as dianetics has discovered and can prov everything which happened to him in the interval of unconscious ness was fully and completely recorded this information is appraised by his conscious mind neither evaluated nor reasoned i tan at any future date become reactivated by similar circumstance observed by the awate and conscious individual when any sud recording an engrain becomes reactivated it has command power it shuts down the conscious mind to greater or lesser degree uvr

antagonistic forces of the exterior environment thus become entered into the individual himself without ihc knowledge or tent of the individual and there they create an interior wjorld of force which exerts itself not only against the exterior world but gainst the individual himself aberration is caused by what has itcen done not done by the individual man has unwittingly long aided the reactive

welcome observation despite existing beliefswhich are not sciet tine acuthat the foetus had memory the psychiatrist and othe workers believed as well that memory could not exist in humx being until rayelin sheathing was formed around the nerves thi was as confusing to dianetics as it was to psychiatry after mud work over some years the exact influence prenatal life had on uv later mind was

falsehoods regarding our church and our founder l ron hubbard the report concerns scientology so mr hubbard is being cited as the founder we have sought from the beginning to have this report corrected and removed from circulation interpol and the german police ean certainly do the latter however since it draws from multiplesources we are talcing the initiative to correct and update each area which was cited as reliable at the same time we initiated campaign regarding such practices we seriously doubted that we were the first to better understand the systems that produce such prac

surgical instruction without license on 24 april 1951 the washington times herald publiahed an article in which hubbarda wife in bringing her divorce charges designated him as hopelessly insane according to the information in this article recom mendation was made by competent medical consultants to admit hubbard to private sanltorlum with view to psy6hlatric observation and treatment of

excellent academic credentials such as dr frank gerbode find concrete substance in mr hubbards works belies the notion that one who writes science fiction cannot also engage in serious philosophic or

classic story on the timedilatation effect hubbard did not start out as science fiction writer he began as travel an aviation writer in 1930 then shifted into pulp fiction writing one of his best early markets was five novels monthly published by dell for them he wrote air adventure storied like hurt itnn winos movenber t934 coast guard stories hke the phantom patrol january 1935 end diving stories such as twenty fathoms downseptember 1934 hubbard was one of the first writers to switch to an electric typewriter in order to keep pace with his own fertile imagination f orlln tremaine had been editorial director of astounding stories end astounding science fiction since late 1933 around 1938 ho persuaded i ron hubbard who had been doing work for some of street smiths nonfantesy magazines to try ttis hand at science fiction he felt that hubbard had light flippant touch which would offset some of the weighty pieces the magazine had been featuring froc saouel hoakovitt tuturee to infinity pyraald books jiew york 1970i diane tics and psychosomatic disturbances by frank cerbode md there is widespread agreement amongst medical professionals and lay public that large proportion of mans ills are psychosomatic by psychosomatic disturbances is meant disturbances in the body caused by disturbances in the mind these may range from minor ones like excedrin headache number 57 caused by burned jello through com pensationitis eg delayed healing of back injury because the patient continues to receive pay for having the injury to actual recognized disease entities such as asthma that are thought to be psychologically caused or aggravated that mental disturbances can and do cause physical disturbances is now beyond dispute study done at yale medical clinic in 3951 showed that 76 of alt patients suffered from what was called emotionally induced illness having per sonally worked at the yale clinic 1 would agree that this disease category far outweighs all others in that and other medical establishments psychosomatic disturbances fall into several different categories the most classic form is the socalled conversion reaction this name comes from the psychoanalytic theory that emotional dis turbances or complexes are converted into phys ical manifestations so that the individual can express or defend against expressing these complexes without having to be aware of doing so thus person may be hysterically blind to defend against the memory of having seen his parents having intercourse or lyzed to defend against aggressive impulses rather dramatic example of this kind of psychosomatic phenomenon is pseudocyesis or pseudopregnancy in which woman or even man may induce physical condition similar in appearance to pregnancy com plete with hormonal changes as an expression of repressed desire to be pregnant in addition to these rather dramaticand rare instances of physical disabilities for which there is classifiable physical disease process there is the less dramatic manifestation of hypochohdriasis stant preoccupation with the body and real or imagined physical problems fact often overlooked vy harried physicians who have to deal with these patients is that hypochondriacs are characteristicallyin real physical distress with real aches pains and other abnormal sensations even illness with welldefined physical causes are profoundly affected by the psychological state of the individual it is well known for instance that epileptic seizures and diabetic crisesnot to mention heart attacks and ulcersare frequently precipitated or aggravated by emotional crises asthma migraine headaches ulcerative colitis atopic dermatitis and variety of other very real physical illnesses are thought by many to have mainly psychological causes and it is currently being widely acknowledged that j forms of illness may be strongly influenced by psychological factors at any rate doctors find that large proportion of their patients are crocks crock is term of contempt for people who forpsychological reasons refuse to get well and continually haunt clinics and physicians offices frequently shopping around from doctor to doctor giving them all failures and making themselves very unpopular when confronted with such patient who is more politely called case with psychological overlay family physician will if he is ambitious administer psychotherapy himself insofar as he can but more often he will refer the patient to psychiatrist having received many such referrals as psychiatrist i can attest that these cases an quite frustrating to handle within the framework of traditional psychotherapy although psychoanalysts havefordecades felt that treatment of psychosomatic conditions was possible they have only had any real success in the rarest category of psychosomatic disordersconversion reactions and while these cases in freuds time seemed to resolve in months the current psychoanalytic timetable is measured in years patient who suffers from an immediate physical problem characteristically has little interest in longterm therapy he wants relief now and b usually not satisfied with the explanation that his oedipus complex will lake j7 years to resolve consequently franquilizers and reassurance b the most common form of treatment since this affords immediate relief and is therefore acceptable to the patient moreover this form of treatment does not cure his condition rather it serves two purposes it ic j dulls the patients awareness of the condition by partially obtunding him and it renders him apathetic by giving him the message that its hopeless to effect real cure this is desirable outcome not for the patient but for the referring physician who is longer harassed by the patient most psychiatrists are trying to make the best of job forwhich they lack adequate tools if it is in fact impossible to afford psychosomatic cases relief from or cure of their conditions then the sooner everyone knows its hopeless the better one could get very frustrated and unhappy trying to run the 10second mile however the psychiatrist who wishes to treat such patients has whether he knows it or not incurred an obligation to have very good look around to see if anyone has way to handle these disorders before deciding they are untreatable any method which is claimed to be workable by its proponents needs to be looked at carefully to see whether it is or not if psychiatry had an effective way to handle psychosomatic problems psychiatrists could afford to ignore lay techniques but since it doesnt they cant i was lucky enough to have close friend who told enoughabout dianetics to make it seem worthwhile to investigate further i found first of all that dianetics has sound theoretical structure one whose principles are readily understandable and intuitively acceptable dianetic theory like most theories that are close to the truth is simple of wide application and predicts further data which when sought after will be found its results are duplicatabie in practice by anyone who is willing to get trained in its techniques dianetic counselling acts by eliminat ing the psychological factors that tend to hold an oiness in place thus allowing the natural course of healing or medical treatment to proceed unimpeded dianetics does not compete with medicine as healing technique dianetic counselor requires the counselee to obtain complete medical exam and appropriate medical treatment before starting dia netic counseling thus it turns out that dianeticgroups are major source of referrals for doctors and doctors whose patients are concurrently getting bianetics have the gratifying experience of having their treatments work well the primary purpose of dianetics b not healing buf the elimination of distractions which non optimum bodily and emotional stale causes even relatively minor disorder such as fever or headache can greatly lower persons efficiency in life phobias such as fear of heights or less clinical fears such as fear of talking in front of groups can restrict ones life considerably drug addiction could be sa id t be caused by the presence of unwanted body sensations and emotions thai compel use of drugs for their alleviation when these unwanted sensations and emotions are handled dianctically person has further need to use drugs he is then free to go about the business of living full life summary 1 psychosomatic disorders and emotional upsets make up the vast majority of human suffering 2 standard medical treatment alone is inadequate to alleviate much of this suffering 3 psychiatric resources are few consisting mainly of offering support and drugs to help person live with condition he cannot nope to cure 4 outside the standard psychiatric framework there is precise duplicatable technique which when correctly applied uniformly and predictably leads to cure or great improvement in psychosomatic disorders when combined with standard medical treatment 5 the purpose of dianetics however is not prim arily to heat bodies but to free an individual from physical and emotional distractions so that he can pursue the business of living with maximum efficiency 2 mr upcrior court of jlcto state board of medical examiners plaintiff bubbard dianetic research foundation defendantcivil action certificate i mortimer

very precise account of the prosecution on the application of the dispositions invoked by the law of 9 december 19051 whereas the article 1st of this text stipulates that the french republic ensures the liberty of conscience and guaranties the free exercise of cults under the sole restrictions enacted there after and this in the interest of public order whereas the state thus claims its neutrality in religious matters does not favor any cult and rv t i irf eaves to anyone total freedom of belief s liiclaciitilii whereas however that this neutrality does nothw ttllifi fl pi7trp n any way tne secular tribunals and more specifically to the repressive jurisdiction guardian of public order to intervene as such in the presence of the practice of cult whatever it may be penal offense has been committed to the prejudice of member of religiouslifcis right of interventions consequence on one hand of the sovereignty or the secular state which manifests itself by the primacy of the civil law and also by the duty which devolves upon that state to protect the essential interests of its nationals in any circumstances whereas the scientology fact seems to correspond to an activity which applies to the usual definition of religion inasmuch the court observes that in scientology despite the lack of metaphysical pre occupations to which the great occidental religions traditionally cling to the subjective element which is faith is supplemented by the existence of human community as small as it maybe whose members are united by system of beliefs and practices relating to sacred things but whereas it does not mean that scientology even though regarded as religion and fitting thereupon the juridical structure set by the law of 9 december 1905 escapes all repression once the relations it maintains with its parishioners are longer on the terrain of spirituality or belief or of the one of its internal organisation but deal with financial questions on the occasion of which the patrimony of some adepts could have been wrongedunder circumstances which fit to the qualifications as defined by the article 405 of the penal code jt whereas indeed the court could not admit the inter pretation brought up by andreus counsels according to vhich the principle of the neutrality of the state in religious matters demonstrated by the organisation of secularity in the law of the 1st august 1905 the provision by this text of mean of financing of churches by the believers themselves according to the system known at cultuol associations and the use bytext in its article reff the formulation under the sole restrictions thteafter confers visavis the state complete autonomy of the system established and forbids the jurisdiction of common law to vithold their competence towards members of the church of scientology outside the perimeter laid down by the repressive clauses of the aforementioned law s whereas indeed the text refered to article 32 which guarantees the free exercise of cult covers exclusively the acts assaults violence or threats against an individual in order to determine him either by fear of loosing his job or by the wrong which could happen to himself his family or his fortune to exercise or refrain from exercising cult to belong or cease to belong to cultual association to contribute or refrain from contributing to the expenses of cult whereas the qualification thus defined is without relation to the fraud the said fraud is distinguished mainly by the existence of fraudulent manoeuvres to undermine or attempt to undermine the patrimony of some body while the article 31 of the 1905 law intends to curb an offence which is similar to the crime of extortion or threats and which if it can in fact be j expressed by transfer of funds could not be classified as fraud within the socalledshrewdcriminality i ithat moreover the spirit of the two opposed tets__ is profoundly different that the article 31 is special text whose perimeter of application is limited to the relations between the church and its parishioners and which is liable to cover the facts directed at by the prosecution while the article 405 of the penal code is general text whose object is to protect without any restriction the victims of prejudice to5ipatrinony through trrsvof false name or f quality or in ian r way of fraudulent manoeuvres whereas the article 33 of the 1905 law manoeuvres enacts that the precedent clauses that is to say those of the articles 31 and 32 only apply to troubles outrages or violence whose nature or circumstances do not lead to heavier penalties according to the clauses of the penal code that in this way the 1905 legislator has himself foreseen that the texts of this code would be if the case arises applied to certain infractions in relation with the adminis tration of cults but about which the repression demands in view of their gravity that they be punished by clauses envisioning heavier penalties thanthose of the articles 31 and 32 that if the article 33 does not expressly aim at the article 405 the principle it states about recourse if need be to the common law texts thwarts the sdcalled inter diction to base the lawsuit on penal qualifications other than those defined by the 1905 law whereas it does not matter much that the financial ressources of scientology in france be precisely those foreseen as regards their finality by the iaw of 9 dec 1905 that such condition is insuffii cient to exempt its directors from all risks of penal lawsuit i whereas it comes into the province of the repressive jurisdiction to which the matter is refered to verify whether or not under the cover of apparently voluntary adherents payments the concerned church did not use any mean through its founders or leaders which turned out to be fraudulent when examined and leading to any damage to people whose agreement would have been twisted and would have been in fact deceived vb concerning andreus personal position whereas the court has to examine it within the tight extent of its seisin saisine since andreu as well was the only defendant to appeal the decision the fraudulent manoeuvres have to be appraised according to his specific position whereas it appears that this defendants role was limited at least regarding his powers extent whereas he was appointed as president of the french association of scientology in september 1972 when the whole organisation in question was already established and whereas he immediately resigned from the presidency to become again simple minister of the cult after he was convicted on january the 8th 1976 within the frame work of the examination started on december the 12th 1970 whereas in 1972 andreu was 21 years old whereas he got into the church of scientology to follow initiation conferences and whereas he did not previously obtain any religious or philosophical education which might have enabled him to appraise with detached enough attitude the merits or unselfishness of the method chosen by the founder of scientology ron hubbard i i whereas this latter never stopped in spite of more apparent than real retirement from his functions of director of he church in 1966 to impress with his authority upon the organizing of scientology associations whereas document seized on march the 10th 1972 bears that he was at that time the director of the scientology centers whereas laarhuis the executive director for all the associations was put by hubbard above the president of the french association and was supervising all the activities of that one of which he was responsible j for under senior authorities to wit hubbard on theathena s whereas it is to thes authorities that laarhuis was sending his reports on the activities of the french association whereas before he disappeared laarhuis stated to the examining magistrate that the president the treasurer and the secretary were his direct assistants whereas he was particularly responsible for the good running of the courses the controlling of the treasury of the association and that it was up to him to decide finally regarding its budget establishing whereas andreu who did nothing but enforce hubbards general policies and more specifically laarhuiss ones as regards the french association could not have gained due to his functions any profit which can be considered as abnormal whereas in 1972 he received 8977 frs for full time duties funds which progressively increased to reach 21682 frs in 1976 whereas in 1976 he resigned from his presidents function which was longer allowing him to decently survive in order to devote himself to remunerated management consultants activity whereas it is fitting however to examine whether or not andreu who was then in function was responsible of the facts mentioned by the koch couple to support theiri complaint for fraud j iwhereas in their complaint which inspite of it having been withdrawn did let the prosecution running the koch couple were explaining that they got interested when starting on november 1973 and bought several books of this discipline whereas in march 1974 their thierry 16 years old came to paris to follow the socalled communication course and appeared to have written letter to atidreu telling him that he was pleased whereas nevertheless in february verhierry koch was locatea strasbourg his motherv maimed for being refundc of the sum of 6350 frs that she paid for an electrometer which was delivered to her and for two courses which were to be followed in paris and for book khereas the repayment was claimed for in letter of 15 february 1974 and confirmed by another letter of 20 february where mrs koch was threatening to lodge complaint whereas it got filed at the public pro secutors in strasbourg on 24 february whereas besides it seems that post strike delayed the church of scientology in the receiving of mrs kochs letters whereas this latter was later refunded for the entirety of the claimed sums and whereas she decided to withdraw her complaint whereas the facts denounced by the koch couple do not appear to constitute fraud offense whereas the counter part of the cost did correspondto an electrometer which was provided and of two books and the remainder relating to courses to be delivered on which an advance payment had been claimed khereas inasmuch as upon one of the parties request the contract may be cancelled and the price refunded the needed element of chimerical credit and imaginary power is uneasy or even impossible to detect the courses not having been followed by thierry koch and their content thus their value cannot be appraised whereas concerning tran ncog lans constitution as party it deals with facts prior to andreus appointment as director of the association whereas on another hand tran charges only laarhuis with whom he was frequently in contact vhereos he mot andreu only the day he decided to leave the association and whereas upon decision madewhereas durvigce hearings the court wa ibie to observe andreus spiritual fervor and strength or convictions where as the sincerity of this young 20 years old man married with wife whom he met at the initiation conferences should not challenged whereas he gave himself body and soul to this new religious discipline whereas this adherence established by laarhuis under hubbards directives and whereas the more over not very important role he played as regards the respon sibilities he was entrusted with and the extent of his wages did not permit him to judge with enough moral independence whether or not the method preached and taught by scientology could constitute breach of the french penal law whereas the court deems that in its entirety andreus act is impressed with good faith and that the moral element of fraud the intention to deceive in order to obtain funds not being established the suit against him was not founded and whereas by annulation of the appealed decision andreu must be discharged whereas by the effect of the decision to occur on the prosecution trans constitution as civil party against andreu is not founded and whereas he will be dismissed the court by these reasons invalidating the judgment insofar as it stated andreu guilty of fraud discharges him states trans consti tution as civil party nonfounded and dismisses him and leaves the expenses for the treasury to pay s i vn fin pjmquci du heant neant pvw conviction q984 cnsmalion p c k1iakt keant neakt di contradicto1re tl cls relaxe deboute p c polfvo on alt tl f has cowr citation

squelching its critics since 1986 hubbard and his church have been the subject of four unfriendly books all released by small yet courageous publishers n each case the writers have been badgered and heavily sued one of hubbards policies was that all perceived enemies are fair game and sub ject to being tricked sued or tied to or stroyed those who criticize the church journalists doctors lawyers

church iast sum mer scientologists spent an estimated si million to plaster the reporters names on hundreds of billboards and bus placards across the city above their names were quotations taken out of context to portray the church in positive light the churchs most fearsome advocates are its lawyers hubbard warned his follow ers in writing to beware of attorneys who tell you not to sue the purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win result scientology has brought hundreds of suits against its perceived ene mies and today pays an estimated 20 mil lion annually to more than 100 lawyers one legal goal of scientology is to bankrupt the opposition or bury it underpaper the church has 71 active lawsuits against the ms alone one of them misca vige vs as has required
