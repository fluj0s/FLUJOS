issues of patent ownership under collaborative ventures these identical bills amend 35 usc section 103 to permit the patenting of inventions made through joint research among multiple partners if certain conditions are met the change is in response to 1997 decision of the federal court of appeals in oddzon products inc v just toysinc the court stated that absent an assignment of rights to single entity prior to the start of research endeavor the sharing of information among members of research team could render any resulting invention unpatentable because it does not meet the nonobvious requirements of the law to be nonobvious an invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was

court decision was seen by some observers to be an impediment to joint publicprivate research endeavors and contrary to the intent of congressional policy facilitating such activities this report will be updated as events warrant congress has had longstandi ng interest in cooperative research and development rd and its connection to technological advance it is now widely accepted that technological advancement accounts for up to onehalf of the nations economic growth over time joint ventures ar an attempt to facilitate t echnological development within the industrial community academia industry and government are often seen as playing complementary roles in bringing new pr oducts processes and services to the marketplace while opponents argue that collaborative activities stifle competition proponents assert that they are designed to accommodate the strengths and res ponsibilities of these sectors cooperativ projects are intended to u tilize and integrate what the participants do best and direct these efforts to the goal of generating new technologies proponents note that they allow for shared costs shared risks shared facilities and shared expertise

schacht crs report rl30320 3 35 usc section 101a major emphasis of legislative activity has been to augment research in the private sector this focus is reflected in executive branch and congressional efforts to encourage companies to undertake cooperative rd arra ngements and to expand the opportunities available for research various laws have created an nvironment conducive to joint ventures between government and industry or between indus try and universities as well as among companies beginning in 1980 with the passage of legi slation mandating the transfer of technology from g overnment laboratorie s and allowing certa in contractors to retain title to inventions made under federal funding c ongress has demonstrated its support for facilitating innovation through cooperative rd this approach continues today in laws designed to make additional alterations to policies regarding government owned intellectual property1 series of laws use patent ownership to foster collaboration between parties in the research and development enterprise among these are pl 96418 the stevenson wydler technology innovation act pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act and pl 98622 amendments to the patent act2 patents protect the invento rs investments in generating the knowledge that is the basis for innovation and serve as an incentive to the commercialization of new ideas as rd has become more expensive ownership of title to inventions has been used as means to encourage collaborative work among the different players in the research enterprise the patent system is grounde d in article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution and is intended to stimulate new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the grant of patent pr ovides the inventor with means to capture returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for generally 20 years from date of filing this is designed to encourage those additiona l investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate ma rketable technology at the same time the process of obtaining patent makes available to the public the concepts on which it is based in return for monopoly right to speci fic applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often doe s stimulate others to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developm ents or to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace to be patentable an invention mu st be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit3 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by an earlier patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain typically referredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21882crs3 4 35 usc section 102 5 35 usc

nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made5 in 1984 congress enacted pl 98622 amendmen ts to the patent act as response to several court decisions wh ich appeared to make the results of collaborative research activities nonobvious because earlie r discoveries of individua l research team members were considered prior art maki ng the new inventions unpatentable6 the 1984 legislation amended 35 us c section 103 to provide that background information shared within an organization as part of cooperative effort was not to be considered prior art which would have prevented pa tenting of the resulting innovation as stated in section bysection analysis of hr 6286 the bill which became law new technology often is developed by using background scientific or technical information known within an organization but unknown to the public the bill by disqualifying such background information from prior art will encourage communication among members of research teams and patenting and consequently public dissemination of the results of team research7 the concept of what constituted an organization within which research was performed was intended to be broad according to th house committee on the judiciary in the 108th congress in amending section 103 to promote collaborative research congress did not expressly limit the benefit of the new law to circumstances in which the collaboration involved researchers from w ithin single organization instead it provided that researchers from different organizations w ho had commonly assigned their rights to single entity could also benefit from the safe harbor created by the law8 however this interpretation was called into question in the federal court of appeals 1997 decision in oddzon products inc v just toys inc the court found that the sharing of information among research team members could result in the invention being deemed obvious and therefor not subject to patent if the participants had not previously assigned intellectual property rights to single entity prior to generating the invention thus if structured research agreement specifying patent ownership had not been implemented before work commenced ot herwise patentable pr oducts or processes could be rendered unpate ntable if in the collaborative r d process the partners shared information even on confidential basis the federal court decision has been seen by some observers as an impediment to cooperative publicprivate research endeavors this was thought to be contrary to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21882crs4 9 ibid 5 10 ibid 5intent of established congressional policy facilitating such activities many states and the federal government opera under laws and practices that tend to prohibit the assignment of inventive rights to pr ivate sector collaborative partner as oddzon stet putatively requires9 in undertaking governmenti ndustry cooperative research the federal departments and agencies may keep title to inventions made by government employees while the private sector party retains the intellectual property generated by its staff these rights may not be amenable to the transfer to single commercial entity prior to the start of the rd enterprise because of existing law and current government policies universities are also restricted in what they are allowed to do with certain types of intellectual property arising from cooperative rd under the bayhdole act 35 usc section 202c7 nonprofit orga nizations including unive rsities are prohibited from assigning to another institution the rights to an invention resultin g from federally funded rd without the approval of the federal agen cy financing the research according to june 10 2003 testimony before the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on courts the internet and intell ectual property jeffrey kushan argued that universities cannot create the legal structures that will qua lify them for the safe harbor of section 103c for their external research collaborations th is he maintains results in situation where only certain institutions can protect their inventions under joint ventures while other organizations involved in the innovation process are unable to do so responding to these concerns pl 108453 the cooperative research and technology enhancement create act allo ws for patenting of inventions made through cooperative rd with mu ltiple parties if cer tain conditions are met under the new law inventions generated in the process of collaborative research are treated as if they were made by single inventor if written coopera tive agreement has been signed prior to the development of the discovery according to the house committee on the judiciary the create act provides simp means of extending the safe harbor provisions of current law that treats inventions of common owner similarly to inventions made by single person10 longer would title to inventions need to be assigned to single entity before research commences in order to be deemed nonobvious under joint research endeavor these provisions ar prescriptive and do not apply retroactively
