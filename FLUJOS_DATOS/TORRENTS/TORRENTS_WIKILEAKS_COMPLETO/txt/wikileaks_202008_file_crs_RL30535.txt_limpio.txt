april 21 2000 eugene h buck senior analyst in natural resources policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this document provides general background and identifies current issues of concern in the domestic and international management of highly migratory fish species eg billfish shark and tuna also discussed are differences among species management in various us coastal regions current legislation and related issues are summarized for proposals to modify management of sharks to restrict finning and to ban or restrict pelagic longline fisheries this document will be updated periodically as these issues evolve legislation on these issues is tracked in crs report ib10010 fishery aquaculture and marine mammal legislation in the 106th congress management of us fisheries for highly migratory species summary domestic and international management of highly migratory fish species eg marlin sailfish swordfish shark and tuna is complex and controversial because these species migrate across many jurisdictions and are caught in various fisheries where commercial and sport fishermen compete for harvests increasing environmental concern and user competition for shrinking resource have led groups to ask congress to consider several initiatives that would modify how the united states manages these fisheries domestically the national marine fisheries service and regional fishery management councils have developed management measures for highly migratory species hms fisheries under the authority of the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act internationally the united states participates as party to several agreements for managing these species cooperatively in addition multilateral highlevel conference on conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in the central and western pacific is in the final stages of negotiation swordfish management concerns include overfishing in the atlantic with proposals seeking to prohibit pelagic longline fishing in certain areas of the atlantic and gulf of mexico and to finance buyout of longline vessel permits legislation has been introduced in the 106th congress to implement these proposals hr 3331 hr 3390 s 1911 or to prohibit all pelagic longline fishing in us atlantic waters hr 3516 shark finning ie removal of fins and discarding of the rest of the shark carcass is controversial and currently is prohibited in the atlantic but allowed in the pacific legislation hr 3535 in the 106th congress proposes to prohibit this practice in the pacific general management issues relate to establishing better means of monitoring the farranging fisheries for hms using combination of satellite technology eg vessel monitoring systems and onboard observers and to minimizing incidental bycatch of nontarget species such as sea turtles and marine mammals by hms fishing gear this document will be updated

migratory species background under the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act msfcma 16 usc 180220 highly migratory species hms are defined as tunas oceanic sharks and billfishes marlins tetrapturus spp and makaira spp sailfishes istiophorus spp and swordfish xiphias gladius hms are managed differently from most fish because their extensive migrations necessitate coordinated management across many jurisdictions these fish are caught by us sport and commercial fishermen in inshore statemanaged waters within the us exclusive economic zone eez in the eezs of central and western pacific island nations under treaty agreement and in international waters most of the us commercial catch of swordfish and sharks is taken within the us eez however in the pacific the majority of tuna sharks and swordfish caught by us commercial fishermen is taken in international or foreign waters table 1 1998 us commercial landings of highly migratory fish species metric tons1

of commerce rather than by individual regional fishery management councils2 on may 28 1999 nmfs published final rule to begin implementing new coordinated hms fishery management plan fmp for 1 national marine fisheries service fisheries of the united states 1998 washington dc national oceanic and atmospheric administration department of commerce current fishery statistics 9800 july 1999 p

atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico3 regulations implementing amendments to separate fmp governing billfish management in the atlantic and gulf were published at the same time more recently nmfs completed stock assessment and fishery evaluation for atlantic highly migratory species safe 20004 providing updated background information for managing all atlantic hms fisheries in the central and western pacific eg hawaii and us pacific islands the western pacific fishery management council has pelagic ie open ocean fmp for managing hms while the pacific fisheries management council is in the process of developing an fmp for hms fisheries along the us west coast the pacific councils fmp will likely bring together washington oregon and california state regulations relevant to hms and may consider limiting entry to control capacity and effort in west coast hms fisheries to enhance the economic position of the existing fleet5 the pacific councils plan has raised concerns about possible capacity shifts among hms fishermen6 the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas iccat coordinates international management of tuna and swordfish in the atlantic7 in the eastern tropical pacific east of 150ow longitude the longestablished interamerican tropical tuna commission iattc sets quotas for two tuna species yellowfin and bigeye has work groups dealing with important management issues eg fleet capacity bycatch management of fisheries on fish aggregating devices and is addressing major administrative concerns eg financing compliance renegotiation of its convention renegotiating its convention will bring the iattc into line with the provisions of the united nations convention on law of the sea and its implementing agreement agreement on conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks8 if the renegotiated iattc convention involves major changes and is signed by the united states the senate may consider its consent to ratification in the central and western pacific west of 150ow longitude the multilateral highlevel conference mhlc on conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in the central and western pacific9 is in the last stages of its 3 64 federal register p 2908929160 may 28 1999 4 nmfs documents are available at httpwwwnmfsgovsfahmspghtml 5 the west coast states already limit entry to most fisheries including the driftnet fishery for swordfish and sharks off california and oregon 6 continued restrictions on groundfish could prompt fishermen to shift to the albacore fishery such move might exacerbate existing economic concerns arising from too much product being available without added markets for this seasonal fishery 7 see httpwwwiccates 8 the department of states bureau of oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs is coordinating us involvement in these renegotiations 9 material related to negotiation of the mhlc are available at continued crs3 negotiations focusing primarily on tunas10 the mhlc likely will implement vessel monitoring system vms and national quotas as well as limiting both effort and capital investment by nation since the late 1980s us purse seine vessels have been authorized to fish in the exclusive economic zones of many pacific island nations under treaty between those nations and the united states11 many of the principles and measures eg vms observers and regional vessel registry of the south pacific tuna treaty are being adopted into the mhlc reflecting the favorable experience with the united states under this treaty if the mhlc convention is signed by the united states the senate may consider its consent to ratification the united states has ratified the agreement on conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks12 when this agreement comes into force the united states and its flag fishing vessels will be bound by the decisions of iccat and iattc as well as any mhlc convention or similar agreement which enters into force even if the united states does not sign the mhlc convention or even join the international organization hms management issues monitoring monitoring of fleet activities is necessary for good data collection and effective enforcement over the extensive range of hms fisheries due to the multijurisdictional and farranging nature of hms fisheries there is increasing interest in using satellite technology and navalcoast guard resources to regulate hms fisheries and apprehend flag of convenience vessels catching hms fish illegally to better manage the pelagic longline fishery in the atlantic and identify where individual vessels are fishing nmfs is implementing vessel monitoring system vms for us pelagic longliners in the atlantic beginning september 1 200013 in the pacific nmfs conducted hawaii longline pilot vms study between january 1 1996 and march 15 1997 vms is seen by many as the most effective way to enforce the closing of fishing areas and monitor where vessels fish however issues such as proprietary interests since fisherman make their living by knowing where to fish and who should pay since vms is fairly expensive make vms implementation controversial indeed lawsuit challenging the vms requirement in the atlantic is 9 continued httpiminasoesthawaiiedupfrppdfmhlc5_rptpdf

scientific affairs 11 treaty on fisheries between the governments of certain pacific island states and the government of the united states of america port moresby 1987 12 see httpwwwtuftsedufletchermultitextsilm1542txt the senate approved resolution of ratification for this agreement treaty doc 10424 on june 26 1996 13 64 federal register p 2908929160 may 28 1999 with several subsequent delays in vms implementation announced by nmfs crs4 pending in the courts14 the minimal guidance and apparent lack of authority in the magnusonstevens act has impeded the development of monitoring programs such as onboard observers and vms especially regarding the use of industry assessments to cover program costs so that an entire fleet bears the cost instead of only the vessels in the fleet that participate in the monitoring program bycatch and protected species interactions minimizing interactions with protected species eg marine turtles is concern in the management of fishing gear for several hms fisheries on november 23 1999 us district court judge ordered nmfs to close large area off midway island to hawaiian longline fishermen to protect sea turtles since most of the affected waters are outside the us eez fishermen from other countries and even other us states particularly california are allowed to fish in the area only hawaiian fishermen are directly affected by regulations implementing this order15 the atlantic longline fishery for swordfish has similar problem with sea turtle interactions in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp changes to us tunadolphin regulations16 in response to the international dolphin conservation program act idcpa pl 10542 have modified the definition of dolphinsafe allowing yellowfin tuna caught using purse seine nets to be imported into the united states if dolphins were observed17 to have been killed or severely injured18 the idcpa mandates that parties cooperate in the conservation and management of the fish stocks and deal with such issues as bycatch in the purse seine fisheries despite the continued relatively low mortality of dolphins in the etp19 the new nmfs regulations are highly controversial and were challenged in federal courts by coalition of animal protection groups as being insufficiently protective of dolphins on apr 11 2000 us district court judge thelton henderson blocked nmfs implementation of more relaxed standards for what tuna might qualify to be labeled as dolphinsafe saying that nmfs had failed to assess whether the proposed labeling change would cause harm to dolphin populations judge henderson concluded that nmfs failed to complete critical stress research testing of dolphins that were repeatedly captured and released 14 blue water

dolphin protection and tuna seining 19 combined us and foreign dolphin mortality in 1999 was less than 1500 animals fraction of the estimated several hundred thousand dolphins killed annually in the early 1970s crs5 individual fishery concerns billfish other than the commercial harvest of swordfish billfish are taken incidentally as bycatch in other commercial fisheries and are targeted and caught by sport fishermen many of whom practice catchandrelease and tagging to allow fish to survive the commercial catch of swordfish is landed primarily in california 214 of 1998 landings florida 115 massachusetts 91 louisiana 49 and hawaii much of the remaining 53 in late august 1999 the billfish foundation the coastal conservation association the american sportfishing association and the blue water fishermens association signed memorandum of understanding mou wherein both sport and commercial interests agreed to closing certain areas of the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico to commercial pelagic longline fishing for swordfish and to participating in financing buyout of permits for pelagic longline vessels that are responsible for much of the incidental mortality to undersized swordfish and billfish ie bycatch legislation hr 3331 hr 3390s 1911 introduced in the 106th congress would implement this mou20 on december 15 1999 nmfs published proposed rule differing from the mou and the introduced bills that would close different areas in the gulf of mexico to reduce billfish bycatch but would provide permit buyout21 some question the equity of both proposals because the closures in the south atlantic leave few areas open to domestic swordfishermen in florida in addition seafood processors in affected areas claim that without commercial longlining in the winter months they might face bankruptcy others are concerned that without buyout the nmfs proposal might displace commercial vessels to other areas and fisheries some suggest possible benefits from the proposed longline closures for related species recalling the improvements in the yellowfin tuna fishery after japanese longline fishermen departed from the gulf of mexico in march 1999 nmfs banned the import of undersized atlantic swordfish22 those regulations assure accurate monitoring of swordfish imports by requiring the identification of the catching vessel flag ie country of vessel documentation certifying that pieces are not from undersized atlantic fish and increasing dealer reporting requirements some question whether harvesting only larger swordfish might raise problems with meeting the us food and drug administrations maximum allowable level of 10 ppm of methylmercury for these fish in an effort to address overfishing of atlantic swordfish seaweb and the natural resources defense council instituted the give swordfish break campaign to discourage consumers from eating swordfish23 20 see httpwwwbillfishorgdirsupportservicesmultimediaeducationalvideos ms56khtm

commercial and recreational fisheries striped marlin are prized gamefish off california and cannot be sold in the state blue marlin wahoo mahimahi and the tunas are key gamefish in hawaii and in some other parts of the western pacific however all of these species are also valued as commercial products only one stock blue marlin is thought to be below the maximum sustainable yield level although it probably is not overfished as that term is defined in the magnusonstevens act major problem throughout the pacific including us territories and hawaii is the general dearth of recreational catch and effort data for billfish while there are some catch data from tournaments there is general lack of effort data eg how many boats are fishing on any day those data need to be linked to the catch data to provide effective catch per unit effort to better monitor the stock status for individual species sharks us commercial shark fisheries occur primarily off louisiana 192 of 1998 landings florida 190 california 79 north carolina 75 and hawaii much of the remaining 46 most sharks caught by sport anglers are released while nmfs prohibits shark finning24 in the atlantic and gulf of mexico this practice is still permitted in the pacific where blue shark populations the primary species finned are considered to be robust shark finning is quite controversial and several conservation and animal welfare groups are seeking to prohibit this practice in the pacific in the 106th congress hconres 189 hr 3078 and hr 3535 were introduced to address these concerns by studying pacific shark fisheries andor prohibiting shark finning early in 2000 the hawaii legislature was also considering passage of state law to prohibit shark finning more recently nmfs received petition for rulemaking to prohibit shark finning and require full utilization of sharks harvested in fisheries managed by the western pacific fishery management council25 in may 1997 some commercial shark fishermen filed suit against nmfs challenging commercial harvest quotas for atlantic sharks federal court injunction resulted in nmfs foregoing its more restrictive management measures including lower quotas slated to take effect on july 1 199926 in june 1999 coalition of sport fishing groups also filed suit against nmfs charging that shark management focused inequitably on limiting recreational fishing final ruling has yet been made on either case in march 1999 the united nations food and agriculture organization fao adopted voluntary international plan of action for the conservation and management of sharks requiring participating nations to adopt by 2001 national plan for reducing catch in shark fisheries as well as shark bycatch in other fisheries 24 the practice of catching sharks to harvest only the fins for the lucrative asian shark fin market discarding the remainder of the shark carcass as waste 25 65 federal register p 19734 april 12 2000 26 southern offshore fishing assn v daley 995 f supp 1411 md fla 1998 crs7 nmfs is preparing but has not yet published proposal for us implementation of the fao shark initiative tuna commercially 67 of the worlds tuna harvest is taken in the pacific because of this some of the top us ports for tuna landings are in the western pacific eg american samoa guam27 however pacific tuna harvest statistics are often omitted from nmfs reports because much of the us harvest is caught outside the us eez and is landed in american ports in samoa guam and elsewhere along with sizeable foreign landings mainland states with significant commercial tuna landings include california 75 of total 1998 us tuna landings washington 29 oregon 22 and louisiana 06 recreational harvest estimates are available for yellowfin tuna with 1998 catch primarily in the south atlantic region 622 of estimated number of sportcaught fish in 1998 midatlantic 205 and southern california 153 the atlantic bluefin tuna fishery is managed through the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas iccat28 rebuilding the population of this species is encouraged by strict harvest quotas current iccat concerns focus on minimizing illegal unreported and unregulated iuu harvests as well as ensuring that all parties to iccat abide by commission guidelines and quotas unilateral us efforts to rebuild atlantic bluefin tuna populations have been frustrated by lax enforcement of iccat guidelines elsewhere additional general considerations additional general concerns relating to how nmfs and regional councils manage hms fisheries include not in any particular order 1 integrating pelagic species fisheries management especially when one fisherys bycatch is the target species of another fishery and accounting for bycatch in quota calculations and fishing effort estimates 2 incorporating diversity eg differences among commercial gear types and between sport and commercial users within and among various user groups to achieve sustainable fishery maintain social equity and estimate the effects of proposed regulatory plans particularly their economic effects 3 evaluating the need for mandatory reporting system for economic data to adequately evaluate the effects of proposed regulatory changes 4 determining the cumulative impacts of hms regulations on the fishing industry 5 improving the objectivity and transparency of nmfs scientific assessment procedures eg more field data collection and analysis involving stakeholders and independent scientists less reliance on computer modeling that support management and regulatory actions to enhance agency credibility and forestall litigation 6 making the role and responsibility of nmfss atlantic hms advisory panel comparable to that of regional council to improve accountability for hms management decisions 7 assuring that us fishermen who abide by international management guidelines are not denied reasonable opportunity to harvest the shared resource and 8 providing sufficient 27

compatible management regimes throughout the ranges of hms stocks in the pacific congressional focus environmental concern for declining hms populations as well as increased competition between sport and commercial fishermen for preferential allocation of the lessabundant stocks have brought hms issues before congress the 106th congress may choose to address hms issues when considering whether to close areas to pelagic longline fishing hr 3331 hr 3390 hr 3516 s 1911 whether to take action on shark finning in the pacific hconres 189 hr 3078 hr 3535 and whether to modify management of hms
