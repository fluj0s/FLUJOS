the federal library and museum projects that would be reauthorized under hr 13 in reauthorizing these programs the bill would require that the director of the institute establish procedures to prohibit federal funding of pr ojects that have been determined to be obscene by court the bill further requires the director to ensure that applications for financial ssistance be evaluated taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the american public this report examines the legal status of obscenity and the implications of congresss imposing the decency and diversity guidelines as condition to the exercise of its spending powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21509crs2 2 483 us at 207 citing helvering v davis 301 us 619 640641 645 1937 3 483 us at 207obscenity obscenity is not protected speech under the first amendment the united states supreme court held in chaplinsky v new hampshire 315 us 568 1942 that there are certain well defined and narrowly limited cla sses of speech the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to ra ise any constitutional problem these include the lewd and obscene the profane the libelous and the insulting or fighting words those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace this list of speech categories has provided source of free speech issues that have b een litigated extensively since chaplinsky but while some types of speech singled out by chaplinsky have subsequently been found to be protected under the first amendment lewd and prof ane obscene speech remains unprotected in miller v california 413 us 15 1973 the court formulated new definition of obscenity and this definition is expressly included in hr 13 the miller definition requires an affirmative response to each part of threepart test which asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurie nt interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently ffensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value these standards were further refined in pope v illinois 481 us 497 500 1987 when the supreme court held that the first and second prongs of the miller test whether work appeals to the prurient intere st and describes sexual conduct in patently ffensive way are questions of fact to be determined by applying contemporary community standards the third prong serious value is determined under reas onable person standard antiobscenity conditions on grants it is settled law that congress may place conditions on federal funding the constitu tion art i 8 cl 1 provides the congress shall have power to provide fo r the common defense and general welfare of the united states the supreme court has examined the breadth of this power known as the spending clause on several occasions the lead ing modern case is south dakota v dole 483 us 203 1987 in that case the supreme court addressed the spending clause in the context of provi sion that conditioned fe deral highway funding to the states on their adoption of minimu m drinking age the court upheld the condition after applying threepart test first according to the court an exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare giving deference to congress in making the determination as to whether particular expenditure is intended to serve general public purposes2 congress has determined that the activity authorized by hr 13 serves the national interest and it is therefore unlikely that any court will strike down this exercise of the spending power for being outside of the national interest the second part of the test under south dakota v dole is that conditions be clearly stated another factor pparently met under hr 133 the third requirement of the test is that condition relate to the federal interest in particular nationa l projects or programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21509crs3 4 id citing massachusetts v united st ates 435 us 444 461 1978 5 presumably the primary way that the antiobs cenity provision would come into direct play would be an instance in which an alreadyfunded project is cut off after it has been found to be obscene in the context of criminal prosecution 6 hr 13 108th cong 103g2 2003 7 hr 13 108th cong 1033c 2003being conditioned4 hr 13 authorizes appropriations to the institute of museum and library services established in 1996 by public law 104208 and amended by public law 105128 the requirement under the act th at projects found to be obscene be denied funding is related to the federa l interest in this national pr ogram the institute of museum and library services is the federal mechanism for making grants to individuals and state library administrative agencies and the condition imposed specifically relates to what those grants may directly support therefore it is unlikely that court will invalidate this conditioning of federal funds by congress on the basis that such conditions are unrelated to the federal interest in this particular national program the congressional spending power is thus very broad also though conditions on spending may be vulnerable to legal attack if they are exercised in way that raises concern about disfavored viewpoints regan v taxation with representation of washington 461 us 540 1997 the requirement imposed by hr 13 that denial of funding to those projects which are found to be obscene is directed solely against speech that has already been found without first ame ndment protection furthermore the supreme court has characterized spending clau legislation as much in the nature of contract in return for federal funds the recipients agree to comply with federally imposed conditions pennhurst state school and hospital v halderman 451 us 1 17 1981 emphasis added theref ore if grant applicants are awarded grant and agree to accept federal funds they essen tially contract not to use t hose funds to create obscenity5 anyone applying for grants from the institute therefore has rights outside of those given under the act since the contract woul d be governed by the terms of the grant application and the internal agency regulations the act itself provides additional evidence of the limited possibilities grant applicant would have to challenge the obscen ity condition for example the act states that the director shall establish procedures for reviewing and evaluating such applications such procedures shall not be subject to any review outside of the institute6 further disapproval of an pplication under the act is exp licitly disclaimed as finding of obscenity disapproval of an application by the direct or shall not be construed to mean and shall not be considered as evidence that the project for which the applicant requested financial assistan ce is or is not obscene7 decency and diversity guidelines in exercising its spending power congress may prescribe criteria that distinguish among otherwise protected speech in national endowment for the arts v finley 524 us 569 1998 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of federal statute 20 usc 954d1 requiring the nea in awarding

american public the identical language found in hr 13 in upholding the language of the statute the court observed any contentbased considerations that may be taken into account in the grantmaking process are consequence of the nature of arts funding the nea has limited resources the agency may decide to fund particular projects for wide variety of reasons such as the technical proficiency of the artist the creativity of the work the anticipated public interest in or appreciation of the work the works contemporary relevance its educational value its suitability for or appeal to special audiences its service to rural or isolated comm unity or even simply that the work could increase public knowledge of an art form it would be impossible to have highly selective grant program without denying money to large amount of cons titutionally protected expressi on the very assumption of the nea is that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing app licants and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable8 nonetheless the court did acknowledge that if the statute were applied in manner that raises concern about the suppr ession of disfavored viewpoints then such application might be unconstitutional for example the court indicated that it would be impermissible to leverage power to award subsidies on the basis of subjective criteria into penalty on disfavored vi ewpoints or to otherwise use grant program to aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas9 in summary obscenity is not protect ed speech under the first amendment congressional spending powers are very broa d and courts are loathe to invalidate exercises of those powers unless they are cl early outside the public interest conditions on appropriations must be related to the federal interest in particular project or program requiring the institute of museum and librar services to deny or curtail funding to projects that have been determined to be obscene by court of competent jurisdiction appears to meet this relatedness test and be valid exercise of congressional spending power in addition the decency and diversity guidelines that hr 13 would impose have been held not to violate the first amendment as long as they are not applied in manner so as to suppress disfavored viewpoints
