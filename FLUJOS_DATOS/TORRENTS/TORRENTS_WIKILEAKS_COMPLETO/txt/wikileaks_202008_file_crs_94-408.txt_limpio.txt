specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy summary in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress adopted the davisbacon act the measure set certain minimum labor standards for workers employed in federal contract construction notably that contractors must pay their employees not less than the locally prevailing wage the threshold for coverage is currently 2000 and up construction crafts are divided into four components commercial buildings highways residential and heavy construction locality in this case is normally the equivalent of county though other options are possible in addition the copeland antikickback act of 1934 sets reporting requirements intended to aid in davisbacon enforcement and compliance through the years the davisbacon requirements have been applied to dozens of program statutes that involve federal and federally assisted construction davisbacon has been amended over the years to expand its coverage and to strengthen enforcement it has generally enjoyed strong bipartisan support throughout its history but the act has also sparked continuing controversy and opposition especially from nonunion contractors issues of policy concerning the act raised initially in the 1920s and 1930s continue to be debated into the 21st century seventyfive years after its enactment questions remain about its economic impact its scope and pattern of coverage and its administration since the early 1950s the act has been variously the focus of rulemaking litigation and legislative interest and through the past quarter century of all three in 1934 and in 1971 the act was generally but temporarily suspended by presidents roosevelt and nixon from october 1992 until march 1993 it was suspended by president george hw bush but only for locations affected by hurricanes andrew and iniki from september into november 2005 it was suspended by president george w bush for areas affected by hurricane katrina into the early 1990s bills were introduced that would have repealed the davis bacon and copeland acts outright had they been adopted eliminating the prevailing wage and reporting requirements from program statutes into which they have been incorporated in the mid1990s shift in political control in congress seemed to forecast victory for those favoring repeal but ultimately the prevailing wage issue proved to be bipartisan and the statutes davisbacon and copeland remained unchanged prevailing wagedavisbacon provisions have continued to be included in federal program statutes where construction has been program component with the advent of the 21st century the davisbacon debate has continued sporadically but its focus increasingly has been upon the prevailing wage standards of program legislation given the experience of the past seven decades it seems likely that davisbacon will remain an issue of public policy for the immediate future contents

concluding comment 43 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy the davisbacon act was adopted in early 1931 it was amended during the middle 1930s and then quietly became part of federal contract practice during the middle 1950s however it gained more visibility as the davisbacon prevailing wage principle was added to various federal program statutes for more than 4 decades now and continuing into the 21st century davisbacon has been almost constantly focus of public policy concern as legislation through administrative rulemaking and in litigation before the courts1 as amended the davisbacon act of 1931 requires among other things that construction contracts entered into by the federal government specify minimum wages to be paid to the various classes of laborers employed under those contracts2 minimum wages are defined as those determined by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the concept of wage was expanded in 1964 to include fringe benefit component the act has coverage threshold of 2000 in addition to direct federal construction contracts the davisbacon prevailing wage principle has been written into more than 50 federal program statutes the act is supplemented by the 1934 copeland antikickback act which requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid and an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees have been proper and by federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statutes further some states have enacted little davisbacon acts within their respective jurisdictions the rhetoric for and against the act has changed little through the years does the act protect workers help stabilize the construction industry and serve the federal contracting community or is it anticompetitive preventing flexible workforce utilization has it been administered effectively and if not can it be administered in an equitable fashion is there sufficient objective information concerning the act to allow for fair assessment of the statute and its impact this report examines policy issues the act has sparked through the years and which remain part of the davisbacon debate into the 21st century these include such questions as wage rate determination procedures reporting requirements under the copeland act an appropriate threshold for activation of the statute interagency 1 see 40 usc 276a276a5 see also 40 usc 31413148 as recodified 2 alongside the davisbacon act are two other statutes

davisbacon enforcement and compliance activity administrative or judicial appeals procedures the use of helpers and other low skilled workers on covered projects and the right of president to suspend the statute as well as the conditions under which such suspension may occur that the fundamental premise of the act remains in contention after 75 years may be itself part of the public policy debate controversy concerning the davisbacon act historically the act has enjoyed strong bipartisan support but at the same time especially since the middle 1950s it has provoked militant criticism federal agencies have disagreed publicly concerning the usefulness and administration of the act it has been subjected to judicial review and interpretation each new application becoming in turn matter for further examination although the department of labor dol has made certain changes in the acts administration the statute itself has remained largely unchanged since 1935 through the years however congress has extended the acts provisions to cover an ever wider segment of federal and federally assisted construction and at least during the past several decades such extensions of coverage have provided an opportunity for renewed debate concerning the act and its impact on the one hand critics of the act argue even were the statute justified in 1931 that it has now been rendered obsolete through market changes and enactment of other federal labor standards laws notably the fair labor standards act of 1938 further they argue that the act is inflationary adding to the cost of public construction and thereby potentially reducing the volume of construction and the number of federal construction jobs finally they suggest that it is anticompetitive discriminates against smaller firms and is difficult to administer repeal or significant modification of the act they note would reduce the paperwork burden of doing business with the federal government and would allow contractors more flexibility in manpower utilization on the other hand the acts defenders hold that davisbacon is as important now as it was in the 1930s it prevents they assert competition from flybynight firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors for federal work it helps stabilize the industry an advantage they suggest to workers and to employers in addition davisbacon may assure the consuming agency of better craftsmanship if when firms are required to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage they tend to employ more highly skilled workers and supporters of the act add it may reduce both the initial cost of federal construction through greater efficiency and decrease the need for repair andor rehabilitation at the same time they point out it deters contractors from fragmenting work and utilizing low crs3 skilllowwage pickup crews and helpers and promotes skill transfer through formal apprenticeship programs the davisbacon literature the davisbacon literature is extensive and diverse generally it falls into three categories public materials ie legislative hearings agency reports and analyses journalistic pieces and academic studies of the latter some are products that have been commissioned by interest groups though they may be scholarly nonetheless others are putatively independent academic work in some cases there has been merger of scholarship with journalism through the years since the prevailing wage legislation was first considered at the federal level there have been numerous congressional hearings that have reviewed the statute however these seem often to have focused broadly upon policy concerns rather than upon specific economic impact and its assessment as the davisbacon debate has evolved arguments have progressed through several levels of affirmation and rebuttal most of which pro and are subject to further oftrepeated counter arguments at large there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act its administration and impact few studies of the statute whether public or private have escaped criticism on the grounds of flawed methodology or inadequate sample size origins of the davisbacon act prevailing wage protection under public contracts seems to have commenced at the state level and later to have been adopted by the federal government3 preliminary initiatives 19271930 congressional interest in federal prevailing wage legislation predates both the new deal and the economic collapse of 1929 indeed it emerged during time of relative prosperity in the construction industry the building industry observed william tracy of the building trades department afl was enjoying the greatest prosperity in its history with wages and hours of labor and improved working conditions better than ever before4 but it appears also to have been period of turbulence and intense competition within the contracting community5 3 david b johnson prevailing wage legislation in the states monthly labor review august 11961 pp 839845 4 william j tracy the building trades american federationist january 1927 p 39 the american federation of labor afl joined with the congress of industrial organizations cio in 1955 to form the aflcio the cio was organized only in the middle 1930s 5 see for example lloyd smith to eliminate irresponsible bidders the constructor continued crs4 during hearings before the house committee on labor in february 1927 representative robert l bacon rny echoed tracys views in new york he noted wages are fair and there has been difficulty in the building trades between employee and employer for some time bacon wanted to keep it that way in 1927 he introduced legislation to require that locally prevailing wage standards be met in federal construction work problems however had emerged with respect to construction of federal hospital in bacons new york district local contractors he explained had submitted bids on the project that reflected local standards but the contract was awarded to an alabama firm the latter bacon noted brought some thousand nonunion laborers from alabama into long island ny they were herded onto this job they were housed in shacks they were paid very low wage and the work proceeded in bacons view the least government could do when contracting was to comply with the local standards of wages and labor prevailing in the locality where the building construction is to take place his measure did not seek to inflate wages artificially but rather to assure that government respected the existing local standard6 the bill was not adopted similar legislation was introduced in 1928 and this time bacon won strong support from the us department of labor dol in note to labor secretary james j davis commissioner of labor statistics ethelbert stewart pointed out the essence of the thing as i see it is is the government willing for the sake of the lowest bidder to break down all labor standards and have its work done by the cheapest labor that can be secured and shipped from state to state7 steward expressed his full support for the bacon bill as did davis indeed to this point the hearings had brought forth body of testimony generally supportive of the prevailing wage concept if not always of the specific provisions of the several differing proposals but once again the proposal died when congress adjourned an enactment emerges 1931 late in 1930 after nearly decade as secretary of labor through the administrations of warren harding calvin coolidge and herbert hoover davis

that current contracting practices were not only disturbing to labor but disturbing to the business community as well8 when the legislation was taken up in the senate senator robert lafollette progressive republicanwisc chairman of the committee on manufactures urged that the measure be speedily enacted9 the report submitted for the committee by senator davis stated that the measure does not require the government to establish any new wage scales in any portion of the country instead the report pointed out it merely gives the government the power to require its contractors to pay their employees the prevailing wage scales in the vicinity of the building projects this is only fair and just it noted to the employees the contractors and the government alike10 similar report was filed by representative richard j welch rcalif for the house committee on labor11 neither report recorded dissent but when the measure was considered in the house reservations were voiced representative thomas l blanton dtexas noted that the measure was the most ridiculous proposition i have ever seen brought before legislative body observing that the bill imposed wage floor that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid blanton objected that workers and contractors ought to be free to bargain for as high or low wage as they might choose you are taking away from american citizens contractors and laborers alike the sacred inherent right of contract the right to make their own contracts for themselves the texan observed we are thus proposing by this pernicious bill to interfere with sacred inalienable right that has given initiative and independence to men for ages past12 in addition representative blanton placed in the record letter from comptroller general j r mccarl who raised questions of different sort since the specific determination of prevailing wage rates was to be made after bids had been submitted mccarl argued that none of the parties to the

progress of the work13 p greensfelder president of the associated general contractors of america seemed to concur in mccarls judgment he emphasized the uncertainty that would result though agreeing in principle that contractors should pay not less than the locally prevailing wage rate14 at the same time representative anning prall dny suggested that the enforcement provisions of the legislation were insufficiently strong but he supported the bill and observed if we find unscrupulous contractors attempting to beat the law we can quickly amend it by putting teeth in it15 in the end the act was adopted without roll call and on march 3 1931 signed into law by president hoover16 modifying the davisbacon act 19311961 dissatisfaction with the act was soon rife both with labor and contractors the initial enactment had been brief and relatively simple statement of policy armand thieblot who has written extensively about the act suggests that it lacked effective mechanisms for either policing or enforcing its requirements and that provisions were made for informing laborers of the protections afforded them under the new statute17 trade unionists were concerned that the scope of the act might leave too many workers unprotected the threshold had initially been set at 5000 sparking labors fear that contracts might be fragmented in order to escape the acts requirements matter of special concern for the painting and decorating crafts the afls executive council noted that the davisbacon act will prove great benefit so far as it goes adding that amendments to further benefit the building trades will be submitted at future sessions of congress18 among industry objections perhaps the most critical was the fact that wage rate determinations were made after bids were submitted thieblot joining in the early reservations of comptroller general mccarl noted above explains postdetermination of wages meant that contractor could be forced to pay wages which upon determination by the secretary of labor were higher than the rate on 13 congressional record february 28 1931 p 6505 14 ibid p 6508 rep blanton placed mr greensfelders comments in the record 15 ibid p 6520 16

emphasis added crs7 which his bid was based19 in effect contractors and perhaps especially those from outside of the area of work were bidding blindly agreeing to pay whatever wage rate the secretary might determine to be prevailing in the locality and in the beginning it may not have been entirely clear what was meant by prevailing and certain other terms used in the act the executive order of 1932 changes in the act were quickly proposed in january 1932 the house committee on labor commenced oversight hearings almost immediately however president hoover responded with an executive order tightening the acts administration20 president hoover acts administratively behindthescenes negotiations concerning amendment of the act appear to have been intense at first organized labor seems to have urged members of congress to add strengthened penalty structure to the statute oversight hearings commenced in the house early in january 1932 but sooner had they gotten underway than president hoover issued executive order 5778 dated january 19 1932 but made public two days later representative william connery dmass in an analysis not immediately challenged recalled that representatives of the building trades after conference with secretary doak made deal with the secretary whereby if the president would issue an executive order on the davisbacon bill they would be against any further legislation on the matter by the committee on labor21 president hoovers executive order provided that all davisbacon contracts contain the following stipulations that wages be paid in full not less than once week in lawful money of the united states and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account that every person while performing work of laborer or mechanic on the public work covered by this contract is to be regarded as employed as laborer or mechanic by the contractor or subcontractor regardless of any contractual relationship alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and such laborer or mechanic that payroll records are to be open to inspection by the contracting officer at such times as the latter may elect provided that such inspection shall not interfere with the proper and orderly prosecution of the work and that the rates payable under the contract shall be posted by the contractor in prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work where workers can view them 19 thieblot the davis bacon act p 11 20 proclamations and executive orders herbert hoover march 4 1929 to march 4 1933 washington gpo 1974 vol ii pp 10661067 21

terminate the contract and may take over the work and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise and that the contractor and his sureties shall be liable to the government for any excess cost occasioned the government thereby22 appearing in the midst of congressional oversight hearings on the act executive order 5778 seems to have caused the several parties to pause and regroup that the order had been issued unilaterally by the president and could be withdrawn or altered at subsequent presidential discretion have caused some uneasiness and perhaps contributed to movement for codification by statute reaction to the order feelings were mixed with respect to the executive order labor which seems to have feared that review of the statute would have endangered whatever benefits we have secured through the present legislation tended to view the hoover initiative with approval representative bacon noted that the order simply carries out in the government contract form what congress intended by the law secretary doak observed that the act had worked out much more satisfactorily than many of us believed possible when the legislation was enacted predicting that the order would prove most helpful in further stabilizing the wage rates and conditions in the construction of federal buildings and adding that there was necessity of further legislation at the present time23 industry was less pleased arguing that wage rates should be made known prior to the submission of bids legislation to achieve industrys objectives introduced by senator jesse metcalf rri provided for predetermination of wage rates allowed for reopening of contracts which covered extended periods established an antikickback provision and set forth procedures for enforcement and the imposition of penalties for violators following hearings24 the measure was adopted by the senate with minimum discussion and on voice vote25 by the time the metcalf bill was called up in the house june 1932 opinion had been solidly formed labor opposed it industry urged its passage it was significantly modified on the floor in part to make it more nearly acceptable to labor but it remained

of controversy through the next six decades for example what constitutes prevailing wage how is prevailing wage to be determined and when should there be regional variations in standards would wages under davisbacon be comparable for private and public construction what constitutes an appropriate locality for purposes of wage determinations how should problems of abuse under the act notably kickbacks be dealt with should the protections of the act extend to production of prefabricated materials to be used in construction was the act only of advantage to employed construction workers class that might not be in need of federal protection does the act restrict employment opportunities in construction these questions were not to be resolved in the near term as amended the measure passed the house and after conference was approved by the senate27 on july 1 1932 however president hoover vetoed the proposed amendments to the davisbacon act further action was taken by the 72nd congress while the president did not explain his views he attached to his veto message memorandum from secretary doak which branded the legislation as obscure and complex and noted that it would be impracticable of administration and would stretch new bureaucracy across the country28 congressional action 19341935 hearings continued on federal construction wage policy through the next several years these provided the basis for adoption of the copeland antikickback act 1934 and for major amendments to the davisbacon act in 1935 the copeland antikickback act 1934 while davisbacon required payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage on federal contract construction it remained to be enforced some employers paying the requisite wages it was alleged would then institute deductions andor kickbacks thus recovering portions of those wages senator royal copeland dny whose subcommittee on crime had been exploring this abuse reported that perhaps as much as 25 percent of the money which is supposed to be paid for labor under the prevailing rates of wage is unlawfully unjustly and indecently returned to contractors subcontractors or officials on the job senator davis

debate on june 13 1934 president roosevelt signed the measure31 the copeland antikickback act which supplements davisbacon orders fine of not more that 5000 or imprisonment of not more than five years or both for anyone who induces any person engaged in federal or federally financed construction to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his contract of employment by force intimidation threat of procuring dismissal from such employment or by any other manner whatsoever the act authorized the administering agencies to make reasonable regulations for its enforcement but specifically required that each contractor and subcontractor shall furnish weekly sworn affidavit with respect to the wages paid each employee during the preceding week32 see discussion later in this report of proposals by the reagan administration to modify the reporting requirements of the copeland act the davisbacon amendments 1935 during general review of federal contracting policy senator david walsh dmass had conducted oversight of the davisbacon act33 he found that the statute was inadequate to cope with many of the practices to which contractors have resorted finding concurred in by the various departments involved with the davisbacon act34 by the spring of 1935 senator walsh had ready significant amendments to the act in addition to antikickback proposals which had been dealt with separately walsh now proposed the following first the dollar volume threshold for coverage under the act should be reduced from 5000 as in the original law to 2000 second coverage should be extended to all federal contract construction of whatever character to which the united states and the district of columbia may be party construction alteration andor repair including

wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics thus there would be predetermination of the davisbacon wage rate ie prior to the submission of bids by contractor although certain of the provisions might have seemed controversial the walsh amendments were agreed to in the senate without discussion36 in the house they were reported favorably without change the committee on labor noted that the bill is merely logical development of policy consistently expressed by congress for the past four years with respect to minimum wages on public construction37 in the house the bill was called up and again passed without discussion38 week later the measure was signed by the president39 period of relative quiet 19351952 for 2 decades after 1935 the davisbacon act seems to have become quietly standard part of federal contract policy the history of the act during this period however remains largely to be explored changing realities new perspectives underlying the davisbacon act was the concept that the united states as consumer has the right to require certain standards by contract when doing business if contractor chose to engage in federal construction work then he had to abide by the stated specifications including labor standards in 1936 this principle was extended to the contract purchase of goods with enactment of the walshhealey public contracts act the principle was further extended in 1965 with adoption of the mcnamaraohara service contract act the final segment of federal contract labor standards law in 1938 congress established general minimum wage and overtime pay structure for the private sector with adoption of the fair labor standards act flsa40 enactment of this broad wagehour legislation may have lessened interest in the davisbacon and walshhealey acts indeed some later have suggested that 36 congressional record july 30 1935 pp 1207312074 37 us congress house committee on labor amend the act approved march 3 1931 relating to rate

world war ii federal contracting entered new era in the early 1940s government procurement agencies and the international unions entered into series of agreements that provided for stabilization of wages and conditions at time when we were at the critical tooling up stage of the war effort the machinery established by those agreements president harry truman later recalled served us well during the war and he pointed with pride to the splendid record of cooperation with the davisbacon division of the department of labor but by 1947 most wartime controls were gone43 establishing administrative order throughout the evolution of the davisbacon act there has been lingering issue of where ultimate responsibility for its administration resided did authority rest with dol with the contracting agencies or perhaps with the general accounting office gao as part of program of postnew dealpostworld war ii administrative reforms president truman sought to establish enhanced order cooperation and efficiency44 in 1947 mr truman noted that administration of the davisbacon and copeland acts had been divided between dol and the contracting agencies as result he observed enforcement has been very uneven and workers have not had the protection to which they were entitled therefore he developed reorganization plan 2 which consolidated certain labor standards activities under the secretary of labor the reorganization plan authorized the secretary of labor to coordinate the administration of the acts for the regulation of wages and hours on federal public works by establishing such standards regulations and procedures as will make enforcement more effective45 41 us general accounting office the davisbacon act should be repealed hdr7918 april 27 1979 pp 1934 not infrequently

years later march 1950 president truman issued reorganization plan 14 in which he took note of the confusion caused by interagency involvement in enforcement of the several laws regulating wages and hours of workers employed on federal contracts for public works or construction he pointed specifically to the davisbacon and copeland acts together with certain federal overtime pay laws and to the labor standards provisions that had been added to program statutes involving construction financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from the federal government or by mortgages guaranteed by the federal government mr truman noted that the methods adopted by the various agencies for the enforcement of labor standards vary widely in character and effectiveness as result uniformity of enforcement is lacking and the degree of protection afforded workers varies from agency to agency to give order to this patchwork the president authorized the secretary of labor to coordinate the administration of legislation relating to wages and hours on federally financed or assisted projects46 emphasis added change and priorities in presenting the plan to the congress the president acknowledged since the principle objective of the plan is more effective enforcement of labor standards it is not probable that it will result in savings but he added it will provide more uniform and more adequate protection for workers through the expenditures made for the enforcement of the existing legislation47 coverage issues however raised during the truman era reorganization on the one hand direct construction by the federal government and on the other construction financed through grants and loans have continued to be point of controversy into the 21st century similarly legislative proposals continue to explore the primacy of the secretary of labor with respect to the administration of the davis bacon act these issues remain unresolved the eisenhower era pivotal period prevailing wage requirements the davisbacon principle had been added to number of program statutes by the close of the truman era moving from davis bacon coverage for direct federal construction to projects financed entirely or in part with federal funds during the eisenhower administration such extensions of prevailing wage coverage became more frequent48 some issues of policy the davisbacon debates of the middle 1950s reiterated many of the earlier arguments for and against the act and added few new concerns but the debates appear to have resolved little 46 special message to the

dissent from prevailing congressional policy several senators argued that adding davisbacon provision to program legislation would expand the federal bureaucracy create paperwork and litigation increase the control of the federal agencies and pose definitional problems with respect to classification locality and prevailing rates all issues that would reemerge during the reaganbush era49 similarly in 1958 senator strom thurmond then dsc contended that dol had failed to administer the act properly suggested that davisbacon wage standards were being imported from urban to rural areas thus raising rural wage rates and decried the usurpation by washington of the rights of the states50 the south carolinian raised arguments that for the most part would be the subject both of debate and litigation for many decades thereafter speaking from somewhat different philosophical perspective senator clifford case rnj stated that the davisbacon act protects fairminded and responsible contractors against unfair competition from contractors who base their bids on wage levels lower than those actually prevailing in the area but he also toke note of the protections that the act affords workers his views were concurred in by senator jacob javits rny who seemingly harkening back to the concerns of the 1930s warned that we must guard against the breaking down of the wage pattern in particular area51 whatever the diversity of opinion may have been during the 1950s with respect to the prevailing wage statute and however vigorous opposition to the act may have been congress continued to preserve the act and to extend davisbacon coverage through the provisions in various federal program statutes changing perspective on the davisbacon act from quick review of legislative activity during the eisenhower era one might reach several tentative preliminary observations first attaching davisbacon provisions to program statutes seems to have been more controversial and to have sparked more heated debate than had passage of the davisbacon act per second as late as the mid1950s many republicans in congress continued to claim credit for the statute for example representative russell mack rwash affirmed the two authors of the davisbacon law were senator davis republican of pennsylvania and representative bacon very conservative republican congressman from the state of new york republican house and republican senate passed the davisbacon law and republican president herbert hoover signed it 49 us congress senate federalaid highway act

about today is 25yearold republican law52 the claim of representative mack notwithstanding davisbacon was not regarded as partisan enactment the debate both in committee and on the floor involved democrats and republicans on each side of the issue third at least some members supported the act in terms of the benefits that it held for contractors the act recalled representative thor tollefson rwash has been valuable as remedial measure to protect contractors and craftsmen from unfair contract bids he added that davisbacon provision was necessary to eliminate existing unfair bidding advantages of contractors who pay low wages in areas where union rates prevail the tacoma republican affirmed that the davis bacon act had assured all contractors equality of bidding opportunity it protects contractors against unfair competition and restricts the area of competition to economy and efficiency53 fourth the issue of the cost impact of davisbacon sparked divided opinion in 1956 report on highway legislation five members dissented voicing complaints about the act based upon economy how about the increased cost of highways if the davisbacon provision were added it is variously estimated at 2 to 4 billion which means less highway for the money expended the unfortunate part is that the administrative and bureaucratic redtape which federal wage fixing entails causes waste from which one benefits and for which the taxpayer must bear the burden54 source was provided for the projected cost estimate and conversely representative mack of washington declared that the act simply keeps wages at the prevailing rate the act he argued does not raise wages but it does prevent wage cutting and it is wage cutting and labor standard lowering that we wish to prevent55 mr mack stated that the washington state highway commission had endorsed the davisbacon provision promptly gardner withrow rwisc declared his complete agreement with mack that davisbacon would not make the cost of highway construction any greater than it is now representative withrow affirmed that the responsible road people in the state of wisconsin declare that the cost under the davisbacon act as it is at the present time would not be any more than it is now so he concluded 52 congressional record april 27 1956 pp 71877188 53 congressional record february 6 1956 pp 20982099 54 us congress house

increase the cost of building roads is entirely ghost and phantom and is not substantiated by the facts56 similarly division of opinion had developed in the senate the initial highway legislation 1955 had been silent on the matter of davisbacon coverage organized labor during hearings had urged that prevailing wage coverage be specifically provided57 and when the legislation was reported davisbacon provision had been added senators edward martin rpa prescott bush r conn and norris cotton rnh dissented from the report of the committee on public works arguing that this extension of davisbacon requirements would expand the federal bureaucracy create paperwork and litigation increase the control of the federal agencies and pose definitional problems with respect to classification locality and prevailing rate58 on the floor debate was extensive and at the initiative of senator dennis chavez dnm the prevailing wage language was dropped59 subsequently restored by the house the provision was retained in conference and became law 195660 fifth the eisenhower era may have been transitional era where davisbacon was concerned some members seemed bewildered that the act should be controversial representative katharine st george rny for example queried whether it is not fact that the davisbacon provision has been in the law for many years and we have never heard any objecting to it until now similarly representative frank smith dmiss noted that all of our committee has voted many times for bills which include davisbacon61 davisbacon during the 1960s early in the 1960s major federal construction programs commenced in defense and space and federal contract labor standards requirements took on new importance there was also perception whether or not justified that the federal construction program was beset with labormanagement problems some argued that vital projects were being delayed by clashes between rival unions with jurisdictional disputes erupting into strikes or walkouts and it was argued that such labor troubles were adding unnecessarily to the cost of public construction there were allegations 56 congressional record april 27 1956 p 7191 57 us

firms which in turn affected the applicability of federal contract labor standards laws industry classification and labor standards since the wage requirements under davisbacon were generally higher than those under walshhealey an employer might have preferred to classify as much of the work as possible as manufacturing rather than as construction per and thereby to reduce his labor costs with defense and aerospace construction the work was more than simply bricks and mortar were worker to install technical electronic equipment for example was the work part of the process of manufacturing and covered by the walshhealey act or was it construction and subject to the somewhat higher wage requirements of the davisbacon act the issue was further complicated by prefabrication of components for general construction was batch plant some distance from construction site still part of the site of work for davisbacon purposes these issues were not to be easily resolved complicating matters further congress adopted the mcnamaraohara service contract act in 1965 mandating labor standards for service workers but standards different from those in either davisbacon or walshhealey thus technical installation might be construction or manufacturing or it could be service operation62 in this way both employers and employees could suddenly find themselves on unfamiliar regulatory ground there were also collective bargaining agreements to consider how work was defined as to craft or skill might determine which union had jurisdiction the roosevelt subcommittee in 1962 special subcommittee on labor chaired by representative james roosevelt dcalif was created which would provide the first fullscale hearing on the act in nearly 30 years roosevelt promptly led the subcommittee into the field for tour of defense and space installations in order to gain firsthand knowledge of the administration of the davisbacon act then formal hearings commenced the agenda was threefold 1 how the secretary of labor makes his determinations as to prevailing wages and what criteria he uses in making these determinations 2 whether some type of review should be provided for prevailing wage rate determinations made by the secretary of labor and 3 any other constructive proposals as to how the act may be improved or made more explicit63 62 see for example the discussion in john r van water applications of labor law to construction and equipping of united states missile bases labor law journal november 1961 pp 10031024 legislation that would become the service contract act had been

june continued crs18 although chairman roosevelt tried to maintain the stated focus wide range of complaints and suggestions were brought before the subcommittee which met intermittently through three years in large measure they laid the foundation for most subsequent davisbacon hearings setting forth 30year agenda creation of the wage appeals board when an interested party was aggrieved by dol decision related to davisbacon there was little that could be done other than to approach the department ask that it reconsider its findings and hope for the best creation of formal review procedure had been suggested at least as far back as the middle 1950s but nothing had been set in place labor secretary arthur goldberg appeared before the roosevelt subcommittee on june 7 1962 and pointed to an important innovation that we have under consideration right now but which had been deferred pending these hearings so as to get the benefit of the viewpoints expressed here the proposal was for the creation of some internal review machinery within our own structure to review some of the determinations that are challenged64 it quickly became apparent that creation of review mechanism would be controversial various proposals each with constituency of its own were presented some thought review by panel within dol would be adequate others argued that such system would never be wholly free from the hand of the secretary whose staffs decisions were being reviewed judicial review was urged but it was argued that it would be unworkable that it would be cumbersome and costly and that decisions would not be timely an inconvenience to all involved and possibly causing delay of vital federal projects review by gao was yet another option but that in itself became matter of controversy since the comptroller general and dol seem frequently to have been at odds over davisbacon administration if there were to be an inhouse board various practical administrative questions would need to be dealt with for example who would appoint its members where would it be housed what would be its relationship to the secretary to the administrator of the wage and hour division within dol and to the office of the solicitor within dol if internal administrative appeal and review did not resolve matter in dispute would there be further options as hearings continued through 1962 and 1963 legislated review procedure had been finalized then on january 3 1964 labor secretary willard wirtz dissenting from certain of the pending proposals created administratively wage appeals board wab which he noted would be directly responsible to the secretary of labor the three member board was appointed by the secretary of labor with one of the members to be designated chairman the secretarys order affirmed that the board shall act as the authorized representative of the secretary of labor in deciding appeals concerning questions of 63 continued 68 11 and 12 1962 washington gpo 1962 p 1

issued under the davisbacon act and its related minimum wage statutes on questions of law the order decreed the wab would act on the advice of the solicitor at dol who would also represent the department at each proceeding65 six months later when labor solicitor charles donahue appeared before the subcommittee june 23 1964 he assured the members that dols review process was in place and functioning66 some viewed the secretarys action as preemptive strike since legislation to create review procedure had been under active consideration by the subcommittee through several years representative roman pucinski dill noted i think that the department just saw the handwriting on the wall67 ultimately when the 1964 davisbacon amendments were enacted congress did not include language dealing with review procedure the arrangement initiated by the secretary remaining in place68 the fringe benefits amendment 1964 stability and fairness within the construction market had been primary considerations of the davisbacon act in 1931 it was alleged that in the absence of prevailing wage requirement contractors would bid for public work on the basis of low wages and adverse working conditions that were inconsistent with those prevailing locally in 1964 upon that same assumption congress extended the definition of prevailing wage to include fringe benefits69 members supporting fringe benefit component argued that contractors working under collective bargaining agreement can normally be expected to provide unit members with fringe benefits health insurance paid vacation time etc nonunion firms may offer similar benefits but they are under contractual obligation to do so thus some reasoned nonunion contractors who offer few or fringe benefits to their employees might be able unfairly to underbid union or other nonunion employers who offer portion of their total compensation package in the form of such benefits 65 federal register january 4 1964 pp

congressional quarterly inc 1965 pp 576577 69 william naumann of tucson speaking for the associated general contractors observed that inclusion of fringe benefits within the concept of wage actually

benefits were as matter of fact prevailing that everybody came on the same basis committee on education and labor amendments to the davisbacon act p 144 crs20 critics suggested that addition of fringe benefit component would increase the cost of public construction they argued that it would be difficult to calculate the value of fringe benefit packages that often varied greatly from one firm or employment situation to another finally some asserted that even were fringe benefit component justified it ought not to be considered as freestanding issue but rather as part of general davisbacon reform when the roosevelt subcommittee reported legislation adding fringe benefit component to davisbacon wage calculations it seems to have generated little controversy the provision was supported by

davisbacon act 1971 the original davisbacon act of 1931 contained provision which in the event of national emergency authorized the president to suspend the statute but the authors of the davisbacon act had legislated in broad terms the concept of national emergency was not defined nor was it clear how long suspension might last before considering the nixon suspension of the davisbacon act in 1971 it may be useful to review briefly franklin roosevelts suspension of the act in 1934 the roosevelt precedent 1934 on june 5 1934 president roosevelt acting upon the advice of the secretary of labor and the administrator of public works suspended davisbacon as matter of administrative convenience to allow various new deal statutes to function more smoothly71 he made attempt to define national emergency other than noting that concurrent operation of the two laws the davisbacon act and the national industrial recovery act caused administrative confusion and delay which could be avoided were davisbacon suspended what transpired thereafter is not immediately clear but on june 30 1934 just three weeks later president roosevelt issued another proclamation he stated that revocation of the june 5 proclamation would be in the public interest and reinstated davisbacon72 the president does not appear to have offered any further public explanation for his actions73 70

president richard nixon among other inflationrelated concerns expressed an intense interest in the wageprice structure in the construction industry on january 18 1971 he conferred with the tripartite construction industry collective bargaining commission74 chaired by labor economist john dunlop and urged that body to do something about curbing the wageprice spiral in construction various options were discussed labor secretary james hodgson reported including suspension of davisbacon seeming to prefer private sector solution mr nixon set 30day period during which the commission should deal with the concerns he had raised75 negotiations followed76 despite meetings between aflcio president george meany spokespersons for the building and construction trades department bctd aflcio omb director george shultz secretary hodgson dunlop and others concrete solution was found lifting the davisbacon requirements on february 23 1971 mr nixon suspended davisbacon77 he noted that the nation is now confronted by set of conditions involving the construction industry which taken together create an emergency situation he noted that collective bargaining settlements are excessive and show signs of decelerating he pointed to unemployment to more frequent and longer work stoppages to wageprice spiral in the construction industry and to their impact upon the general economy therefore he suspended the act and with it any executive order proclamation rule regulation or other directive providing for the payment of wages which provisions are dependent upon determinations by the secretary of labor under the davisbacon act78 while president nixon admitted that his action was directed at organized labor he also stated that wage rates on federal projects have been artificially set by this law rather than by customary market forces he affirmed his belief that this preferential arrangement does not serve the best interests of either the construction industry or the american public at time when wages are under severe upward pressures 73 continued to be regarded as tentative 74 john herlings labor letter january 16 1971 p 1 the commission was created by president nixon under

the president set aside the davisbacon provisions that had been written into the various program statutes then more than 50 of them and declared further i am calling upon states and other governmental bodies with similar statutes to take similar action79 some questions and reactions the suspension appears to have been less an attack upon the act per than an effort to encourage labor and management but primarily labor to adopt what the president believed was more responsible wageprice policy he observed it is evident now that decisive government action is needed to protect the public interest while labor and management continue their efforts to attack the causes of this problem80 many questions arose were inflationary wage settlements in the construction industry of which federal construction was only part what congress had in mind in crafting the acts national emergency provision did the president have authority under that provision to set aside not only davisbacon but also the prevailing wage provisions of the federal program statutes enacted by the congress through several decades and could the president preempt the various little davis bacon acts of the states we believe hodgson noted that the suspension should help produce more reasonable settlements throughout the industry and restore better balance to the bargaining process while he defined neither reasonable nor better balance his intent seemed clear if the unions would moderate their demands and accept less costly wage settlements then balance could be restored and with it perhaps davis bacon meany branded the suspension as punitive against workers and an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to exploit workers81 and labor analyst john herling wrote that suspension had brought cheer to the us chamber of commerce which for decades has battled to remove davisbacon from the statute books82 some of the state prevailing wage laws predated enactment of the federal statute how would the suspension affect the practices of the several states peter g nash thenus solicitor of labor declared the weight of authority supports the conclusion that states are now preempted in effect negative

the suspension mr nixon in executive order 11588 declared that the suspension was longer necessary due to the establishment of an equitable stabilization plan having created the construction industry stabilization committee tripartite body appointed by the secretary of labor and directed by john dunlop part of larger regulatory wageprice apparatus for the construction industry he now restored the davisbacon act together with the various supplemental regulations governing its implementation and enforcement86 the carter era new conflicts concerning the davisbacon act davisbacon had been moreorless continuously focus of attention for the policy community since the middle 1950s during and shortly after the carter administration however the act passed through period of somewhat higher visibility with arguments pro and voiced with unusual vigor the basis of this period of tension extends back to the original debates over the prevailing wage legislation gao enters the fray the bills that evolved into the davisbacon act of 1931 were crafted in part in response to rulings from then comptroller general j r mccarl of the general accounting office gao to the effect that the federal government when contracting for construction work was forced to accept the lowest responsible bid the concept of responsibility during the period generally related to fiduciary matters and the ability of the bidder to produce the work for which contract was let wages and working conditions were not factors to be considered given this interpretation as labor secretary doak explained the only course we had was to resort to legislation87 84 john herlings labor letter march 6 1971 p 1 85 in john herlings labor letter april 3 1971 pp 23 herling suggests that the administration quickly came to

with management of certain aspects of federal expenditures 40 usc 276a2 in addition it has functions related more broadly to oversight of federal spending thus beyond historical circumstance the agency has reason to be interested in the act oversight testimony 1962 on june 12 1962 j welch gao deputy general counsel appeared before the roosevelt subcommittee which was then conducting oversight hearings on the davisbacon act welch affirmed that since 1935 we gao have examined or passed upon practically every davisbacon act case in which irregularities have been reported he stated that gaos experience indicates that the methods and procedures adopted by dol for administration of the act have not kept pace with the requirements of the period but he assured the panel that gao was neutral on whether the davisbacon act should be either continued or repealed89 lengthy exchange attempted to clarify the relationship between gao and dol where davisbacon was concerned though precise conclusion seems to have been reached it quickly became clear that the two agencies were not operating in complete harmony welch pointed to an ongoing series of negotiations between the comptroller the solicitor at dol and their aides which had seemed more nearly to define areas of disagreement than to resolve conflicts we feel welch concluded that if the department of labor is to be given final responsibility with respect to davisbacon that should be accomplished by appropriate amendment to the act90 both gao and the subcommittee appear to have set the issue aside at this point however gao added as supplement to its oral testimony extended documentation questioning dols administration of the act91 gao urges repeal of davisbacon 1979 beginning in the early 1960s92 gao issued series of

based was questioned by some supporters of the act some wondered whether it was appropriate for the general accounting office to challenge in so direct manner policy which congress had reaffirmed through nearly half century94 nonetheless this latter study together with the several earlier reports provided rich resource for critics of the statute to draw upon95 in urging congress to reverse its support for davisbacon gao set out series of arguments first significant changes in economic conditions and the economic character of the construction industry since 1931 plus the passage of other wage laws make the act unnecessary second after nearly 50 years dol has not developed an effective program to issue and maintain current and accurate wage determinations it may be impractical to ever do so third the act results in unnecessary construction and administrative costs of several hundred million dollars annually if the construction projects reviewed by gao are representative and has an inflationary effect on the areas covered by inaccurate wage rates and the economy as whole96 although the 1979 gao report was influential judging from the frequency with which it has been cited it did not win universal acclaim during hearings in june 1979 several members of congress puzzled over gaos activist stance representative frank thompson dnj for example asked comptroller general elmer

congress passed the mcnamaraohara service contract act sca in 1965 it extended labor standards requirements to federal service contracts amendments to the sca were adopted in 1972 and 1976 in each instance over contractor objections the jurisdictional issue thus became threeway contest102 bureaucratic controversy the three statutes similar and complimentary but not identical have different regulatory and economic impacts thus which of the statutes applied to particular project was of some considerable interest to employers to workers to the federal agencies as consumers of construction and goods and services and to the taxpayer in 1974 the office of management and budget omb formed an interagency task force to review implementation of mcnamaraohara but when the review was complete dol refused to concur in its findings and stalemate resulted again in january 1977 during the transition from the ford to carter administrations omb acted unilaterally mandating administrative change

developed between ofpp and dol the ofpp administrator advised the department of defense dod that contracts for overhaul and rebuilding of certain aircraft engines would fall under walshhealey effectively the federal minimum wage rather than the locally prevailing rate under mcnamaraohara104 at once the house subcommittee on labormanagement relations commenced hearings on the issue august 1978105 and at the request of several key members of congress ofpp stepped back the matter being referred to attorney general griffin bell for legal decision concerning the ofpps authority in march 1979 bell found in behalf of dol whether particular class of contracts is covered by walshhealey or the sca bell affirmed is up to the secretary of labor but he reminded president carter that the secretary was subject of course to your supervision and direction as chief executive106 another interagency dispute developed in june 1979 when dol notified the general services administration gsa that automatic data processing contracts in which services were provided would be subject to sca dod objected that meeting sca prevailing wage standards would raise wages and disturb the salary structure in the industry spokesmen for industry agreed the contractor and the contracting agency found themselves in conflict with dol at this juncture gao issued report arguing that mcnamaraohara should not be applied to service employees of data processing and hightechnology firms107 industry taking firmer stance threatened not to enter into federal automatic data processing contracts at all

task force seems to have been overtaken by events the independent but somewhat parallel oversight by the house subcommittee on labormanagement relations summer 1978 and the determination rendered by attorney general bell spring 1979 each discussed above in addition there were changes in staff within the several agencies which seems to have contributed to shift both of focus and of priorities110

rejected dol agreed to ascertain what could be made available to the committee on labor and human resources112 if the task force report with the related documents was made available to the senate it

secretary raymond donovan affirmed that the final rule should be very well received by contractor groups he also acknowledged that labor may react unfavorably119 secretary donovan was right on both counts organized labor charged that the new regulations were back door attempt to nullify the law the aflcios executive council added that the regulations are laundry list of virtually every proposal offered over the years by contractor associations120 in contrast the chamber of commerces washington report termed the regulations major improvement noting that the business community including construction trade associations has been working for years to abolish or amend the davisbacon law and the regulations that implement it the associated builders 114 dlr june 5 1980 pp a6a7 and e1e6 and

projects121 the regulations issued on may 28 1982 may be viewed as distillation of policy questions remaining from the initial discussion of the act in the 1920s and 1930s and reviewed variously since that time they dealt primarily with five areas first under the prereagan system wage rate paid to 30 of the workers in craft in locality absent more broadlybased rate could be termed prevailing for davisbacon purposes the 30 percent rule was now to be replaced by 50 percent rule second it had been charged that dol in setting locally prevailing wage rates had been importing urban rates for projects in rural areas the new regulations placed strict limits upon this practice third in determining davisbacon wage rates dol was said to have included within its data base wages paid on other federal davisbaconcovered projects which it was charged could have the effect of ratcheting up the base rate fourth the new regulations expanded the potential use of helpers unskilled general utility workers on federal construction projects industry argued that this would reduce the cost of federal construction open work options for the unskilled and allow employers greater flexibility labor argued that it could lead to craft fragmentation decrease employment of trained workers and reduce the pay of workers employed on federal contract construction work fifth under the copeland antikickback act of 1934 contractors are required to file weekly payroll reports and an affirmation of compliance with the davisbacon pay requirements the new regulations retained the affirmation of compliance but required submission of payroll records only in enforcementcompliance actions all of the changes were opposed by organized labor but it appears the provisions dealing with the helper regulations and the copeland acts reporting requirements were of primary importance to the unions122 the new regulations challenged in court on june 11 1982 the building and construction trades department bctd of the aflcio with others filed suit to block implementation of the new regulations123 on july 22 1982 just as the regulations were to be given effect judge harold greene of the us

123 dlr june 11 1982 pp a9a10 e1e5 crs31 preliminary injunction then on december 23 1982 judge greene issued final decision essentially favorable to the union position on one point judge greene ruled in favor of secretary donovan that the secretary had acted properly in substituting new 50 percent rule for the longstanding 30 percent rule with that single exception however he declared the regulations invalid and permanently enjoined the secretary and his agents from enforcing or giving any effect to the new rules fifteen secretaries of labor serving eight presidents have never altered the regulatory scheme the present secretarys claim to have discovered wholly different congressional intent judge greene affirmed rings hollow in the light of history124 both parties appealed in january 1983 the department of justice on behalf of the dol challenged judge greenes decision in parallel move the bctd announced that it would appeal that portion of judge greenes decision that was favorable to the secretary ie the issue of the 30 percent rule125 on july 5 1983 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued split decision it stated that the legislative history of the act though not crystal clear suggests that congress contemplated that the secretarys authority to determine prevailing wages extended to finding the best way to do so in general the court deferred to the authority of the secretary first the secretary was permitted to implement the 50 percent rule andor an averaging procedure second the right of the secretary to exclude distant urban data from rural wage rate calculations was sustained third the secretary was allowed to exclude wage data from federal projects except in cases where suitable alternative data were available fourth the appeals court partially approved and partially denied the new rules on the use of helpers directing that dol amend the proposed regulation dol promulgated revised final rule dealing with helpers on january 24 1989 which won court approval congress however then refused to fund implementation of the helper rule and it remained as an open issue fifth the appeals court concurred with the district court that the changes in the reporting requirements of the copeland act would weaken davisbacon enforcement would conflict with statutory intent and therefore would be beyond the authority of the secretary the department continued to experiment with language to alter the copeland reporting requirements and the issue became the subject of various legislative proposals none of them enacted gradually the copeland reporting issue seemed to disappear from the policy agenda the prior requirements remaining in tact126 124 dlr december 27 1982 pp a9a10 e1e2 125 dlr january 24 1983 pp a6a7 126 dlr july 6

sustained in three of five areas but in two areas the helper issue and the copeland reporting requirements the position of the department had been denied suspension of the davisbacon act 19921993 as was discussed above two suspensions occurred during the first 6 decades of the acts history in 1934 president roosevelt suspended the act briefly for reasons that seem to have amounted to administrative convenience in 1971 president nixon suspended the act again briefly justifying his action in economic terms to apply pressure upon construction contractors and building trades unions as part of his wageprice control strategy in early 1992 there were published reports that third suspension of the statute might be under consideration this time under the authority of president george bush such consideration seems to have commenced during the first months of that year in june it was reported that nationwide suspension was more likely than not128 but months passed and the issue seemed to drop from view the bush partial davisbacon suspension on october 14 1992 president bush by proclamation 6491 ordered davis bacon suspended for certain jurisdictions in the states of florida louisiana and hawaii taking note of hurricanes that had recently struck those states the president declared i find the conditions caused by hurricanes andrew and iniki to constitute national emergency within the meaning of section 6 of the davis bacon act the suspension was to continue until otherwise provided129 in suspending the act president bush added several elements to the concept of national emergency which variously defined had served as the basis for presidential action first suspension might enhance employment opportunities the dol it was noted had estimated that suspension could result in the creation of as many as five to eleven thousand new jobs in the construction industry in these states explanation of the basis for this estimate was given second suspension might be viewed as an economy measure payment of the locally prevailing wage the davisbacon rate set by the administrations secretary of labor would increase the costs of rebuilding facilities in the several areas again more construction companies will be able to bid on federal construction contracts 127 dlr january 17 1984 pp a11a12 128 dlr april 22 1992 p a10 see also dlr april 23 1992 p a15 and june 5

considerations in the administrations opinion for more than half century the davisbacon act has imposed nonmarket wage rates in the construction industry unfortunately the davisbacon act has historically operated to exclude semiskilled workers including many african americans hispanics and new immigrants from work on federal contracting projects fourth there was the issue of the federal deficit in addition by having the government adhere to costly local wage settlements in the construction industry the davisbacon act has added billions of dollars to the cost of federal construction the white house statement asserted130 the assumptions set forth in the suspension order and accompanying documents were contestable and almost at once sparked dissent but laying aside such policy debate some observers felt that hurricanes andrew and iniki may have been less reason for the suspension than justification for an action already under consideration131 reaction and reinstatement opinion was divided on the suspension segments of the construction industry especially those associated with nonunion or antiunion policies applauded the suspension some suggesting the economy could be strengthened were the act suspended everywhere132 organized labor was distressed by the presidents action suggesting that it was desperate attempt to win business support in electoralrich florida and louisiana133 aflcio president lane kirkland suggested that residents of the affected states would be victimized again as unqualified contractors become involved in the reconstruction process134 representative william ford dmich chairman of the house committee on education and labor was critical of the bush proclamation mr ford charged the president with using the desperation of residents of the affected areas as an opening to cut wages and please his us chamber of commerce campaign contributors135 reportedly mr ford pledged to look into the presidents action 130 press release the white

was putatively intended to assist introduced legislation which called upon the president to amend the suspension proclamation to eliminate all references to the state of hawaii and hurricane iniki137 through the years many members of congress had been critical of the entire premise upon which the davisbacon act rested if suspension were useful total repeal might be even better some reasoned early in the 103rd congress senator larry craig rida proposed the latter now at time when this president william clinton is driving toward deficit reduction senator craig affirmed let suggest to this president that if he truly means to make meaningful cuts in the budget bring down the deficit bring down the debt one of the ways to do it is to put federal construction and private construction on an equal footing138 early in the 103rd congress the concerns of representative ford and of senator inouye were addressed on march 6 1993 president clinton issued proclamation reversing that of his predecessor george bush the clinton proclamation 6534 was simple restoration of the full force of the davisbacon act with explanation cited139 some questions remain the 19921993 davisbacon suspension had been urged upon president bush as matter of policy through the spring of 1992 long before the hurricanes struck his early reaction reportedly had been mixed140 whether his ultimate decision to suspend the act was primarily response to stormrelated developments or reflection of broader policy considerations may now be moot point other issues however remain what constitutes national emergency for purposes of suspension of the davisbacon act what was the intent of congress in this area does the concept of national emergency under davisbacon allow the president to suspend the act for regional or local emergencies that may have only tenuous impact upon the nation at large for example an earthquake or flood 136 aflcio news october 26 1992 p 1 137 see s 138 of the 103rd congress

requirements how might these be affected if at all by presidential suspension of davisbacon were president to suspend the act how long could that suspension remain in effect traditionally such suspensions have been short but might they remain in effect so long as the suspending president remained in office the crucial questions concerning suspension of davisbacon may be legal and likely subject of litigation especially so were the duration of suspension to be greater davisbacon in the 1990s the hatfieldweldon proposals the davisbacon act would continue as source of contention through the 1990s some aspects of the reagan administrative changes remained unresolved notably the helper issue questions continued to be raised concerning the wage rate determination process simultaneously some urged that the statute be repealed while others argued that it needed to be strengthened and with each congress the issues were raised anew growing momentum for repeal of davisbacon with the election of 1994 the republicans found themselves in control of both houses of the congress and davisbacon became an immediate priority as bills pro and were introduced in each house the engineering newsrecord enr summarized senate and house republicans are mapping simultaneous assaults on the davis bacon act in hearings on two bills to repeal the 64yearold federal prevailing wage law battle lines were clearly drawn on one side lawmakers and interest groups are pushing for immediate repeal of the law on the other side labor and industry groups who see the gops strategic advantage are ready to discuss wholesale reform142 141 the issue could be complicated by the specific wording through which the davisbacon requirement has been added to the various program statutes the mechanism is

davisbacon outmoded senator kassebaum opined that the public is illserved by the acts wage rate and work rule restrictions143 hearing was conducted on february 15 and on march 29 the bill was markedup

davisbacon and copeland acts per but also to remove davis bacon requirements from all federal laws into which they had been incorporated mr ballenger charged that davisbacon adds billions of dollars to federal construction costs and that repeal of the act permitting payment of lower wages to construction workers would allow the federal government to fund more construction projects with the money which is being spent or to get the planned construction done for less money145 the bill was referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections of which representative ballenger was then chair on march 2 the subcommittee markedup the bill and reported it to the full committee on economic and educational opportunities146 momentum it seemed was building147 but support for repeal was not as clear

davisbacon act reform amendments of 1995148 the senator presented the legislation as compromise that would be acceptable to the two major parties namely the building construction trade unions and the contractors coalition he reviewed the history of the act and recalled that as governor of oregon he had signed that states little davisbacon act affirming his support for the prevailing wage concept he stated the davisbacon act as it now stands indeed deserves some of the criticism that my distinguished associates level against it nevertheless its purpose of protecting the jobs of our nations construction workers must persuade us to reform rather than repeal the act senator hatfield explained that the bill was the product of long and arduous discussions that had commenced in oregon among representatives of industry and labor and had continued in washington during the summer of 1995 he proposed three amendments to the existing statute first the threshold at which the act becomes applicable to federal projects would be raised from 2000 to 100000 second the frequency with which contractors are required to file wage and benefit schedules would be changed from weekly to monthly third trainees and apprentices would be excluded from the prevailing wage standard if they are enrolled in training program that is registered with the department of labor the bill contained other provisions as well tightening here expanding or redefining coverage there rather than repeal davisbacon he suggested s 1183 would rewrite that measure so that it can serve its original and laudable purpose149 companion legislation offered in the house as the summer of 1995 wore on consideration of davisbacon continued as congress took up budget and appropriations measures and variety of program

republican members of the house as representative weldon explained the bill has the cosponsorship of 27 republicans and the support of organized labor across the country as well as many of the largest contracting corporations in america151 he enumerated the advantages of davisbacon both for workers and for industry and asserted that repeal would jeopardize the quality of life of every construction worker in this country152 although both bills s 1183 and hr 2472 died at the close of the 104th congress the movement for repeal of the davisbacon and copeland acts came to an abrupt halt it was reported that when repeal had actually seemed possible more than 14000 contractors have joined coalition with construction unions seeking reform rather than repeal153 thereafter through the end of the 20th century though repeal proposals continued to be introduced they were not acted upon some limited oversight hearings were conducted but congress now concerned itself primarily with the davisbacon provisions of program statutes even with that more focused agenda change was made in the prevailing wage statute suspension of the davisbacon act 2005 in late august 2005 hurricane katrina gathered

transportation may have been critical and perhaps equally important for these people there was lack of any acceptable destination for them after the storm passed many poor remained amid the ruins of

reaction to the promulgation representative charlie norwood rga praised the president for his quick action to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy that may hamper our ability to recover davisbacon rules are onerous and drive up the cost of any project to which they are applied the nation he stated cant afford that kind of inefficiency red tape and inflated costs when we have an entire region to rebuild largely at taxpayer expense161 the daily labor report quoting the president suggested that suspension will result in greater assistance to these devastated communities and will permit the employment of thousands of additional individuals162 or as representative feeney reportedly stated lots of people in louisiana are willing to go to work tomorrow and the market will set the wage163 organized labor opined that the presidents order would allow contractors to pay substandard wages to construction workers in the affected areas john sweeney the aflcio president opined that employers are all to eager to exploit workers this is time to make that easier further he asserted taking advantage of national tragedy to get rid of protection for workers that corporate backers of the white house have long wanted to remove is nothing less than profiteering edward sullivan president of the building and constructions trades department likened the effect to legalized looting164 the new york times editorialized that by any standard of human decency condemning many already poor and now bereft people to subpar wages thus perpetuating their poverty is unacceptable165 legislation introduced somewhat anticipating the presidents action representative flake introduced the cleanup and reconstruction enhancement act care act on september 7 2005 the flake bill hr 3684 would whenever major disaster has been proclaimed under the stafford act governing such matters automatically suspend the davisbacon act for one year in the area of concern companion bill s 1817 was subsequently introduced by senator jim demint rsc in the wake of the presidents action several bills were introduced that would have had the effect of overturning the presidents davisbacon proclamation hr 3763

specifically with the davisbacon act two bills seemed to challenge administration policy in that regard representative miller had introduced hres 467 bill requesting that the president transmit to the house of representatives information in this possession relating to contracts for services or contraction related to hurricane katrina recovery that relate to wages and benefits to be paid to workers the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce where ultimately it was rejected by vote of 25 to 20166 separate measure but of similar intent had been introduced by representative steve latourette roh and forwarded to the committee on transportation and infrastructure chaired by representative young of alaska167 davisbacon reinstated gradually conditions in the gulf region became clearer and in that context movement was discerned for reinstitution of the davisbacon act in late september some 37 republicans signed on to letter to president bush urging that his proclamation be rescinded in more varied appeal latourette stated when you suspend davisbacon you also suspend the copeland antikickback prohibitions of the act so you have more certified payrolls for those who are worried about profiteering and other things reinstating davisbacon is good idea168 in late october about 20 republicans reportedly attended meeting with white house chief of staff andrew card at the office of speaker dennis hastert card was described as more than receptive to suggestions from those supportive of davis bacon and acknowledged that they werent saving any money through the suspension169 on october 25 card called representative latourette to invite him to meeting at the white house the following day october 26 during the white house meeting card was quoted as having said according to latourette that there appeared to be savings garnered from suspending the davisbacon act170 on october 26 2005 word began to surface that change of policy was in the works and by late afternoon it seemed to have been confirmed the bush administration said the daily labor report reported that it would reinstate on november 8 davisbacon act prevailing wage requirements for reconstruction projects in the hurricanebattered gulf coast region the article continued quoting 166 see crs report rl31909 house resolutions of inquiry by louis fisher 167 daily labor report october

will reinstate davisbacon171 issues remaining for the new century although the davisbacon act has been in place for 75 years it remains focus of controversy through the closing years of the 20th century and into the 21st century aspects of its administration remain in contention but most areas of dispute have roots in the enactments of 1931 and 1935 when the initial davisbacon legislation was under consideration few appeared to have entertained doubts that the department of labor would be able rather easily to render wage rate determinations whenever the stakeholders employers and workers were unable to agree with respect to what the locally prevailing wage actually was in practice wage rate determination has remained core issue with respect to the davisbacon act and remains as yet unresolved similarly classification of workers has remained an issue emerging most notably with proposals from the late 1970s to define treatment of helpers and to assess an appropriate pattern of utilization of apprentices two quite distinct groups of workers how workers are classified largely determines the rate at which they will be paid it may also reflect the attitude of the employing firm toward trade unions and collective bargaining other classification issues have arisen along with the definition of various statutory provisions what for example is meant by the site of the work for davisbacon purposes how should offsite work however defined be treated should truck drivers be davisbacon covered what ought to be the inter relationship between davisbacon and the other procurement statutes ie the walshhealey act setting labor standards for goods produced under federal contracts and the mcnamaraohara act setting labor standards for service workers engaged under federal contracts annexation of the davisbacon act to variety of program statutes or inclusion of davisbacon prevailing wage provision within such statutes has added further complexities and opportunities for dispute pro and for example does davisbacon prevailing wage provision added to program statute insure protection for the workers involved it may or it may not depending upon the phrasing of coverage and the relationship of the davisbacon provision to the core statute when project funding is not directly provided to grantloan recipient through appropriated funds but through revolving fund or tax credits etc is davisbacon coverage modified or might the work be completely davisbacon exempt finally through the 1990s and beyond dispute remains about the economic impact of the davisbacon act were davisbacon repealed how much might the 171 daily labor report october 27 2005 p aa1 crs43 federal agencies save presumably by paying construction workers at lower rates or would elimination of davisbacon have implications that could augment both labor and total project costs does davisbacon with its associated regulations encourage higher quality of workmanship enhanced productivity and reduced need for remedial work is there connection between skilltransfers apprenticeship training and davisbacon how are various groups of workers women minorities the unskilled nonunion workers affected by the operation of the statute after 75 years as one reads through the hearings and floor discussions it would seem that the verdict is still out indeed there would also seem to be very little solid data upon which to base an assessment still often normally on several occasions during each session of the congress the issue of davisbacon is raised anew amid largely unqualified assertions of impact pro and frequently without supporting empirical evidence concluding comment since the 1930s doubts have been raised about the need for the davisbacon act and about the ability of the department of labor to implement the statute in reasonable manner through most of its history however such criticism seems to have been muted in the 1950s as davisbacon provisions were increasingly added to program statutes critics became more vocal and increasingly so during the 1960s through the 1980s in the mid1990s there seemed to be some suggestion that critics were making inroads on the act and that repeal or significant revision was likely then suddenly the climate changed and through the past dozen years debate has cooled though criticism has not entirely disappeared the act has been the focus of numerous hearings scores of floor debates and has sparked an extended body of literature studies reports analyses but the thrust of congressional policy has been consistently toward expanded coverage and strengthening of the act through the years certain policy issues with respect to davisbacon have remained under discussion and to the extent that these questions continue to be raised they can be said to be unresolved indeed some issues that were subjects of debate in the 1930s continued to be debated largely in the same terms and to provoke similar demands for administrative andor legislative action the growing davisbacon literature pro and with refutations and countercritiques seems to offer little that is new and appears to have left critical aspects of the act its administration and its impact unilluminated172 the davisbacon act has now become an institutional part of wage structure and contracting practice within the construction industry what the impact of repeal or significant modification of the act might be is not entirely clear should any 172 concerning these and other issues see crs report 94908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittaker crs44 change with respect to davisbacon whether pro or be extended to the related federal contract labor standards statutes the walshhealey act and the mcnamara ohara act this may be an area in which further study could be productive as the 21st century advances several additional elements may be added to the debate over davisbacon or have an effect upon the character of that debate first some perceive gradual weakening of the trade union movement both in actual membership and in political influence this could translate into diminished public and congressional support for davisbacon and if that perception is accurate it could result in some refocusing of labors legislative priorities at the same time it should be recalled that the davisbacon act was intended to promote stability within the construction industry as well as to protect labor standards might elimination of davisbacon adversely impact industry producing uncertainties with respect to wages as an element of the bidding process alter manpower utilization patterns increase the risk of accidents in the workplace or render less effective skill development and transfer now commonly resolved through apprenticeship programs where there is davisbacon coverage173 second there has been gradual change over time in demographics members of congress policy analysts trade union leaders with others may longer fully share or appreciate the experience of the preworld war ii era with the retirement of the generations of the 1930s and 1940s and attendant loss of certain historical perspectives there may longer be broad understanding of the rationale for certain statutes for protection of workers that an older generation may have taken for granted thus if these labor standards statutes such as davisbacon are to survive they may need to be justified anew either through education or through experience some of it perhaps painful but on the other hand might it be that there may really be longer need for statutes such as the davis bacon act or might it be feasible to recodify davisbacon with the several related statutes as more general federal contract labormanagement standards enactment third the reemergence of the federal deficit and budgetary constraints resulting from security concerns may provoke more critical review of assumptions made during earlier periods of our national experience as result where certain statutes are criticized as imposing unnecessary costs or as presenting significant enforcement and compliance problems there may be increased willingness to alter or to dispense with these older perhaps less well understood laws and to replace them with programs and regulations judged to be more vital to younger constituency 173 implications of repeal of the davisbacon act are suggested in philips peter garth mangum norm waitzman and anne yeagle losing ground report on the repeal of nine little davisbacon acts salt lake city university of utah press 1995 crs45 for all of these reasons it may be useful to review the evolution of the davis bacon act and of other federal contract labor standards statutes as well in order to provide rational foundation for their reassessment and for the development of future directions of public policy174 174 see also crs report rl32086 federal contract labor standards statutes an
