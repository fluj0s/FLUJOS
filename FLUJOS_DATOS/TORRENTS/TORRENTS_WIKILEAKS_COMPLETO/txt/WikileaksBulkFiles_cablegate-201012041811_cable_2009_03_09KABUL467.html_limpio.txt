b and d 1 cnf summary individuals formerly close to president karzai attribute blame for karzais recent unpredictable behavior to the influence of trio of palace advisors critics say palace chief of staff mohammad daudzai education minister farooq wardak and information and culture minister abdul karim khoram provide misleading advice and conspire to isolate karzai from more pragmatic and prowestern advisors in purposeful effort to antagonize western countries especially the united states these three share common link to the mujahideenera hezbeislami organization stoking suspicions particularly among nonpashtuns that their efforts are part of larger conspiracy but in rumordriven country such as afghanistan assumptions can far outstrip reality there is wide consensus that these three currently have karzais ear but allowances have to be made for afghan rumor mongering and karzais own conspirational outlook karzais advisor bubble 2 cnf many karzai supporters some who have been with the president since his transitional administration and 2004 presidential campaign have expressed frustration over their lack of direct access to karzai they say chief of staff daudzai has restricted access to the president and prevented other palace staff from meeting alone with karzai when petitioners do receive meetings daudzai is always present mps also complain karzai is less accessible than he was two years ago and repeatedly ignores their meeting requests many former allies have either withdrawn their support for his reelection or have held off on publicly committing to his campaign reftel 3 cnf palace chief of policy sebghatullah sanjar said daudzai feeds the president misinformation and highlights negative coverage of his government turning karzai against former allies and influencing his opinions of people he has not yet met sanjar said daudzai began to cut off karzais oneonone meetings with other palace staff in 2008 though sanjar succeeded in seeing the president without daudzai twice in the last two months sanjar and others say daudzai is karzais most influential advisor on afghanistans foreign policy and reconciliation initiatives many believe daudzai is steering the president into closer ties with iran russia and taliban leaders 4 cnf sanjar describes karzai as lonely and alone man who suspects his inner circle is leading him in the wrong direction but does not know who else to trust the president pays significant attention to the mostly negative media coverage of his government perpetuating his suspicions that enemies are out to get him daudzai and khoram have convinced karzai to take harder line against his critics regardless of whether they are traditional rivals or allies providing constructive criticism sanjar suggests this advice is factor in karzais emotional reactions to civilian casualty incidents and his publicized dialogue with russia former foreign minister abdullah abdullah claimed daudzai and farooq wardak know how to manipulate karzais thought process and tendency to make emotional decisions based on unvetted information abdullah also asserts that karzai is increasingly paranoid and prone to conspirational outlook on life leading him to blame all problems on others and unable to see his own role in mistakes 5 cnf fm spanta objects to daudzais conduct on limiting access including for spanta and to daudzais policy influence they have cool relationship palace deputy chief of staff homayra etemadi affirms the observations of others on daudzais ill influence over karzai she distrusts her boss and has recommended the embassy consider carefully what kinds of information it shares with daudzai mfa chief of protocol hamid sidiq is convinced that daudzai who once served as afghanistans ambassador to tehran is working to advance tehrans interests ahead of the united states visavis the palace sidiq reported that daudzai recently overruled an mfa decision to turn down meeting request to karzai by an 8person delegation of iranian television officials earlier that day the palace had limited an official canadian delegation to five members to see karzai 6 cnf information minister khoram and education minister wardak get their fair share of criticism as well social moderates like lower house mp shukria barakzai kabul pashtun upper house mp rida azimi parwan tajik and former wardak governor abdul jabbar naeemi blame khoram for karzais increasingly conservative stands on social issues kabul 00000467 002 of 002 and wardak for the presidents hesitance to publicly criticize the taliban and other insurgent groups united front members and other contacts are incensed that karzai criticizes the united states and other coalition partners after civilian casualty incidents but only issues muted statements through his press office or the ministry of foreign affairs after deadly insurgent attacks such as the feb 11 attacks on government ministries in kabul the hezbeislami connection 7 cnf daudzai khoram and wardak were members of hezbeislami hi in the 1980s during the mujahideen campaign against soviet forces the majoritypashtun his later rivalry with the tajikcentric jamiatemilli and other resistance groups has left legacy of ethnicbased tension among mujahideen today none of the three advisors is member of hezbeislami afghanistan the political party that broke with gulbuddin hekmatyar in order to rejoin afghan politics however many tajiks and other nonpashtuns maintain their suspicions that every promotion or appointment of former hi member or current hia member is part of conspiracy of pashtunization of the government driven by daudzai wardak and khoram 8 cnf hia chairman arghandewal suspects daudzai manipulates karzais political views but denies any connection between his party and the three advisors arghandewal who serves as tribal advisor to the karzai has not had oneonone conversation with the president in more than nine months rendering him an advisor who does not give advice he said hia members are frustrated by the publics association of them with the daudzaiwardakkhoram bloc since the three have current ties to the party and were only minor figures in the mujahideen years arghandewal hekmatyars chief financial officer for several years said he may have met daudzai or khoram in passing during the 1980s but only became aware of their hi connections after their current rise to prominence conspiracy or projection 9 cnf in afghanistan all criticism and personal attacks should be taken with grain of salt and examined carefully for underlying and ulterior motives that said the criticism of karzais inner circle spans the ideological spectrum and includes detractors from all major ethnic groups by all accounts karzais access to onetime loyalists has been more limited over the past year but those who feel loyalty to or pity for the embattled president may be projecting their frustrations away from karzai and on to the nearest target his advisors others mostly ethnic northerners inclined to distrust any pashtun leaders motives see the hezbeislami connections of daudzai wardak and khoram as all the proof they need to substantiate their conspiracy theories but hezbeislami members tend to be among the most educated afghan mujahideen and thus the fact that they may be in positions of technocratic power today close to karzai or not is understandable in government with thin pool of competency to draw from 10 cnf for the impartial observer it is difficult to determine whether these three advisors do indeed have their own agenda or whether karzais reliance on their counsel is reflection of his own political leanings what is clear however is that the characterizations of karzais emotional and psychological state by his afghan critics reported here are by and large consistent with our own observations and dealings with him dell
