of epas capandtrade regulations updated january 13 2006 james mccarthy specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress mercury emissions from electric power plants an analysis of epas capandtrade regulations summary epa studies conclude that about 6 of american women of childbearing age have blood mercury levels sufficient to increase the risk of adverse health effects especially lower iqs in children they might bear thus there was great interest in the agencys march 15 2005 announcement that it was finalizing new regulations to control mercury hg emissions from coalfired electric power plants power plants account for 42 of total us mercury emissions according to epa in announcing the regulations however epa stated that most mercury in the atmosphere comes from nonus global sources even if regulations could reduce power plant mercury emissions to zero the agency concluded there would be little change in the mercury health effects it has identified this point is contested many argue that power plants make significant contributions to mercury emissions in local hot spots and that reducing power plant emissions would significantly reduce risks instead of stringent plantspecific requirements epa promulgated capand trade standards that rely heavily on cobenefits from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide controls installed under separate agency rule the clean air interstate rule cair this approach minimizes costs for electric utilities by 2015 less than 1 of coalfired power plants will have installed equipment specifically designed to control mercury under the hg rule according to epa by 2020 only 4 of plants will have such equipment sixteen states have filed suit to overturn the agencys action arguing that epa is required by the clean air act to impose more stringent maximum achievable control technology standards at each individual plant beginning in 2010 the capandtrade rule limits total power plant mercury emissions to 38 tons annually 21 reduction vs 1999 levels second phase caps annual emissions at 15 tons starting in 2018 according to the agency trading and banking of emission allowances will result in lower than required emissions in the early years but will delay achievement of the 15ton cap to at least 2025 epa has sent contradictory signals regarding the importance of controlling mercury emissions its january 2004 analysis estimated that the indirect benefits of proposed regulations would be 15 billion annually outweighing compliance costs by factor of at least 16 to 1 direct benefits although unquantifiable were said to be large enough to justify substantial investment in hg control the analysis of the final rule by contrast concludes that quantifiable direct and indirect benefits of mercury control are just 43 million per year epas calculations did not include consideration of an academic study that it had funded factor contributing to the calculation of smaller benefits this decision was one of several irregularities in the regulatory process alleged by the agencys inspector general gao and others in addition to epas regulatory effort at least six bills that would regulate these emissions have been introduced so far in the 109th congress with more expected s 131 the clear skies act has many points in common

electric power plants an analysis of epas capandtrade regulations background mercury is potent neurotoxin that can cause adverse health effects at very low concentrations concerns about public exposure to mercury have grown in recent years as research has indicated its presence at significant levels in numerous species of fish and as analyses of dietary intake and resulting blood levels have pointed to potential health risks from mercury ingestion particularly for women of childbearing age and developing fetuses according to the environmental protection agency epa as of december 2004 44 states had issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury twentyone states primarily in the midwest and northeast have issued statewide advisories for mercury in all their freshwater lakes andor rivers in all these advisories cover more than 13 million acres of lakes and roughly 765000 river miles1 twelve states in the southeast and new england have statewide advisories for mercury in their coastal waters and hawaii has statewide advisory for mercury in marine fish mercury reaches water bodies from naturally occurring sources from past uses many of which such as fungicide application to crops are now banned from disposal of mercurycontaining products and from current activities principally combustion of fuels containing mercury in trace amounts mercury released to the atmosphere can circulate for up to year before being deposited on land or in water thus it is widely dispersed and often is transported thousands of miles from the emissions source2 according to epa us sources contributed only 3 of the 5500 tons of mercury emitted to the atmosphere on global basis in 19953 of the mercury deposited in the united states however about 60 comes from us sources4 1 us epa office

wwwepagovttnoarpgt3memorandawhtpaperpdf crs2 this percentage is estimated to be even higher in certain regions eg northeast us5 because mercury emissions are concentrated in specific areas and because of variations in precipitation patterns the highest deposition rates according to epa occur in the southern great lakes the ohio valley the northeast and scattered areas in the southeast6 of particular concern for aquatic organisms and human health is mercury in the form of methyl mercury nearly all of the mercury that accumulates in fish tissue is methyl mercury an organic compound formed by microbial process often in wetland environments once formed methyl mercury tends to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms increasing concentrations at each level of the food chain as result top predators in food chain such as largemouth bass or walleye may have concentrations of bioaccumulative contaminants in their tissues million times higher than the concentrations found in the waterbodies7 children born to women with fetal cord blood concentrations of mercury above 58 parts per billion ppb are at some increased risk of adverse health effects8 according to epa these health effects include delayed development neurological defects and lower iq recent data reported by the centers for disease control and prevention indicate that about 6 of women of childbearing age had bloodmercury levels above the 58 ppb threshold in 199920029 because mercury levels in fetal cord blood are likely to be higher than levels in maternal blood the percentage of babies that might be at risk is likely to be greater sources of emissionsstatus of regulations as shown in table 1 us air emissions of mercury come from eight principal sources of these the largest source is coalfired utility boilers ie coalfired electric power plants these accounted for an estimated 52 tons of mercury emissions per year in 19941995 about onethird of total us mercury emissions at the time10 5 us

saturated brine to an electric current the mercury binds with potassium or sodium in the process but later is separated and reused in the year 2000 65 tons of mercury that the plants consumed could not be accounted for crs4 regulation of nonutility sources as of march 2005 epa had made regulatory promulgations for all major sources of mercury emissions the authority for most of these regulations is section 112 of the clean air act 42 usc 7412 which requires national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants in amending section 112 in 1990 congress included list of 188 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated mercury among them epa was directed to identify sources of these pollutants and impose maximum achievable control technology mact section 112 defines mact for new facilities as an emission standard less stringent than what is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source ie the best demonstrated technology for existing facilities it allows somewhat less stringent standard setting the average emissions of the best performing 12 of units in the category as minimum in most cases but giving epa discretion to set more stringent standard sources of mercury emissions including coalfired commercial and industrial boilers chloralkali plants and portland cement plants are subject to regulations promulgated under this authority separately section 129 of the clean air act requires emission standards for solid waste incinerator units including municipal and medical waste incinerators these standards which were promulgated in the mid1990s limit 11 categories of pollutants including mercury under the standards municipal and medical waste incinerators which together accounted for 29 of total us mercury emissions before regulation have achieved emission reductions of 95 and together emitted only 22 tons of mercury in 2000 according to epa11 as result coalfired utilities the last major source to be regulated now account for at least 42 of us mercury emissions12 electric utilities and mercury statutory requirements electric utilities were singled out for special consideration by the 1990 clean air act amendments under section 112n epa was required to undertake two studies of mercury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units and to report to congress before deciding whether to impose mact standards one study was to characterize emissions from utilities municipal waste incinerators and other sources determine their health and environmental effects identify the technologies available to control emissions and estimate the costs of such technologies the other study was to 11 major reductions in toxics metals seen from controls on incinerators epa says daily environment report june 25 2002 p a3 12 the 42 estimate comes from table vi2 of revision of december 2000 regulatory finding on the emissions of hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units and the removal of coal and oilfired electric utility steam generating units from the section 112c list 70 federal register 16018 march 29 2005 hereafter cited as revision of regulatory finding it refers to emissions in 2001 in the agencys toxic release inventory tri database httpwwwepagovtriexplorer electric utilities accounted for 65 of total air emissions of mercury and mercury compounds in 2003 latest available year as of january 2006 the tri database somewhat overstates the utility share of the total because it excludes waste incineration and all sources that emit less than 10 pounds of mercury crs5 determine the hazards to public health anticipated as result of emissions of all hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities after imposition of other requirements of the act and describe alternative control strategies for emissions which may warrant regulation under this section after considering the results of this study the administrator shall regulate electric utility steam generating units under this section section 112 if the administrator finds such regulation is appropriate and necessary having submitted the required reports to congress under this section in 1997 and 199813 epa administrator carol browner did find such regulation appropriate and necessary and issued formal finding to that effect in december 200014 the finding set in motion the development of mact standards the standards were to be proposed by december 15 2003 and final mact rule was to be signed by march 15 2005 mact standards require compliance for existing facilities three years after promulgation with the possibility of oneyear extensions15 epas utility regulations in the march 15 2005 final mercury rules epa did not promulgate mact standard instead it revisited the december 2000 analysis and reversed its regulatory finding in its revised analysis regulating mercury from utilities under section 112 is neither appropriate nor necessary it is not appropriate the agency concluded because the health effects of mercury from utilities remaining after imposition of other controls do not result in hazards to public health16 it is not necessary in the agencys reasoning because mercury could be regulated under other sections of the act specifically section 11117 thus the agency proposed new source performance standard nsps for mercury from utilities under section 111b and capandtrade system to control emissions from existing and new utility sources under section 111d of the two section 111 rules attention has focused primarily on the capand trade system under section 111d rather than the nsps very few new coalfired units have been built in recent years and only handful of such facilities are 13 us epa office of air quality planning and standards study of

hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units 65 federal register 79825 december 20 2000 15 these dates on which regulations were to be proposed and promulgated were fixed in modified settlement agreement filed november 17 1998 the case is natural resources defense council inc v us epa 921415 dc cir originally the deadline for promulgation was december 15 2004 in late april 2004 nrdc offered to extend the deadline 90 days in order to allow for additional analysis of regulatory options epa accepted the offer 16 us epa revision of regulatory finding 70 federal register 16004 march 29 2005 the full discussion begins on p 16002 17 ibid p 16005 crs6 currently moving through the permitting process while some think the rise in natural gas prices will spark construction of new wave of coalfired plants the department of energy projects essentially change in coalfired electric generation between now and 201518 thus it is expected that the nsps will affect far fewer units than the capandtrade rules furthermore under the promulgated capandtrade system new units are not given any emission allowances for each ounce of mercury that they emit they would need to purchase an allowance from an existing unit that has controlled emissions more or sooner than required thus in the overall scheme of things new units would not increase total emissions of mercury above the nationwide cap matter how weak or strong the nsps might be the capandtrade system on the other hand has received significant attention much of it highly critical some of the criticism concerns the choice of section 111d as the legislative authority for mercury regulation section 111d has rarely been used until now and has never been used to regulate hazardous air pollutant listed under section 112 epa staff say that it has previously been used to regulate sulfur emissions from pulp and paper mills and fluoride emissions from aluminum smelters neither of which are controlled elsewhere in the act19 epas march 29 2005 federal register notice contains long discussion of the legality of the use of section 111 as opposed to the mact authority in section 112 the legality of this approach was immediately challenged in suit filed by new jersey and 15 other states20 18 see energy information administration us doe annual energy outlook 2005 february 2005 table 9 at httpwwweiadoegovoiafarchiveaeo05aeoref_tabhtml 19 sulfur and fluoride are not listed as hazardous air pollutants under section 112b and are not criteria pollutants listed under section 108a 20 the

and midwestern states delaware illinois michigan minnesota pennsylvania rhode island and wisconsin have since joined them in challenging the rule while seven mostly plains states alabama kansas nebraska north dakota south dakota and wyoming have intervened on epas side for discussion of the legal issues see crs report rl32203 legal analysis and background on the epas proposed rules for regulating mercury emissions from electric utilities by michael john garcia interestingly neither section 111 nor section 112 actually mention capandtrade programs section 111 requires standards of performance defined as standard that reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction emphasis added which the administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated epa states that this language allows capandtrade system section 112d also uses broad language referring to measures processes methods systems or techniques but in elaborating on this definition for nearly page the statute provides numerous examples and specifics without mentioning capandtrade systems crs7 the specifics of the capandtrade system its timing and its level of stringency are also controversial21 the system will cap nationwide emissions of mercury from coalfired electric generating units at 38 tons beginning in 2010 and at 15 tons beginning in 2018 if achieved the caps would provide 21 reduction from the 1999 level of emissions in phase 1 and 70 reduction in phase 2 table 2 mercury caps and projected emissions under the mercury capandtrade rule year 2010 2015 2018 2020 cap 38 tons 38 tons 15 tons 15 tons projected actual 313 tons 279 tons na 243 tons emissions source us epa the caps will be implemented through an allowance system similar to that used in the acid rain program through which utilities can either control the pollutant directly or purchase excess allowances from other plants that have controlled more stringently or sooner than required early reductions can be banked for later use if they are not sold the agency says the banking provision will provide incentives for early reductions as shown in table 2 it projects emissions of 313 tons in 2010 nearly 7 tons less than the cap22 if this happens it will allow utilities to delay full compliance with the 70 reduction until well beyond 2018 as they use up banked allowances rather than install further controls the agencys analysis projects actual emissions to be 243 tons as late as 2020 less than 50 reduction compared to baseline 1999 emissions23 it appears that full compliance with the 70 reduction might be delayed until 203024 21 variety of views have been expressed by interested parties regarding epas mercury rule for additional

which the agency uses to calculate regulatory impacts runs to the year 2030 and assumes that all allowances will be used by the end date discussions continued crs8 costs and benefits of the final rule while acknowledging that it is unable to estimate or express in dollars at least seven categories of potential benefits epas estimate of the direct benefits of the final capandtrade rule is close to zero25 the one direct benefit for which the agency made an estimate was the benefit from avoided iq decrements in children prenatally exposed to lower levels of methylmercury the value of which was estimated at 400000 to 30 million annually in calculating this amount the agency looked only at exposures due to the mothers ingestion of fish from fresh water recreational fishing26 in addition the agency found that the controls installed to reduce mercury would slightly reduce emissions of fine particulate matter pm25 saving up to 7 lives annually these cobenefits were estimated at 14 million to 40 million per year27 the costs of the mercury rule were estimated to range from 157 million annually to 896 million depending on whether 3 or 7 discount rate was used28 24 continued we held with epa staff indicate that some think the allowances will be used more quickly perhaps as early as 2025 while others think use of allowances will be stretched into the 2030s the level at which the phase 1 cap is set is key determinant of when the rule reaches its ultimate stringency the final rules 38ton phase 1 cap generates 705 tons of early reduction allowances by 2018 in epas analysis cap that matched epas estimate of actual emissions in 2010 would generate only about 17 tons of allowances by 2018 if the timing of industry compliance was unchanged in general the larger the number of allowances generated by early reductions the later full compliance will be achieved 25 potential benefits that were not estimated included cardiovascular effects ecosystem effects genotoxic immunotoxic reproductive renal and hematological effects while studies have suggested associations between exposure to methylmercury and each of these effects epa found the evidence either inconclusive or insufficient to evaluate the impacts see us epa standards of performance for new and existing stationary sources electric utility steam generating units final rule preamble pp 186187 available at httpwwwepagovttnatwutilitycamr_final_preamblepdf hereafter preamble to the final rule in its analysis of the proposed rule epa listed 11 health and welfare benefits of controlling mercury reductions in neurological disorders learning disabilities and developmental delays impacts on birds and mammals such as reproductive effects impacts on commercial subsistence and recreational fishing and reduced existence values for currently healthy ecosystems it also listed as potential mercury control benefits reductions in cardiovascular effects altered blood pressure regulation and reproductive effects in humans none of these benefits were quantified but the agency stated at the time that it believed that they are large enough to justify substantial investment in hg emission

187 more thorough discussion of the cobenefits of particulate matter control is found in section 12 of the regulatory impact analysis at httpwwwepagovttn atwutilityria_finalpdf 28 the higher discount rate would imply greater uncertainty regarding future cost rather than continued crs9 cost factors estimated by epa included capital investments in pollution control operating expenses of the pollution controls and additional fuel expenditures but not the cost of monitoring reporting and recordkeeping29 several observations can be made regarding these cost and benefit estimates first according to the rules preamble epa modeling assumes improvements in the cost or effectiveness of hg mercury control technology over time in the next sentence the agency notes in reality by 2020 costs of hg control are expected to have declined30 the costs used in the modeling runs were estimated in mid 2003 according to epa since that time mercury control costs have declined as much as 75 according to the institute of clean air companies icac the trade association that represents manufacturers of pollution control equipment31 if that is the case mercury control costs could be overestimated by as much as factor of 4 the discrepancy between icacs estimate and epas may be larger than fourfold however at january 2005 congressional briefing icac and one of the technology providers estimated current mercury control costs as low as 2000 per pound32 epas modeling runs estimated the marginal cost to be 39000 per pound in 202033 second while the estimated costs of the rule 157 million to 896 million annually in 2020 appear substantial in epas costbenefit analysis there is little additional detail provided as to what these costs represent the analysis concludes that almost pollution control equipment would be installed specifically to control mercury as shown in table 3 in 2010 only 2 gigawatts less than 1 of coalfired capacity is projected to have installed activated carbon injection aci under the rule34 an additional 1 gigawatt gw is projected to add selective catalytic reduction scr to control mercury total coalfired electric capacity is currently 305 gw and is expected to remain at that level in 2010 by 2015 there is little change by 28 continued the imposition of additional controls 29 epa estimates these costs elsewhere in its analysis at less than 76 million annually preamble to the final rule p 190 30 ibid pp 198199 31 institute of clean air companies icac advances in mercury control technology to meet future needs congressional briefing january 31 2005 32 ibid followup discussions with icac one of its member companies and epa staff produced range of estimates regarding cost but all three sources agreed that the cost of mercury removal has been reduced substantially since epas 2003 baseline personal communications week of april 11 2005 33 see regulatory impact analysis previously cited table 78 p 77 epas modeling results are expressed in 1999 dollars 34 aci is the only technology specifically designed for mercury control in epas model crs10 2020 mercury controls would include 13 gigawatts of aci about 4 of coalfired units 3 gw of scr and 1 gw of scrubbers35 the reason that so few units would install aci in epas analysis is that the agency designed the rule to complement its simultaneous promulgation of the clean air interstate rule cair capandtrade program for utility emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox controlling so2 nox and mercury simultaneously reduces costs by allowing utilities to maximize cobenefits of emission controls controls such as scrubbers and fabric filters both of which are widely used today to control so2 and particulates have the side effect or cobenefit of reducing mercury emissions to some extent nox control technology known as selective catalytic reduction or scr tends to oxidize elemental mercury making it easier for scrubbers and particulate controls to remove under epas capandtrade regulations both the 2010 and 2018 mercury emission standards are set to maximize use of these cobenefits thus few controls would be required to specifically address mercury emissions under the rule and the costs specific to controlling mercury would be low table 3 epa projections of installed pollution controls at coal fired electric generating units 20102020 in

observations regarding the benefit side of the analysis one notable feature is the contrast between epas final costbenefit analysis and the agencys analysis of its proposed rule which appeared in the federal register year 35 fgd scrubbers and scr are designed primarily to reduce so2 and nox but have the co benefit of reducing mercury crs11 earlier36 in the proposed rule calculations of the overall costs and benefits supported the imposition of more stringent standard the proposed mact rule would have taken effect two years earlier than the capandtrade rule and allowed emissions of 34 tons annually the agency projected compliance costs of the mact proposal at 945 million per year quantifiable benefits of mact essentially longer lives and less illness from the reductions in fine particles achieved as cobenefit were estimated at more than 15 billion annually 16 to 1 advantage over costs if costs to other sectors of society were added in the benefitcost ratio was still 9 to 1 as noted earlier none of the 15 billion in benefits the agency quantified in its proposal was direct benefit of mercury control they were all benefits that resulted from reduced particulate emissions in addition to these cobenefits however the agency concluded that the unquantifiable direct benefits of controlling mercury are large enough to justify substantial investment in hg emissions

depending on whether one chooses the industrys compliance cost or the cost to society at large and depending on the discount rate used to adjust future costs and benefits to facilitate comparisons this table relies on compliance cost rather than social cost the range of capandtrade benefits includes both direct and indirect pm25related benefits nq not quantified as shown in table 4 the analysis accompanying the final rule presents results far different from the earlier analysis whereas the earlier analysis showed benefits far outweighing costs the final analysis concludes that the costs of mercury control outweigh the benefits by 17 to 1 the primary change appears to be reassignment 36 us epa mercury proposal preamble 69 federal register 4651 january 30 2004 37 ibid p 4711 crs12 of the 15 billion in particulate matter cobenefits to the cair rule38 by making implementation of mercury controls simultaneous with cair the cobenefits are attributed to cair instead of to the mercury rule epas analysis of cair now shows benefits of 85100 billion annually by 2015 more than 25 times its cost some of this change is simply paper exercise the cobenefits are taken from one rule and given to another but there is also real difference in the agencys position regarding direct benefits rather than maintaining that the benefits of mercury control although unquantifiable are large enough to justify substantial investments in mercury control the agency now concludes that even complete elimination of the mercury emissions from us power plants would have little impact on human health39 in assessing this latter conclusion though we arrive at second key observation regarding the benefits analysis epas assessment did not include two peerreviewed studies that indicated stricter utility mercury rules would have yielded large benefits one study by the mount sinai center for childrens health and the environment published in the national institutes of healths environmental health perspectives february 28 2005 concluded that between 316588 and 637233 newborn children each year have blood mercury levels associated with loss of iq the study concluded the resulting loss of intelligence causes diminished economic productivity that persists over the entire lifetime of these children this lost productivity is the major cost of methylmercury toxicity and it amounts to 87

of reducing power plant mercury emissions to 15 tons per year range from 119 million annually if persistent iq deficits from fetal exposures to methylmercury are counted to as much as 52 billion annually if both iq deficits and cardiovascular effects and premature mortality are estimated42 the harvard report was not referenced in the agencys analysis of the final rule the agency maintains that since the final report on the study was not submitted until after january 3 2005 agency deadline it was ineligible to be considered availability of technology critics of epas mercury rule argue that the regulations should be more stringent or implemented more quickly to large extent these arguments and epas counterarguments rest on assumptions concerning the availability of control technologies specifically epa maintains that the technology required for mercury control will not be adequately demonstrated until after 201043 and that the technologies for so2 and nox while available now cannot be implemented at faster pace without causing extremely high costs and overwhelming the capacity of equipment suppliers44 analysis by other experts came to different conclusion for example late 2003 paper coauthored by representatives of two power companies the electric power research institute the us department of energy and adaes leading consultant on advanced mercury control technologies concluded recent fullscale field tests have proven the effectiveness of activated carbon injection for reducing mercury emissions this technology is ideally suited for use on existing coalfired boilers as it provides the following advantages minimal capital cost of equipment 3kw can be retrofit with little or downtime of the operating unit effective for both bituminous and subbituminous coals can achieve 90 removal when used with fabric filter that has been designed properly for carbon injection and 41 see epa draws fire for ignoring harvard study of benefits of

ord in white paper posted on the epa website march 2 2004 appears to conclude that technology is more available and more effective than is maintained in the agencys rulemaking ord found that fabric filters relatively simple technology that is currently installed on more than 12 of power plants achieve 90 reduction in mercury emissions at bituminous coal plants and 72 reduction at subbituminous plants the addition of scrubber increased the emission reduction to 98 at bituminous plants according to ord46 the white paper further stated that by 2010 activated carbon injection with fabric filter has the potential to achieve 90 hg reduction on any rank of coal and could be installed within 12 years of signing contract to do so47 since the white paper was written there have been reports that european firm donau carbon has begun offering commercial guarantees for mercury removal from coalfired power plants using aci technology48 aci has also been used successfully for the past decade to control mercury emissions from municipal waste incinerators according to epas office of air quality planning and standards emissions of mercury from these sources were reduced from 452 tons in 1990 to 22 tons in 2000 and the performance of the mact retrofits has been outstanding49 while the concentration of mercury in incinerator emissions is higher than that in coalfired power plants requiring some adjustments in operating methods the basic aci technology has proven itself to be reliable and effective through decade of experience hot spots one of the main criticisms of the capandtrade approach is that it would not address hot spots areas where mercury emissions andor concentrations in water bodies are greater than elsewhere epa has developed data on such hot spots environmental

account for 50 to 80 of the mercury deposition50 that the local contribution to hot spot concentrations is this high is disputed by utility sources particularly for mercury emitted by power plants utility spokespersons maintain that much of the mercury emitted by utilities is in the elemental form is nonwater soluble and is released from taller stacks the result they say is that it is less available to fish and disperses over wider area with much of it entering global mercury cycle51 epa has adopted this point of view in supporting materials that accompanied the release of the final mercury rule the agency noted that only 1 of global mercury emissions comes from us power plants52 epa modeling in support of the final rule concluded that even if power plant emissions were reduced to zero there would be little impact on methylmercury concentrations in us lakes and rivers and little consequent reduction in the concentrations of mercury in fisheating women of childbearing age53 the concern over hot spots and the impetus to address them were reinforced in late 2003 by study of mercury contamination in the everglades the study found that concentrations of mercury in fish and wading birds in the area dropped around 75 after florida imposed stringent controls on incinerators and other local sources of mercury emissions in the 1990s54 backers of strong controls on utility emissions have cited these results in arguing against capandtrade approach capandtrade programs are not in principle well designed to address hot spots they argue the capandtrade approach allows facilities to purchase allowances and avoid any emission controls if that is the compliance approach that makes the most sense to plants owners and operators opponents of the rule maintain that if plants near hot spots purchase allowances rather than install controls the capandtrade system may not have an impact on mercury concentrations at the most contaminated sites by contrast mact standard or very stringent cap would require reductions at all plants and would therefore be expected to improve conditions at hot spots epas analysis of the capandtrade rule has addressed this issue55 in the preamble to the proposed rule it noted that all states would remain free to establish more stringent controls to address local healthbased concerns separate from the 50 environmental defense out of

visited january 11 2006 see especially pp 5659 55 mercury proposal 69 federal register 47024703 crs16 mercury capandtrade program requirements but it went on to state that the agency does not anticipate hot spots for two reasons first epas modeling suggests that larger coalfired units which have the highest local deposition footprints are likely to control emissions more than required and sell excess allowances achieved through overcompliance to smaller units second mercury emissions come in several forms the most difficult to control is elemental mercury according to the agency and it is the most likely to be transported long distances from the generating units thus if plants focus on the more easily controlled forms of mercury they will control mercury that would more likely be deposited locally finally the agency raised the possibility that it could adjust the trading program to favor controls at units in sensitive areas56 effects on eastern and western coal whether imposition of controls on mercury will affect the total amount andor the types of coal consumed at the nations power plants has been an important issue in the debate over power plant mercury controls the united mine workers of america for example were critical of epas proposed mact on the grounds that the standards could be met by majority of western subbituminous coals without the need for any emission control technologies whereas eastern bituminous coals representing roughly onehalf of domestic coal production would have needed to meet an average emission removal rate of 7557 the proposed mact rules costs and reductions in emissions came almost entirely from controls on bituminous units according to epa table 5 estimated changes in coal use from imposition of the mercury hg capandtrade

mercury from bituminous coal would generate one allowance under the capandtrade mercury rule whereas equivalent reductions from subbituminous coal will generate 125 allowances reductions from lignitepowered facilities will generate 3 allowances per ounce the agencys rationale is that it is more difficult to remove mercury from lignite and subbituminous coal emissions58 even with this allowance scheme epa projects greater growth in use of eastern and interior versus western coal under the rules as shown in table 5 epa projects 20 growth in utility coal use overall between 2003 and 2020 with imposition of the cair and mercury rules about 5 less than would have occurred without the regulations by region59 interior coal use is projected to grow 66 appalachian 20 and western 9 under the cair and mercury rules according to epa60 the regulatory process the utility mercury rule is among the most controversial rules in epas 35year history not only because of its substance but also because of claimed irregularities in the regulatory process shortly after the proposed rule was published early in 2004 the clean air task force bostonbased environmental group reported that significant portions of the proposal had been copied verbatim from memos written by latham watkins law firm representing electric utilities both jeffery holmstead the epa assistant administrator for air and his chief counsel bill wehrum had worked at latham watkins before joining epa in 2001 holmstead reportedly stated that he was unaware how the memos had found their way into the regulatory proposal61 both the epa inspector general ig and the government accountability office gao have released reports critical of the regulatory process the igs report concluded that the development of the rule was not consistent with expected and 58 epas rationale is discussed in us epa standards of performance for new and existing stationary sources electric utility steam generating units final rule preamble available at httpwwwepagovttnatwutilitycamr_final_preamblepdf pp 8487 59 the integrated planning model which epa uses to assess the impact of proposed regulations on utilities and the coal

indiana and western kentucky and western principally the rocky mountain states and north dakota including the powder river basin 60 in the base case without cair or the mercury rule epa projected that interior coal use would grow by 28 appalachian 9 and western 36 in sensitivity analysis epa notes that does energy information administration eia assumes higher electricity growth rate and bigger differential between natural gas and coal prices than does epa with eias assumptions total coal use by utilities would grow to 1371 million tons in 2020 even with the cair and mercury regulations each

of the process used to establish the proposed mercury mact limits point rendered moot by epas choice of the capandtrade option63 gao was critical of the analysis underlying both the mact and capandtrade proposals for example gao found that epa did not document some of its analysis or adhere to the principles of full disclosure and transparency as directed by omb and it did not provide decision makers or the public with consistent information on how changes in the proposed level of control would affect its estimates of net economic benefits for each option64 as noted above the agency did not consider in its costbenefit analysis two studies that would have indicated direct benefits of mercury control as much as three orders of magnitude above those it used in determining that more stringent standards were unnecessary one of the unused studies was funded by the agency an agency staffer was one of its principal authors and other epa staff had peerreviewed it65 62 office

httpwwwepagovoigearthreports2005200502032005p00003gcopy pdf fuller description of these conclusions is found on pp 2736 of the report 63 for example the ig report stated evidence indicates that epa senior management instructed epa staff to develop maximum achievable control technology mact standard for mercury that would result in national emissions of 34 tons annually instead of basing the standard on an unbiased determination of what the top performing units were achieving in practice the standard likely underestimates the average amount of mercury emissions reductions achieved by the

congress66 although epa has now finalized standards for electric utility mercury emissions under section 111 the administration has also proposed that congress amend the clean air act by passing multipollutant legislation for utilities the clear skies bill version of clear skies introduced by senator inhofe s 131 would establish nationwide capandtrade programs for so2 nox and mercury similar to those established by the cair and mercury rules in addition it would eliminate or suspend more than half dozen specific regulatory programs for electric power plants including new source review prevention of significant deterioration new source performance standards the nox sip call67 nonattainment area requirements best available retrofit technology and any mercury mact the administration states that many of these rules would prove redundant under multipollutant capandtrade regime and that eliminating or suspending them would create more efficient regulatory structure for discussion of the ways in which clear skies would change the clean air act see crs report rl32782 clear skies and the clean air act whats the difference by larry parker and james mccarthy other multipollutant or mercury bills also have been introduced most other legislation would reduce mercury emissions more and faster than clear skies68 senator jeffords s 150 for example would reduce utility mercury emissions to total of 5 tons ie about 90 by 2010 representative waxmans hr 1451 would set comparable requirements reduction of at least 90 from 1999 levels by 2010 senator leahys s 730 also envisions 90 reduction under the jeffords waxman and leahy bills there would be allowance trading or banking programs for mercury two other bills remain under discussion senator carpers s 843 from the 108th congress and its 109th congress house counterpart representative basss hr 1873 present middle ground between clear skies and the jeffords waxman and leahy bills like clear skies the carperbass bill would establish tradeable allowance program to ease compliance but it would also establish caps at individual units and would mandate sharper reductions sooner than clear skies an 80 reduction in mercury emissions by 2013 66 this report focuses on mercury emissions to the air and on legislation to address such emissions congress is also considering legislation to reduce the amount of mercury in products and waste streams for information on mercury in products and wastes including congressional and state actions on the subject see crs report rl31908 mercury in products and waste legislative and regulatory activities to control mercury by linda g luther 67 the nox sip call refers to regulations under which state implementation plans in 22 eastern states and the district of columbia must be revised to control nox emissions in order to improve ozone air quality in downwind states 68 an exception is representative sweeneys hr 227 under which the clean air acts existing provisions for mercury are essentially restated with epa to promulgate regulations for utility mercury emissions by march 15 2005 crs20 conclusion high concentrations of mercury in aquatic environments and the resulting advisories to limit consumption of fish in order to protect human health have focused attention on the role of mercury emissions from variety of industrial sources among these coalfired power plants are the largest accounting for 42 of total us emissions and they are the last major category of emission sources for which epa has considered regulations under consent agreement epa agreed to propose regulations controlling mercury emissions from this category by december 15 2003 with promulgation by march 15 2005 in meeting this commitment epa promulgated capandtrade regulations rather than the maximum achievable control technology regulations it had previously found to be appropriate and necessary in doing so it revised its earlier finding step that 16 states have sued epa to overturn the switch from mact to capandtrade means that the control technologies installed will be primarily scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction controls designed to reduce emissions of so2 and nox to meet caps on those emissions under simultaneously promulgated rule the cair rule mercury will be reduced as co benefit of this other rule during the next decade epa estimates that only 1 of electric generating units would be likely to install pollution control equipment specifically designed to capture mercury under these regulations the mercury capandtrade regulations are highly controversial read literally they offer reduction of 70 in mercury emissions by 2018 but the agencys accompanying analysis indicates that due to emissions banking and trading the full 70 reduction might not be achieved until 2030 the agency projects actual mercury reductions of 35 by 2010 and about 50 by 2020 many observers contend that epas estimates of the benefits of mercury control are understated in its final analysis the agency did not include two peerreviewed studies one of which it funded that concluded that annual benefits of mercury control were as high as 13 billion or 52 billion at least on paper in order to select the capandtrade mercury control option epa passed over mact option that offered higher benefits for essentially the same cost in large part because of rapidly improving technology the agencys supporting documentation relies on estimates of mercury control costs that are 4 to 20 times higher than current projections by pollution control industry sources the agency disputes information suggesting that specific control technology is available now arguing that it will not be available until after 2010 epa states that the mercury to which americans are exposed primarily in fish consumption comes overwhelmingly from nonus sources from its perspective more flexible capandtrade approach has economic advantages allowing utilities to maximize the cobenefits of controlling several pollutants simultaneously in the rule it proposed year earlier however the agency found that more stringent more quickly applied limits using maximum achievable control crs21 technology would also deliver cobenefits which would outweigh the costs of compliance by an order of magnitude as promulgated the utility mercury rule may raise equity concerns other combustion sources municipal waste combustors and medical waste incinerators have been required to reduce mercury emissions more than 90 under existing clean air act authority with considerably shorter deadlines than those in the capandtrade regulation for utilities since similar technologies could be applied to coalfired power plants critics argue that different standards are being applied to different sources of the same pollutant the agency has offered explanation for its less stringent approach to the regulation of mercury from utility sources other than its general desire to limit costs and provide flexibility69 with the 1990 clean air act amendments congress determined that electric utilities would be treated differently from other sources of hazardous air pollutants before regulation the amendments required that epa report to congress before determining whether regulating utility emissions of these pollutants was appropriate and necessary this special treatment for electric power producers was motivated by number of factors including desire to preserve the use of coal as an energy option for both economic and energy security reasons whether these concerns justify the agencys approach to the utility sectors mercury emissions and the balancing of those concerns against competing health and equity considerations are at the core of the continuing debate over mercury issues 69 section 129 which addresses solid waste combustion controls specifically does mention using section 111 and 111d to control incinerator emissions this would appear to give the agency firmer statutory basis to provide flexibility to waste combustors in meeting mercury reduction targets yet the agency imposed mactlike standards on incinerators and achieved greater than 90 reductions in mercury emissions within three years of promulgation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868
