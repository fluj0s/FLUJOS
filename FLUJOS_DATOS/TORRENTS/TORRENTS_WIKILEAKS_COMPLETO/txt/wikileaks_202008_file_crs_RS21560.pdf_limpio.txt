and against linking worker rights protections to trade promotion vehicles in favor of the linkage are human rights activists who argue that some worker s in developing countries are being denied protections available to us workers and labor rights activists who argue that laborprotections are necessary to help level the playing field against lowwage foreigncompetition against the linkage have been some business interests arguing that worker rights provisions in trade promotion vehicl are disguised fo rm of protectionism congress has responded to these concerns by promoting worker rights in three ways first it has supported the in ternational labor organiza tion ilo united nations organization chartered in 1919 to promote wo rker rights through voluntary compliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560crs2 2 internationally recognized worker rights are included in the 1984 amendments to the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 see also

suasion ilo members are obligated to uphold handful of core labor standards which are listed in table 1 second congress has promoted worker righ ts through us trade laws which tie preferential trade treatment to adherence to internationally recognized worker rights these rights similar to ilo core labor sta ndards but grounded in us labor law are referenced in variety of us statutes primarily those offering trade preferences to countries taking steps to affo rd their workers these rights such statutes and programs include the generalized system of preferences gsp the andean trade preference act atpa and the caribbean basin initiative cbi2 the extent to which ilo and us standards duplicate each other is evidenced in table 1 the combined lists include six rights of which four the right of associa tion right to organize and bargain collectively prohibition of forced labor nd child labor protections are virtually identical ilo core labor standards additi onally include freedom from employ ment discrimination while the us list includes acceptable conditions of work relating to minimum wages maximum hours and occupati onal safety and h ealth protection table 1

ilo and trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 the third way the united states promotes worker rights is through trade agreements which include pledges to uphold both ilo core labor standards and us internationally recognized rights promotion of these righ ts is mandated by trade promotion authority tpa previously known as fasttrack au thority whereby congress agrees to consider trade agreements the president has negotiated on fasttrack basis voting them up or down without amendment nd with limited debate since 1993 four trade agreements the north american free trade

where they have remained in the chile and singapore ftas the basic labor provisions have remained consistent through the four trade agreements under them each party country agrees to support ilo core labor standards and internationally recognized worker rights b agrees to effectively enforce its own labor laws in traderelated matters and c retains discretion in allocating enforcement resources nafta singapore and chile ftas also provide for domestic remedies and procedural guarantees the nafta and jordan ftas differ from th chile and singapore ftas in terms of labor provisions subject to dispute panel proceedings sanctions and maximum penalties under nafta only failure to enforce occupational safety and health child labor or minimum wage standards is subject to these remedies4 under jordan violation of any labor provision is subject to any appropriate and commens urate action if the dispute cannot be resolved5 under the chile and singa pore ftas only the sustained failure of party to enforce its own laws in matter affecting trade may be subject to the abovementioned remedies maximum penalties for sanctionable offenses also differ among three of the four trade agreements naftas maximum penalty is 20 million for the first year and failure to pay could result in suspension of nafta benefits to the amount of the monetary enforcement assessment ma ximum penalties under the chile and singapore agreements are 15 million annually with failure to pa as under nafta leading potentially to suspension of benefits to the equivalent dollar volume jordan lists maximum singapore and chile ftas labor advisory committee issues the labor advisory committee lac us trade advisory committee of 58 members representing unions from every economic sector evaluated the chile and singapore agreements against nafta and the usjordan fta and came out against them on three points6 first the lac argues that the chile and singapore ftas represent big step backwards from the jordan fta and largely replicate nafta which permits only communication investigation and recomme ndations to resolve most complaints second the lac argues that the chile and singapore ftas will not protect the core rights of workers in any of the countries i nvolved for several reasons first they argue the dispute settlement process may not be used to challenge whether party is striving to meet ilo standards and to not derogate from domestic laws even though failure in effort may be arguably hard to prove sec ond they argue that either country if it werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560crs4 7 trade act of 2002 pl 107210 august 6 2002 sec 2102b12gtable 2 core labor standards and internationally r ecognized worker rights adopted by chile and singapore core labor standards chile has ratified all core labor standards singapore has ratified one out of two in each of the four categories freedom of association and collective bargaining elimination of forced labor elimination of employment discrimination and abolition of child labor it has denounced convention 105 on forced labor internationally recognized worker rights both chile and singapore have laws covering all five internationally recognized worker rights sources ilo and department of statechallenged for failing to enforce its existing labor laws could simply weaken or eliminate those laws to avoid dispute settlement finally they argue labor enforcement procedures allow parties long timelines fo r consultations and cap the maximum amount of fines and sanctions available at an unacceptably low level finally the lac argues the chile and singapore ftas neither fully meet the negotiating objectives laid out by congre ss for trade agreements nor promote the economic interests of the united states while potentially threatening job loss they argue that the labor enforcement provisions of the singapore and chile ftas are weaker than in the jordan fta because labor and commercial obligations which were treated identically in the jordan fta are treated di fferently from each other in these most recent trade agreements this they argue violates the tpa legislation on dispute settlement as principal negotiating objective7 principal negotiating objectives of the tpa legislation call for trade agreements that treat all complaints eg labor and commercial equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and the availability of equivalent remedies perspective of the ustr and the usitc the us trade representative ustr res ponded to the concerns of the lac citing the larger benefits of more open trade that reducing foreign trade barriers increases economic growth stimulates j ob growth and makes consumer products more affordable the ustr also emphasized that chile and si ngapore already have strong labor rules consistent with ilo core bor standards see table 2 nd that chile amended its labor laws to ensure that its standards meet the benchmarks set out in the fta in addressing specific concerns of the lac the ustr focused on lac charges that the ftas failed to protect core rights of workers in response to lac criticism that chile and singapore might be tempted to roll back their labor laws if their enforcement of them were under challenge the ustr replied that 1 chile had strengthened its labor laws in anticipation of the inclusion of enforceability issues in the fta 2 under the chile and singapore ftas system of labor consultations av ailable for addressing any matter arising under the trade agreement creates forum for discussing any labor disputes and 3 the us department of labor has already embarked on cooperative program with chile to improve the administration of its labor laws and enhance labor justice lac concerns about potential job loss from the ussingapore and us chile ftas are addressed in us international trade commission usitc reports on

small few of the sectoral impacts are estimated to ex ceed onetenth of one percent of sector employment through 2016 this is becau tariffs and trade ba rriers to be removed are generally small and trade with singa pore and chile the united states12th and 36th trading partners accounts for 17 and 03 of total us trade exports and imports combined the larger potential job effect s are with chile where by 2016 net imports of vegetables fruits and nuts could cause us production to decline by 005 to 008 and us production of machinery and equipment to expand by 002 to 005 chile and singapore ftas as potential role models there was much debate when the usjordan fta was being approved about whether it should be role model for other agr eements some argued that the jordan fta should be onetime case because it already d strong worker protections others argued that trade agreements to follow should be further strengthened the us has begun fta negotiations with 1 morocco 2 five nations in central america the central america free trade agreement cafta which includes costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua 3 five nations in the southern african customs union botswana lesotho namibia south frica and swaziland and 4 australia some argue that the chile and singapore ftas which authorize dispute resolutions leading to possible sanctions only if country fails to enforce its own labor laws would be inadequate as template for ftas with cer tain developing countries 1 if the text does not address egregious conditions for wo rkers 2 where countrys laws do not reflect international standards and 3 where there is hi story of nonenforcement andor hostile environment toward the rights of workers others argue that the united states is wo rking closely with number of countries to improve their labor laws and enforcement efforts in anticipation of entering into trade agreements with them however certain veloping countries they point out may lack the funding and resources to adequately enfo rce their laws and might balk at pressure from the united states to overhaul existing legislation or introduce new measures therefore it might be difficult for such countries to agree to trade pact that attempts to go above the chiles ingapore standard conclusion achieving economic growth better jobs nd improved labor sta ndards are some of the goals of modernday trade agreements challenge in further removing barriers to international trade is to balance the objectives to achieve trade and investment opportunities and worker prot ections at the same
