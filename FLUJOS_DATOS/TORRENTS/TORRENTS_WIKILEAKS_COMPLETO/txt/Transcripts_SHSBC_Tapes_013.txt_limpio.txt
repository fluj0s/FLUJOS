subject shsbc 13 seminar question and answer period lecture given on 13 june 1961 thank you this is what this is the 13th ah you see see unlucky for you lucky for born on friday the 13th you know that was awful bad luck for the american psychiatric and the british medical associations what questions do we have today now i know how bright you are by the number of questions that you find out gee thats pretty stupid suzie what are we going to do about this yes female voice ron this is for very late in routine 3 say terminal has reached the point where it longer reacts at all on the primary scale mm female voice is your next step then just to take it and methodically check off everything on the secondary scale before declaring that terminal flat flat flat and assessing for new terminal well youve got now very advanced case of something or other there are several things that are conditional to this the question is what do you do late in case about terminal who longer reacts on the primary scale well we used to just find another terminal that was the first answer that was given to this thingjust find another terminal for that goal and couldnt find another terminal for the goal why find another goal do another goals assessment and youre in trouble right about that point because your goals assessments keep running out and youll go all the wayyoull find goal youll find terminal and it is all dandy and youve got it all assessed and you find one level on the prehav scale and that is the end of that whole package it just tookjust look at the level and said well what do you know about that and the fellow blows it its quite interesting so your contest actually is not to go into the secondary scale and try to flounder all over the secondary scale and scrape this thing to the bone the thing to do when you longer can getremember you can also get noassessment because of the rudiments being out but your primary scaleno more reaction your case well advancing needle very loose two threedial drop on can squeeze test with your sensitivity at zero got the idea its banging against both pins of the can you know you just cant close it down well then what youd have to do is do new terminal assessment for the goal you were running all right thats fine terminal assessment all by itself may very well wind up that goal the goalll still be live to some slight degree well you go ahead however and try to assess and then assess on the prehav scale and run these terminals for that same goal well eventually you cant get any reaction on the goal you cant get any reaction on any more terminals thats it youve got to do another goals assessment just like you did originally and this goals assessment will usually go fairly rapidly and now it is less critical getting wrong one you can get wrong one now and it isnt going to do anybody any harm you get wrong one in the beginning you can really throw somebody in the soup so that is the way you handle this and its very precise activity actually once your first terminal that youre running can longer assess on the primary prehav scale you do new terminal assessment for the goal you were running if you can assess you carry on as before with the new terminal you finally get that goal totally out of the road you do new goals assessment new terminals assessment new level assessment and now the fun begins because you will start doing new goals assessment new terminals assessment and new level assessment and five commands and thats the end of that level thats the end of all levels thats the end of that terminal thats the end of that goalboom all right now it gets more rapid than this you do goals assessment and you can find terminal for it and the second youve found the terminal you dont any longer get to the prehav scale its now evaporated its gone utterly now you have to keep your rudiments in the only thing thatll fool youif the rudiments go out on you because you see you can null the whole meter because the persons got pt problem his attention is on everything else all right it eventually boils down to where you get the goal and you get the terminal and you cant get it over to the scale the first clear that was made in south africa we were in stitches because the poor girl for two days had been trying to find goals and terminals and get them to the scale she would find them all right and try to get them to the scale or get them run or get command and theyd just fold up and then shed try this again and then itd fold up and she would do it again and itd fold up and thuuhh and she finally was in panic and she came to the instructors and she said oh my goodness ive just ruined this case yes she had she sure had ruined that case and then after shed kept this up for just few days actually all of sudden the case longer reacted in any way shape or form on an emeter there wasnt anything you could do to this case now thats complete difference from your bottomscale case bottomscale caseyou can hit guy over the head and you get reaction on the emeter but the needle is not floating needle and the sensitivity knob is very high and this case cannot answer questions regarding help or control so know them by these marks now you get it up at the other end and its just floating situation and it goes on and on and theres nothing you can do and you cant get the emeter influenced and that person is clear now you go ahead and stabilize clear by going on and trying to do this you understand its not good enough just to get floating needle at the end of the run you go on trying to find goal trying to find terminal your effort to do so blows up the remaining stuck goals and terminals on the track it isnt that youre conducting fruitless search just cause you cant find it on the emeter and you have to do this for quite while and all of sudden why youre now approaching up to level of theta clear and you get stable mest clear this person wont fall downhill weve got clear right now that is just ruining whole central organization its disgraceful she went down to hasi joburg to help teach course and didnt find any people for it and she found everybody sitting around at their desks not doing very much so she wound up and started giving pe course as well as giving the day course and found out they werent writing anybody any lettersthat she considered this and so she startedafter her pe course apparently in the evening or some such thing however it goes she started catching up on their mail for them heres the thing youve got stuckvalence serenity mixed up with the state of clear and you do have practically until you get to be clear and you say now clear would always be serene and would never be the effect of anything you get the idea youve got the buddhist definition here and man that was wrongendto that was an absolute guarantee of plowing somebody in well now clear doesnt act that way they are rather responsive not reactively responsive in that you say good morning to them and they fly through the roof like aberrated people do but they have another type of response you say well it cant be done and its all too sad and isnt this terrible and youre liable to get almost anything its grim thing to be around one because they are volatile they react to life in other words they are alive and of course as everybody knows thats very dangerous they also however dont get into irrational arguments with you that is whats devastating is that when they say somethings wrong it normally is it isnt that they think it is wrong it normally is thats it so what youre looking at is somebody who is alive and who can react and so forth remember the biggest invalidation that the poor board of directors of the hubbard dianetic research foundationthey had all mocked up as clear as near beerand i got mad at em one day for telling that everybody ought to be run upside down at the end of the corridor or some perfectly valid thing and i got mad and they all went white could hardly see themthe walls were white too they all rushed out and went back to their offices and sat there gloomily and well we thought you must be clear you see so this had invalidated the whole thing ah brother thats not true it wasnt that i was clear but been my experience on the thing person when he approaches sanity reacts very sanely and they react volatilely on the emotional scale theyre not unpredictable theyre very predictable you come in and drag an old dead dog thats been rolled in carrion and throw it in the middle of the rug in the living room youre going to hear about it man theyre not repressed concerning what they think about this activity so youre not making bunch of serene beings you see youre not trying to put somebody at ninety thousand feet up flat on his back looking at the clouds for the rest of his existence and i think probably the reason joburg got allergic to developing clears in the hgc is the clears kept sayingthey got this kind of notion when person gets clear they tell you lets get the show on the road lets get something going lets get something doing around here and lets do this and that and that big stack of papers youve got there theyre probably not very important lets get on to something else here now and so on and the money starts coming in and things start happening and people start getting well and everybody starts getting happy and enjoying life and you just cant have that kind of thing so the way to keep from having that kind of thing of course is to cut back clearing thats the normal answer yes i know im branding an organization on tape thatll go to other organizations but this one needs branding i left it in perfectly marvelous condition ten weeks ago it only took them ten weeks to pull the rug out to get it in state of emergency only theyre unlucky right at the present moment because theyve got clear in their midst horrible so clearing them up dont leave them just because the needle only floats clear them up all the way you audit them as far as you can audit them and after while itll even look foolish to you to audit them theyre exterior they blow by inspection everything is blowing by inspection everything rationalizes by inspection you could keep up this process but after while it is senseless to have the person on meter because the meter hasnt reacted for about ten or fifteen hours of processing dont you see so youd run them without meter but you could keep up the same process and probably arrive at much higher states youd probably arrive at theta clear with this same thing ive just given you see youd probably arrive at ot with the same thing ive just given you there isnt any reason why you really have to shift gears into something else only trouble is after while they cease to have answers to these things because they think of them and they evaporate now there are other processes that you can do now on the final thingim just thinking just off the club here what id finally do to somebody before i actually released them i would read to them probably the whole of the secondary scale from one end to the other still on meter you see and ask them to look over their consideration about these things and youd probably blow the latent and remaining reactive locks all right thats how it is done okay by the way theres something on pertinent to clears i must make remark every once in while when the little red brothers are amongst us they have ball waving their hand over somebody and getting them clear and you get rumors all over the place about how this is occurring now this is occurring all you have to do is spit in somebodys direction or something like that and theyre clear and they have this marvelous new technique what they actually do they have this marvelous new technique that kills somebody or something like that you see hasnt anything to do with the price of fish its very very interesting that this always gets afloat any time the organization is successful and is clearing people you always pick up these instantaneous clear rumors and they are not true and dont fall for them because im telling you i have had cases over the jumps now for man and boy now these fourteen year or better and there is thought processno thought singlebutton processi tell you this advisedlythat will produce clear there is single button nor is there any shot in the arm thatll produce clear the fellow has got to get out of the trap the same way he came in hes got to walk out the labyrinth the same way he walked into the labyrinth which was overwhelming and getting overwhelmed and if you dont over and underif you dont underwhelm him in reverse to all of the overwhelms youve got guy who simply goes into one of these superserene valences and sits on buddhas navel or something and regards his cloud nine you got the idea thats just bunch of balderdash when you think of the amount of overwhumping that has been going on in the last two hundred trillion years it is wonder few people get in the wrong valences particularly since we continue to overwhump valences that are not desirable valences and then we have mechanismhad mechanismto unoverwhelm having overwhelmed got the idea scientology is the first mechanism which does both and that is why it is good and valid and if it didnt do both it wouldnt be valid in other words after youve overwhelmed something the penalty for having overwhelmed or eradicated this badness you see can itself be erased you see how this is so its the first thing that ever did it both ways and when you hear about somebody picking up the magic needle and by giving somebody shot in the arm concerning this and the person went clear as near beer why yawn for will you if there had been such thing im pretty sure i would have found it this is very odd remark for to make but i would have found it in the last fourteen years because there isnt any thought combination or direction of combinations that we havent been into there isnt one left ive even calculated it calculated it totally out how many possible potentials of thought combinations are there the mere fact that flows exist defeats at once single button just the fact that flows exist immediately youve got two buttonsyouve got them doing it to you and you doing it to them theres some kind of wild rumor going on that the phrase this single phrase is clearing people like mad around in england and it runs like thislet see what is it nowwhat would you be pleased to accept oh thats wonderful way to plow somebody in just look at it and the flows gonna stick and ill tell you something it was run to its ragged bottom in 1954 look it up in the records if you dont believe that subject has been covered and covered and recovered and there wasnt anybody clear and as matter of fact one poor little girl from canada was walking aroundshe couldnt enter room without walking around and hitting each wall on the process on practically that exact process you have in this case by the way somebody who has picked up an old record list theyre picking up all these old processes that produce rapid result for few minutes and i can give you lists of them if you want to prove scientology works to somebody by spinning him i can give you long list of how to do this exact phrases one of them is look around here and find something you can go out of arc with this is what the fellows trying to do and all hes got to do is spot this few times and if he just spots it just very few times this is okay hell feel fine he feels marvelous and then of course he walks out and falls on the sidewalk flat on his face because youve said what in the physical universe could you go out of communication with with the connotation of what could you go out of affinity with and what in the physical universe could you consider unreal these oldtime cults like psychiatry universityism any one of these old cults has its button and they are formed up normally on single buttona monomania on single button and if you smoke out what this button is and run reverse process on it you will make that kind of person out of the pc find out what the button is that would bring about soldier just figure it out what would soldier be most monomanic about probably wanting to get out probably wanting to get out of the army or trying to get people out of the army or not destroying anything or whatever it is that you work out finally work it out you get few dozen soldiers and just run each one of them professionals you see and run each one of these things bunch of tests youd finally find common denominator thatd make soldier now all right now fix that up so its nontherapeutic you see so it busts him out of communication with things sticks the flow as single button and run that process and the guy will all of sudden look at you very fixedly and says i think i will go join the army and dont think this hasnt been known on the whole track this is how they got recruits for space opera for the state department for all kinds of places got the idea actually universities run these single buttons on people one of the ways they do it in engineering schools is to continue to tell people that engineers are not wanted anymore that is usually stabilized and standard and the fellow comes up and tries to be better engineer so that hell be one of the few select that are wanted and all these little mechanisms see in the christian church they get you stuck in god by running the line blasphemy thou must not talk to god see you mustnt say anything bad about god you mustnt be in communication with god you mustnt god isnt there you cant talk to him you mustnt communicate with god all right if you set somebody down and say all right get the idea of not communicating with god good get the idea of not communicating with god good get the idea of not communicating with god good get the idea and arc broke him while you were running it and get your rudiments out and have somebody ring him on the phone in the middle of the session and tell him his wife has just left him or something like this in other words get arc breaks and present time problems good and restimulated and go on and run this go out of communication with god go out of communication with god all of sudden the fellow gets starryeyed look on his face he actually could be walked right straight out and join nunnery or whatever it is they join you got the idea in other words you can take the whole track fixations of person and restimulate them selectively and bring about momentary resurgences in certain goals directions and you can do it it can be done so any time we start cleaning people up always somebodys going to step forward and remember one of these oldyou know reactively they get the way they got trapped see and then they decide that if they run that on everybody then theyll all be all right you see just that one thing in other words theyre auditing their own case on somebody else you hear these rumors every time i had to put that in by the way as footnote because its rather unusual to have two continents go crazy at once but it is also equally unusual to not have any continent crazy at one time wing you had question male voice oh yes pertaining to what you said about janes question you remember that list of ultimate processes hm male voice remember that list of ultimate processes yeah outlawed processes right male voice fit them in for please huh male voice fit them in for please well now do i remember the same list these processes are the reverse processes that are nontherapeutic is that male voice please uh female voice the ultimate processes male voice ultimate processes oh the ultimate processes male voice the ultimate processes uh those are ot processes male voice right now you flatten them way after youve done everything ive just talked to you about male voice thats all i wanted to know yeah then youd flatten those make sure you however you had freefloating needle that youd exhausted every ramification of sop goals there was nothing left because only then will those other processes function male voice thank you good okay any more questions yes female voice yeah uh ive been kind of surprised that on sop goals nobody that i know of has had sixth dynamic terminal turn up and get audited on yet certainly theory 67 were sure is pretty correct because of all the good results running stuff like thats right female voice motion and objects and uhhuh female voice things it just is surprising what i was wondering is are they likely to turn up would there be any objection whatsoever if somebodys got box or sphere or something representing the goal and go ahead and run it oh well you want to know why sixth dynamic terminals are turning up on goals assessments well thats just the peculiarities of the game theyre totally allowed for in the assessment nobodys steering them in it but actually youre talking to the person normally as human being and this in itself tends to throw the assessment uh female voice we had woman in south africa had spacecraft thank you thank you i can tell you how this sixth dynamic thing works when the person can longer be beingness they you might say extrovert into and permanently permeate some object or housing or familiar thing around beingness and its just like the fellow gets hanged and he goes and becomes the headsmans blocks or something because that was less painful you know thatshes been overwhelmed or hes been headsman for several lifetimes and all of sudden somebody makes the mistake of hanging him and this isnt right and it upsets him it throws his beingness way out and he ceases to become person and then he goes into an object you could very well have case that you would miss on because it couldnt be assessed with sop goals apparently it just was having an awful time being assessed with sop goals and you go along happily trying to do something for this person and you just cant seem to find terminal well you should inspect your interrogation for terminal as to whether or not it is totally throwing the question into live beingness such as well who would be person who would want to create mathematical scale now what person would want to commit mathematical scale see what person what person and your question might actually be putting nothing but beingness on the line in terms of livingness and it might totally exceed the needs and necessities of the case whereas the case would respond very easily on what would invent mathematical scale you see so you can throw an assessment off of the sixth when it should be on the sixth and id say if nobody is doing that at allnobody ever finds sixth at all i would say theres possibly something awry with the patter which tends to sling it over onto the other dynamics and keep it off the sixth because its very true people make terrific gains terrific gains with sixth dynamic terminals as matter of fact lots and lots of cases run most easily on sixth dynamic terminals for instance i know i myself probably could do something about the beingness of typewriter or something like that when youve poundedjust thinking of it offhand of beingness when youve knocked oh i dont know twenty thirty forty million words through machine why its cinch that now and then you begin to wonder if your ribbons arent unwound you get the idea but just the fact that i would know about it would probably preclude anything very desperate being there you takewell now there was one case in an acc one time in the first fifteen minutes of play this fellow was gonna leave and go back to chicago and he was all very upset and so forth and i grabbed hold of him for fifteen minutes i traced back his last life by the way hed been killed at the battle of jutland on british destroyer and this was over in arizona shows you how far youll run sometimes from battle get to total water to water you know and this boy had been killed on the foredeck of destroyer and in this lifetime had been machinist and the bug of the factoryou know the guy didnt know and what he didnt know was that it wasnt machinery or that sort of thing that was upsetting him it was ships metal and i picked this up whambarn just investigating this kind of havingness thing made him mock up few destroyers and shove them into his body and that was the end of the case the case made terrific case progress afterwards the case was just totally stuck in that incident in other words all right there was case where the resolution of the case depended on the discovery of sixth dynamic terminal but rapidly because he was busy being destroyed another case that was total hangup on the third south african came back to battery fast i remember suzie telling with what disgust that she had finally found this fellows terminal she herself was having little trouble with space opera at the time she was doing this and she told with enormous disgust that shed found this fellows terminal and she said it so disgustedly that i said well all right whats the matter is it the right terminal oh yes its the right terminal well did he refuse to run it oh was he interested in it oh yes yes he was very interested in it well how did it go in the first little period of auditing well it went fine went fine we found his level just easy you know and i said well whats wrong with this terminal well she said its spacecraft i cant imagine anybody having terminal like that auditors response to the pcs terminal very amusing anyway thats the gist of it sixth dynamic terminals will turn up and if you cant find any kind of terminal to fit something or other look inspect your question you know youre saying well who would shoot kings who would shoot kings who who who who who thats maybe what youre using and you probably should ask the question what would shoot king and somebody says gun of course bang there it is theres your terminal terminal is gun yes male voice ron when you have exhausted great number of terminals andi mean goals ratherand run terminals flat for thatfor particular goal on whole big list well say hm male voice now what happens when you have to assess for new goal lets say do they go back over those same goals oh i donti wouldnt waste time on the original list you know most of them but some of them are going to come back male voice well thats what i mean youre going to get some of those goals back male voice mm but id say the fastest way to do it is to go make new goals list id say that was the fastest way to do it rather than to plow through bunch of other stuff but if i was unable to find goals list only then would i go back and dig up the fellows first goals lists and now i would go over this goals list again and see if anything is live now you see id try to do it the easy way and get away with it often enough to have saved time you see which is just make new goals list and so on you realize of course that if at the end of clearing person is blowing by inspection or blowing by repeater technique which is constant repetitive inspectionif fellow is blowing at that end of itdont be so surprised or dont be amazed that it takes long while to do goals assessment what youre doing is running sop goals and comment came the other day from the area thats under curse just nowtheyll probably have plagues there any minutewas that the assoc sec told the d of p well this pc isnt getting many gains or vice versa and the assoc sec says well whats happening with the case and so on and the d of p said well hes just had twelve hours of assessment thats why theres change and the assoc sec said well all right thatthen that explains it please tell what this explains i dont get this you see it just would not explain anything you mean you can assess somebody for twelve hours and get gain on the case at all well thats silly youre actually running the end process of sop goals at the beginning and youre cleaning this case up in all directions so obviously the case is being run in an auditing room he cant tolerate with pt problem with big arc break in an improper assessment with an auditor who is invalidating him and who is doing the other remaining clauses of the auditors code backwards and i would say offhand that would probably account for gain whatsoever in twelve hours of goals assessment but only that would account for it see so they said well that explains it yeah well the devil it does i was talking to you yesterday aboutwatch it now if youre getting gain then the error is gross not little the error is big so it wasnt the goals assessment at all that was the trouble with the case there was something very wild about this case you do get gains along this line if you do goals assessment right every hour of it is auditing if you do joburg right every hour of it is auditing and man you should see those needles loosen up what are you trying to do in the last run youre trying to loosen up the needle bring down the sensitivity knob and straighten up the reading of the tone arm right well the goals assessment does all those things so it must be getting somewhere furthermore it improves profiles and does other things otherwise there is advantage in an assessment but you shouldnt develop the notion that its because its taking you so long to assess that youre not getting anyplace or you shouldnt feel disappointed because your assessment is not getting anyplace yes your assessment is getting someplace all the way if your rudiments are in and if youre doing it by the auditors code in model session you are doing more for the case for every hour of assessment than was done in twentyfive hours just two years ago see thats hour for hour were speeding it up speeding it up speeding it up and its damn good auditing one of the reasons it might prove to be untherapeutic is the person didnt think it was auditing and didnt think it should improve the case and therefore became very careless on how he did it or how he handled the pc ive seen case of that i have case of that yeah where the auditor finally said well it isnt as if were running session and having invalidated lot of the pcs goals and so forth of course the pc practically folded up right in the middle of session hes told that theyre not having session that was when all goals assessment went instantly into model sessionthe history of that okay any other questions all right well i understand that youre making progress i trust i trust now let ask this let ask couple of questions here before we wind up this lecture is there anything you dont know and the other question is any of you think youre totally hung up and making progress of any kind whatsoever any case think its in that kind of condition all right okay good enough we do have some equipment to be installed down the hall here in the old wine vat you look down the hallway youll find the old wine vat and it actually already has its lead door weve had the lead door installed and so forth so if your cases dont make any progress why it isnt the last resort okay thank you very much
