relations leaders from the peoples republic of china prc who long have claimed taiwan as part of china believe that incumbent president chen shuib ians ultimate intention is to declare taiwan independence prc leaders pub licly have stated they woul d pay any price including taking military action to prevent this and in th past they have refu sed to negotiate with the chen administration offi cial american views while fully supportive of democratic processes in taiwan and elsewhere ne vertheless have been tempered by us commitments of military assistance to help taiwan defend itself us officials remain deeply concerned about provocative actions on ither side of the taiwan strait that might conceivably result in us armed conflict with the prc as result us officials throughout the year were seen to attempt to balance support for taiwan with cautions that us support was not unconditionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21770crs2 1 the traditional kmt policy held that there was onl one china that taiwan was part of china and that one day taiwan would retake th mainland and china would be reunifiedthe two major election contenders and their platforms taiwans 2004 presidential nd legislative elections were battles between two political coalitions the panblues and th pangreensso name d because of their respective party colors that remained roughly equal in strength through the year each narrowly won one of the contests illustrating the extent of the political divide within the taiwan electorate the pangreens dpptsu the incumbent president chen shuibian is the leader of the democratic progressive party dpp whic h was formed only in 1987 and is closely identified with advocating taiwan independence chens first election victory in 2000 was historic as he defeated the candi date of the nationalis t party kmt which until then had ruled taiwan for 50 years still chens pangreen coalition comprised of the dpp and the smaller taiwan solidarity union tsu has remained minority in taiwans kmtcontrolled gislative yuan ly throughout chens presidency the ly routinely has blocked or modified chens proposals resulting in political gridlock and making it difficult for him to campaign in 2004 on his record of policy successes chen also had to perform continuing balancing act between the radical base of his party those who avid ly support taiwans i ndependence and the more cautious electorate in taiwan includi ng the kmt who believe that antagonizing the prc is not in taiwans interests chen and his dpp advisors attempted to address this contradiction by proclaiming new taiwan identity and emphasizing maintenance of the status quo which they define as taiwans defacto s overeignty and statehood while this strategy appeared to help chen win second presidential term in march 2004 it did not contribute to dpp victory in legislative elections in december 2004 beijing has objected strongly to dpp policies believing that they are but prelude to an eventual declaration of independence which beijing has stated it will bear any cost to prevent the panblues kmtpfp the opposition panblue coalition was cobbled from various remnants of the kmt after its shattering loss of power in 2000 the pan blues include the remaining kmt party and kmt splinter group the people first party pfp the kmt itself is politically conservative and strongly anticommunist it is credited with engineering taiwans ast ounding economic growth and transformation during its 50year rule on the island bu t the kmts reputation for corruption its growing factionalism and its inability to offer clearer vision for taiwans future in changing world ultimately made it vulnerable to the dpp challenge1 in the march 2004 presidential campaign the pan blue coalition portrayed itself as more responsible steward for taiwans future it criticized the dpps posture toward beijing as unnecessarily confrontational and promised to replace it with policy of engagement the kmt also portrayed chen as insufficien tly attentive to taiwans business community and as man who has difficulty getting th ings done argument s facilitated by the gridlock between the pan bluecontrolled legislature and the dpp executive branch while the kmt coalition platform was not successful in preventing the reelection of dpp president chen it did contribute to an unexpected kmt victory in decembers legislative elections httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21770crs3 2 glenn kessler us cautions taiwan on inde pendence president is warned not to provoke china washington post april 22 2004 3 quote attributed to kmt candi

the elections while campaigning in an openroofed car in his hometown of tainan the president and his running mate annette lu were shot and slightly wounded by one or more assailants still unknown as result of the shooting president chen invoked national security protocol placing 200000 military and police personnel on emergency duty status finally after the polls cl osed taiwans cent ral election commission declared that 337297 of the votes cast were invalid reportedly due to uncertainties about whether polling places had followed consistent standards out of reported total of 1325 million

26 2004 protesters scuffled with police and damaged the commissions hea dquarters in the first of several large rallies held by the opposition the stakes were further raised when spokesman from the prc commenting on the protests publicly wa rned the mainland side will not look on unconcerned should the postelection situa tion in taiwan go out of control5 the referendum failure also on march 20 2004 taiw an held controversial and precedentsetting referendum which posed two questions whether taiwan should acquire more advanced antimi ssile weapons if the prc refu ses to withdraw the missiles it has targeted on taiwan and whether th taiwan government should engage in negotiations with the prc on president ch ens proposed peace and stability framework for crossstrait interactions the

it could set precedent for an islandwide vote on taiwan independence given chens strong support for it its failure to pass was regarded as major defeat for the dpp and strong public rejection of g overnment actions that could threaten the political status quo still the referendum set precedent for future such measures chen has stated that in 2006 he wants to hold re ferendum to revise or replace taiwans constitution election challenges in an attempt to address the election controversy the parties spent weeks negotiating recount which ultimately sust ained the electoral results in addition the kmt opposition filed separate lawsuit before the taiwan high court to nullify the entire election the kmt base d its suit on questions about the credibility of the alleged assassination ttempt on president chen as well as questions about the effect that chens subsequent national emergency declaration may have had on voter turnout on november 4 2004 the high court ruled against the kmt and in favor of upholding the election result the kmt sa id it would appeal on december 30 2004 the high court rejected second kmt wsuit to nullify the election again kmt operatives said the party would appeal legislative elections december 11 2004 dpp and tsu leaders projected that based on the mandate of their presidential victory in march 2004 they would make subs tantial gains in legislative elections on december 11 2004 and win unprecedented legislativ control that would allow them to implement president chens less moderate policies gaining legislative control said chen at campaign rally would allow him to build taiwan into normal complete progressive beautiful and great country6 in addition early in december 2004 chen pledged that after the elections he would replace china with taiwan in the official names of taiwans stateowned enterpri ses embassies and overseas missions many preelection polls and december 11 exit polls suggested that the dpp was correct in its assessments of its legislative elections chances but in what was clearly shock to dpptsu party leaders the opposition kmt retained slight legislative control when the legislature is seated in febr uary 2005 then the opposition kmt coalition will have 114 members and the d pp coalition 101 members with the remaining 10 seats in the 225 member body held by independents dpp moderates blamed the loss on president chens radically proindependent campaign rhetoric and in bow to this criticism chen resigned as dpp part chairman on december 15 20047 observers of taiwans political scene suggest that the electoral re buke by voters will force chen to move to more centrist position for his second and fi nal presidential term some have also suggested that the continuation of divided government in taiwan will mean continued policy gridlock and political infighting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21770crs5 8 the dear colleague letter was initiated by representatives peter deutsch and dana rohrabacher on march 11 2004 9 in response to press question on decembe r 13 2004 us spokesman richard boucher said he would not speculate on how the legislative out come would affect taiw ans approval of us weapons purchasespolicy implications fo r the united states before both sets of taiwan elections u s officials were seen to be especially concerned about the extent nd nature of proindependence rhetoric that flavored the campaigns several issued periodic warnings to taiwan officials to avoid provocative actions and statements that could lead to confrontation with china as result some observers hold that the bush administration may be relieved at the outcome of legislative elections on the assumption that continued kmt legislative control will act as brake on the dpps proindependence as pirations some members of congress support this view seeing expressions of official us caution as muchneeded restraint on taiwan they see current trends in taiwan as risky business that could endanger regional stability and harm us security interests but others in congress maintain that the united states should offer stronger support to the democra tically elected dpp government because to do otherwise is incompatible with american democratic values these congressional views were expressed in march 2004 dear colleague letter expressing support for democratic processes in taiw an and for the democratic ri ghts of the taiwan people8 implications of conti nued divided government as during his first term president chen again will not be able to count on legislative support for his policy initiatives this will be disappointing to americans who support but gratifying to those who oppose president chens policy goals that are judged to push the edge of the envelope on the independence question thes goals include substantial constitutional revision substitution of taiwan for china in official titles continued references to taiwan sovereignty and efforts to join th united nations kmt controlled legislature is more likely to be unsupportive of these dpp goals thus potentially lowering the prospects of confrontation with china but continued divided govern ment in taiwan also means that policy fractiousness and unpredictability may keep taiwan po litics in gridlock for the next four years in seeking to deny credit to the dpp and build momentum for its own party in the 2008 presidential elections kmtcontrolled gislature may be unwilling to support other needed policies initiated by the dpp infrastructure improvements banking sector reforms and other economic pr ograms some fear that lagging us arms purchases by taiwan already sore point in ustai wan relations may c ontinue in such scenario with kmtcontrolled legislati on remaining opposed to passing special 18 billion arms acquisition budget put forward by the dpp for making such purchases9 effects on party politics the december elections so highlighted the fragility of the panblue and pangreen party coalitions prior to the elections former president lee tenghui key adviser and founder of th dpps radical coalition partner publicly criticized the dpp as stupid for estimating that the tsu

loss may fu rther strain relations between the pangreen partners likewise in th panblue camp pfp chairman james soong publicly charged that some good pfp ca ndidates had lost because the kmt had withdrawn support from them11 he questioned the pfps relations with the kmt saying because of our unconditional support for the km t we have lost our identity and almost became marginal party12 soong intimated that long discussed merger between the kmt and pfp expected in february 2005 ma be in jeopardy sentiment that kmt officials quickly dismissed in such an envi ronment us officials may find it harder to predict taiwans policy direction and more difficult to manage ustaiwan relations implications for dpp policies some suggest president chen made key political misstep in assuming that his ma rginal march 2004 victory had given him mandate to pursue more aggressive politi cal agenda according to this group chen missed the message sent by the publics re jection of dppsuppor ted referendum on the march 2004 ballot and he leaned too far in the direction of the more radical element in his political base the legislative election results represented serious rebuke by voters of more confrontational dpp approach these observers say and this message now will force chen to move to more centrist position for his second and final pr esidential term from the us standpoint the dpp loss may give th bush administration more leverage with president chen who some char ge has all but ignored us concerns over taiwans policy direction in recent years some suggest that us officials now can credibly ask how chen can expect american policymakers to support more radical dpp direction when taiwan voters do not appear to support it the white h ouse also may be able to cite the december election outcome to refute congressional arguments that the majority of the taiwan people reject unification with china and support dpp independence aspirations implications for rela tions with beijing early speculation is that beijing now may find less incentive to deal with chen and the dpp or to make concessions to the current government prc officials speaking after the election criticized chen as the source of chaos in asia and claimed that the election results show that the pro independence view is unpopular in taiwan13 should this hardline stance continue prc officials may be able to use the taiwan election outcome to criticize american policymakers who push for taiwans enhanced international status claiming these us officials are out of step with the taiwan polity
