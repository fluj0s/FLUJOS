in december 1963 after prolonged uprising against brita in invol ving over 13000 casualties kenya resisted the marxistleninist ideological tid that swept much of africa in the 1960s and 1970s and maintained fairly st able political system in regi on marred by civil strife and political violence although it was under oneparty rule until 1992 kenya enjoyed relatively open political system for the firs t two decades after independence kenya also had one of the most impressive economic growth rates in africa in december 1991 president daniel arap mo i reluctantly agreed to move to multi party politics eight years after his government amended the constitution to legalize one party rule kenya had been facto onep arty state since 1969 the move came after twoyear antigovernment campaign by opposition groups and persistent pressure by donor countries including the united stat in late december 1992 kenyans voted in record numbers in the countrys first multipa rty election in almost 26 years president moi in power since 1978 defeated opposition ca ndidates by small margin his party the kenya african national union kanu also won majority in the 210seat parliament despite the feat of

of opposition politicians and proopposition journalists by hardline ruling party members dominated the political scene for much of the 1990s wrangling and defection within the opposition parties weakened opponents of the ruling party efforts to bring about reconciliation w ithin the opposition camp did not succeed until recently in the mid1990s the opposition ffered from series of defections by prominent opposition party leaders to the ruling party in addition to the formation of several other small political parties number of factions emerged within the major opposition groups the internal bickering w ithin political parties was not limited to opposition parties the ruling party kanu was also in turmoil in the late 1990s in december 1997 at the height of nsions between the opposition and the ruling party kenya held its second multiparty elec tions president moi was reelected with 40 of the votes cast while his nearest rival mwai kibaki won 31 the ruling party kanu won

some irregularities the results of the elections reflected the wishes of most kenyans th victory by moi was largely due to divisions within the opposition camp and the inability of the opposition to back single candidate against moi it looked as if the opposition would face the same fate in the december 2002 elections when number of opposition lead ers joined the kanu government in the late 1990s and early 2000 the december 2002 elections end of an era the 24year rule of president moi and hi s ruling kanu party came to an abrupt end in december 2002 when coalition of oppositi on parties

stable although president kibaki faces serious economic and political challenges the challenges ahead the 24year rule of president moi kept kenya united but left the east african country in serious economic difficulties and politically frac tious the most immediate political challenge to president kibaki is to keep his narc coalition intact and keep former kanu senior figures from redefectin g number of powerful opposition figures might be tempted to challenge kibaki by denying him majority in the parliament the current minister of works and housing raila odinga of the liberal democratic party who switched parties several times in the past few years wants to become the next prime minister if the new constitution would create such position president kibaki is 71 and questions have been raised about his health he was hos pitalized in january 2003 and is rarely seen in public some observers expect kibaki to step down in 2008 the economy is another challenge it has been stagnant since the mid 1990s with gross domestic product gdp gr owth rate of less than 1 in 2001 unemployment is high and corruption is endemic in 1997 the imf suspend its enhanced structural adjustment program because of corruption and the refusal of the moi government to implement proposed reforms the expecta tions of kenyans after 24years under kanu are likely to increase pressure on the kibaki government to deliver goods and services tackling corruption is seen as major prior ity of the kibaki g overnment despite the potential political and social backlash in dealing with this problem rooting out official corruption may require getting rid of senior members of government and prosecution of former senior government officials another daunting challenge is the hivaids pandemic in kenya where 15

government the kibaki victory has had positive impacts in kenya as well as africa the smooth transfer of power and transparency in the conduct of the elections reaffirmed that democracy can flourish in africa the lessons learned from the kenyan elections are many and could strengthen democracy movements elsewhere in east africa the power of incumbency and the entrenched clout of ruling party did not stop an opposition victory in kenya the elections demonstrated that ethnic divisions can be contained as the coalition of opposition parties showed in kenya if groups are united by single
