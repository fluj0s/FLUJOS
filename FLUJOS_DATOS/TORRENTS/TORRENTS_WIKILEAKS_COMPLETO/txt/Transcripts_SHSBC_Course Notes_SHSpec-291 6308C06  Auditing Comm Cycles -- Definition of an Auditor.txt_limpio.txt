6308c06 shspec291 auditing comm cycles definition of an auditor that mixture which is not shaken stagnates for that reason we have checksheet changes people who ask for changes in organizational structure overlook the fact that the character of this planet and its population makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet it takes incredible stress and planning to get anything done on the backtrack one ia used to operating with ease and swiftness this planet is different this planet was part of federation and passed out of its control due to war etc this federation has been called the markab confederacy this sounds spaceoperaish but if it is true is should be stated whether it is acceptable or not the planets of the confederacy united out of fragments of earlier civilizations over the past 200000 years but it is not native to this galaxy in the past 200000 years mental implanting has been taking place that is not native to earlier track the markabians have the basic problem of how to kill thetan the best way to hide your overts is to give someone amnesia and tell them that something else happened thats what is going on here their ideal is the conformist what they are conforming to is pretty scummy and lowtoned their standard choice citizen is the contented wage slave this leaves the artist the brilliant engineer the manager the criminal and the pervert all persona non grata they are afraid of all these types so they condemn them to perpetual amnesia calling it being dead forever then they ship them here so on this planet we have minimal number of workers and maximal number of artists geniuses managers criminals and perverts how do you make an organization out of these dudes they are all nonconformists therefore the difficulty you get in organizations with these people is alteris this has led to civilization on this planet that is totally different from the civilization that planted it here until recently when current western civilization started to look like the markab confederacy the fact that current western civilization has the same image as the markab confederacy makes this civilization restimulative it makes it look dangerous one of the highest crimes in the markab civilization is error in income tax that makes matters relating to income tax very restimulative here the material of the betweenlives area is contained in what to audit history of man pp 6566 the markabians have not launched big reaction to the fact that their secrets are out probably because they fear that landing in force would restore everyones memory and blow the amnesia people get mad at governments and organizations on this planet because they are really mad at the markabian government almost unbelievable force was used by the markabians to create the amnesia you can easily restimulate peoples amnesia by giving them some data about the markabians it seems very unreal to them as an auditor therefore you are handling the roughest case in the universe to rehabilitate the individual you have to rehabilitate his knowingness charge on the case represents lost knowingness as the case moves up the line you get an odd phenomenon the case remembers more one kind of memory that is restored is picture memory at an advanced state the pc can tell the difference between false and genuine picture he graduates up to simply knowing without depending on pictures up to point of knowing who and where he has been independent of crossproof knowingness is slow to increase but it does rise over the top of that identityknowingness which is still rather general comes detailed knowingness eg knowing how you got here why you are here and other details of the past without pictures that is the restoration of the beingness of the individual it returns gradually bit by bit along this gradient what does it take to bring about such total amnesia total explosion of spaceship in his face twice was enough to be little confusing to lrh it takes far more force than that to destroy someones memory to the point where he would have case the force also has to be combined with trickery scrambling dates giving balanced items etc to keep the thetans memories scrambled the amount of force it took is what the auditor has to get off the case its easier for the auditor and the pc to confront things like unknownness than to confront force but the force must be confronted eg in running ow getting off critical thoughts does nothing for the case theres something done behind it which contains energy and must be gotten off it is the energy contained in done that makes it hard to confront harder to confront than some random think the mission of an auditor is the restoration of persons awareness which includes restoration of his memory his identity what holds it down is force used with trickery thus an individual gets an arc break with force and then becomes the effect of force so you are handling someone who has lots of arc breaks with beings matter energy space time location and form that is pc an auditor has to be somebody who can release this force from the pc ta movement registers relief of force in the reactive mind force is being removed from the case as long as the ta is in motion when force is aberrated by trickery the ta hangs up until the trickery eg wrong dates is handled you dont always have to run process to get the ta moving ie particular curative process if the ta is moving the pc will eventually go ot auditing in the absence of ta motion will never produce an ot if you run the right significance off the case and get ta action you will make an ot quicker but running the right significances without ta wont do it while getting ta alone on anything right or not will eventually give you an ot if might take thousands of hours if you audited person randomly ia motion indicates the blowing off of encysted force as it leaves the case when you run the right significances it speeds up the case because you are running the force off early track and you get extra charge blowing which doesnt all show up on the meter sometimes you will see repetitive blowdown as remote force area blows up the most fundamental method of making ta move is not running process it is the basic definition of an auditor listener it is up to the auditor to permit the pc to blow the mass that has been restimulated by the process which he does by listening his basic job is to listen not to restimulate we can get away with restimulating charge because we can talk to each other the only way to get rid of reactive charge is by communication line that is the only method cf axiom 51 the auditor only gets hit by the charge if he stops it from flowing across the comm line all therapies from time immemorial have consisted of listening but what makes auditing different is the ta action which the auditor produces by restimulating charge and letting the pc blow the restimulated charge the auditor gives the command it crosses the distance and hits the bank square in confrontable aberrated area the bank now causes an effect on the pc the pc now becomes cause as he tells the auditor about it answering the question the pc gains some knowingness when he observes what happens when the command reaches him additionally life is always giving commands to the pc and restimulating all sorts of charge as the pc tells you about his betweensessions activities with or without sincemidruds ta occurs as he gets that restimulation communicated to you this shows that the line from the pc to the auditor is little senior to and more important than the auditors line to the pc in the former line you will find all auditing failures providing any process at all has been run if the case was loused up by auditing we inspect the ta in judging particular process if there was ta on the process the process was ok as far as getting the causedistance effect of the pc to the auditor goes when that line goes out the restimulation flows back to hit the pc where else can it go you see the first symptom of that line going out in the pcs dirty needle the auditor isnt listening he is doing something to shut the pc up the line with the pc at cause may take many times as long as the one from auditor to pc as the pc examines something undoes identification gets force off and gains knowingness the more ta action you get the more positive the pc sounds even in just one auditing cycle ta blowdown accompanies returning knowingness on the part of the pc the names of these main lines in the auditing cycle are the whatsit line from auditor to pc and the itsa line from pc to auditor the tone arm follows pattern it goes up on whatsit possibly the reverse happens on lowta case and it comes down on an itsa high ta shows you restimulated but unresolved charge when charge flows across the comm line it asises and the ta moves down knowing scientology if you were in the galactic confederation now you would be enthroned you could fix up all the messedup ots as long as you could listen in the confederation your pcs wouldnt have all the enforced amnesia you have to get rid of with an earth pc it would be like the difference between auditing an earth case and an ant the progression of events that occur when an itsa line goes out and is not restored is the following 1 dirty needle 2 stuck ta 3 arc break the itsa line is the most fruitful source of bpc charge restimulated and not allowed to flow out there are arc breaky pcs there are only auditors who dont listen the only crime you can commit by letting the pc talk is to do it without getting ta action what about the pc who is just talking motivators well they dont get ta from it besides someone who is just motivating is already in an arc break so you should find the bpc so that the itsa line which is the the same as just talk can get in again so let the pc talk as long as you are getting ta action and longer dont acknowledge just look intelligent and nod if the pc looks brighter at you this is case level 2 see p 414 above for description of this level auditing by the way if the pc is telling you all about the track lower down the case levels you have to direct the pcs attention more
