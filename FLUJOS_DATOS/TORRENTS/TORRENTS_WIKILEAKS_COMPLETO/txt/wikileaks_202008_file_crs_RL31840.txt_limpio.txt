american national government government and finance division congressional budget resolutions motions to instruct conferees summary both the house and the senate have procedures whereby the full bodies may issue instructions to conferees on budget resolutions such instructions usually are issued in the form of motion but in at least one instance the senate adopted simple resolution containing such instructions if motion or resolution instructing conferees is agreed to however the instructions are not binding on the conferees and point of order would lie against the conference report on the ground that the instructions had been violated the practices of the house and senate regarding such motions differ markedly in key respects including in terms of the frequency and number of motions and the prerogative to offer such motions first the house resorts to such motions regularly having considered 18 such motions in 15 of the past 19 years covering fy1991fy2009 the house regularly used such motions in earlier years as well during this period the senate instructed its conferees on only three budget resolutions for fy2000 fy2008 and fy2009 for earlier years the senate precedents only cite one instance when budget resolution conferees were instructed for fy1979 when simple senate resolution was used second with single exception the house has considered only one motion per budget resolution while the senate considered between five and 10 motions each during consideration of the fy2002 fy2008 and fy2009 budget resolutions the house considered multiple motions in connection with the fy2005 budget resolution finally the house regards the motion to instruct conferees strictly as prerogative of the minority party while the senate does not fifteen of the 20 motions considered in the senate were offered by members of the minority but three were offered by the chairman of the senate budget committee and two by other members of the majority in both chambers the content of motion may range from broad statement of policy to position focused more narrowly on one or few issues the nature of budget resolutions ie largely broad statements of fiscal policy nevertheless tends to focus the content of motions to instruct conferees on broader issues motions to instruct conferees are amendable in each chamber during the 19 year period covered in this report one motion was amended in the house for fy1992 and an amendment to one motion in the senate was withdrawn for fy2000 there is clear pattern of acceptance or rejection of such motions in the house eight were agreed to nine were rejected and one was vitiated after consideration in the senate 14 of 20 such motions were successful this report will be updated as developments warrant contents background 1 house and senate

fy1991fy2009 6 table 2 motions to instruct senate conferees on budget resolutions fy2000 fy2008 and fy2009 13 congressional budget resolutions motions to instruct conferees background the congressional budget act of 1974 requires the house and senate to reach agreement on at least one budget resolution each year1 in most years the house and senate initially pass separate versions of budget resolution and then resolve their differences through regular conference procedures but sometimes the differences have been resolved by means of the two chambers formally exchanging amendments when conference procedure is used both the house and the senate have procedures whereby the full bodies may issue instructions to conferees on legislation2 conferees are expected generally to uphold the positions reflected in the legislation that was passed by the chamber they represent motions to instruct the conferees usually urge them to support particular positions taken by their chamber or urge them to oppose particular positions taken by the other chamber at the same time it is understood that conferees must make concessions in order to reach final compromise it is not uncommon therefore for instructions to urge conferees of one chamber to recede to one or more positions of the other chamber if motion or resolution instructing conferees is agreed to the instructions are not binding on the conferees and point of order would lie against the conference report on the ground that the instructions had been violated3 as one scholar has noted conferees may disregard the instructions particularly when they feel the need for room to maneuver or compromise the full house and senate still have an opportunity to accept or reject the conference committee report on the bill and 1 for detailed information regarding the record of experience with budget resolutions see crs report rl30297 congressional budget resolutions selected statistics and information guide by bill heniff jr and justin murray the house and senate have adopted at least one budget resolution every year since 1975 except in 1998 for fy1999 2002 for fy2003 2004 for fy2005 and 2006 for fy2007 2 for

usually are issued in the form of motion but in at least one instance the senate adopted simple resolution containing such instructions house and senate practices the practices of the house and senate regarding motions to instruct budget resolution conferees differ markedly in key respects some of these differences are discussed below in terms of the frequency and number of motions and the prerogative to offer such motions several additional procedural issues also are discussed frequency of motions the house resorts to such motions regularly while the senate uses them only occasionally as table 1 shows the house considered 18 such motions in 15 of the last 19 years covering fy1991fy2009 the table lists another motion for fy2005 that member announced he would offer but the house vitiated the motion before it was considered accordingly it is not reflected in the count the house regularly used such motions in earlier years as well with regard to the four years in which the house did not consider motion to instruct conferees the house and senate did not both appoint conferees in three years for fy1999 fy2003 and fy2007 and did not conclude action on the budget resolution5 in the remaining year in 1990 for fy1991 conference agreement was reached and approved by both chambers in october following lengthy budget summit between the administration and congress during the 19year period the senate instructed its conferees on only three budget resolution for fy2000 fy2008 and fy2009 as discussed in more detail below for earlier years the senate precedents cite only one instance when budget resolution conferees were instructed for fy1979 when simple senate resolution was used6 number of motions the house has considered only one motion per budget resolution except for fy2005 when four different motions were considered with regard to fy2005 three of the motions were rejected and the fourth was vitiated after consideration as indicated previously one member announced his intention to 4 oleszek walter j congressional procedures and the policy process 7th ed cq press washington dc 2007 p 267 5 in the fourth instance in which the house and senate did not complete action on budget resolution conferees reached an agreement in 2003 on the fy2004 budget resolution the house agreed to the conference report but the senate did not consider it 6 the senate adopted sres 562 on september 14 1978 by vote of 6321 the measure instructed the senate conferees on the second budget resolution for fy1979 to insist on the senate position not to add 2 billion for public works spending see the remarks of senator edmund muskie and others in the congressional record of september 13 and 14 1978 at pages 2915729158 and 2939129403 respectively crs3 offer fifth motion to instruct conferees on the budget resolution but that motion was vitiated before it could be considered on the three occasions that the senate considered motions to instruct conferees on budget resolution five such motions were considered with respect to fy2000 five with respect to fy2008 and 10 with respect to fy2009 see table 2 prerogative to offer motion the house regards the motion to instruct conferees strictly as prerogative of the minority party in 13 of the 14 instances identified in table 1 when only one motion was considered the motion was made by the ranking minority member of the house budget committee in the remaining instance the motion was made by another member of the minority party with regard to the fy2005 budget resolution all four of the motions considered were offered by members of the minority party two of them serving on the house budget committee the fifth motion which was not considered by the house also was offered by member of the minority party motion to instruct conferees however is subject to amendments offered by members of the majority party as discussed below fifteen of the 20 motions considered in the senate were offered by members of the minority but three were offered by the chairman of the senate budget committee and two by other members of the majority other procedural issues in both chambers the content of motion may range from broad statement of policy to position focused more narrowly on one or few issues the nature of budget resolutions ie largely broad statements of fiscal policy nevertheless tends to focus the content of motions to instruct conferees on broader issues broadlyworded motion offered by representative john kasich to the fy1994 budget resolution for example instructed the conferees to agree to the highest level of deficit reduction the lowest levels of budget outlays and the lowest level of revenues within the scope on the conference without resorting to higher taxes on social security beneficiaries in similar vein senator judd gregg offered motion to the fy2009 budget resolution that instructed the conferees to reject the revenue levels in both the senatepassed and housepassed budget resolutions both of which assume the largest tax increase in history and include revenue levels consistent with the extension of the tax rates currently in place more narrowly drawn motion offered by representative willis gradison to the fy1990 budget resolution instructed the conferees to agree to senate provision relating to the adoption of joint resolution to amend the us constitution to require balanced budget in the case of the fy2009 budget resolution senator kent conrad offered motion that instructed the conferees to insist that the revenue levels in the resolution include the cost of providing relief from the alternative minimum tax in 2008 while motions to instruct usually are briefly stated they may involve more lengthy and complex instructions motion to instruct conferees on the fy2006 budget resolution offered in the house by representative stephanie herseth for crs4 example contained several components dealing with the medicaid program under the motion the conferees were instructed 1 to recede to the following findings of the senate medicaid provides essential health care and longterm care services to more than 50 million low income children pregnant women parents individuals with disabilities and senior citizens and b medicaid is federal guarantee that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed medical services 2 to strike reconciliation instructions to the committee on energy and commerce and recede to the senate by including language declaring that reconciliation bill shall not be reported that achieves spending reductions that would undermine the role the medicaid program plays as critical component of the health care system of the united states b cap federal medicaid spending or otherwise shift medicaid cost burdens to state or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers or c undermine the federal guarantee of health insurance coverage medicaid provides which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the united states but the entire health care system 3 to recede to the senate on section 310 entitled reserve fund for the bipartisan medicaid commission of the senate amendment and 4 to make adjustments necessary to offset the cost of these instructions without resulting in any increase in the deficit for any fiscal year covered by the resolution7 further motions to instruct conferees are amendable in each chamber during the 19year period covered in this report one motion was amended in the house for fy1992 and an amendment to one motion in the senate was withdrawn for fy2000 in the house motion offered by representative willis gradison the ranking minority member of the house budget committee regarding the fy1992 budget resolution was amended by substitute offered by representative leon panetta the chairman of the house budget committee in the senate senator pete domenici the chairman of the senate budget committee offered an amendment to motion offered by senator edward kennedy but then withdrew it finally the pattern of acceptance or rejection of such motions differs somewhat by chamber8 of the 17 motions decided by vote in the house
