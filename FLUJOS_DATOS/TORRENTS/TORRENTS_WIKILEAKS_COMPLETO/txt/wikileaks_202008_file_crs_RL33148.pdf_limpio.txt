ratification of new or revised treaties in august 2005 the congressionally mandated commission on the review of overseas military facility structure of the united states also known as the overseas basing commission formally reporte d its findings it disagreed with the timing and synchronization of the dod overseas rebasing initiative it also saw the initiative as potentially at odds with st resses on the force from operations in iraq and afghanistan and possibly hampering recruiting and retention the commission questioned whether sufficient interagency coordination had occurred it expressed doubts that the military had enoug h airlift and sealift to ma ke the strategy work and noted that dod had likely underestimated the co st of all aspects associated with the moves dod budgeted 4 billion the co mmission estimated 20 billion dod disagreed with much of the commissions analysis meanwhile some have voiced concern that the dod plan would harm l ongstanding alliance relationships while others questioned dods plans to accommoda the thousands of troops returning to the us critics also argued that the 2005 base realignment and closure brac round which entered into force on novemb er 9 2005 and the quadrennial defense review qdr which is to be complete d in early 2006 should have been finalized before completing the overseas basing plan congress acted on some of

cold war confrontation and in some cases the us presence may now be less welcome in testimony before the senate armed services committee secretary of defense donald rumsfeld listed multiple reasons for reworking the overseas military basing dispositions he argued that the current arrangements were serious ly obsolete oriented to deter and fight the large standing militaries of the warsaw pact in europe rather than the current threats however he gave geographi c specifics on where he viewed the new threats as residing he stated that upda ting the militarys global posture was part of the

governments and enhance cooperation with allies he also indicated that nations that imposed restrictions or conditions on the use of us forces from their territory would be viewed as less satisfactory locations15 he did not specifically cite the countries he saw as sources of friction with respect to the presence of us forces or the conduct of us operations however it was widely assumed he was referring to friction with germany over the invasion of iraq and german restrictions on us training exercises during his june 2005 testimony to the senate armed services military construction subcommittee principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy ryan henry echoed many of secretary rumsfelds themes he noted an increased reliance on prepositioned equipm ent and forces that move to forward operating sites on temporary basis but did not explain the anticipated mix between these forces and permanently stationed forces or what the department would need for airlift and sealift to sustain this approach he also suggested that the new strategy would improve military familie s quality of life because they would experience fewer disruptive overseas moves and the military member would have more predictable deployment schedule however the st rategys reliance on more frequent short deployments which would increase the frequency of family separations would seem to some to contradi ct this assertion16 deputy undersecretary henry also cl aimed linkage with the 2005 brac round and the anticipated quadrennial fense review qdr study study that congress mandates dod to accomplish every four years to allocate missions and guide military procurement17 he did not however address the criticism that the first qdr performed after 911 s hould precede realignment of global basing structure rather than trail it by over year likewise the interaction of impacts from the re basing and from the relocations driven by the 2005 brac process have not been clearly articulated while it is possible that basing arrangements optimized for cold war adversaries may not be itable to counter current thr eats the selection criteria for new base locations ve not been

overseas basing commission commission report findings on august 15 2005 the congressiona lly chartered overseas basing commission released its final report the commission visited with senior military leaders defense analysts and senior offi cials from other government agencies and traveled extensively for site visits while the commission concurred with the need to reshape the structure of us overseas basing in general the report was critical of the dods overseas restructuring process and proposal18 there were several areas in which the commissions repor t concurred with dod it laude d the concept of transforming of the military from cold war structure to meet new requirements it agreed that the shifting of forces in south korea and the return of most army heavy forces from central europe was appropriate it also supporte d the concepts of forward operating sites and cooperative security locations with their reduced pe rsonnel and smaller infrastructure the commission agreed that these arrangements would give more options in crisis and more opportunities to work w ith new allies thus expanding positive us influence however the reports major finding held that the timing and synchronization of the global rebasing initiatives must be rethought19 chairman cornella argued that dod s plan overemphasized purely military perspective and neglected to fully reflect the concerns of all members of the national security interagency community for ex ample state department concerns about opportunities to enhance allian ce relationships through exercises and exchanges and to exert political and diplomatic influence in the regions under review were allegedly given inadequate ttention the commission believed the desire to implement base withdrawals quickly rather than specifi c strategic decisions and coordination seemed to be driving the selections further the report held that the locations were picked based on todays threats rather than long term threat assessment it expressed concern that the plan disregards the politics and values of some of the new potential allies which might not dovetail with us interests20 the report questioned the timing of the moves in environment of fastpaced current military operations the commission expressed concern that the strain of conducting this sweeping series of moves while also conductin g major conflicts in iraq and afghanistan has the potential to th reaten the capability of the force forces would either be preparing to deploy ployed or returning from deployment whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs7 21

trying to reestablish their unit s support structure military personnel and families at new bases further it viewed the pace of the aggressive time line proposed by dod projected as 2006 through 2011 as overly ambitious21 the commission noted that mobility and equipment prepositioning were key to the success of the rebasing strategy howe ver it expressed concern that current and projected strategic airlift and strategic sealift were inadequate for the defense departments concept which relies heav ily on transporting troops to crisis areas rather than permanent forward basing it also held that sufficient prepositioned supply stocks do not now exist most impor tantly it argued that future budget plans for projected sea and airlift procuremen t did not account for the rebasing plans needs22 the report highlighted claims that the rebasing plan would harm the quality of life of volunteer military personnel it noted that the military has insufficient plans to ensure both that require d support facilities at us ba ses gaining personnel are in place for new personnel on arrival and that facilities are preserved at the losing base overseas until the last person is gone th support facilities include commissaries exchanges hospitals and child care cap acity on base and ff base support capability provided by the local and state communitie s such as schools and housing without this support young military families with limited incomes may suffer in areas of spouse employment family health and cost of living the commission also argued that the heightened tempo of temporary overseas rotations that is central to the plan will result in frequent family separations over the course of career that could threaten retention and recruiting the decision to stay in the military is very much family decision and when many child growth milestones are missed or spouse experiences enough home emergencies nd worry while the military member is deployed overseas the decision can tip to separation from the military23 significantly the report contended that the dod might have underestimated the total cost to implement their base realignment process the commissions independent analysis calculated 20 billi on bill for the moves while the dod has only budgeted 4 billion through 2011 the danger is that the services will need to spend from their operations and main tenance budget accounts which should normally be used to buy daytoday materi such as expendabl equipment fuel or ammunition to cover the difference this could result in potential damage to force readiness given the concurrent budget mands caused by combat operations in iraq and afghanistan24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs8 25 commission on review of the overseas military facility basing pp

httpwwwdefenselinkmiltranscripts2005tr200505092701htmlthe commission given all its reserv ations recommended slowing and reordering of the pace of overseas rebasing until that the acquis ition of key capabilities such as mobility and prepositione d supplies required to support the new strategy had occurred it also maintained that better budget support for establishing forces at new locations mai nly back in the us such as funding for the movement of people and equipment and building at these locations is required further preparatory activities were needed for local communities to absorb thousands of new military families such as support for additional schools and roads25 in general the commission held that coherent national strategy did not sufficiently guide the overseas posture revi ew and that formal national debate on the larger scope of american security postcold war should pr ecede further rebasing moves it argued that completion of the 2005 quadrennial defense review the base realignment and closure commission report and the mobility capabilities study26 were key to providing an overall architect ure for updating our overseas posture the commission strongly recommended diligent congressional oversight of this process to ensure cohesive basing strategy27 responses to the commission report the defense department responded to the commissions report upon its release in may 2005 principal deputy undersecret ary for policy ryan henry and acting under secretary of the army ray dubois t with the press and delivered specific counterpoints to many of the reports findings mr henry rebutted the commissions critique of the dod choices fo r strategic dispositions where the commission viewed the dod selections as base d on todays threats he asserted that the concept strove to base the forces in locations that supported flexibility and speed of response to anywhere in an unpredictable environment28 critics may contend however to simply assert that future thr eats are unpredictable sidesteps the challenge of articulating strategic vision which includes projec tion of anticipated threats mr henry also took issue with the commissions argument that dod had not sufficiently coordinated the global posture review across government agencies he cited meetings with the regional combatant commanders that began shortly after the 2001 qdr as well as consultations with th department of state the national security council and 45 briefings to mbers of congress and to committee staffshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs9 he maintained that congress had indicated satisfaction with the amount of oversight consultation to this point he also highlighted visits to the leadership in over 20 foreign countries that could be affected by the relocations while he noted the number of meetings he did not indicate whether the briefings were indepth or ongoing nor the state of progress particular ly regarding the delicate status of forces agreements that guide basing rules with th foreign countries he stated that the global posture review was intended to rve as starting point to feed the 2005 qdr as well as the 2005 brac and the m obility capability study all of which were to be coordinated in parallel therefore it would fall to the qdr to address the timing of lift procurement and other needed equipment acquisition to ensure it supports the integrated global presence nd basing strategy igpbs however since the qdr is intended to be the keystone document outlining dods future strategic vision selecting how the military w ill align its bases befo re determining the strategy they are trying to achieve ra ises questions of appropriate sequence mr dubois disputed the commission reports concerns that dod was shortchanging military families quality of life he res ponded that the rebasing plans decisions were incorporated into the brac analysis he noted that the dod held discussions with the partment of education as well as state governors and leaders of communities that would be vita l partners in supporting returning personnel and dependents he did not however i ndicate if additional impact aid for these communities was planned he also did not address plans to expand infrastructure on or near affected installations he held th at the rebasing would give other payoffs to improve quality of life noting that the number of family permanent changes of station pcss would be fewer thus reducing the turmoil of overseas moves although reducing the number of pcs move s may offer greater stability it assumes that all military bases are of equal desirability in their geographical location and facilities which is often not the case dod also appears to assume the overseas stationing in permanent european bases s uch as germany italy are undesirable to military fa milies which is also often not the case in fact the opportunity to periodically live overseas is for some an advantage of military career mr dubois also did not address however the stress that increased unaccompanied overseas deployments would place on families or th troops deployed at isolated bare bones locations neither official addr essed the potential impact on recruiting or retention finally mr henry downplayed the dispar ity between the defense departments and the commissions cost figures he suggested that the commissions study included costs that other programs in th defense budget covered while dod figures only focused on the additional costs driven specifically by the moves mr dubois also noted that the military would eventu ally accrue savings in operations and maintenance accounts as they drew dow n from maintaining expensive overseas locations yet even if these costs will be covered by other programs in the budget there is indication that the department has proposed an increase for those budget items such as construction ai rlift procurement or sealif t procurement further it is unclear that the compensation the us would get from the new host nations would offset that currently received from establis hed allies commonly countries in which us bases are located provide various fo rms of host nation support this could include basic utility services construction and even cash payments in recognition of the benefit to local economies however many of the new locations such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs10

to allow basing in their countries reaction to the pentagons plan c ontinued to emerge from beyond the commission alliance relationships formed one topic for debate historically european allies have been especially desir ous of keeping significant us presence which they view as supporting european stability and integration security guarantees to other allies have encouraged their support of nonpr oliferation regimes some critics such as philip h gordon at the brookings institution fear that moving forces away from long term allies to basing in nations less likely to restrain us military operations would give the administration more latitude to take unilateral military action in future crises without consultati on thus furt her harming relationships and the us image29 others have reinforced the concern that the moves could erode ties with traditional long term american allies with particular focus centered on the relationship with germany some such as pat towell at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments even suggested that the moves were intended as punishment of germany by th bush administration for its opposition to us operations in iraq30 at the same time it bears recognition that land restrictions and real estate costs for some us allies has led to limitations on training and exercises further prudent us relo cations could reduce frictions with local populations especially in okinawa and south korea advocacy gr oups for military personnel and families echoed the reports warnings regarding the impact of the rebasing strategy on quality of life some like joyce raezer of the national military family association suggested that dods record of preparation for past unit moves showed that services were not ready for families at new locations and that services closed before old locations were empty likewise they fear the strain on civilian in frastructure such as roads schools and housing could cause problems with the relo cations for example as new brigade recently assumed posting at fort drum watertown new york soldiers had to move up to 75 miles away for housing31 such long commutes will strain soldiers on shift work or delay their response in cr isis scarce housing also could harm troops standard of living particularly for families where both adults are active duty members or single parent households it could also drive up rent costs for junior enlisted members and coul d limit civilian spouse employ ment opportunities for example schools in watertown became overc rowded and the single hospital in town lacked capacity for the new patients however other larger communities such as paso texas have expresse d enthusiasm for the job growth and homebuilding surge these moves would prompt32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs11

contention and is critical aspect of qdr linkage with the global posture review with regard to force structure reports indicate that in order to free funds for potential qdr call to increase army and marine forces for the war on terror the navy might drop from 11 to 10 carrier battle groups secretary of defense rumsfeld had proposed this idea as early as september 2004 but it would also seem to cut into the power projection and mobility concepts pivotal to the global rebasing strategy34 the mobility capabilities study was completed at the end of july 2005 and dod has been briefing the

the currently planned program which was shaped before the september 11 2001 attacks is sufficient to support national strategy it argues that additiona l airlifters sealift ships or aerial refueling tankers are need ed and calls for ending purchases of c17 and c130j transports it also requires re taining and modernizing all air force c5 transports which historically have poor availability rate35 the recommendation to end c17 constructi on contradicts recommendations from former us transportation command comma nder general john hardy who called for at least 42 more aircraft36 september 2005 defense scien ce board report also questioned the sufficiency of airlift and tanker capabilities and proposed that dod should keep open the option to acquire additional c 17s given the unpredictable threat and budget environment37 in examining the dod methodology behind the mobility capabilities study the govern ment accountability office also expressed concerns regarding the validity of the modeling and simulation tools used in developing the results38 congressional action congress incorporated its concer ns regarding the global posture review into the fy2006 national defense authorizati

notify congressional defense committees when basing agreements are completed with foreign g overnments one unide ntified congressional staffer expressed concern that the info rmation dod had forwarded

capabilities study congress included authorization for the air force to purchase up to 42 additional c17 airlifters however exercise of that authority is contingent on the dod first conducting reassessment of air lift requirements for national defense this asse ssment must specifically take into account the structure proposed by the igpbs the legislati on tasks dod to submit this assessment with the qdr or up to 45 days after the qdr is delivered to congress if more time is required40 congress also gave direction regarding the stateside infrastructure needs that would arise from returning forces th fy2006 authorization legislation also requires the secretary of defense to consu lt with state and local governments as it develops its global posture implementati on plans regarding infrastructure and support needs driven by personnel returning from overseas basing41 the legislation also included sense of the congress th at the qualityoflife support facilities should be ready at bases gaining pe rsonnel before they arrive and maintained at closing bases until the pers onnel have departed42 lastly the fy2006 authorization incorporated sense of the congress that roads leading to military installations that gain significant numbers of personne l from the igpbs or brac should be designated as defense access roads43 this section also directs the secretary of defense to conduct study of the surface transportation infrastructure around bases affected by brac and the igpbs and its adequacy to support the gains from redeployments that report is due to congress by april 15 200744 international arena there have been several recent positive events that help the implementation of the global posture review to move forward on december 6 2005 secretary of state rice signed an agreement with romanian foreign minister razvan ungureanu to station us forces at the mihail kogalniceanu air base near constanta on the romanian black sea coast us forces would also be able to use the babadag smardan and cincu training ranges the new location would house the eastern european task force with roughly 1500 personnel reports indicate that negotiations for basing in bulgar ia

000 marines at futenma to land to be reclaimed off shore at camp schwab46 other recent international developm ents potentially cast shadows on key assumptions underlying the global posture re view there might be indicators of an international shift in the degree of welcome extended by other countries to basing us forces for example statement by south korean president roh moohyun would seem to place limits on the united states ability to employ forces stationed in korea to missions beyond the peninsula47 in another case kyrgyzstan has demanded 100fold increase from 2 milli on to 200 million in the rent the united states pays for use of manas air base kyrgyz president bakiyev had also been trying to charge the united states an additional 80 million for jet fuel the united states had already paid for this fuel but the payment was allegedly misappropriated by former president akayev the dod has refused this additional charge claiming the corruption is kyrgyz internal problem the kyrgyz government has also begun agitating for compensation for claimed environmen tal damage due to aircraft emergency fuel dumping48 in yet another instance russian officials quickly expressed dismay at the recently concluded us basing agreement with romania russian defense minister ivanov suggested that the move put the future of the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty in doubt and appeared to threaten withdrawal from the treaty the state depa rtment countered that the us agreement was in compliance with cfe and other understandings with russia49 of particular concern to the rebasing plan are recent developments in uzbekistan on july 29 2005 the united stat was formally notified that it had 180 days to leave its air base at karshikhana bad in uzbekistan this base has served as vital hub for missions flown to s upport operations in af ghanistan and was prototypical of the cooperative security locations envisioned in the pentagon re basing plan the last contingent of us troops departed on november 21 2005 ending four years of operations there one reason for this eviction might have been state department pressure on the tashkent government regarding recent

august 29 2005 httpglobalfactivacomrights abuses50 another reason for the eviction might have been encouragement from china and russia who have indicated increasing unease regarding us military activity in the central asia region region seen by the united states as strategically vital to the war on terror commentators contend that russia and particularly china are exploiting the perception of us support for democratic revolutions in georgia and the ukraine as examples of us threat to the power of the areas authoritarian leaders such as president karimov in uzbekistan during the demonstrations that prompted th harsh uzbek government response and attendant us criticism china publicly expressed s upport for karimovs actions furthermore shortly before the united states eviction karimov visited beijing where he garnered 15 billion in contr acts and agreements between china and uzbekistan51 finally the political and security climate in some locations proposed for us forward bases could require disproportionate amount of manpower be dedicated to local security requirements for example while president hamid karzai has signaled desire for permanent us military presence in afghanistan an upsurge of violence killed seven us troops in four day period in august 2005 this increase of attacks also wounded two embassy staffers four years after the defeat of the taliban52 other countries reported to be under consideration for or already hosting us troops confront significant terrorist threats of their own for example the lords resistance army continues to stage brutal attacks in uganda with limited ceasefire having failed at the beginning of the year in turkmenistan country under consideration to host the us for ces removed from uzbekistan government crackdowns on terrorists have led to accusations of major violations of human rights and civil liberties curtailments53 potential oversight issues for congress the overseas basing commission point edly emphasized the importance of congressional oversight of the overseas basi ng realignment process some of the issues congress may wish to consider include the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs16 strategy does the igpbs have ade quate linkage to an overa rching strategic framework agreed upon by all key governme nt parties in the national security strategy process while most may agree that revision of th overseas basing structure left from the cold war is overdue some would argue that developing rebasing strategy without completing the defense departments qu adrennial defense review and achieving buyin across government agencies and with congress is premature these moves may have major impacts across many aspects of us foreign and security policy the lack of overarching strategy and analys is may also be construed by some to miss vital linkages in execution timing and schedule which could lead to implementation pitfalls in the future cost are the defense departments cost projections for the overseas realignment accurate will projected savings outweigh the cost of realignment and associate systems procurement the dod and the overseas basing commission disagree on these points others might also contend that proposing rebasing strategy before completing the 2005 base realignment and closure round and the mobility capabilities study could result in mismatche s of supporting infrastructure or mobility assets the consequence could be sh ift of these unfunded requirements onto the services which are already under pressu re from the cost of ongoing combat operations operational tempo is it feasible to conduct the basing realignment moves given the deployment tempo driven by ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan units returning from combat deployments only to immediately pack up families and relocate can put immense burdens on an already stressed force this burden is exacerbated if the bases receiving new troops lack sufficient supporting infrastructure can the services permanently sustain the long term pace of frequent deployments required by the strategy at some undetermined point members may experience enough degraded quality of life for their families and endure such frequent separations that retention or recruiting begin to suffer diplomacy what will be the effect of the rebasing on the relationship with long term us allies such as germany where drawdow n is proposed lack of presence could find the united states reducing its voice in eu ropean or asian affairs and finding it harder to motivate internati onal coalitions or support when needed have sufficient legal arrangements such as status of forces agreements and overflight rights been negotiated in advance of the arrival of us forces in new host nations the overseas basing commission argued that the preliminary diplomatic legwork had not been fully accomplished do the political climates in the new host nations support us values of democracy and human rights while some nations such as romania have actively sought us pr esence others such as uzbekistan havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33148crs17 ended those arrangements as soon as they begin to annoy or their profitability is the rebasing proposal affected by standi ng treaties to which the us is state party such as the conventional forces in europe treaty early evidence may indicate that dod and the stat department need to furt her examine potential treaty impacts
