antiquities act of 1906 16 usc 431433 has protected valuable sites but also has been contentious president clinton used his authority 22 times to proclaim 19 ne w monuments and to enlarge 3 others see appendix with one exception the monumen ts were designated during president clintons last year in offi ce on the assertion that congress had not acted quickly enough to protect federal land the establishment of national monuments by president clinton raised concerns including the authority of the presid ent to create large monuments impact on development within monuments access to m onuments for recreation and lack of requirement for environmental studies and public input in the monument designation process1 lawsuits challenged several of th monuments on various grounds described below the bush administration examined monument actions of president clinton and the interior department is developing management plan s for doimanaged monuments recent congresses have considered but not enacted bills to restrict the presidentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20902crs2 2 tulare county v bush civ n 002560 dc dc september 2001 affd 306 f 3d 1138 dccir 2002 rehearing banc denied 317 f 3d 227

changes to the antiquities act are neither warranted nor desirable cour ts have supported presidential actions and segments of the public support such protections the antiquities act of 1906 the antiquities act of 1906 authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain his toric landmarks historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest the act does not specify particular procedures for cr eating monuments it was response to concerns over theft and destruction of archaeological sites and wa s designed to provide an expeditious means to protect federal lands and resources congress later limited the presidents authority in wyoming 16 usc 431a and alaska 16 usc 3213 presidents have designated about 120 na tional monuments totaling more than 70 million acres although most of this acreage is longer in monument status congress has abolished some monuments outright and converted many more into other designations for instance grand canyon initially was proclaime d national monument but was converted into nati onal park congress itself has created monuments on federal lands and has modified others presiden t clintons 19 new and 3 enlarged monuments comprise about 59 million federal acres only president franklin delano roosevelt used his authority more often 28 times and only president jimmy carter created more monument acreage 56 million acres in alaska monument issues and controversies various issues regarding presidentiallyc reated monuments have generated both controversy and lawsuits issu have included the size of the areas and types of resources protected the inclusion of nonfederal lands within monum ent boundaries restrictions on land uses that may result the manner in whic h the monuments were created the selection of the managing agency and other legal i ssues courts have upheld both particular monuments and the presidents authority to cr eate them for instance court dismissed challenges to clinton monuments which we re based on improper legation of authority by congress size lack of specificity nonqualifying objects increased likelihood of harm to resources and allege d violations of the national forest management act of 1976 nfma 16 usc 1601 et seq administrative procedur act apa 5 usc 551 et seq and national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq 2 in another case court found that plaintiffs did not allege facts sufficient to support the courts inquiry into whether the president might have acted beyond the authority given him in the antiquities act3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20902crs3 monument size and objects protected critics assert that large monuments violate the antiquities act in that the presidents authority was intended to be narrow and limited the monuments designated by president clinton range in size from 2 acres to 1870800 acres defenders argue that the anti quities act gives the president discretion to determine the acreage necessary to ensure protection of the designated resources while reserving the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected 16 usc 431 cr itics also contend that president clinton used the antiquities act for impermissibly broad purposes such as general conservation and scenic protection supporters counter that the acts wording other objects of historic or scientific interest grants broa d discretion to the president further some claim that the antiquities act is designed to protect only objects that are immediately endangered or threatened but others note that the antiquities act lacks such specific requirement to date the c ourts have upheld the authority of the president on these issues inclusion of n onfederal lands nonfederal lands ar contained within the boundaries of some national monuments some state and private landowners have been concerned that development of such nonfe deral land is or coul d be more difficult because it might be judged incompatible with monument purposes or constrained by management of surrounding federal lands monument supporters note that concerned state and local landowners can pursue land ex changes with the federal government effects on land uses state and local officials and other citizens have been concerned that monument designation can limit or prohibit developm ent on federal lands they argue that local communities are hurt by the loss of jobs and tax revenues that result from prohibiting or restricting future mineral exploration timber velopment or other activities the potential effect of monument designation on energy development has been particularly contentious given the current emphasis on energy production subject to valid existing rights most of the recent proclamations bar new mineral leases mining claims prospecting or exploration activities and oil gas and geothermal leases by withdrawing the lands within the monuments from entry location selection sale leasing or other disposition under the public land laws mining laws and mineral and geothermal leasing laws further the fy2006 interi or environment and related agencies appropriations act pl 10954 continued ban on using funds for energy leasing activities within the boundaries of national monuments as they were on january 20 2001 except where allowed by the presidential pr oclamations that created the monuments mineral activities that would be allowed may have to adhere to higher standard of environmental regulation to ensure compa tibility with the monument designation and purposes others claim that monument s have positive economic impacts including increased tourism recreation and relocation of bus inesses in those ar eas some maintain that development is insufficiently limite d because recent monument proclamations typically have preser ved valid existing rights for particular uses such as mineral development and continued certain activities such as grazing some recreation groups and other citizens have opposed restrictions on recreation such as hunting and offroad vehicle use pr oclamations typically have restricted some such activities to protect monument resources and additional rest rictions are being considered for management plans in development httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20902crs4 4 the provision in flpma is likely to be an unconstitutional legislative veto under ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 because it authorizes th termination of an executive action other than by act of congress however there have been rulings on this particular provisionconsistency of antiquities act with nepa and flpma critics of the antiquities act argue that its use is inconsistent with the intent of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma 43 usc 1701 et seq to restore land withdrawal policy to congress withdraw restricts the use or disposition of public lands eg for mineral leasing in enacting flpma congress repealed much of the presidents withdrawal authority and limited the ability of the secretary of the interior to make land withdrawals it required congre ssional review of secretarial withdrawals exceeding 5000 acres4 and contains notice and hearin g procedures for withdrawals supporters note that in enacting flpma congress did not repeal or amend the antiquities act and thus desired to retain presidential withdrawal authority critics of the antiquities act so assert that there has been insufficient public input and environmental studies on pr esidentiallycreated monuments and favor amending the antiquities act to require public and scientific i nput similar to that required under nepa flpma and other laws others counter th at such changes would impair the ability of the president to act quickly and could result in resource impairment or additional expense they assert that presidents typically consult in practice and that nepa applies only to proposed actions that might harm the environment and not to protective measures monument management whereas previously the national park service nps had managed most monuments president clinton selected the bureau of land management blm and other agencies to manage many of the new monuments some critics have expressed concern that the blm lacks sufficient expertise or dedication to land conservation to manage monuments president clinton chose blm where its own lands were involved to increase the agency s emphasis on land protection and possibly both to protect the lands and manage them for multiple uses mineral development timber harvesting and hunting are the principa l uses that would be legally compatible with blm management but not with management by the nps grazing also typically is allowed on blm lands but of ten precluded on nps lands other legal issues the property clause of the constitution article iv sec 3 cl 2 gives congress the authority to dis pose of and make needed rules and regulations regarding property belonging to the united states some have asserted that the antiquities act is an unconstitu tionally broad delega tion of congress power because the presidents authority to create monuments is essentially limitless ce all federal land has some historic or scientific value court dismissed suit raising this issue and this holding was affirmed on appeal see note 2 the recent monument designations renewe d discussion of whether president can modify or eliminate presidentiallycreated national monument while it appears that president can modify monument it has not been established that the president like congress has the authority to revoke pr esidential monument designation for more information see crs report rs20647 administrative and legislative activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20902crs5 administrative action the bush administration examined the monument actions of president clinton including whethe r to exclude private state or other non federal lands from the boundaries of newly created monuments there has been comprehensive administration effort to redesignate the monuments with altered boundaries while the monument designation does not apply to these nonfederal lands most of president clintons monument procla mations stated that they will become part of the monument if the federal government acquires title to the lands from the current owners also the interior department continue s to develop management plans for new monuments within its jurisdiction further president bush reestablished one monument the governors island national monumen t in new york on february 7 2003 legislative action legislation to amend th antiquities act of 1906 has not been introduced thus far in the 109th congress but was considered in recent congresses for instance hr 2386 of the 108th congress sought to amend the antiquities act to make presidential designati ons of monuments exceeding 50000 acres ineffective unless approved by congress within two years th measure also would have established process for public input into presidential monument designations and required monument management plans to be developed in accordance with the national environmental policy act of 1969 other legislation in recent c ongresses has sought to alter particular monuments for instance to exclude pr ivate land from within their boundaries appendix
