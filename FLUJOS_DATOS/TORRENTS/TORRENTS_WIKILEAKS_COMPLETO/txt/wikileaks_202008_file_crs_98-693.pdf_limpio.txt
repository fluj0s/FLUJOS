in the us trade deficit and th economic theory and policies surrounding it after dropping to 74 billion in 1991 the us merchandise trade deficit increased by 49 billion in 1998 to record high of 248 billion even though the reasons for the rising deficit seem apparent it raises questions about the theoretical analysis th at underlies us policies to deal with it and its sustainability and effect on the us economy the federal trade deficit review commission was org anized on june 10 1999 and is responsible for developing trade policy recommendations by examining th economic trade tax and investment policies and laws and other incentives an d restrictions that are relevant to addressing the causes and consequences of the us merchandise and current account deficits economic theory is evolving with respect to the international trade side of the us economy and the relevant policy implications the standard macroeconomi c approach to explaining the trade deficit is encountering some obstacles first th savings and investment equality is an ex post identity framework for analysis and not behavioral equation second the linkage between macroeconomic conditions and nations exc hange rate has not been established exchange rate changes do not translate completely into price changes for imports and exports and exchange rates tend to overshoot the equilibrium rates this brings other inefficiencies into n economy government policy may also affect exchange rates recent weakness in the japanese yen for example h as been exacerbated by japanese government policy the united states does not seem to have transparent method of determining if and when it should intervene in currency markets third is sue is that focus on the savingsinvestment relationship in th economy can lead to dubious policy prescriptions such as the assertion in th 1980s that eliminating the federal budget deficit would do the same for the trad deficit fourth pr oblem is that static macroeconomic approach does not account for why the united states may be borrowing from abroad and how those funds are being used there may be an op timal level for nations current account deficit and borrowing may be justified if it is used to increase productivity recent us trad data indicate that rising share of us imports has been for capital goods that should raise us productivity and economic growth the policy implications with respect to trade still center on the belief that free trade is optimal but extensions of the theory now allow for strategic trade policy aimed at assisting certain industries the conventional economic conclusion that all intervention into trade flows has effect on the trade deficit however is yet to be demonstrated empirically in terms of sustainab ility if the recent large capital inflows reaching nearly 200 billion per year continue into the next century us foreig n debt would develop equivalent to quarter of gdp and foreigners may end u p owning more than half the us federal debt if the capital inflows do not continue the us trade and current account deficits of today will be unsustainablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693contents recent trends in the us trade

balanceofpayments basis i n 1998 this surge in the us trade deficit can be explained primarily by the stron g us economy which is buying m ore of almost everything including imports the asian financial crisis which has reduced us exports to asian countries and lowered prices of asian exports to the us and inflows of capital which drive up the value of the dollar and mak imports into the united states cheaper and american exports more expensive even though the reasons fo r the rising deficit are apparent it raises questions about the longterm implications of this imbalance the economic analysis that underlies us policies to deal with it and its sustainability in concert with the rising us trade deficit the exchange value of the dollar has been rising parti cularly with respect to the currencies of asian countries except for china and hong kong the strength of the dollar in the late 1990s bears strong resemblance to the strong dollar in the first half of the 1980s this was the period when the us trade deficit grew by six times in 1998 the dollar gained so much strength with respect to the yen that on june 17 1998 both the united states an d japan intervened in

imports from asia also are lower because of their weakened currencies in terms of the us current account which includes trade in merchandise and services investment income and unilateral transfers the

although there is economic reason that bilateral trade with any particula r trading partner should be in balance the chronic us deficit with japan and the rising imbalance with china have attracted criticism raised political tensions and hav induced calls for changes in us trade policy trade barriers and market opening measures moreover clearly aff ect trade with individual nations the continual trade deficit with ja pan combined with that nations weakyen policy and capital outflows from japanese financial deregulation along with trade barriers in china have arguably contributed to the rising us trade deficit6 trade theory and policy international trade theory takes two basic tracks in analyzing aggregate trad flows the first harkens back to the theory of comparative advantage along wit h neoclassical economics and the second focuses on the macroeconomic foundation s of trade flows although the theory of comparative advantage and neoclassica l economic theory do not focus on the trade deficit per we discuss this briefly i n order to provide picture of how various aspects of trade theory and policy ar evolving the theory of comparative advantage and traditional trade policy analysi s conclude that under certain idealized conditions country maximizes its wellbeing by specializing in producing those goods and services in which it has comparative advantag and importing those in which other nations have advantage the polic implication of the comparative advantage argument is that barriers to trade reduc national welfare and free trade brings optimal benefits for the economy as whole import competition may hurt some domestic competitors and impose som adjustment costs on certain actors in the economy but in the long run free trad tends to lower prices and provide benefits to consumers that should offset th negative effects on industries that are hurt for the economy as whole therefore national wellbeing is increas ed it is up to the political system to determine whether income is then transferred to the industries that are hurt according to this analysis protectionism is self defeating it benefits certain trade interests but at cost to the rest of society criticism of this model for trade policy based on comparative advantage an d traditional trade theory comes both from some policymakers and theoretica l economists some decisionmakers assert that the policy implication that free tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs6 brander james strategic trade policy in handbook of international economics 7 vol iii edited by g grossman and k rogoff new york else vier science 1995 p 1397 98 1447is always optim is too broadbrushed and unidimensional and does not account for the complexities of the real world adjustment costs from free trade may be too high or in some cases other countries may pursue industrial and trade policies that ar unfair governments may subsidize certain industries maintain trade barriers or allow compa nies to engage in dumping or other unfair trade practices mos t economists contend however that retaliation for trade barriers and protectionis m abroad usually ends up hurting us consumers rather than solving the problem economists acknowledge however that traditional trade models do not describe or predict accurately trade flows in the real world particularly in terms f manufactured products the models either ignore or pr ovide unsatisfactory treatment of five maj or deviations between the real world and the theoretical models thes include 1 increasing returns to scale larger firms can produce goods at lower per unit cost than smaller firms 2 learningbydoing comparative advantage can b created as economies learn ho w to produce certain products and entry costs are high for latecomers 3 external effects benefits exist from re search and development and technological change that cannot be captured solely by those directly involved plus concentration of industrial processes such as in silicon valley or detroit produces benefits for other firms and society at rge 4 interfirm strategic rivalries in contrast to the pure competition economic model in which all firms are small and produce identical products in the real world the actions of one firm in an industry can affect the operations of others and 5 the existence of abnormal profits or losses by firms for systematic reasons ie for reasons beyond simple randomness or luck which government policies can influence greatly the comparative advantag e7 approach also does not account for trade barriers exchange rate manipulation r business subsidies by individual countries that may alt er the competitiveness of certain firms large body of economic literature has been developed to st udy these deviations from the pu re theory of international trade this literature is summarized in the handbook of international economics edited by g grossman and k rogoff an important conclusion of this literature is that interna tional trade theory is evolving and some cherished axioms are being abandoned the pure theory is not repudiated rather it is being extended the critical question is whet her or not the above problems with the pure theory are significant enough to invalidate the analysis so far mos t economists retain their support of the position that as rule of thumb free trade i s most beneficial but acknowledge that in certain industries the deviations between the model and the real world are significant enough to alter the standard polic prescriptions complete review of the literature on how trade theory and policy are evolving is beyond the purview of this paper here we examine two areas in which deviations from the standard model bring new insights into real policymaking they are intra industry trade and strategic tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs7 intraindustry trade the theory of comparative advantage goes long way in explaining why on country specializes in produ cing one product which it then trades for another saudi arabia for example trades petroleum for aircraft what the theory of comparative advantage does not xplain however is why europe buys aircraft automobiles and machine tools from the united states while the unite d states buys the same products from europe this is intra industry trade or trade in products within the sam industry eg american jeeps fo r german bmws and contrasts with inter industry trade which is trade between countries for products of different industries eg american power generators for chinesemade shoes intraindustry trade arises partly because of economies of scale in production the average cost of manufactured products tends to fall as the units produce d increase i f one country tries to produce the full variety of products that consumers demand it will be able to do so only at relatively high costs companies often need extensive production runs to be competitive with respect to price they produc large quantities of certain produc t lines for sale in both domestic and export markets but they are not able to produce eac h type of the product intellectual property rights also come into play the conclusion of traditional comparative advantage analysis that for example europe could pro duce all highfashion goods the united states all automobil and japan all consumer electronics makes way for more comple x system of intraindustry trade in which all three economies produce and trade wit h each other for all three products this is the twoway trade of products within th same industry and it counters the idea that cou ntries should abandon entire industries that may appear uncompetitive at some time this intraindustry analysis may provide for example framework to analyze whether governmentbacked loan to comp any ie the chrysler corporation in the 1970s is economically efficient this extension of trade theory however does not address the size of the us trade deficit strategic trade theory another response to the criticisms of the traditional approach to trade has been to develop theory of strategic trade in which governments play role in fostering the develo pment of strategic industries and pursue trade policies that condition r alter strategic relationships among firms the primary strategic relationship in which government intervention might be justified is in terdependence the profits of one firm are directly affected by the individual strategy choices of other firms in economi c models one way to account for this interdependence is to introduce oligopolie s industries dominated b few firms producing differentiated products or imperfect competition into trade policy analysis the appeal of this approach is that it allows trade theory to address some of the practical concerns that dominate the politica l debate over actual trade policy the policy implications of the strategic trade approach tend to justif government intervention in favor of strategic industries intervention might include subsidies for research and development military contracts to develop dualus ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs8 ibid p 144614478technology or export support for commercial aircraft the strategic approach also helps to u nderstand how apparently modest government intervention can have large effects if comparatively small subsidy determines whether foreign or domestic firm enters an industry in which there are significant learning requirements an d economies of largescale production sizable longrun impact can arise if th domestic industry eventually becomes viable the approach also helps explain how trade and industrial policies have had major role in influencing the curren t international pattern of specialization and trade it further provides theoretica l rationale for deviating from the policy of free trade 8 strategic trade policy prescriptions however pose problems f their own many economists still are not convinced that the ri sks involved in implementing them justify the deviation from free trade selecting strategic industry is difficult in political system in which traditional industries such as steel automobiles petroleum an d textiles have major in fluence on national economic policy true strategic industry may be small and not represented well in po litical power centers strategic trade also can be used as rationale for protection of industries that may be strategic primarily in terms of size or political clout but not with respect to th economic definition of the term studies of strategic trade also indicate that even nationally successful strategic trade policies have beggarthyneighbor aspect that is one countrys strategi c industries may advance at the expense of those of another this may induce othe r countries to retaliate and attempt to neutraliz the gain also countries that compete with each other with strategic trade policies tend to make agreements to ameliorate or prevent such rivalries the united states and other industrialized nations fo r example have multilateral trade agreements curbing excessive use of subsidies an d other government assistance to industries strategic trade policies moreover are not aimed directly at the us trad deficit whether deficit exists or not does not change the rationale for strategic trade policy macroeconomic theory macroeconomics deals primarily with aggregate flows in an economy it i s largely separate from considerations of comparative advantage or the actions f particul ar microeconomic actors such as business production or consumer choice it is in macroeconomics that the proble m of the level of the trade deficit is addressed the macroeconomic interpretation of trade and current account deficits is that they are caused by an imbalance in domestic saving and investment

equals the savings investment shortfall plus the budget deficit krugma n paul country is not company harvard business review v 7410 januaryfebruary 1996 p 4051 krugman assumes the economy is at full employmentinvestments or ficit spending this implies that the relative level of trade flows is9 determined outside of specific trade policies that are aimed at imports or exports including strategi c trade policy trade policies may change particular product flows but are unlikely to change their aggregate level according to macroeconomic theory for example policy to restrict imports of steel may cause foreign steel inflows to decline but the overall balance of trad would not cha nge an import barrier causing fall in us imports of steel woul d have two major effects exchange rate appreciation and multiplier effect on th domestic economy decline in steel imports would first push up the value of th dollar as fewer japanese yen korean won and other fore ign currencies were required to buy foreign steel this dollar appreciation would make imports into the unite d states relatively cheaper and us exports more expensive for foreign buyers th second effect would be domestic demand stimulus as steel consumers bought less steel from abroad and m ore from local producers this would be multiplied through the domestic economy raising incomes and economic activity higher economi c activity would induce more imports the combination of these two effects woul d eventually bring international trade flows back to t he previous level determined by the balance of savings and investment the same l ogic applies to export promotion or even an increase in exports that may occur for any of variety of reasons paul krugman one of the foremos t international trade economists for example states the following consider national economy that finds one of its major export s growing rapidly there will be strong negative feedbacks from th growth of that export to employment and exports in other industries indeed those negativ feedbacks will ordinarily be so strong that they will more or less completely eliminate any impr ovements in overall employment or the trade balance10 the policy implications of macroeconomic approach to the trade deficit therefore is that trade policy measure s have effect on the overall balance of trade although they can influence specific flows of imports or exports or change th distribution of the trade deficit among trading partners or among specific trade d goods according to this approach trade policy may do many thi ngs but it is unlikely to alter the aggregate size of nations trade deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs10 griswold daniel t americas maligned and misunderstood trade deficit cat o11 trade policy analysis 2 april 20 1998 on

variables by dick k nantothis macroeconomic approach to the trade deficit is reflected in polic conclusions such as the following from the cato institute contrary to popular conception the trade deficit is not caused b unfair trade practices abroad or declining industrial competitiveness t home trade deficits reflect the flow of capital across international borders flows that are determined by national rate s of savings and investment this renders trade policy an ineffective tool for reducing nations trad deficit11 in recent years this basic approach to the trade deficit and trade policy has been extended economists have developed new models that attempt to deal with som shortcomings of traditional analysis such as 1 the inability of macroeconomi c models to explain movements in actual data such as the exchange rate 2 th inability of macroeconomic models to indicate when exchange rates are over r undervalued and 3 the static nature of macroeconomic models which do t consider dynamic and intertemporal effects on variables such as productivity an d consumption at dif ferent time periods recently the asian financial crisis has raised the issue of the sustainabili ty of the trade deficit the macroeconomic approach also pays little attention to the time necessary for adjustment the adjustment path r whether the adjustment is partial or complete12 problems with the basic macroeconomic approach the accounting identity underlying the macroeconomic approach to the trad deficit relies heavily on the equality of savin gs and investment the problem with this is that while the savingsinvestment i dentity always holds ex post with an adjustment for errors and omissions of several billion dollars it is less useful in determinin g policy and in forecasting future changes the economic profession agrees that savings investment is an accountin g identity and not behavioral equation the identity captures final result but does not show how to get there it is framework for analysis macroeconomi c relationsh ip that overlays microeconomic world it provides way to sort out the many forces in an ec onomy that affect trade and to highlight relationships that might be difficult to grasp otherwise it also is useful in categorizing the sources of savingsinvestment gap in country the identity however does not show th direction of causality do levels of savings affect trade or do levels of trade affect savings it also does not provide mechanism to show exactly how domesti c savingsinvestment gap determines international capital flows and the trade

policy i s beyond the purview of this report to catch flavor of the debate and the polic y13 implications of it however we will examine three issues that seem pertinent today these are foreign exchange rates the socalled twin defic its and the trade deficit over time exchange rate effects and determ ination exchange rates and the role they play in equilibrating imbalances in trade flows among nations are key t macroecon omic trade analysis exchange rates are like international prices amon g countries they are central part of the mechanism by which macroeconomic flows of goods services and capital are brought into balance in theory by allowin g exchange rates to adjust countries can bring th eir international accounts into balance exchange rates also play key role in linking capital flows to trade flows consider for instance an inflow of capital which is usually considered to cause n offsetting increase in countrys trade deficit how does the process work th standard interpretation is that the capital influx increases demand for country s currency which causes the nations exchange value to appreciate the higher value for the currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive to foreig n buyers the net effect is that imports rise exports decline and the trade defici t increases the inflow of capital if t offset by actions by monetary authorities also may lower interest rates which then stimulates demand for products includin g imports in the real world however exchange rates do not always determine the prices of traded goods and services the problem is that international markets tend to b segmented product may have different domestic prices in different countries the law of one price does not hold in most cases prices for commodities such s14 petroleum and coal tend to be the most similar across countries while prices fo r sophisticated manufactures or for services tend to be the least similar if differen t prices for the same product can be charged in various countries then an exchange rate change will not necessarily induce the expected response in im port and export flows on brandname products in particular the passthrough of exchange rate changes is usually incomplete for example between january 5 1994 and april 19 1995 the japanese ye n appreciated by 34 against the dollar as it ros from 113 to 80 yen per dollar prices for exported products from japan to the united states should have risen significantly but for example the us stick er price of toyota celica st coup rose by only 2 it went from 169 68 to 17285 while

import prices fell by only 4 between 1985 and 1988 the dollar depreciated by 44 while us import prices rose by only 1015 for shipments to the united states economic studies have found that n average an exchange rate change induces price response equal to onehalf th amount although it varies by industry measures of trade barriers moreover tend to play role in explaining the differences in pric across markets an implication16 of this lack of response of domestic prices to exc hange rate changes is that currency depreciation will not necessarily eliminate nations trade deficit although empirical17 studies indicate that for most countries over the long run real depreciatio n adjusting for domestic inflation is likely to improve nations current accoun t balance while real appreciation is likely t worsen it in the shortrun however the opposite is likely to occur 18 for practical purposes the lack of response in flows of imports and exports to an exchange rate change means that the exchange rate will often overshoot th amount of change neces sary to bring trade and capital flows back into balance this introduces more distortions and inefficiencies into the economy an extreme cas would be the situation in indonesia in which its trade gap was not closed despite drop in the value of its currency from 2500 rupiah per dollar in july 1997 to about 14000 per dollar in july 1998 further problem with exchange rates and the macroeconomy is that the lin k between the two still has not been sufficiently quantified if the savingsinvestment relationship determines the trade deficit and one of the mechanisms by which th trade deficit changes in response to macroeconomi c variables is through the exchange rate then economists should be able to establish linkages between exchange rat movements an d underlying macroeconomic conditions such as relative interest rates and the money supply the economic literature on t his point however is less than persuasive several economic

they are found ar often either fragile or unconvincing in that they rely on implausibl theoreti cal or empirical models for these reasons we like much of th profession are doubtful of the value of further timeseries modeling f exchange rates at high or medium frequencies using macroeconomi c models19 in comm enting on another study the same reviewers concluded tha t macroeconomic variables cannot be very important determinants of exchange rat volatility there appears to be growing general consensus for this conclusion it is the rule rather t han the exception that large movements in exchange rates occur in the absence of plausible or detectable macroeconomic events the theory however20 appears to do better with annual changes and in predicting longterm trends in view of volatility in exchange rates in the 199799 asian financial crisis more work on exchange rate determination is being conducted the current trend is t view exchange rates in terms of microeconomic analysis not unlike that used t analyze stock prices but this approach is still primarily research agenda what21 everyone does seem to agree upon is that exchange values for floating rates ar determined by supply and demand and that capital flows rather than trade flow s comprise most of the foreign exchange transactions analysis of the exchange rate moreover is complicated by the fact that the us dollar is key internationa l currency other nations use it as unit of account store of value and medium of exchange they often acquire dollars for purposes other than to purchase us exports or invest in the us market there is little evidence that macroeconomic variables have consistent stron g effects on exchange rates except during extraordinary circumstances such s hyperinflations without this link between nations macroeconomy and it s exchange rate part of the adjustment mechanism by which nations saving an d investment affects the trade deficit disappears we are left with the demand effects an increase in exports stimulates t he domestic economy which then draws in morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs14 in order for all increases in us exports to be offset by greater imports caused b y22 increased demand the us import share would have to exceed the inverse of the deman d multiplier for example if 1 billion increase in exports raises nations gross domestic product gdp by 25 billion multiplier of 25 then for imports to rise by 1 billion imports as share of gdp must equal at least 40 or 125 and must respon d proportionat ely in the united states imports of goods and services account for about 13 of gdp major defense of weakening exchange rate usually requires raising interest rates23 to attract capital inflows or stop capital outflows higher interest rates however caus continuedimports and offsets some of the original increase in exports demand effects alone however cannot account for all movements in trade balances22 the inability of macroeconomic theory to explain even simple exchange rat movem ents also raises questions about the standard interpretation of internationa l trade policies if exchange rates do not reflect either underlying trade flows r macroeconomic variables such as interest rates then the standard macroeconomic conclusion that all export promotion or import protection is negated completely by market forces is subject to ch allenge country might be able to erect trade barriers or promote xports without eliciting major response from exchange markets the current sta of macroeconomics allows one to state that reducing us imports will tend to raise the value of th dollar on exchange markets but whether combination of the effects on the exchange rate and domestic demand are sufficient to offset the reduced imports to keep the balance of trade the same does not seem to have bee n established empirically in terms of actual trade policymaking however us commitments under th world trade organization and other trade agreements preclude unilatera l protectionist measures or excessive export promotion ctivity economic studies also have shown that import protection does cause higher prices and narrower choice of products this benefits domestic companie s manufacturing those products but harms consumers who might buy them the lack f an empirically established link between the exchange rate an d macroeconomic variables also implies that little can be said about whether n exchange rate is at the right level or not although observers agree that s exchange r ates rise and fall they tend to overshoot there is agreedupon formula to determine what the appropriate level should be and when an exchange rate s dropped too low or risen too high some co untries maintain fixed exchange rate that they determine primarily in response to forces of demand and supply hong kong china an d chile for example intervene aggressively in foreign exchange markets to m aintain their fixed rates they have doggedly fended off speculators who have bet on depreciation they also may be willing to sacrifice some amount of domestic economic growth to maintain what they consider their right exchange rates the

in exchange markets moreover then the resulting exchange rates ca n be partly the result of government policy although with floating exchange rates most intervention appears to have only temporary an d psycholog ical effects one way that governments intervene in foreign exchang markets is to accumulate foreign exchange reserves japans foreign exchang reserves for example soared from 985 billion in 1993 to 1833 billion in 1995 and to 2237 billion in may 1999 this still is small relative to world capital flows but25 the increase from 1993 is mor than double the size of japans trade surplus with the united states countrie s also may regulate capital flows some countries restrict outflows of capital or may cause rge of foreign borrowing by local institutions eg thailand in the mid1990s by libera lizing their nations capital flows or may induce surge in capital outflows by increasing the share of pension funds or other assets that can be invested in foreign securities eg japan in 1998

also may produce policy prescriptions that can be incomplete for examp in the 1970s and 1980s the united states experienced socalled twin deficits sizable volume of economic and popular literature pointed out that the dissavings of the federal government in th form of its budget deficit was generating twin in the form of rising us trad deficit in order to reduce the trade deficit the policy prescription was that th united states should look beyond trade policy and put its resources instead int increasing its savings rate this led to 1989 policy proposal by japan in trad negotiations with the united states for example that in order to reduce the us trade deficit americans should curtail their reliance on credit cards 27 how valid is the twin deficit connection an econometric analysis

effects of international bor rowing on variables such as productivity and consumption at different time periods if american citizens for example are borrowing fro m abroad to finance current purchases they must be doing so according to som valuation of future versus current consumption according to review of economic literature on the intertemporal approach to the current account economic models that fail to integrate investment saving an d growth make it virtually impossible to understand persistent current accoun t imbalances why for example are the current accounts of canada and australi perennially in deficit while that of japan is in surplus despite wide swings in their real exchange rates the standa rd macroeconomic approach to trade deficits moreover offers valid benchmark for evaluating the size of external imbalances th international monetary fund in its dealings with currency crises considers current account deficit that exceeds 5 of gross domestic product to be warning signal that the deficit may be unsustai nable but that observation is based more on experience30 than on theo ry in practice policymakers usually just strive to avoid negativ current account in considering trade across time periods however efficiency often calls for an unbalanced current account as explained below31 one recent approach to this problem is to treat the international borrowing t fund current account deficit in terms of standard investment analysis curren t account deficit represents the borrowing against future output in order to purchase more goods and services today which generates trade deficit this potentiall could burden fu ture generations with lower consumption in order to repay the debts being incurred today in standard costbenefit analysis this borrowing would b justified if it results in enough consumption being made availab in the future to offset borrowing costs interest rates for nation rigorous costbenefit analysis of all international borrowing is not feasible capital flows occur because of both pull and pu sh factors although inflows of capital may be conceptually equivalent to international b orrowing foreign investors may have their capital pushed into the us market for variety of reasons including considerations of political risk which may be unrelated to differences i n interest rates or other borrowing criteria stylized approach to assessing whether trade deficits are good or bad however is to examine how deficit in trade and corresponding imports of capita l borrow ing are used if the capital imports are employed to increase

is used to finance current consumption it is considered to be bad in the sense that future consumption will be l ower than it otherwise would be the logic of this analysis is similar to that for an individual if the individual i s borrowing to finance investment s in productive assets eg an education automobile for commuting to work or preventive medical care t hat tend to increase productivity and earned income it may b considered to be good however if the individual is borrowing merely to increase current consumption eg vacation travel clothes or entertainment it may be considered to be bad33 as shown in figure 5 us imports of capital goods excluding automobiles have been rising in 1998 they accounted for 30 of total merchandise imports up from 23 in 1990 imports of automobiles some of which are capital goods bu t most of which are consumer durables eased somewhat from 18 to 16 whil consumer goods grew from 19 to 24 in dollar amounts i mports of capital goods excluding automobiles rose by 154 billion from 116 billion in 1990 to 27 0 billion in 1998 while the us curren t account deficit rose by 141 billion from 92 billion in 1990 to 233 billion in 1998 in the 1990s therefore imports of capita lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs20 goods have increased by more than the current account deficit and capital good s imports have been growing both absolutely and as percent of total merchandis imports in this sense the capital borrowing from abroad seems to have been used to finance productivity enhancing investments consumption imports however still are quite large the intertemporal approach to the current account deficit does provide on policy implica tion that most developing nations have implemented that is if tariffs are imposed they should fall on consumption and not capital goods this approach may indicate to policym akers whether country is squandering the capital being imported to purchase current consumption goods but it does t provide policy tools to determine the optimal size of nations current accoun t deficit the united states may be borrowing to enhanc future economic growth but are we becoming too reliant on foreign capital the intertemporal approach has not yet developed to the point that it can indicate to policymakers whether or not chronic current account deficit can be sustained sustainability of the trade deficit is the us current account deficit sustainable is the united states likely t encounter situation in which i nvestors lose confidence in dollardenominated assets and dump them thereby causing rapid depreciation in the value of the dollar and currency crisis similar to that experienced by mexico in 1995 and countries of asia in 1997 nd 1998 this depends on whether the us economy will be able t generate the resources necessary to repay the funds borrowed from abroad first it shou ld be noted that even though the us trade deficit has reached the 200billion level the curr ent account deficit is less at 155 billion primarily because of the us surplus in services trade as percent of total us consumption moreover the trade defici t at about 3 is down from the 5 in the mid1980s the current account as percent of gross domestic product also is c omparably lower the us current account deficit is not c urrently at the 5ofgdp level considered to be danger sign in international financial markets second it should also be noted that the foreign in vestments in the united states have grown to the point that in 1997 foreign i nvestors in the us market earned 53 billion more than americans earned on their investments abroad concern over th sustainability of the us current account deficit was recently stated by alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve more dist ant concern but one that cannot

become key world currency it is used abroad for the sam reasons that it is used at home as unit of account medium of exchange and store of value foreigners are willing to purchase us paper currency which pays interest for use in international transactions as of 1996 the us treasur estimated that 209 6 billion in us currency primarily 100 notes was circulating abroad this amount was increasing by about 15 billion per year and exceeded the currency circulating in the unit ed states in other words the united states has been exporting paper currency in exchange for claims on real goods and services abroad the use of dollars as key currency moreover means that american foreig n borrowing can be denominated in dollars rather than in foreign currency even if the value of the dollar falls on exchange markets the dollar amount of us borrowing does not change this is quite different situation from that of indonesia sout h korea or mexico as the value of their currencies fell the amount

most mainstream economists assert that international trade results primarily in reallocation of jobs from less efficient to more efficient industries rather than particular job ga ins or losses for the economy as whole this argument was recently stated by alan greenspan as follows it is difficult to find credible evidence th at trade has impacted the level of total employment in this country over the long run indeed we ar currently experiencing the widest trade deficit in history with level f unemployment close to record lows certain ly the distribution of jobs by industry is affected b international trade but it is also affected by domestic trade it is th relative balance of supply and demand in competitive market econom that determines the mix of empl oyment when exports fall or imports rise domestic demand and relative prices have invariably adjusted in the lon g run to leave total employ ment relatively unaffected as economists like to say all imports are eventually paid for with exports 37 other studies however indicate that the trade deficit may have an impact n us potential employment one study for example concluded that because of the asian financial crisis many of the asia countries affected are attempting to expor t their way out of their prob lems the resulting 100 billion increase in the us trade deficit could destroy 11 million us jobs the losses would occur in every state mostly in the manufacturing sector where even if interest rates are lowered enough to stave off jump in unemployment 600000 jobs would be shifted from th highwage manufacturing to

there can be net job losses as long as us output and employment continue to rise another study however 39 estimated that over the first three years of nafta the reduction in net exports t canada and mexico had eliminated 16717 2 american job opportunities and in total nafta had resulted in net loss of 394835 jobs this rea of job losses and gains40 from trade agreements seems to be one in which data and methods of analysis are still being developed conclusion this brief survey of the us trade deficit and the theory an d policies surrounding it indicates that this field of economics is evolving recently some basic economic theory has been called into question as mpirical studies fail to validate long accepted theoretical linkages the policy implications with respect to trade have develope d from the prescription that free trade is optimal to one that allows for example fo r strategic trade policy aimed at assisting certain industries particularly those in high technology strategic trade policy however comes with new set of pitfalls the macroeconomic approach to explaining the trade deficit is encounterin g some obstacles many seemingly straightforward theoretical linkages for example have not been empirically established in particu lar studies have not been able to link macroeconomic conditions to short and mediumterm chang in nations exchange rate also studies have found that changes in exchange rates do not translat completely into price cha nges for imports and exports this implies that in order for exchange depreciation to eliminate trade deficit it must overshoot the equilibrium rate by quite margin this brings other inefficiencies into an economy many nations regularly intervene in foreign exchange markets and influence the values of their currencies recent weakness in the japanese yen for example s been exacerbated by the japanese governments intervention into exchange markets the united states however has an nounced exchange rate policy nor does it have transparent method of determining when it should intervene in currency markets the inability of macroeconomic theory to explain even simple exchange rat movements raises questions about the standard interpretation of international trad policies if exchange rates do not reflect either underlying trade flows r macroeconomic variables such as interest rates then the standard macroeconomic conclus ion that export promotion or import protection is negated completely b yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98693crs27 market forces is subject to ch allenge country might be able to erect trade barriers or promote exports withou t eliciting major response from exchange markets us commitm ents under the world trade organization and other trade agreements however preclude unilateral protectionist measures or excessive export promotio n activity the demand effects of import protection or export pro motion however are well established in empirical studies of the economy trade policies that reduce imports or increase exports provide stimulus to the domestic economy that usually causes domestic production to rise this in turn brings in more imports which offset t some exten t the reduction in imports or increase in exports resulting from the trade policies also well established in economic studie s are the benefits to competing us producers and harm done to the american consum er from higher prices and narrower choice resulting from import protection policies the macroeconomic approach also is being extended to account for why th united states may be borrowing from abroad and how those funds are being used trade data indicate that rising share of us imports has been of capital goods that should increase us productivity and growth in the future treating foreig n borrowing with the same methods used to evaluate domestic borrowing migh t determine an optimal level for the us current account deficit this has not yet been done however in terms f sustainability it is difficult to see that the historically large capita l inflows of 19961998 will continue into the next centu ry as the asian financial crisis ebbs and world economies recover s ome of the capital that has sought safety in us markets likely will return abroad if so the us trade and current account deficits of today will have to diminish put in opposite terms if the us trade deficit i s reduced the need for foreign borrowing also will decline the ability of the united states to continue to incur trade and current account deficits at the 200 billion level depends on the willingness of foreigners to lend and invest funds in the american market the deficit currently at roughly 3 of gross domestic product is not at the dangersignal level of 5 of gdp used by th international monetary fund but whether foreigners will continue to move capital to the americ an market even if the foreign share of the us federal debt rises t exceed 50 or if the level of foreign assets in the us market increases to th equivalent of twothirds of us gdp is both political question for us policyma kers and an economic question for foreign investors further issue i s whether net us payments to foreign investors will continue to rise enough abov their 225 billion in 1998 and whether they will offset capital inflows or become burden to the us economy considerab controversy exists as to the effect of imports and exports n americ an jobs and wages mainstream economists assert that international trad results primarily in reallocation of jobs from less efficient to more efficient industries rather than particul ar job gains or losses for the economy as whole other studies however document potential job losses in specific industries and point out that rising trade deficit induces shift of jobs from relatively highwage manufacturin g industries to the relatively lowerpaying service sector
