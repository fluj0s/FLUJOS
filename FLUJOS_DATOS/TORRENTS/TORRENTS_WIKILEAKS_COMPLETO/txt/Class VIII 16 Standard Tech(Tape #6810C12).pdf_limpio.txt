6810c12 class viii tape 16 standard tech well you will be very happy to know brethren as we are assembled here together that we have to bow our heads in prayer for none of you at the moment since youve already gotten each one of you well done now all you have to do is get your 85 on the final exam and in any event you can make your airline reservations for the sixteenth or the seventeenth whatever aircraft you can get on what lecture number is this sixteen fifteenth sixteenth gee i though youd slipped or i had sixteen lecture number sixteen and this is twelve oct correct ad eighteen and the subject of this lecture is standard tech i do not envy you going almost singlehandedly into an organization at this particular state of affairs and having dumped on your lap what you dumped on my lap when you arrived here laughter but im afraid it is that exact situation now what you lack because ive been too busy with your folders you lack big chart which gives you the b cs of csing you lack that chart ive not been given the space nor the time to get you together with big cs chart the great deal of the auditing which you have been doing is ot section auditing nevertheless the simpler actions apply to the lower grades now remember that youve got to be backed up by the examiner very often session will look ok to you if you dont look at the examiners report now its quite remarkable but those sessions wnich were done today i think all of them it is reported got to the examiner with an fn the whole sweeping lot now when youre really hotter than pistol they come back to the next session with an fn theyll not only get to the examiner but they come back to the next session thats asking lot but im telling you that its quite triumph to get all the guys to the examiner with an fn now you must realize that if the report looks absolutely flawless and by the time the person gets to the examiner hes fallen on his head that you have false auditing report and the most likely two things that have happened is the auditor talked too much and the auditor didnt talk at all it isnt really that he even did something else its just that he did too much in the way of gib gab gab gab he got the pc distracted and upset or he just didnt give him the commands now the other type of additive you can usually spot because its very often in the auditing report do you have present time problem what postulate did you make that gave you that problem what counter postulate was there to this very good then give problem of comparable magnitude to it fine alright good now invent problem good you know there was actually folder around thats got that in it from class vi auditor wow and of course the pc just fell on his head well that was easy to spot dont you see thats easy to spot the hidden one is all of the stuff that didnt get into the report now you can very often tell all the stuff that didnt get into the report by the time of the session the session is one and one half columns long but consumed two hours it doesnt make any sense at all how could they have only one and one half column of work sheet and worked at it for two hours see thats impossible so therefore thats false auditing report just obviously on the face of it now you are to use the examiner to investigate this sort of thing and you can ask your examiner to ask the pc things so you send the folder back to the examiner and you say examiner get the pc in and ask him do you follow so then the examiner and you just you can even make together little little form you can mimeo few forms off you know what you want the pc asked see you can get you can get another point of view on this you can get the examiners point of view now dont think that the examiner has to be very skilled people think they have to put class vis on or something like that on the examiner post all you want is an honest person on the examiner post he doesnt even have to be trained in tech cause whats he doing hes reading meter he has to know the state of the needle and he has to be able to write the language youre auditing in he also has to know that he must not make an evaluative glares and sneers and he mustnt ask lot of silly questions unless hes been told to ask some questions now when you you can have pc brought to the examiner you get this auditing report back and you say oh my god what the hell is this all about and youre trying to figure out what the hell its this thing within two hours and you have one and half columns of work sheet and it didnt seem to work out and the guy got to the examiner with dn and the ta at 5 what in the name of god happened he left the session three minutes before with an fn at 2 but now its at 4 what the hell is going on what is going on alright well you dont know so dont hang yourself up in mystery any question you have about it write out the questions and get the answers from the examiner you dont call in the pc you send the folder with some questions down to the examiner examiner calls in the pc asks the questions now you normally will get these things just on straight examiner form that is an additional line im showing you exists dont you see now if youve got five six seven folders which have appeared to you totally well done and the examiner report was great on them and you notice all of sudden that four of these five are back in review within about forty eight hours what do you do about that you convene board of investigation or comm ev cause brother youre dealing with false reports it goes straight onto the ethics line you can ask the ethics officer to interview these people it is the least action youd take and you can convene board of investigation because your neck is out miles your neck is out mile people suddenly start accusing you you see you get the condition you dont assign thats the horrible part of it if some guys in nonexistence and you dont assign nonexistence first thing you know youre in nonexistence its weird its weird mechanism and it happens its actual factual so therefore if you get the thing stacked up now dont go around grinding your teeth and snarling to yourself quietly and so forth just put it on the ethics line very forthrightly what the hell happened and you will just be amazed at the grossness of the error it took the auditors all of sudden were writing all of their reports long after the session to make them look good theres collusion with the examiner something weird has gone on here see and the faster you cure it the faster your tech lines are going to work so you just are alert all the way along the line when youre doing cs work to these oggiltyboggeldy weirdities and dont you try to get weird to solve the situation on tech lines these oggiltyboggeldy what the hell is this guy has power 5a three days later hes reported sick well you know the items of 5a are out and although it looks good in the auditors report it might even have slid by the examiner somehow or another the fact that he fell on his head in any way shape or form he got sick he turned up as an ethics case something like this you know truly false auditing report now these are the fine points these are the fine points of being cs where you have to be clever in being cs is avoiding anybody pushing you into position where you give unusual solutions cause every time they goof theyll ask you for an unusual solution youre being asked to dig them out of it after they havent done anything they should have done only they wont tell you they havent done anything they should have done so you could easily push yourself into situation where you are being required to give unusual solutions when all you really are dealing with anyhow are false reports so any unusual solution which you give which is which is based on false report will just wind the guy up in another ball thats what i mean when i say take it easy take it easy on your hes got to be audited this afternoon this thing looks sour looks like something unusuals going to have to be done and so forth well you can have the pc called in and reexamined on set of questions on the basis of that if it doesnt true up you can turn it over to the ethics officer you dont get any satisfaction there you can turn it over to b of i or comm ev do you follow when these situations become consistent you make it b of i or comm ev dont let anybody get away with it the next thing you know youll be doing your nut now ill let you in on something its only the lousy sessions that consume cs time its only the lousy ones itd be interesting to look at the time dates if you knew the exact sequence of times if you took bunch of my cses you would find that the well dones take about two minutes and the lousy ones take up to half an hour so that i would be able to get through tremendous stack and i have done as many as forty six forty six cases cses in one evening with great care every line dont you see and the lapsed time was about ten hours now the funny part of it is is out of that ten hours the easy ones didnt consume an hour of it and the rest of the whole time was in trying to unravel the lousy sessions and its interesting that right at that state of time not your folders but another zone of folders and so forth were being filled with false reports and that was what was the trouble there were great many additives in the sessions which werent being recorded and very shortly i alerted looked up and got ethics in with crash it straightened out it will straighten out itll all come out right now but when you find yourself then with cs consuming too much time and its rust hard job plowing through this know then that youre dealing with out tech and false reports you just are you could actually stack up the folders that are probably false reports it didnt make any sense you told him to do something monday and tuesday it comes back as apparently done and wednesday why the case is misbehaving most remarkably and that hasnt worked so you say something else and it comes back to you on thursday and this ta is way up and everything seems bit awry well the first thing it tends to do is shake your confidence in what you yourself are doing you can get into what the hell you know i have what in the name of god is going on perfectly valid sessions theyre all written up beautifully only those sessions didnt take place do you follow now thats pretty gruesome thats pretty gruesome but somebody can throw you an awful curve this way now there isnt any unusual remedy for the situation certain percentage of this sort of thing will happen so you simply take care of it that way any time you make it rule any time youre asked for an unusual solution you turn it over to the ethics officer or the examiner you get note from an auditor this person is waf waf in waffle waffle waffle and yowf waf waft and youve already csed the folder twice let us say two times and its waffle waffle waffle waffle dont you go waffle waffling your line to that pc is being cut in some fashion or another and youd what not or will not know until you get some further information so you the least thing you can do is turn it over to the examiner and have the pc interrogated the next thing you can do maybe after youve done that second action is turn it over to the ethics officer let him look into this whats the ethics records involved here see what i mean in that way youll stay out of trouble itll all go smooth as glass standard tech is in or its out ethics do you see you cant get standard tech done while ethics is out somebodys giving you false reports somebodys getting away with murder and its just amazing its amazing what can happen amazing you will find all kinds of weird things ive been through all this in organizations all over the place i dont think theres anything much could happen that hasnt happened in infinite variety ive had tremendous numbers of wins tremendous numbers of successes but some of these points really stand out one time i found that the d of p couldnt possibly get much done yet there were thirty five auditors on staff but there was very little happening and you know i found the registrar was scheduling the pcs they werent being scheduled by tech services they were being scheduled by the registrar and the registrar would schedule them this way person would come in and the person didnt wasnt even asking when he should be audited or when he shouldnt be audited and the registrar would just automatically volunteer well how much time how much spare time do you have and the person would say well i dont know im usually free after seven oclock in the evening well very good lets see eight oclock thursdays how is that every thursday they were going to have one hour session see here was complete outadministration well nobody could run that hgc it was impossible they had to have this vast number of auditors who didnt have anything to do they didnt have anything to do because pcs ever showed up in processing at any given time there were eighty or ninety pcs well my golly you would have figured that thirty five auditors would have cleaned up eighty or ninety pcs in one awful rush they wouldve been out of work by thursday dont you see cause the sessions werent all that long but it was so fixed that an auditor was only about doing an hour worth of work every two days they could have gone on this way for years and they also could have gone completely broke do you see now situation like that makes it impossible for cs to keep anybody busy or live so this is the other side of outadmin now you in the first place dont care how much time that pc hangs around as long as when he is to get session he gets the session and what happens in that session is what you said was to happen in it and then you take look at the session and then the next time hes to get session somebody brings him in and gives him session in other words your tech services is operating against the action of cs and the availability of auditors pongety pongety pong well thats all an administrative action now it can go the other way around where you have somebody else entirely who is completely out of zone or area whos doing all the scheduling that hasnt anything to do with anything you know its all being scheduled by the hco exec sec and therefore you cant get people audited when theyre supposed to be audited the less days you leave bad 5 out of action the less the better if youve got to correct 5a or something like that and you want it corrected now that evening if possible so somebody in tech services has got to be on the ball and be able to call in whoever it is so they have troubles so tough thats tough you dont care how much trouble they got youre whole action youre whole action is getting the cs done getting the cs done and getting the case gaining do you do you see so your administrative play you see falls in against the tech and these two things are coordinated one against the other now you dont want tons of auditors sitting around on pcs who are falsely and weirdly scheduled and so forth the scheduling of pcs is very much in the hands of the tech services and its very much under the orders of the cs just recently believe it or not in another zone i had two pcs who just plain goofing it boy they were goofing it up most gorgeously and another pc who was pleading that he should go to the hospital and have his throat cut or something and he had this as thing and you ever once in while go into hospital and you ask some of the patients well im going to have an operation heh so you say is anything wrong with you i dont think so oh yes ive ive got something i dont know what it is just something i had something else last week but theyre going to operate on guys are just dramatizing see so i was ordering these people to be audited and audited now and boy you would be surprised at the amount of force and pressure i had to bring in to get them audited and the guy who was pleading to have an operation they didnt get around to him he went over and the next thing i heard hed had his operation ah one useless hole so you see tech services and so on can fail to back you up the auditing doesnt occur in terms of time when you want it or they are trying to force you to get the case audited in some speedy fashion or something to suit the convenience you dont care how inconvenient it is for the pc you get it you dont care how inconvenient it is you dont care how hard tech services has to work this is to hell with it you understand and if its matter of straightening that case out carefully you want that case straightened out carefully and you want to watch every step of the case as it comes along the line to then the ratio that the less trust you have in the auditor the more actions and the more times you want to inspect it why sell down the river everything from zero to four if youre going to sell anything down the river lets sell the ruds let him goof the ruds let him goof little assessment of some kind or another why sell grade down the river now this is all part of setting the case up to have the major action done and you as cs have the job of setting the case up to get major action done do you understand so if theres any insecurity on your part that the case isnt going to be set up for the major action and somebodys just going to slaphappy the major action on through the lines bah at that point you start putting on the brakes see fly the ruds and give him any give him anything dont give him grade so you fly the ruds and dont give him grade so theres two ways you can use little prep checks and l1s and things laughter in actual fact in all respect to this class i havent been doing that just to give you something to do i have used them meaningfully to set the case up better but i wouldnt i wouldnt think twice about it assess the following and weve seen some way back here that the pc was once bank cashier and seems to have failed at it cause its back in some kind of withhold he was giving but when he was kid he didnt want to be he wanted to be banker but now he tells he better not because so on and so on well good alright alright you got some clue we dont care where they got the clue you can even issue interrogations to get clues you saw do it recently what is your state of ot and i picked out the physiological illnesses and audited straight in the direction to set the guy up to bring up section or zone of his case which must be holding him down from exteriorization alight now i gave you drill on this see now that isnt standard form to amount to anything but you can call it standard form you can make up these forms what careers have you followed that you have failed at turn it over to the auditor and get it assessed prep check it what you gonna get youre gonna get the rehabilitation of failed purpose the guy is immediately going to be less tired well when you know when these things are the interplay is very simple once again under this heading youre looking for zone or area to audit so that you can test fly this pc whats he gonna do so you never want to hand out major actions i have come to saint hill to have power im going to want my power processing cs hes going to have his power processing alright somebodys going to try to tell whoever is csing around there that its really not necessary to cs the folder before he gets his power processing because after all he hasnt had any power processing yet you dont know where this guy is within seven miles of being set up for power power only works like bomb and only works fast ill show you how you can save time it only works fast when the pc is set up and pointed hes got to be all straight as die and then send him through power and pongo you really get results ive seen pc completely change his character when he was set up for power and had power alright now pc who isnt set up for it it doesnt even change his arc breaks so your proper action is to make very sure that anybody coming in for power has his folder at once turned over to cs and that the folder whether or not you are the cs or not just make sure that the folder is turned over to cs and then they would test fly this guy so we take some completely unlimited process you know like assess list prepcheck it do l1 on auditors anything you know assess list auditors auditing yowowowow do list 1 brrrrrr see item by item item by item item by item to fn well christ you can tell by the length of that list how near he is to being acceptable for power the auditor it didnt fly until item fifteen wow this case is charged up like galvanic battery ill bet you he has not even vaguely got his grades it was hard to do dont you see you could look over on the assessment and that all seemed bit difficult but they managed to finally settle on auditing and then the l1 on auditing went the whole page each one reading oh wow now do you see as cs you have an estimate of charge how charged this guy is bow long does it take him to clean up his arc breaks how long does it take him to do this how long does it take him to do that it takes him long time case is heavily charged doesnt take him very long case isnt heavily charged its elementary now supposing the case has been rehabbed in keckuk on all grades and your first action of prepcheck took all morning and half the afternoon to get it to fn well i wouldnt i wouldnt say your auditors trs were any good doing it but this is against also against the fact that you must be dealing with very charged up case so alright let us rehab or run arc straightwire not as youve been getting arc straightwire to four fly the ruds rehab arc straightwire or run get the folder back boy youre now liable to find the damndest things you ever heard of see well we actually actually either he didnt know what arc straightwire was there was somebody that told him he was once run on recall process and he couldnt remember very much of the auditing and it didnt fn the ta hasnt gone up terribly and nothing bad has happened and so forth now youre left with riddle has he ever been run on arc straightwire hell now if the case is charged up you know at once that he hasnt actually gone up through the grades theres something missing on the grade line now if you dont trust the auditor too much youre going to make that youre not going to throw away the whole rehab youre gonna get arc straightwire rehabbed or run fly the ruds rehab arc straightwire or run it now if you really didnt trust the auditor at all you would say check the state of arc straightwire and send back the folder now from that data we could determine whether or not to rehab it or run it so we could say rehab it or we could say run it do you follow you could you could slow it down to that that almost nowhere so the amount of action which you assign to be done is proportional to your confidence in the auditor in turning in result and factual auditing report and the action can get very damned complex after while on this sort of thing you can say do this do that do the other thing do the other thing do the other thing only god they dont have ball see because auditing which is administered quickly without any chance for any intervening ptps or anything like this really flies the guy but also auditing which administered very badly is better done in little pieces so that you can straighten it out before it all goes sour do you follow so this is the degree of approach the degree of approach in case supervision now what you audit what you order to be audited probably is occupying your attention it probably is i can turn you chart out ive been too busy working with your folders to give you chart at this time chart will be in existence at the time anybody is listening to these lectures and its just an b c proposition one of the reasons i dont get busy on it and so on it looks too simple to the simplicity is so simple and i see people bonglebingling around on this well my god what could they possibly be floofing about you know and yet i see i see early on in the org 8 course and with other experiences ive had recently teaching this the most complex damn cses you ever heard of people you know they they look at the administrative blunders of sessions as something that must be remedied i dont know why they have to go back to 1962 to get comma corrected what the hell is going on dont you see i mean im very puzzled about what is this surer complexity i suddenly see in my lap and its interesting that for ot cases for ot section repair and so forth its interesting that nearly all or your suggestions here toward the end of this course are dead on see youre calling your shots dead on and the only place i am in disagreement with it is i find another piece i can take off and you didnt quite see that i was heading cases for exteriorization by discharging them so i was looking for another piece i could take some charge off before id finally let it go see you get you get what i was going see cause im actually trying to set you up for 7 and 8 and this this is really the auditing youre getting im just setting you up for that it isnt it isnt that its terribly far to go or anything like that or that youre in bad shape or anything like this but in numerous instances we have actually been able to bring about exteriorization and all that sort of thing and ive been working on that and so on well this is not necessarily the target that you will find lower grade case working toward what he thinks is wrong with him what he thinks is wrong with him will be of one or two categories he isnt total ot in the last ten minutes of the first session you know so that gives him lose and it was totally unreal to him he wouldnt even know what the hell an ot was but its usually hes measuring his gains about whether or not he worries about his wife you know so all of his gains are measured against something like this or in the morning he has his foot hurts and after hes been audited does his foot hurt see this kind of thing so he has tendency with his terrific complexity to start backing you into the field of healing or something and your stable datum your stable datum on that is is the case will right itself by you simply finding any available charge you dont find any available feet you just find any available charge now ive tried to teach you few times somebody comes in with cold or somebody comes in with an ear do you follow alright now i say i say so and so and so and so find an engram or chain and run it first available that you can find just any engram chain that you run any engram chain you find on this case will have the ear on it do you follows yeah so its its so so its any available charge does anything you see its that gross and in doing case supervision and in auditing and so forth you dont have to grope around to find the head or the bottom of the pencil its just what ive been trying to teach you its where can you get some charge off how can we get some charge off alright if we can get some charge off of the guy well we can straighten him up if we cant get any charge off we wont there is magic button which makes case well without taking charge off see all magic buttons they might be awfully magic but they will depend on the amount of charge they got off the case do you follow that thats thats the whole of it now theres various things that actually mechanically render this that and the other thing lets take an out of valence case case that is out of valence is already heavily charged hed have to be heavily charged now the exact mechanics of this are very very interesting and ill let you in on one little series of processes you may or may not know that power processing in its entirety was synthesized by myself without using it on one single pc and with having subjective reality on it of any kind whatsoever myself because i was already clear it is one of those wild tours force in the field of that i set up what case will be in the state of and then figured out what it would take to bring about certain exact end phenomenon and then wrote up each power process and then wrote up the three 5a processes on the same thing without single test without single case with subjective reality on it i didnt have any case that could be run on that little bit afterwards to give you laugh i decided that i should probably be run on some power processes to get subjective reality on it and about two commands later i was wrapped around seven telegraph poles it did not function boy because i was already clear and ive noticed this before when they try to rehab power after clear when they try to run power after clear it normally throws guy into rag bag because his case is not in the shape that it takes it so its sort of cleaning clean it makes him look for things that arent there there are computations he longer has so to try to run them he sort of has to mock them up and when he does that why he says he doesnt quite own them and it tends to make them solid and youre liable to put him in the damndest black mass you ever heard of in your life and then youre going to wonder where it came from but below clear power was totally synthesized every single step of it and then i wrote up the bulletins of power and they were all experimental bulletins and put people onto power and did my first power cases and so forth and they all came out like that and i was watching it like hawk because i was doubly trebly critical of it because itd been totally synthesized how the hell did these end phenomena be so exact he so right on see they were perfect on the line so that was the they were supposed to behave and that was the way they behaved and it wasnt because i was saying so because i was saying they shouldnt behave that way and they went right on up the line bong bong bong bong bong and we had power processing now this is an interesting tour force now there is another zone where this has just occurred in the low ta case in order to teach this first class viii course i had to know what low ta case was i knew what high ta case was but i had to solve once and for all what was the low ta case so i could give you the hot dope because that would make zone or area in doubt which was in the technique which would continue to worry you now i could handle low ta case at ot 3 because its forced into one position or another by body thetans either the body thetans are gone and hes still standing back thinking theyre still there you can do various things at this but i had to know the identity of this well first it could be cured more or less at power pr pr 6 has tendency if run exactly correctly to cure low ta case and it cures few of them but i had to find out exactly what this was so i sat back and i figured out exactly what is low ta case exactly what is one and i want to teach you this exact mechanic because this was totally by synthesis i hadnt had low ta dont know anything about them reality on this of any kind whatsoever so i had to figure it out from scratch and here is the basic background of the low ta case now let now let show you here let show you here what we will call time track now this time track here is wide from the bottom up in terms of time we dont care what gradients they are this is the actual time track in which he would be in valence you got it he would be in valence ok now at this low point of the time track we have an area where the individual has had an incident on his own time track which is so gruesome that he has gone into the behavior i have seen on some preclears some preclears desert their own sphere and action to point where in the engram you pick it up originally you fine theyre little girl in the crowd at this execution and they cant quite tell what kind of an execution it is but theyre little girl in the crowd and you run it through the next time and you fine out that there were actually post on they think maybe the gallows and then you run it througn again and you find out they finally discovered who they were they were the headsmans axe and its beheading and then you run it through again and you find out that theyre the headsman and then you run it througn again and so help pete there they are on the block and down comes the axe in other words theyve gone out of valence successively and repeatedly further and further out of valence you got it that was because they wouldnt want to be that they couldnt confront being there and so on now that experimental data is from way way back way way way way back 1952 and so forth so i would action what the hell is this low ta i know when the guy goes out of valence i have this much check on it when he goes into valence of body thetan or he goes out of valence he goes into low ta well what the hell could this be alright well what it was is he had this horrible experience and he moved off there off the time track he moved from here over to there he went he says to hell with being that guy that guy gets into trouble im somebody else now so there he was safely over there now that experience then keys out and you see by dotted line here he comes back onto his own time track and then he lives for little while on his own time track and then one day somebodys selling headsmans axes or something and he goes flip and actually he goes back into that incident its lock hes now out of valence again do you see you got it and every time you have lock on this you charge that up some more charge the basic incident up some more see so thats another bar another bar on the side over here see so now he comes up the line again and he comes all trustworthy and everything is fine and he thinks life is gorgeous and everything is ok and all of sudden he gets himself into he finds himself standing on the platform up amongst crowd and he says oh my god you know reality break ahhh break where to go another lock puts another one on here down on this basic one see well try to label the engram and this is lock one the first time it happened lock two the second time it happened now he comes back over here more cautiously but when he runs into little girl like the one in the crowd he goes bango out here out of valence which is lock three got it each time its takes him longer and longer and longer to come back onto his own time track and to be himself do you see and every time this happens there was lock one lock two and lock three theyre adding up charge down here now after while down here in the engram the guy that thing is just so charged up with locks he couldnt get anywhere near it he just couldnt come close to it so that if you tried to get it by normal engram running he just wouldnt go near it and anybody who even faintly invalidates him hes in such state after while anybody who faintly invalidates him drives him out of valence so his tone arm goes down so on such person invalidation knocks his tone arm out of sight that means that there is such an incident as this on the track it is so neglected that even though he knows hes mocking things up and so forth he doesnt even know enough about it to know that hes still mocking it up do you see that mechanism well i figured this all out synthetically this is all synthetic cause i dont have it so what i did is i put together whole bunch of words which when assessed would make guy have the idea of moving on his own time track over to there overwhelmed driven out wiped out anything you could think of whereby he was gone here and appeared over here at the engram now when we assess that this is the way it this is the reason it works when we assess it by wiped out overwhelmed list lx1 when we assess this thing why we get the basic postulate thats got him over here weve kicked the edge of it its something like boy i dont want there to be anymore of that whoa and which comes under dislocated see or denied or some hes expressed it in some fashion do you see and now heres the oddity in order to run this engram or get near this track we have got to discharge the locks off the top of it so we recall being whatever assessed and that wuf wuf that puts as you see these big xs that knocks that off then that also knocks that much charge off the engram now we find the engram of being he goes right there and you get the engram wiped out now all of sudden he can get into valence now just to make sure that he isnt also hung with the overt you can also run the overt chain of engrams doing each one past an fn that is to say youve got an fn on the locks you got an fn on the on the motivator engram and you can get an fn also on the overt engram well by that time all of this slide out of valence every time i turn around is cured and then he can get back to asising his own time track because the trouble with this guy is is every time he goes out of valence or is the least bit invalidated he cant get any case gain the auditor sits into the session and slightly invalidates him he slides out of valence and therefore he doesnt asis what hes running so it wont fn he actually arc break needles hes just dead body you got the silly mechanics of this well apparently thats the way it is thats exactly the way it works out the wildest thing you ever saw in your life so this type of action is as part and parcel of discharging case do i make my point yes now this was an important zone or area of discharge because i found there was some people that even though you did four rundown nothing much happened so we had to figure out because that coordinated against the fact they were low ta cases now the odd part of it is you can do this exact action at engram level now this really puts one into your hands boy that takes case thats all the way down there at the bottom of the grades well you can undoubtedly run it again up along the line someplace it will have changed but this actually will run clear down at the level of dianetic engram so youve got powerful tool in your hands so you find this guy and he just cant seem to make it and hes got black field and he cant see anything well of course what he should do is get ot 3 but as the chances of running ot 3 on him without proceeding up through the grades is so slight as to skip it you couldnt do anything with it hed look at you incredulously he wouldnt believe anything about anything but you can do this hell run very shallowly hell probably stay in this lifetime the engram will erase he wont have any real idea of whats happening but boy will he discharge enough and all of sudden he isnt the black field case now thats your rough case not necessarily the case with the black field cause he intends to be very often high but theyre alike overcharged they alike dont asis but if you get your low ta case thats the one you use got it i tell you itd work on either one of them but its your low ta case special any such put together as you see in lx1 and the handling of it is one two three four and you know exactly what it is alright now lets take another case lets take this well lets take what used to be the black five theres the invisible one too see but theres the black five and hes way up through the roof and hes reading at 5 on the ta now that comes down ordinarily on the process what has been overrun rehabbing each one youre going to have your heart broken here and there where you give that process out because somebodys liable to just make list the worst youll see on it is they make list and they dont even put down what read and they dont rehab any of it and theyve made you your list you could even explain it to some guys and say now look you list what has been overrun this way what has been overrun it is not legitimate listing question it merely gives you an assessment its sort of of horrible thing which lies between listing and nulling and assessment see its neither fish nor fowl it is simply an auditing question which you happen to write the answers down on thats all you could do the same thing you could write the answers down to level zero see and youd find one agreed and another agreed and it wouldnt come out to one item cause its not listing auestion but you can use this so the pc is asked what has been overrun and then he lists and he gets long fall maybe he lists the first one and it doesnt read at all so you dont touch it and then long fall alright very good peeling potatoes you simply rehab peeling potatoes and you know ive seen the most complicated rehabs recently and i suddenly remembered that the earliest rehab bulletins and so on have not been condensed and rewritten theres too much tech in those things those they contain the actual complete steps of rehab and rehab does go that way but it isnt that hard to rehab its just how often was he released on the subject is all you need for rehab and it goes fn and thats it so you dont have to follow those those early early rehab remember those were back written just about the time i was synthesizing power and for the first time found that auditors had been overrunning fns and experience since that time has brought more data to view and the data which we have brought to view is simply that it is only necessary to ask them the number of times they went release while doing something and they fn particularly if you make them count up the times its very simple so you could you could actually overrun rehabbing if you get it too complicated and the only reason people dont rehab and why it had to be trickily rehabbed is because the rehab itself was hard to deliver to the pc so its been very simplified how often were you released see count the number of times how often were you released that didnt fn or were you released didnt fn on that so count the number of times and guy counts the number of times and all of sudden you get an fn and thats it and its an elementary action now while youre doing that you have to watch it cause theres one thing that you dont at this time do is you have to watch it to make sure that your trs remain in you watch it because you see you could rehab operations or something like this and get an arc broke needle on it and not notice it but an arc break needles very easy to establish because youve got bad indicators with it alright rehab bad indicators with it why just ask if theres an arc break or something in connection with this subject its as easy to do as that and you put in the ruds before the release and it then flies and the actual mechanism which youre using is if you you know it wont rehab or something like this and the fn is an arc break needle theres trouble here some kind or another just put in the ruds on the subject and thats quite allowable because its on that subject so it limits it now when you try to put in the ruds if you put in the ruds generally something like this made cough to think about it if you put in the ruds something weird like this in living you know in living before before living was there an arc break enough to make anybody cough now this is silly one see you see you could ask the guy in any limited way so in the taking in the taking of ether hes an ether sniffer or something and it wont fn something like this and you could ask him well in the taking of ether was there any arc break or something like that because youve limited it and actually what youll do is put in the arc break and so forth and youll get your fn probably on the arc break to hell with the ether it probably doesnt have any fn in connection with it do you follow so that you can slide and get yourself sideways out of rehab by putting in the ruds in the vicinity of that rehab you got it so you dont get caught in trap of having fn i know its its rather its is it going to i tested this out one time on the subject of death well it was obvious that any mass existed because there had also been release its true because it makes sort of gpm freedom trapped do you see its sort of gpm sitting along here so anyplace guys got lot of mass he must be comparing it to release so in any area of mass theres release available somewhere in it now it takes considerable glib auditing skill to all of sudden say da da da da been released and so forth well yes you get fall on it the only reason its hung up is theres also release in it you ask this fellow well now you say you were taking kerosene for kicks and then it releases and the needle doesnt move and nothing happens and there isnt anything to that its all the same well dont try to force through release cause there is none theres gonna have to be some needle action but if theres mass there theres also release there you can ask yourself if this guy is so stuck in the stuff how does he also get to here cause he is in pt he is in present time well howd he get here well he must have moved out of what he was in see that thats quite quite obvious so of course if he moved out of what he was in he was stopping it because it was overrun as i gave you in the last lecture so he has the mass which hes got stop on it but remember hes still here he isnt there so obviously you can find release point do you see theres nothing much to this actually but if you sweat at it too hard you get him up to stopping it and you can get the stop point and then it wont release and the ta will go up so its rather slippery action so you count the number of times or something like that and you dont sweat at it very hard if it wont release it wont release and youre going to run into this sooner or later find somebody who wont release now there is way that you can still get release on it you say well did you take anything earlier on the track that was similar to kerosene oh yes yes we used to take balderdash in the old days i just remembered yes fn thank you you can get yourself out of that one because the overrun is so overrun that the releases are longer available in it dont you see but these few well chosen approaches to the subject give you road out so we do what has been overrun anything hed list can be rehabbed if it reads it can be rehabbed because hes longer stall with it so there is release point which is registered in it all you got to do is make it do its release point again and hell come off the obsessive stop hell cease to mock it up now if its driven down to an arc break needle by this it will be because theres roughness in the session normally but you can now put in the ruds with regard to it or the session and itll rehab and if it just wont rehab at all then you just think well what was similar to kerosene earlier on the track and you can rehab that and that will rehab kerosene do you understand thats very simple action youve probably been amazed to sit there and watch those fns happen so fast well it is tribute to your smoothness as an auditor but youre going to have grade 2 class 2 trying to do this for you and so forth he will really be sweating and hell be saying but how could it you know what if it doesnt what if i dont get an fn on it that will be the question which you will be having to answer and the answer is well you better had and you just tell him to ask for if it was and how many times and if he cant do it to cease and desist the session at once and knock it off on the first one dont let him go through twelve of them if he cant do it he cant do it but the mechanism of it can be so exaggerated and there can be so much data on it you know wow you have to have the idea however there is such thing as mental mass the mental mass is there because its hung up on the track because of gpm the guy did get out of it one he was released before he got into it and two he was released when he got out of it and in the middle of it someplace he may have been released half dozen times because of it you see so its the chances are theres several releases available and all of those get him off the kick of stopping it and it sort of occurs to him hey wait minute i got out of that therefore why mock it up to get out of what you do is unstabilize it the electric eel characteristics of thetan are plus and minus you knock out the minus the pluses go you knock out the plus the minusll go well hes not going to get out of it because you want him out of it the reason why theres mass there its hung up with the release see he hes got it because he got out of it but the got out of it dont you see is the plusminus of gpm its like they throw the r6 pictures all the r6 pictures are in black and white which hang him up see pink and green hang him up so you get your opposite numbers your opposite color wheel and it tends to hang him up loud and quiet high and base see any opposite then youll find out the whole nomenclature and actions of implants and everything else is based on plus and minus for some reason or another they hang together so you got plus and you got minus so you can knock out the minus or you knock out the plus the other onell go to hell so the guy is hung with mass you knock out the release and the mass vanishes do you see thats actually the only mechanic youre working with fellow says well i dont know im in r6 and i see only these colors you know theres green ushers and theres pink audience and the things are turning pink green and so forth you say whats pink and the picture will dim his attention is spread on both pink and green see just get him to look at pink and the green will vanish and there goes the pink you should know this mechanic because its one of the simple mechanics of the mind i ran into an engram which was silver and black very interesting silver and black half and half which made up white black type of action one against the other now space and solid also makes plus and minus space and mass you see this can be strained at fantastically to make things hang together one way or the other so theres always releases available and in this whole subject of overrun when you run what has been overrun theres one of these doubles you dont even have to ask for it if the guyll tell you what the half of it is youre asking for the release well hes been concentrated on the mass you ask him for the release and that is you ask him for the moments he didnt concentrate on the mass and to that degree with relationship to the mass youve moved him on the time track so the mechanic of it is more simple than was imagined originally he didnt have to think of anything really to give him release point its just all the auditor did the whole thing so anyway the net result of this is that you have lot that you can do now after the guys gone along i mean in csing youve got lot of it when guys gone along in auditing for six and half months and he hasnt had session for that length of time and he comes back in again and his ta is up and so forth the probability is that theres an overrun in between and what has been overrun is completely unlimited process youre just trying to find out what can we rehab on the case so the guy puts the item down the item reads the auditor rehabs it do you see whats been overrun weighing fish baskets very good alright is there point of release on your weighing fish baskets oh yes fn alright oh yes fn how many times ff ff ff ff one two three four five six every night every night there was moment of release i would leave work fn thank you so youre getting off those overruns one right after the other so discharging the case with anything that would handle throwing him out of valence its your lx1 approach and they can do more than one of those thats your low ta that he rses easily by the way low ta case also rses easily and then your high ta your high ta is overruns and it is vital that you rehab them now your normal ta your normal ta might be just nasty tempered or something but he is readily solvable readily solvable but you still might have to discharge this so setting us pc to have the grades run gives gain on the grades the like of which you never heard of before wheee now its shame to see somebody use the grades to take the ta down or something dumb like this oh ive seen it done ive seen it done its shame to see somebody who has come through the grades and all hes handled is his current ptp hes actually worried about getting back to keokuk and all you see in the grade responses is getting back to keokuk i could talk about getting back to keokuk my wife will worry if she gets back to keckuk its service facsimile i could make people wrong by not getting back to keokuk so the case isnt set up so you can always get an estimate not on personality analysis but you can always get an estimate the length of time in session the thickness of the review forms and so on and the number of actions which you take is proportional to the numbers of actions which have had to be taken its direct coordination so you know immediately its resistive case now some people are going to resist like mad having resistive case run on them because they thinks its an evaluation so you can call it special case but it doesnt mean anything it just gives you something else to run and in great many of these cases they wont solve even vaguely before you pound right through on that resistive case thats your real resistive case boy when you do the assessment on that thing and it says former therapy fall fall fall fall fall youre liable to find something on the order of when youre dealing with the public at large youre liable to find wild ones nothing can guys in scientology in fairly good shape but boy you can find some wild ones in people walking in off the street they after every session they have to go see their priest to get their throat cut or something you know its crazy business you know they cant have sometimes only learn about it they cant have session on saturday because then thats when they go to see their orthodoptrist or something and you say whos this and then you find out he goes to person who puts his feet in machine and turns on bunch of electricity in order to straighten out the bones and this is the general somatic which youve been trying to handle on the case so you can get some weird ones going and they are interesting and you can get very involved with these people but actually hes doing something else hes mixing therapies thats for sure but when you find these things are out why you can correct them one way or the other but when you get right down to handling the actual cs of the run of the mill case the only thing youre trying to do is get enough charge off so that it can run the grade and then boy will it make gain and theres several ways you can do that i havent enumerated all the ways that you could do it but theyre equally simple theyre all the simple idiot order of things like you do little assessment you prep check it you take things like well items connected with his profession do an l1 on it now what determines what you do on it is relatively the mood youre in you say actually im not gagging with it because there is determination on the thing one of the reasons you prepcheck the thing as it comes through one of the reasons why you prepcheck it as it goes through is one the action is easy to do and its totally unlimited and you feel that the item is suppressed or is pushed down the reason you do an l1 is you feel that hes upset about it or arc broken concerning it you got it there is there is reason behind the two things im giving you gag i should be careful of my gags now but theyre simple things and they can apply to anything now youve got in the there are several things which have won out well trying to pull missed withhold by force and duress and so on is very often winds you up in the soup very now and then because you may be going up against low ta case invalidation involved gives you rses all over the track or something dumb like this is liable to occur did it ever occur to you to prepcheck the missed withholds theyll come out just the same you discharge it to point where the guy is willing to look at it because hes sort of out of valence on the whole subject so your best answer to hard to pull missed withholds that you cant get out and that sort of thing your best answer to it is actually prepcheck rather than an auditor pushing him up against the wall with pistol and prepcheck works very well on it your upset conditions are ordinarily best handled with upset conditions are best handled in ordinarily actions with an l1 or some species of list like an l1 it can be handled in two ways one while the pc is upset in the session it can actually be assessed by general assessment to one item which you then give the guy as what is wrong with him in the session that actually can be handled that way to handle session arc break that you dont seem to be able to get to first base on that can be handled that way and that was actually its first reason for design couldnt talk to the pc anymore but you could still assess it and you could go tearing down the line get the one that was left reading indicate the bypassed charge to the pc and you with just absolute magic the pcll just cool right off that can be handled that way can be handled in auditing with an on or in sessions has and then just take that line and clear it take the next line and clear it take the next line and clear it take the next line and clear it those are the two methods of handling an l1 you can always take any list and assess it now the one thing that is adventurous to do is to assess green form that has proven very unsuccessful green form is very successful its handled itsa earlier itsa on cases that do not have very many remedy bs or anything like that they havent had s and d something like this they are connected to suppressive or something such hatting of that is best handled by an s and d with w with your withdraws unmock stop assessment which one is it and then you do that remedy b now and thats done by listing and nulling of course i said an s and d its done by just listing and nulling now your remedy b if environment beads if guy hasnt had too many of them and so on your best bet at environment and so on is in actual fact remedy b new style and what youve got for your student who cant seem to dig it is to find out what the hell subject hes trying to dig while hes trying to study dianetics and scientology it works like bomb you have to find the former subject and what is misunderstood in that in other words the study remedy b now you can also take the dianetics remedy b and you can run it on an psychologist and if youre ever gonna teach him anything you damn well better had and you handle it the same way this doesnt seem to this hasnt been too heavily stressed but you could take in psychology do you see why who or whats been misunderstood something like this then you take that item and youre past but you wait minute were already handling the guys past the guys got some earlier subject than psychology see there was some earlier subject already hung him up so you could say in psychology who or whats been misunderstood and youd get an item and then that straightens out the subject for him sort of remedy with regard to psychology you see or you could make it remedy and you get something and you get an answer and then you list for the earlier subject it was earlier in psychology and then you can find out what was misunderstood in that so theres several ways you can play this cat its all the same thing its all the same action so that we take psychologist he comes in hes unable to understand what were doing he cant dig it any way or whatsoever you can run remedy as though hes studying psychology do you see and get his misunderstood off the field of psychology and then he can study this but that didnt work so you do the deeper one do you understand now your rule in case supervision simply follows this is the reality of the case is proportional to the amount of charge off you want to undertake if possible the simplest possible action undertake the simplest action available and dont undertake the deeper action until the simpler action has proven ineffective and then youve still got shot in your locker now the next thing about it is is all cases going in to review or something like that should be run on some such formulization as green form youll never find out whats wrong with him but youd have to teach people to run the whole green form with lists before you could trust them with it otherwise youre gonna run us fabulous numbers of remedy bs fabulous numbers of s and ds get into all kinds of fire fights all over the place do you understand youll get overreviewing only because theres listing on the green form do you follow then you dont ever permit anybody to ever send anybody over and say what qual should do with them do you understand i mean some organizational executive cannot send the whole staff in for sea checks cannot send the whole staff in for disagreement checks cannot send the whole staff in for you got it to hell with that cause it causes the case supervisor infinite trouble hes got more cases to straighten out now than you can count so youve had given too many sec checks so therefore you make it firm rule that nobody can order qual to do anything and then to do that then you have to hold qual to green form and then youll have to force qual never to run green form past an fn and then dont let them list because thats the one theyll goof up the most and then teach them itsa and eariler itsa anyway do you see the hang of it the administration and the general handling of the case supervisor yes alright very good thank you very much
