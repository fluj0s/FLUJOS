international force east timor interfet was established under australian command and deployed on september 20 1999 australia has continued to play leading role both in operations and on bilateral basis with east timor since 1999 structure of parliament east timors parliament of 88 members is an extension of constituent assembly that was elected in august 2001 and drafted constitution for east timor that went into effect in 2002 east timor at that time was under the administration of the united nations which had taken control in late 1999 after indonesia withdrew from the territory east timor formally became independent on may 20 2002 the new constitution provided for an elected parliament of 52 to 65 members but the constituent assembly declared itself the first national parliament of the new state it is dominated by fretlin the party that led the resistance to indonesian rule the constitution also provided for parliamentary government with largely symbolic popularly elected president the next parliamentary election will be in 2007 the parliament has severe deficiencies most members fought with the fretlin resistance to indonesian rule and entered parliament with legislative experience few members have college or even high school education the business of parliament is hampered by the practice of members using both legal languages tetum and portuguese most legislation originates with the executive branch and parliament rarely amends it however the parliament did originate an important bill to compensate veterans of the anti indonesian resistance committees reportedly do attempt to exercise oversight over the executive branch but the committees have few staff members have personal staff and few computers recent events internal strife and political turmoil events over the past year have led to the deterioration of east timors internal security situation and the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers from australia new zealand portugal and malaysia see chronology below the australian military contingent is the largest with some 1100 troops in country the peacekeepers have been deployed at the invitation of the east timorese government3 3 australian department of defence about operation astute continued crs3 security council resolution 1704 of august 25 2006 established the united nations integrated mission in timorleste unmit that consists of civilian component as well as up to 1608 police personnel and up to 34 military liaison and staff officers unmits mission includes supporting the east timorese government in consolidating stability enhancing culture of democratic governance and facilitating political dialogue among timorese stakeholders in their efforts to bring about process of national reconciliation4 the source of the present strife can be traced to divisions within the dominant fretlin party dating to their period of struggle against the indonesians some fretlin elites went into exile while others including president xanana gusmao stayed behind to fight in falintil which he commanded one way these divisions manifest themselves is in splits within and between the military and police forces the allegiance of most of the military to gusmao appears to have played role in the creation of paramilitary units within the police divisions between the military and the police can be traced to the recruitment process many recruited into the military were xanana loyalists while decision led to over 300 individuals who had earlier served in the indonesian police force in east timor to be hired into the new police of east timor5 in the words of the international crisis group report personal and institutional tensions between president committed to pluralism and ruling party fretlin with distinctly authoritarian tendencies politicisation of the police lack of any regulatory framework for the security forces more generally and the inbred nature of tiny political elite with 30 years shared history allowed matters to get out of control6 the event that triggered the current strife and political turmoil can be traced to the dismissal in march 2006 by former prime minister alkatiri of 591 members of the 1500man military those dismissed had protested their conditions and pay and claimed discrimination against members of the force from western districts of east timor most of the upper echelons of the military are drawn from the eastern districts or loro sae while much of the political leadership and the police are from the western districts or loro munu7 in july 2006 it was reported that the police had broken into factions with some taking their weapons to join rebels in the hills8 the march 2006 dismissal of the protesting troops led to rioting looting number of deaths and the fleeing of tens of thousands of mostly eastern east timorese from the capital dili beginning in april 2006 alkatiri stepped down in june as result the government is now headed by former

transfer of security sector weapons to civilians10 former interior minister rogerio lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to profretlin supporters and fretlinlinked hit squad11 lobato reportedly had frosty relationship with gusmao and had bought large quantities of arms for the police and had established two paramilitary police units12 one of the leaders of the violent protests of march 2006 which resulted in the mutiny of soldiers from western districts is major alfredo reinaldo reinaldos support base is drawn from the west reinaldo and 50 of his supporters escaped from prison in august 2006 australian forces failed to capture reinaldo on march 11 2007 the operation was ordered by the east timor government the decision to apprehend reinaldo was apparently taken after he pursuaded border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles on february 25 2007 the government had previously been in negotiations with reinaldo for killing soldier while fighting against east timorese army units while reinaldo has not been major political figure in east timor he has attracted much support among young men who are increasingly resentful of the foreign military presence in east timor13 reinaldo is resentful of fretlin for ordering the dismissal of protesting troops14 another dimension of the escalating violence in east timor are the gangs of largely unemployed youth unemployment and underemployment is estimated to be as high as 70 in east timor15 with the collapse of law and order in the wake of the may 2006 police and military clashes gang violence swept through dili leading to further deaths the displacement of more dili residents from the capital and the widespread destruction of property16 many of the dili gangs

reconstruction cnrt in the following parliamentary elections in the hope of becoming prime minister19 alkatiri will reportedly seek to defeat gusmao and once again become prime minister as the fretlin candidate the cntr will likely seek the support of the democratic party and the social democratic party it is also thought that gusmao will garner the support of the catholic church which has an overwhelming influence in the country that said fretlin has an extensive political organization that developed its networks over the years of struggle against the indonesians if ramos horta and gusmao who are allies are successful they will in effect trade jobs gusmao is viewed by many as one of the few who can unite the country fretlin is the party that has been most closely associated with bringing independence to east timor and as such retains much support fretlin controls 55 of 88 seats in the constituent assembly there are reportedly factions within fretlin that would support prime minister ramoshorta in the april 9th presidential election east timor held an election on august 30 2001 under the supervision of untaet to elect constituent assembly to draft new constitution and

destroyed sufficient access to potable water and the risk of disease due to poor sanitation is significant problem for idps in camps and elsewhere many of the camps are also at risk for flooding moreover the united nations says that more than 40 of the east timorese population lives below the poverty line with high child mortality rate resulting from lack of sanitation infectious diseases and malnutrition recent rice shortage throughout the country has also been cause for concern deteriorating social structures and services at the community level have greatly affected the capacity to provide health care and education and to respond to natural disasters such as floods and landslides during the rainy season which are common in east timor the united nations childrens fund unicef believes that idps will need humanitarian assistance through 2007 and that the transition from humanitarian programs to development activities will be delayed22 reports indicate that once idps return they will still need food and shelter assistance in february and march 2007 security incidents again increased leading to restrictions on the movement of humanitarian personnel some believe the motivations behind the violent demonstrations may be shifting toward more local gang related incidents concern about displacement due to civil unrest has prompted contingency planning under the national disaster management office ndmo and the ministry of labour and community reinsertion mtrc23 it has also raised concern about humanitarian access and the protection and security of those displaced and for nongovernmental organizations and operations in addition to the peacekeeping operation the international humanitarian aid community includes the united nations international organizations non governmental organizations and donor governments that provide contributions and inkind bilateral assistance the international community is working closely with the east timor red

international legal obligations assessments and training of the border patrol unit were taking place and had moved to the next phase which involved interaction with the indonesian army counterparts however some concerns about progress were also raised by mr hasegawa first significant weaknesses remained in the implementation of capacity building in the justice and finance sectors and international advisory support was seen as critical to continued success there was particular concern about roughly 3000 pending civil and criminal cases second human rights activities would need continued outside supervision and monitoring and with unresolved issues over accountability for the crimes against humanity committed in east timor in 1999 the timing was particularly sensitive third

long40 if gusmao becomes prime minister it appears likely that there would be change in policy on how to resolve past human rights abuses perpetrated by indonesians at the time of east timors independence the 2006 state department country report on human rights practices in east timor viewed the east timorese government as generally respecting the rights of its citizens but found that societal divisions based on regional origin eastern vs western emerged as major problem during the year resulting in widespread discrimination segregation and violence particularly in the capital it also stated that excessive use of force and abuse of authority by the police was problem41 challenges and potential issues for congress the debate over timing the withdrawal of presence when the mandate of the unotil mission was scheduled to end on may 19 2006 questions were raised about whether presence should remain in east timor for another year supporters of continued role argued that east timor was not ready for departure as the institutions of state were too fragile although there were number of the achievements in east timor it remained vulnerable there was need to improve security services and the judiciary and to ensure greater institutional transparency and the rule of law including security and training on the border electoral assistance and advisors in the justice and financial sectors east timor had also requested that the maintain presence on the other hand at the time the united states thought east timor should reduce its reliance on direct assistance from the united nations though with continuing support from the international community in number of important political and economic sectors particularly in strengthening democratic institutions infrastructure economic development and the training of security services42 and east timor could get assistance in other ways from the international community such as the undp the world bank bilateral
