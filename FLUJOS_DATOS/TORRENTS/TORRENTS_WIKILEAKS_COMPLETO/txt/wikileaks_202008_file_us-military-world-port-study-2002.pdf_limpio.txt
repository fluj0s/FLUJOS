is phase i of twophase study the military traffic management commands transportation engineering agency tea has analyzed ports for years with our ports for national defense program we survey the ports that are important to national defense defining their capabilities we then compare these capabilities to the demand imposed by notional unit deploying through the port from this we assess theports ability to meet its requirements this methodology has suited us well in the past however as the deployment windows continue to shrink we are forced to get our conus based deploying forces through the ports faster than ever before compound this with thecontinued economic expansion in many of these areas and it is becoming challenge for the ports to dedicate real estate and facilities to respond to our requirements this is particularly true in the early days of contingency as result tea realized the need for more precise assessment of each ports ability to meet its requirements we realized the need to base each ports requirements on the most demandingoperation plan oplan for that port using our modeling capability we can work with the tremendous quantity of information in an oplan timephased forcedeployment data tpfdd massage the data and extract the detail needed to get an accurate picture of the deployment through each port phase i identifies the quantity of cargo dod plans to send through the seaport and phase ii considers the ports ability to handle their assigned workload port of charleston virginia port authority 16objectives the objectives of this initiative are phase i 1 define the oplanbased timephased flow of cargo through the port during demanding deployment this flow is defined in terms of quantity and square feet 2 allow planners to assign transportation terminal brigadesbattalions ttbs to ports based on workload 3 allow ttbs to adequately prepare for deployment operations 4 validate the need for deploying units to support sea ports of embarkation spoes phase ii 1 assist the port commander in quantifying real estate and facility support needed from the port 2 in instances where the port cannot meet their requirements provide the quantitative basis to help both dod and commercial planners assess potential fixes these fixes could include rerouting cargo to another port in the region retiming the flow or even working through the local and metropolitan planning organizations to solicit federal funds 17methodology when practical ports are analyzed on regional basis this allows planners to examine an entire region at one time evaluating peaks and valleys at groups of neighboring ports in this case the ports of charleston hampton roads jacksonville morehead city new yorknew jerseysavannah and wilmington are all represented in the tpfdd therefore they are all considered in this analysis the following tools are utilized to analyze port workload tpedit tpfdd editor an integrated set of automated processing tools that provides tpfdd editing and analysis capability tpedit allows the analyst to view the tpfdd graphically extract information for the seaport of embarkation spoe of interest edit the tpfdd remove oncall and shortfalled records clean up data issues review data to determine the amount of cargo number or ulnscins quantity square feet short tons measurement tons flowing through the port expanded tpfdd database shared by the simulation models and used for tracking movement requirements at the individual item level of detail using the expanded tpfdd theanalyst can load the tpfdd into the oracle database management system expand the tpfdd cargo detail within oracle to level 6 for the spoe of interest 18target transportability analysis reports generator system of models and programs that provide the capability to generate movementrequirements at the individual item level of detail level 6 the system merges force structure data from the table of organization and equipmenttoe or the modified toe mtoe with equipment characteristics from the department of the army standard equipment characteristic fileecf to create unit equipment tables with target the analyst assigns transport modes by ulncin convoyrail selects transport assets containers 20 and 40 railcars 89 flatcars 60 flatcars 68 dodx railcars determines convoy rail and container requirements fpm reports set of customized reports extracts detailed cargo information from target output files these reports when imported into microsoft excel are the foundation of the port workload effort the graphs are included in the results section of this report 19assumptions the requirements in this report represent c48 the entire duration of the flow through the ports of charleston hamtpon roads jacksonville morehead city new yorknew jersey savannah and wilmington asdefined by the operation plan oplan c48 all records in the plan scheduled to move by sea under military sealift commands msc control c48 the most demanding plan for each port the plan may not necessarily be representative of the flow during an actual deployment tpfdd records not included in this analysis c48 oncall records these records are in the plan but are not scheduled to move they appear with an available to load date ald of 999 c48 shortfalled records these records are in the plan but are not sourced they have not been matched with

railcars 89foot flatcars 60foot flatcars 68foot dodx railcars note commercial motor was not utilized containers are stuffed at their origin target stuffs containers and loads railcars with unit integrity in addition target will not mix unit equipment and containers on the same railcar this may in some instances give high estimate of containers and railcars for each unit if the origin is less than 400 miles from the seaport of embarkation spoe roadable vehicles convoy from origin to spoe if the origin is greater than 400 miles from the spoe roadable vehicles are loaded onto railcars for transport to the spoe all nonroadable vehicles are loaded onto railcars for transport to the spoe the breakbulk category includes cargo coded in the tpfdd as containerizable with dimensions exceeding the allowable dimensions of 20foot container and nonvehicular cargo coded as noncontainerizable 20results the results of this analysis for the ports of charleston hampton roads jacksonville morehead city new yorknew jersey savannah and wilmington figure 1 are in appendix through g respectively the graphs in each appendix represent the cargo arriving at that port asoutlined in the tpfdd they show

some necessary editing in the form of cleaning up data is performed this however does not in any way change the intent of the requirement spelled out in the tpfdd instead it contributesto the accuracy of the final result this is not the case for the analysis of cargo deploying through the port of new yorknew jersey for variety of reasons the tpfdd does not show units from fort drum deploying through the port of new yorknew jersey these units insteadare scheduled to deploy through the port of wilmington north carolina based on discussions with mtmc hq mtmc dsc and others we decided to

agency tea has analyzed ports for years with our ports for national defense program we survey the ports that are important to national defense defining their capabilities we then compare these capabilities to the demand imposed by notional unit deploying through the portbased on this comparison we assess the ports ability to meet its requirements this methodology has suited us well in the past however as the deployment windows continue to shrink we are forced to get our conusbased forces through the ports faster than everbefore compound this with the continued economic expansion in many of these areas and it is becoming challenge for the ports to dedicate the real estate and facilities to respond to our requirements as result tea realized the need for more precise assessment of each ports ability to meet its requirements we realized the need to base each ports requirements on the mostdemanding operation plan oplan for that port using our modeling capability we can work with the tremendous quantity of information in an oplan timephased force deployment data tpfdd massage the data and extract the detail needed to get an accuratepicture of the deployment through each port phase i identifies the quantity of cargo dod plans to send through the strategic seaport and phase ii considers the ports ability to handle their assigned workload port of oakland port of tacoma11objectives the objectives of this initiative are phase i 1 define the oplanbased timephased flow of cargo through the port during demanding deployment this flow is defined in terms of quantity and square feet 2 allow planners to assign transportation terminal brigadesbattalions ttbs to ports based on workload 3 allow ttbs to adequately prepare for deployment operations 4 validate the need for deploying units to support sea ports of embarkation spoes phase ii 1 assist the port commander in quantifying real estate and facility support needed from the port 2 in instances where the port cannot meet their requirements provide the quantitative basis to help both dod and commercial planners assess potential fixes these fixes could include rerouting cargo to another port in the region retiming the flow or even working through the local and metropolitan planning organizations to solicit federal funds12methodology when practical ports are analyzed on regional basis this allows planners to examine an entire region at one time evaluating peaks and valleys at groups of neighboring ports this study includes requirements for the ports of long beach oakland san diego seattle andtacoma there is only small requirement at port hueneme and is therefore not included in this study the following tools are utilized to analyze port workload tpedit tpfdd editor an integrated set of automated processing tools that provides timephased force deployment data tpfdd editing and analysis capability tpedit allows the analyst to view the tpfdd graphically extract information for the seaport of embarkation spoe of interest edit the tpfdd remove oncall and shortfalled records cleanup data issues review data to determine the amount of cargo number of ulnscins quantity square feet short tons measurement tons flowing through the port expanded tpfdd database shared by the simulation models and used for tracking movement requirements at the individual itemlevel of detail using the expanded tpfdd the analyst can load the tpfdd into the oracle database management system expand the tpfdd cargo detail within oracle to level 6 for the spoe of interest 13target transportability

rail and container requirements fpm reports set of customized reports extract detailed cargo information from target output files these reports when imported into microsoft excel are the foundation of the port workload effort the graphs are included in the results section of thisreport 14assumptions the requirements in this report represent c48 the entire duration of the flow through the ports of long beach oakland san diego seattle and tacoma as defined by the operation plan oplan c48 all records in the plan scheduled to move by sea under military sealift commands msc control c48 the most demanding plan for each port as result the same oplan was not used for all ports the plans may not necessarily be representative of the flowduring an actual deployment tpfdd records not included in this analysis c48 oncall records these records are in the plan but are not scheduled to move they appear with an available to load date ald of 999 c48 shortfalled records these records are in the plan but are not sourced they have not been matched with specific unit c48 bulk petroleum oils and lubricants pol records packaged pol is included target uses the following transport assets containers 20foot 40foot convoy vehicles selfpropelled towed railcars 89foot flatcars 60foot flatcars 68foot dodx railcars note commercial motor was not utilized containers are stuffed at their origin target stuffs containers and loads railcars with unit integrity in addition target will not mix unit equipment and containers on the same railcar this may in some instances give high estimate of containers and railcars for each unit if the origin is less than 400 miles from the seaport of embarkation spoe roadable vehicles convoy from origin to spoe if the origin is greater than 400 miles from the spoe roadable vehicles are loaded onto railcars for transport to the spoe all nonroadable vehicles are loaded onto railcars for transport to the spoe the breakbulk category includes cargo coded in the tpfdd as containerizable with dimensions exceeding the allowable dimensions of 20foot container and nonvehicular cargo coded as noncontainerizable15results the charts in this report represent the daily cargo arrival in terms of quantity and square feet at the respective port the cargo consists of containers wheeled vehicles tracked vehicles floating craft aircraft and breakbulk the wheeled and tracked vehicles are categorized by weight as shown in table below this study includes the following ports appendix port of long beach appendix b port of oakland appendix c port of san diego and appendix d port of san diegoassault follow on echelon afoe appendix port of seattle and appendix f port of tacoma the requirements for the port of sandiego are presented in appendices c and d cargo to be transported via military sealift command msc ship is presented in appendixc in addition there is marine corps afoe scheduled to arrive at the port navy amphibious ships will most likely transport the afoe but the requirements still need to be taken into consideration since they will compete forresources at the port the study does not include port hueneme since there is only small requirement

management commands transportation engineering agency tea has analyzed ports for years with our ports for national defense program we survey the ports that are important to national defense defining their capabilities we then compare these capabilities to the demand imposed by notional unit deploying through the portbased on this comparison we assess the ports ability to meet its requirements this methodology has suited us well in the past however as the deployment windows continue to shrink we are forced to get our conusbased forces through the ports faster than everbefore compound this with the continued economic expansion in many of these areas and it is becoming challenge for the ports to dedicate the real estate and facilities to respond to our requirements this is particularly true in the early days of contingency as result tea realized the need for more precise assessment ofeach ports ability to meet its requirements we realized the need to base each portsrequirements on the most demanding operation plan oplan for that port using ourmodeling capability we can work with the tremendous quantity of information in an oplan timephased force deployment data tpfdd massage the data and extract the detail needed to get an accurate picture of the deployment through each port phase i identifies the quantity of cargo dod plans to send through the strategic seaport and phase ii considers the ports ability to handle their assigned workload 4objectives the objectives of this initiative are phase i 1 define the oplanbased timephased flow of cargo through the port during demanding deployment this flow is defined in terms of quantity and square feet 2 allow planners to assign transportation terminal brigadesbattalions ttbs to ports based on workload 3 allow ttbs to adequately prepare for deployment operations 4 validate the need for deploying units to support sea ports of embarkation spoes phase ii 1 assist the port commander in quantifying real estate and facility support needed from the port 2 in instances where the port cannot meet their requirements provide the quantitative basis to help both dod and commercial planners assess potential fixes these fixes could include rerouting cargo to another port in the region retiming the flow or even working through the local and metropolitan planning organizations to solicit federal funds5methodology when practical ports are analyzed on regional basis this allows planners to examine an entire region at one time evaluating peaks and valleys at groups of neighboring ports although they are not located in the same geographical region the three ammunition portswere grouped together because of the uniqueness of their mission the same tpfdd was not used for the three ports the following tools are utilized to analyze port workload tpedit tpfdd editor an integrated set of automated processing tools that provides tpfdd editing and analysis capability tpedit allows the analyst to view the tpfdd graphically

tpfdd cargo arrives at the port from four origins as shown in figure 1 two of the origins elemendorf afb and fort richardson are located adjacent to the port depending on thecircumstances the cargo from these origins will either 1 depoy to the port where it is staged and later loaded aboard the ship or 2 stage at the origin and be called forward directly to the ship the data in this report represents the more demanding option for the port option one however the data for option two is more appropriate in some instances and is included as appendix the first set of graphs figures 2 and 3

the mtmc south atlantic outport sao this facility has about 85 acres of open area available for marshaling the mtmc sao is often used to support ammunition loading navy base between the columbus street and north charleston terminals is closing navy base with about 1500 acres that could be used for marshaling plans in accordance with president clintons policy to revitalize communities include private shipbuilding and repair other heavy industry and housing for the homeless in spite of the overall size of the base the landfill may be the only open area that will remain available for future marshaling about 25 acres of grass covered open area can be used to marshal military vehicles material handling equipment mhe the terminals have total of 18 container cranes half of these are at the wando welch terminal the union pier terminal has railmounted cranes at all the port owns and operates all the mhe in the chart below although our throughput analysis does not account for the floating roro ramp the portable ramp can greatly increase roro shipping throughput the ramp can handle vehicles up to 100tons and can operate at any of the four terminals with less than days notice the ramp

intermodal area approximately 1200 linear feet that is now regularly handling tainers to and from double stack railcars future development the port hopes to develop 800 acres of land on the southwest section of daniel island this island between wando welch and north charleston terminals will bedeveloped in phases eventually the port expects csx andor ns to provide double stack service to thenew container facility trucks willhave easy access to i526 future daniel island terminal 18ii throughput analysis general this section evaluates the throughput capability of the port of charleston using the port opera tional performance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weak link analysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of measurement tons mton per day terminal throughput subsystems this analysis assumes maximum of 80 per cent of the port facilities can be made avail able at any one time for this reason we ran all port analyses using an 80 percent facilityuse factor also the ship mix is based on desert shield and desert storm statistics we weighted the percentages to adjust fordifferences in cargo deadweights and expec tations for future deployments terminal handling shipping staging19terminal receptionhandling highway i26 and 526 provide access to the port terminals each terminal has designated entrance for trucks the road network in and out of the terminals including the gate processing of vehiclescould handle about 290000 mton of equipment and supplies per day roadable vehicles in convoys will process directly to the staging areas vehicles on commercial or military flatbed trailers without integral ramps will offload at portable ramps there are per manent truck end ramps at any of the terminals our analysis assumes the port can acquire or build two portable or temporary truck ramps at each of the four terminals these ramps could offload more than 38000 mton from flatbed trailers per day supplies in van semitrailers will proceed to roughly 220 vanhandling positions these docks can offload more than 198000 mton of van semitrailershipped materials per

rates as well as berthship compatibility conversion factors breakbulk 4 ston per mton roro 25 ston per mton containers 4 ston per mton the type of ship preferred at each berth is based on the methodology described in appendix b the evaluation is based on snapshot view of the current physical characteristics of the berthsand the mhe available the evaluation to the right gives considerations for enhancements such as equipment the floating roro ramp was not considered if it is available for military operations it would greatly improve roro loading at any of the berths the lower the numberfor berth the better the berth is suitable for the loading operation the wando welch berths are well suited for loading any type of shipthey are highly rated on the chart because of the cranes container freight station and age howeverwhen rail access is considered thecolumbus street terminal berth 12is the best choice for military opera tions furthermore the wando welch aprons are 16 feet

xviiith airborne corps corps support command from fort bragg north carolina usingprimarily fss vessels in 6 days of reception and handling the august 1994 revision for the planning orders digest issued by marad provided agreements for military use of the port of charleston these agreements have been renewed until 15 june 1996 the planning orders call for the use of the following facilities at the north charleston terminal 20 acres open staging and berths 1 2 and 3 total 2430 feet of berthing the south atlantic outport sao is adjacent tothe north charleston terminal requirements units making up this corps slice of the xviiith airborne corps remain unidentified for thisanalysis we assume the unit will require 6000 vehicles by convoy 1000 per day 1380 railcars230 per day and 420 containers 70 per day three fsssized vessels will load simultaneously each sustained loading operation will conduct three shiploading cycles for total of nine fsssized shiploads 27terminal inprocessinghandling highway terminal operators at the north charleston terminal should open either of the two gates on remount road directly accessible from interstate routes 26 and 526 depending on the available staging at the time of deployment convoys would enter the sao gate or the north charles ton terminal gate an exclusive gate between the two areas allows vehicles to traverse from one facility to the other remount road and these two gates can easily handle 1500 vehicles per daywithout causing significant delays in traffic this meets the 1000 vehicle per day requirement as convoys arrive support personnel account for the vehicles and send them to staging areas or directly to shipside for loading they direct nonroadable equipment arriving by commercial or military truck or on flatbed trailer to the container stuffing station for unloading and subsequent staging 28rail two major railroads serve the north charleston terminal the norfolk southern and the csx the north charleston terminal can accommodate and unload more than 50 each 89foot railcarsper cycle the terminals general manager states that they can unload four blocks of cars daily for total of 200 cars per day the saos tracks can hold 76 89foot railcars the railroads normally spot block of cars at the outport at night for working the next day providing adequatesupport by the railroads the outport can unload at least two blocks of cars or 152 cars per day sao unloads railcars at two ramp positions the first is located at the foot of track which is about 2700 feet long the second is ramp on f track which is about 1800 feet long the north charleston terminal uses two heavy duty portable ramps rated at 90tons for unloading wheeled vehicles and tracks from railcars the terminal places these ramps wherever they choose to do rail offload operations the two spurs in the open area near berth 3 are each about 1000 feet long assuming four cycles at each ramp per day the north charleston terminal and sao together can support offloading about 260 railcars per day 29staging this analysis assumes that nine fsssized ships will deploy the unit three ships will depart every 2 days because of this the staging requirement is to support three sustained loading oper ations although an fssload of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 acres are required for the staging of the46 containers for each fss the three simultaneous ship loading operations will require 48 acres of open staging of which about 6 acres are dedicated to containers the north charleston terminal has approximately 185 acres of open staging area this space is normally used to storestage containers about 30 of this area about 55 acres is likely to be immediately available to support military deployments the south atlantic outport sao has more than 85 acres of open area that can be used for stag ing equipment we expect the availability of most of saos staging area the staging area at thenorth charleston terminal and the sao total 140 acres this exceeds the 48 acres needed to sup port three fsslmsr vessel operations however the 20 acres provided in the planning orders do not meet the requirements 30shipping although this analysis assumes that nine fsssized ships can deploy the unit the number of ships required depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would consist of all eight fss ships plus one cape h roro ship the requirement is to work three fss or lmsrsized ships concurrently berths 13 at the north charleston terminal can accommodate two of these ships and the sao can accommodate onetogether the two facilities can fully support the requirement however the 2430 feet of apron provided in the planning orders do not meet the requirement 31summary the combination of the north charleston terminal and the south atlantic outport has adequate characteristics to support the deployment of the units the planning orders alone are insufficient recommendation in addition to the facilities provided in the planning orders we recommend the military negotiatefor the following facilities berthing for an additional fss sized vessel staging area of an additional 28 acres 5800 feet of tangential track for rail offloading operations 2 to 4 rail end ramps depending on number of spursport of hampton

the port operational performance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weaklinkanalysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capa ble subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the termi nal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging andterminal processinghandling in measurement tons mton per day terminal throughput subsystems this analysis assumes maximum of 80 per cent of the port facilities can be made avail able at any one time for this reason we ranall port analyses using an 80 percent facility use factor also the ship mix is based on desert shield and desert storm statisticswe weighted the percentages to adjust for differences in cargo deadweights and expec tations for future deployments terminal handling shipping staging18receptionhandling highway i64 664 and 264 provide access to the terminals each terminal has designated

throughput capability for deploying notional air assault division using primarily fss vessels the august 1994 revision for the planning orders digest issued by marad provided agreements for military use of the port of jacksonville these agreements have been renewed until 15 june 1996 the planning orders call for the use of13 acres open staging 3000 feet of berthing and adequate warehouse space at the blount island terminal requirements the likely requirement for the port of jacksonville is to deploy an air assault division in six days of reception and throughput the division will likely come from fort campbell kentucky about627 miles from the port the movement to the port will require 1095 182 per day railcars using the allrail option about 110 containers would arrive per day 23terminal inprocessinghandling highway should military vehicles arrive by convoy they will enter the blount island terminal from heck scher drive florida route 105 over the bridge linking the island to dames point heckscherdrive intersects with several highways including i95 i295 and us 17 the road entering theterminal has four lanes port support activity personnel assist port police in receiving military vehicles at the terminal gate and directing them to processing area rail csx railroad serves the blount island terminal directly and switches all rail cars on the island two other railroads the norfolk southern and the floridaeast coast have intermodal ramps located only short distance 7 miles from the terminal at the imeson industrial park the citys former airport csx also operates the busch switch yard with capacity for approximately 250cars about 6 miles from the blount island terminal this yard alone could meet the requirement for rail receptionand storage the terminal can only receive and store about 95 railcars per day without disrupting commercialoperations the spurs at the two fixed ramps in the usmc area east of the terminal can each support offload ing of about 20 railcars this analysis will also assume one spur of the intermodal yard is avail able to support offloading an additional 15 railcars with portable ramp conducting four switching cycles per day at these three offloading areas would offload about 220 railcars per daythis exceeds the requirement additionally dedicated switch engine will assure smooth efficient reception 24staging although an fssload of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about two acres are required for the staging ofthe 70 containers for each fss the current size of an air assault division requires 62 fsssized ships to deploy we assume 6 fss vessels and small notional roro ambassadorsenator class will be used this requires the port to simultaneously perform two sustained fss loading operations 16 acres each at the same time as onetime small roro loading operation 4 acres this requirement of 36 acres for staging is conservative for two reasons we assume the small roro vessel will load in the early stages of the deployment the staging requirement would beless if the small roro would load with the final two fsssized vessels the final two fss load ing operations are longer sustained operations and therefore would only require 10 acres each we also assume the ambassadorsenator class vessel will sail fully loaded about 40 percent of anfssload this assumption will allow the final two fsssized vessels to sail with less than full loads or with reduced stow factor the planning orders only call for 13 acres of staging this is not enough to meet the 36acre requirement as shown below additional staging to meet the requirement is available at the terminal the blount islandterminal contains over 680 acres of which more than 400 is open and used for stagingcommercial cargo two tran sit sheds provide 360000 square feet of covered stagingarea discussions with per sonnel from the mtmc cape canaveral outport and portoperators indicate that about 75 acres are usually available the marine corps 160 acreswill also likely be available usmc operations will likely be complete before the division arrives 25shipping the requirement is to berth three ships simultaneously for two days at least two of these ships are to be fsssized the planning orders provide berthing for three fsssized vessels this meets the requirement the remaining four days of the deployment will only require berthing fortwo fsssized vessels although this analysis assumes 62 fsssized ships can deploy the air assault division the table below provides ship quantities for various ship types the number of ships required depends on the shipping mix selected summary the blount island marine terminal has adequate characteristics to support the deployment of anair assault division the current planning orders do not provide enough staging area the 3000 feet of berthing is sufficient to meet the requirement recommendation we recommend revising the marad planning order digest to include an additional 23 acres ofstaging and 5500 feet of tangential track unit movement requirements airborne assault division vessel type number

for the planning orders digest issued by marad provided an agreement for the military to use the port of morehead city it called for use of berth 67 berth 89 and 7 acres of adjacent open storage although these agreements expired 1 july 1995 we expect they will be renewed without sig nificant change until 15 june 1997 new planning orders are being considered at the time ofthis publication facilities likely to be used for military operations 17requirements the likely requirement for the port of morehead city is to deploy notional mechanized infantry brigade in 6 daysthe brigade has to move about 2600 vehicles and 220 containers the move ment to the port will require 360 railcars60 per day using the convoyrail option under this option about 1200 205 per day roadable vehicles would

theaccess roads and gates can handle well over 1000 vehi cles per day rail the railyard within the port area can receive only about 50 railcars without disrupting the simultaneous commercial operations this does not meet the requirement of the unit there are other railcarstorage locations on radio island and areas west of the port that could store in excess of 125 cars the fixed ramp west of warehouse 6 can support offloading eight railcars the ports portable end ramp can easily support offloading seven additional railcars at any of several locations we recommend using the adjacent track also west of warehouse 6 if available offloading these 15 railcars every 5 hours will meet the 60 railcar per day requirement19staging this analysis assumes that current downsizing continues and that three fsssized ships will deploy an entire notional mechanized infantry brigade one ship will depart every two days although an fss load of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 acres are required for staging tainers in addition to the acreage in the august 1994 planning orders nine more acres arerequired if the acreage on the port is not available the adjacent radio island could provide offsite staging to meet the 16 acre requirement 20shipping although this analysis assumes that three fsssized ships can deploy the notional mechanized infantry brigade the tablebelow provides ship quantities for the current brigade size the number of ships required depends on the shippingmix selected berth 89 can support fss and lmsr operation this berth alone meets the requirement the apron of berth 67 is too narrow for fss side ramp operations but lmsrvessels can load by placing the stern ramp between the

military ocean terminal in bayonne new jersey is sighted for closure at present there are firm plans for its commercial development20 ii throughput analysis general this section evaluates the throughput capability of the five selected terminals of the port of new york and new jersey we determined the throughput capabilities using the port operational performance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal themodel yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of measurement tons mton per day terminal throughput subsystems this analysis assumes maximum of 80 percent of the port facilities at each terminal can be made available at any one time for this reason we ranall port analyses using an 80

vessels in january 1996 marad and the port authorityof new yorknew jersey agreed on planning orders as shown below requirements this analysis assumes the requirement for the port of new york and new jersey is to deploy anotional mechanized infantry division in 6 days of reception and throughput the division has tomove about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the movement to the port will require 1055 176per day railcars using the convoyrail option under this option about 3650 610 per day roadable vehicles would be driven and about 2320 387 per day would be towedplanning order facilities

at present the rail capability of the howland hook terminal is uncertain access from the rail line in new jersey to staten island has been inactive for several years mtmc believes therail line will be restored to meet the dod clearance and weight requirements in late 1996 or 1997 once rail access is fully restored the howland hook terminal and the arlington railyard on staten island could together receive more than 120 railcars per day the railyards in and around the port newark and elizabeth terminals can receive about 240 rail cars of military equipment per day this capacity along with the capacity on staten island is sufficient to meet the requirement the only location at the howland hook terminal that can support rail offloading is along the wharf just inland of the container cranes placing portable or temporary rail end ramp at the end of each of the two spurs and conducting four switching cycles per day would offload about160 railcars per day the mtmc port operator should insure the rail offloading operations leaveaccess to the shiploading area if necessary the container cranes could be used for direct loadingfrom the railcars to the ship the landuse map for the port elizabeth terminal shows numerous rail spurs that might support flatcar offloading this analysis assumes the tracks along the warehouses at the north end of ter minal will be available two portable or temporary rail end ramps at these spurs can support off loading total of about 25 railcars at the same time assuming four cycles per day these rampscould offload about 100 railcars per day these ramps and those at the howland hook terminalcould offload total of about 260 railcars per day this capability meets the requirement35staging this analysis assumes that current downsizing continues and that nine fsssized ships will deploy an entire notional mechanized infantry division three ships will depart every 2 days because of this the staging requirement is to support three sustained loading operations two at the howland hook terminal and one at berth 96 of the port elizabeth terminal sealand although an fss load of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 acres are required for staging the 73 containers for each fss the three simultaneous shiploading operations will require 48 acres of openstaging of which about 6 acres are dedicated to containers this analysis assumes the militarywill use 32 acres at the howland hook terminal and 16 acres at the port elizabeth terminal berth 96 the planning orders allocates 35 acres to the howland hook terminal and another 35 to the port elizabeth terminal this exceeds the requirement36shipping although this analysis assumes that only nine fsssized ships can deploy the notionalmechanized infantry division the numberof ships required depends on the shippingmix selected the best ship mix would consist of all eight fss ships plus two cape hroro ships the requirement is to berth two fsssized vessels at the howland hook terminal andone at berth 96 of the port elizabeth terminal the berthing capabilities tables earlierin this report show the port has over 25berths capable of supporting fss operationsmost of these are at the port newarkelizabeth terminal the planning orders how ever only provide for two fss berths one at howland hook and one at

performance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weak link analysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of measurement tons mton per day terminal throughput subsystems this analysis assumes maximum of 80 of the port facilities can be made available at any one timefor this reason we ran all port analyses using an 80 facility use factor also the ship mix is based on desert shield and desert storm statistics weweighted the percentages to adjust for differences in cargo deadweights and expectations for future deployments terminal handling shipping staging11receptionhandling highway us 17 74 76 and 421 provide good highway access to the port the road network into and out of the port including the gate processing of the vehicles could handle about 190000 mton of equipment and supplies per day roadable vehicles in convoys will process directly to the staging areas vehicles on commercial or military flatbed trailers without integral ramps will offload at port ramps the port has permanent ramp with four handling positions at berth 12 this ramp could offload about 19000 mton from flatbed

evaluation comparison is made of the characteristics of each berth and the list of ideal factors required to support the different ship mixes tables b1 through b3 give the ideal factors for breakbulk roro and containership mix operations as the tables show points are awarded for each factor these are then used to compare the potential for each factor these are then used to compare the potential of each berth to support the three ship mixes ranking of individual berths is established for each type of ship mix operation based on comparison of total points accumulated by each berth the berth

study isbased on that site survey and 1999 2000 validation with the beaumont port authority this is astrategic port that can throughput divisionsize unit and can accommodate vessels as large as thelmsr or fss the port is made up of five wharf areas berths 1 24 57 harbor island marine terminal himt and carroll street wharf csw berths of importance for deployment are himt cswand 24 these three berths each have water depth of at least 38 feet and length of at least 1200feet berths himt csw and 24 are all called out in the port planning orders issued by themaritime administration the port of beaumont is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge operations this port is rail accessible by the burlington northernsanta fe union pacific and kansas city southern rail lines and has an airport about 10 miles away the nearest airport can handle c130 aircraft available mhe include wharf crane floating crane mobile cranes of various capacity andtype container handler and various forklifts for palletized cargo some of the mhe is availablethrough local stevedores the port also has both truck and rail end ramps for offloading semitrailers and railcars the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of about 21760 ston total port per day roro and container throughputs are 25800 ston and 6960 ston per day respectively the us military will most likely use himt csw and berths 24 with associated open storage areas for an actual deployment for this application we analyzed notional armored divisiondeploying from the port of beaumont on lmsr ships using berths 24 himt and csw anotional armored division has 101350 ston of vehicles and equipment to meet port closurerequirement of 6 days deploying notional armored division needs to throughput 16900 ston101350 ston in 6 days of vehicles and equipment that includes 90 containers each day at the port of beaumont when the six lmsrs are available for loading the port has the potential to meet the shipping requirements if all facilities and resources are available smaller ships willrequire additional time andor berths for sustained deployment operations about 25 acres of open staging are desired per lmsr for total of 75 acres per day for three lmsr berths the desired open staging for an fss is about16 acres per ship for deployment for total of 48 acres per day for 3berth operations the portport of beaumont mtmctea 3has total of 83 acres of open staging dispersed throughout the port almost all of the 83 acres are either paved gravel or stabilized these staging areas are not contiguous and may cause disruptions in traffic flow during an all out deployment the notional armored division will require 169 railcars per day for convoyrail deployment rail traffic to the port was two trains per day two in and two out in september 1997 with max imum of 85 railcars per train the 596 th us army transportation terminal group estimates rail traffic to beaumont during deployment to be about 225 275 railcars per day the estimatesand past experience indicate that the port can meet the minimum rail requirements computer simulation showed that the port is capable of achieving closure for throughputting notional armored division in 8 plus days using lmsr vessels this estimate falls on the conservative side of 55 82 day closure range based on several computer simulations performed for beaumont the ship transfer time noncontiguous open staging and lack of specialized container handling equipment are among the various factors that could contribute to extending port closurefrom 6 days to over 8 days the port of beaumont can easily handle heavy armored cavalry regiment within 6 days if all facilities and resources are availableport of beaumont mtmctea 4ii general data the port of beaumont is strategic port on the us gulf coast that has been used by the us military for numerous exercises and deployments team

deploying notional heavy armored cavalry regimentrequires about 5210 ston of vehicles and equipment that includes 24 containers per day to beloaded to meet port closure requirement of 6 days deploying notional armored cavalry division requires about 16900 ston of vehicles and equipment plus 90 containers per day to beloaded when two lmsrs are available for loading in sequence the port meets the shipping requirements for notional heavy armored cavalry regiment if all facilities and resources are available computer simulations also show that the port is capable of achieving closure forthroughputting notional armored cavalry regiment in about 6 days using lmsr vessels the port of corpus christi cannot meet shipping requirements for deploying notional armored division to meet 6day deployment requirement the port would need three lmsr ship berthsfor deployment using lmsr ships we also analyzed deployment using fss and other rorovessels at cd 8 1415 and 9 even with six fss and three other roro vessels available for loading the port does not meet the shipping requirements for notional armored division com puter simulations show closure for notional armored division takes over 9 days using fss andother roro vessels at cd 8 1415 and 9 we consider the 9day estimate to be on the optimisticside smaller ships will require additional time or berths for loadout for deployment operations about 25 acres of staging are desired per lmsr to support daily tained loading operations for division or brigade the desired staging for an fss is about16 acres per ship to support daily sustained loading operations cd 8 and 1415 have more than 25 acres of paved open staging plus an additional 15 acres of stabilized compacted surface open staging cd 9 is supported by more than 25 acres of open storage 7 acres paved 15 acres stabilized surface plus additional stabilized and unimproved open storage another 11625 acres ofstabilizedunimproved open staging exists throughout the port the notional heavy armored cavalry regiment will require 54 railcars per day using the railcon voy option notional armored division will require about 170 railcars per day using the railconvoy option the port states that they can handle 3 trains per day with maximum of 200 railcars although this shows the port can handle rail requirements the port cannot deploy notional armored division in 6 days because it does not have three lmsr berths and cannot load the division aboard the ships in 6 days 9 days optimisticallyport of corpus christi mtmctea 4ii general data the port of corpus

conducted site survey of the port of galveston in september 1997 this ports for national defense study is based on that site survey and 1999 2000 validation with the galveston port authority this porta mediumsize port located on galveston island can easily throughput brigadesize units and canaccommodate vessels as large as the lmsr the port is made up of various piers and quays the premier berth berth 10 is 1346 feet long with water depth of 40 feet and has four container cranes it also has 44 acres of paved open storage this berth has potential for outloading army brigades but is also currently subleased bythe port of houston for container operations to supplement those at barbours cut in houston the port of galveston is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge operations this port is rail accessible by the burlington northernsanta fe and union pacific rail lines and has an airport 5 miles away the airport has handled c130s and b727s in the past available materials handling equipment include transtainer and port packers for container handling plus forklifts forpalletized cargo mobile cranes are available through local stevedores the port also has bothtruck and rail end ramps for offloading semitrailers and railcars the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of about 40930 ston 157130 mton per day roroand container throughputs are about 48400 ston and 14500 ston per day respectively computer simulations show that the port is capable of achieving closure for throughputting notionalarmored cavalry regiment in about 6 days if all facilities and resources are available the us military would most likely use berth 10 plus surrounding open staging area and adja cent covered storage for an actual deployment for this application we analyzed notional heavyarmored cavalry regiment deploying from the port of galveston on lmsr ships using berth 10a notional heavy armored cavalry regiment has about 31350 ston 130680 mton of vehiclesand equipment to deploy notional heavy armored cavalry regiment in 6 days the port mustthroughput about 5210 ston of vehicles and equipment that includes 24 containers per daywhen two lmsrs are available for loading in sequence the port meets the shipping requirements smaller ships will require additional time or berths for sustained deployment operations 25 acres of open staging per lmsr are desired to support daily sustained loading operations the desired staging for an fss is about 16 acres per ship tosupport daily sustained loading operations berths 10 and 14 combined have 50 acres the notional heavy armored cavalry regiment will require 54 railcars per day using the rail convoy option the port states that they can handle between 48 trains per day at 100 railcars pertrainport of galveston mtmctea 3ii general data the port of galveston texas is port on the us gulf coast considered for use in deploying military

uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading orunloading staging and terminal receptionhandling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show thethroughput yields in ston throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations simi larly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 70 percent of the time in developing thethroughput scenario we used statistical datadeveloped from analysis of deployments thatoccurred during operations desert shield anddesert storm these data helped us develop amix of vessels likely to support military deployment operations we further weighted the mix percentages to adjust for differences in cargo and expectations for future deployment terminal

authority this porta mediumsize port located on galveston island can easily throughput brigadesize units and canaccommodate vessels as large as the lmsr the port is made up of various piers and quays the premier berth berth 10 is 1346 feet long with water depth of 40 feet and has four container cranes it also has 44 acres of paved open storage this berth has potential for outloading army brigades but is also currently subleased bythe port of houston for container operations to supplement those at barbours cut in houston the port of galveston is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge operations this port is rail accessible by the burlington northernsanta fe and union pacific rail lines and has an airport 5 miles away the airport has handled c130s and b727s in the past available materials handling equipment include transtainer and port packers for container handling plus forklifts forpalletized cargo mobile cranes are available through local stevedores the port also has bothtruck and rail end ramps for offloading semitrailers and railcars the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of about 40930 ston 157130 mton per day roroand container throughputs are about 48400 ston and 14500 ston per day respectively computer simulations show that the port is capable of achieving closure for throughputting notionalarmored cavalry regiment in about 6 days if all facilities and resources are available the us military would most likely use berth 10 plus surrounding open staging area and adja cent covered storage for an actual deployment for this application we analyzed notional heavyarmored cavalry regiment deploying from the port of galveston on lmsr ships using berth 10a notional heavy armored cavalry regiment has about 31350 ston 130680 mton of vehiclesand equipment to deploy notional heavy armored cavalry regiment in 6 days the port mustthroughput about 5210 ston of vehicles and equipment that includes 24 containers per daywhen two lmsrs are available for loading in sequence the port meets the shipping requirements smaller ships will require additional time or berths for sustained deployment operations 25 acres of open staging per lmsr are desired to support daily sustained loading operations the desired staging for an fss is about 16 acres per ship tosupport daily sustained loading operations berths 10 and 14 combined have 50 acres the notional heavy armored cavalry regiment will require 54 railcars per day using the rail convoy option the port states that they

uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading orunloading staging and terminal receptionhandling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show thethroughput yields in ston throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations simi larly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 70 percent of the time in developing thethroughput scenario we used statistical datadeveloped from analysis of deployments thatoccurred during operations desert shield anddesert storm these data helped

military traffic management command transportation engineering agency conducted site survey of the port of houston in september 1997 this ports for national defense study is basedon that site survey and 1999 2000 validation with the houston port authority this port hugefacility with ample capability in various operations can easily throughput brigadesize units andcan accommodate vessels as large as the fss or lmsr the port is made up of quays at several terminals the premier terminal is barbours cut very busy ultramodern intermodal terminal this terminal has 6000foot long quay and waterdepth of 42 feet it is capable of berthing lmsr and fss vessels the apron height 19 feet is atthe upper limit for these vessels at the time of the port survey barbours cut terminal was operating at peak capacity and the houston port authority had worked an agreement with the port ofgalveston for subleasing pier 10 from military usefulness standpoint the other terminals are turning basin woodhouse care and jacintoport due to the lack of large turning basin none of these terminals are fss or lmsr capable also the i610 bridge has an air clearance of only 135 feet at mean high waterwhich negates fss accessibility to the turning basin terminal the port of houston is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge operations this port is rail accessible by the burlington northernsanta fe and union pacific rail lines and has two commercial airports and united states air force base within 12 miles of the turning basin terminal between these airports the military services should not encounter any problems for landing takeoff of larger military aircraft available materials handling equipment mhe include tran stainers container cranes mobile cranes container handlers forklifts and floating derrickmobile cranes and other mhe are available through local stevedores the port also has bothtruck and rail end ramps for offloading semitrailers and railcars the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has total mixed throughput capability of about 97800 ston 371000 mton per dayroro and container throughput capabilities are 114360 ston and 78800 ston respectively the terminal most desirable for deployment is barbours cut due to the 42foot water depth close proximity to open water and greater ease in ability to turn ships this terminal is compatible withberthing fss and lmsr vessels and has ample staging the barbours cut terminal is also thebusiest in the port much of the staging area is constantly covered with containers

terminal because the port of houstons port authority suggested woodhouse terminal as an alternative for military deployments woodhouse terminal is small but viable terminalfor throughputting brigaderegimentsize unit this terminal cannot handle fss or lmsr vessels because of lack of access to turning basin however vessels as large as the cape d andcape h can access the woodhouse terminal notional heavy armored cavalry regiment has about 31350 ston 130680 mton of vehicles and equipment to meet port closure require ment of 6 days deploying notional heavy armored cavalry regiment requires about 5210 stonof vehicles and equipment that includes 24 containers per day to be loaded when two lmsrsare available for loading in sequence at barbours cut terminal the port meets the shippingrequirements if all facilities and resources are available deployment of the regiment usingcape d or h vessels at woodhouse terminal does not meet the 6day requirement but is within65 days smaller ships will require additional time or berths for deployment operations about 25 acres of staging are desired per lmsr to support daily tained loading operations the desired staging for an fss is about 16 acres per ship to supportdaily sustained loading operations open storage requirements are dependent upon cargo arrivalto the port smooth loading operations on the cargo vessel and ship arrival the barbours cutterminal has about 203 acres however almost all of this open storage is used on daily basiswoodhouse terminal has about 17 acres of available paved open storage sufficient for cape hor cape d vessel the notional heavy armored cavalry regiment will require 54 railcars per day using the railcon voy option the port states that they handle 42000 railcars per month or 1400 per

port is in the planning stages for building the bayport container terminal terminal sim ilar to barbours cut scheduled completion is 3 years away 2 the port plans to build dock 33 new ship berth designed for berthing ships up to 1000 feet long because of the restrictions of the channel going into the turning basin the port will likelyplace restrictions on navigation of ships longer than 750 feet such restrictions could include nav igation during daylight hours only andor passing traffic scheduled completion is 3 years away explosives and hazardous cargo operations any shipment of

based on the port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity of the port of houston the pops model uses weaklink analysis to deter mine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloadingstaging and terminal receptionhandling the least capable subsystem defines the maximumthroughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughputyields in ston throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 70 percent ofthe time in developing the throughput scenario weused statistical data developed from analysis ofdeployments that occurred during operationsdesert shield and desert storm these data helpedus develop mix of vessels likely to support

vessels container roro breakbulk and barges the port of houston is fully capable of supporting us military deployment operations this port does have several constraints currently the turning basin woodhouse jacintoport andcare terminals do not have the capability to turn vessels larger than 750 feet also the air draftgoing to these same terminals is 135 feet mhw these constraints appear to limit fsslmsroperations solely to the barbours cut terminal due to the heavy container business that the port of houston does at barbours cut the availability of berths and the surrounding open and covered staging areas during contingency is questionable the port may experience difficulty in clearingstaging areas at barbours cut in sufficient time to adequately support military operationsundoubtedly military deployments will likely disrupt commercial business and affect both theport and commercial shippers at barbours cut the port barbours cut can accommodate vessels as large as the lmsr and fss as shown in the berthing characteristics table operations at the other terminals require vessels larger than750 feet size of the cape h the woodhouse terminal appears to have potential for militarydeployments and exercises it has ample wharf space rail access ample open and coveredstorage and appears readily available on daily basis the largest ship that can access this terminal is the cape h of the transportation subsystems analyzed the least capable is the shiploading the port has mixed throughput capability of at least 97800 ston during the september 1997 visit

limitsport of houston mtmctea 36iv application general this section evaluates the ports throughput capability for deploying notional heavy armored cavalry regiment our analysis covers two potential deployment scenarios barbours cut andwoodhouse terminal barbours cut is evaluated because it is the only terminal at the port ofhouston that can currently handle fsslmsr size ships woodhouse terminal is also chosen because the port authority suggested this terminal as an alternative for military deployment to the busy barbours cut terminal the port authoritys suggestion would prevent disruption of commercial container business at barbours cut however fsslmsr ships are too large and cannotturn around for operations at the woodhouse terminal the barbours cut terminal is largeenough to handle divisionsize unit but this terminal is heavily used and the military will notlikely get access to more than one ship berth for this analysis we assume that other military units will be competing for these facilities dur ing the time that the heavy armored cavalry regiment occupies the port we further assume that the required assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately load the ship andclear the port to evaluate the ports deployment capability we used the port simulation portsim model to flow unit equipment in the heavy armored cavalry regiment through the port portsim

of lake charles the pops model uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading orunloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each sub system in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughputyields in ston throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth

of the port of mobile alabama the pops model uses weaklink analysisto determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems shiploading orunloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximumthroughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each sub system in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amountby three throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assumea vessel on berth at the selected berths 80 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis ofdeployments that occurred during operationsdesert shield and desert storm these data helpedus develop mix of vessels likely to support military deployment operations we further weightedthe mix percentages to adjust for differences in cargo and expectations for future deployment terminal handling staging shipping terminal throughput subsystems staging staging ship mix

access to the port entrance to the port is provided through the main gate off beauregard street two other gates areavailable if needed the port roadways provide access to staging and pier areas from the main gate the road network in and out of the port including the gate processing of vehicles could handle about 42500 ston of equipment and supplies per day the highways connecting the portto the interstate go through or close to downtown mobile the traffic shares the roads with downtown mobile traffic decreasing the port highway throughput during peak hours roadable vehicles in convoys will proceed directly to the staging areas the port has end ramps therefore the deploying unit or stevedoring company would need to make or supply themto offload vehicles from trailers based on the assumption that deploying unit uses five end ramps they could be used to offload about 8000 ston per day containers on chassis can move to staging areas or directly to the container loading pier the container handling facility could offload 3000 ston of cargo per day this would require the chassis to be loaded directly on to theships since the port does not have any container handling equipment

cargo transshipment operations the tidal range of up to 15 feet will not limit roro operations the port can accommodate ves sels as large as the lmsr and fss as shown in the berthing characteristics table the berth best suited for lmsr and fss is berth 2 if berth had deck and not just rear roro ramp thiswould also be suitable berth for use currently the side ramp of an fss or one ramp of anlmsr can use the roro ramp other possible berthing includes berth 46 could be used with asingle ship ramp placed in the opening at berth 5 the finger piers b south c south and c northif river conditions are favorable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the least capable is shiploading the port has mixed throughput capability of at least 54700 ston the inland water network makes barge transport an effective shipping method the port connects to this network and provides third alternative for moving items to and from the port commercial operations taking place concurrently in the port will limit actual daily throughput sustainable over time by an appropriate percentage of the terminals overall capability if all ofthe open storage was made available there would be enough open storage to

allow the side andstern ramps on the lmsr to be used to load the ship if smaller ships are used to deploy the brigade then additional time or berths will be required to move the brigade deploying by lmsr requires two ships the berthing can support up to six lmsrs or fsss based on preliminary lmsr loading results we estimate the lmsrs will load about 400 stonper hour each lmsr will require an average 3481 hours to load the number of days requiredto load the ship is determined by the hours of work per day 20 and factors for sustainment andnighttime operations applying these factors we get the equivalent of 1843 hours per day based on loading time of 3481 hours and 1843 hours per day productive time it will require an average of 189 days to load each lmsr if the load was divided equally between the two shipsthe first ships should arrive earlier than the third day of railcar arrival and begin loading andthe last ship arrives in the port as the first ship departs this requires total of

agency conducted capability analysis of the port of new orleans on 2021 september 1999 the port of new orleans is fully capable of supporting us military cargo transshipment operations and canaccommodate vessels as large as the lmsr mississippi river wharves are more than 90 milesabove the head of passes the head of passes is over 20 miles from the sea buoy at southwestpass wharves reached using the mississippi gulf outlet are about 70 miles from the sea buoy the port has 24580 feet of quay and can accommodate vessels as large as the lmsr and fss it can load or offload mixed throughput of at least 111389 ston per day the brigade will require about 25 acres of staging per lmsr for deployment from port per day the fss requires about 16 acres per ship for deployment new orleans is viable port for supporting deployments of notional armored brigade provided berth is available for us military deployments notional armored brigade has total of 27970ston of vehicles and equipment and could be loaded on 14 lmsrs in about 4 days of actualshiploading the brigade will require use of the port for about 7 days the first 6 for rail andhighway arrival and offloading and the last 4 for shiploading this overlaps rail operations andshiploading on the 3 middle days to move an armored brigade any of the following river terminals berths could be used nash ville avenue nashville avenue b and c napoleon avenue and b or louisiana avenuethe river terminals are limited to moving one armored brigade at time because of the limitednumber of trains going into the terminals per day france road terminal berths 4 and 5 are able to support loading up to two armored brigades at the same time if both berths are available for use it would be possible to load single brigadefaster if both berths could be made available to load two ships at the same time if three fsss areused 9 days will be required to deploy the unit through the port using one berth using two berthsto load two fsss simultaneously would require 7 days to deploy brigade through the port it will be possible to deploy an armored division through the port and load it in 6 days using berths 4 and 5 in france road terminal and one berth in the river terminals such as nashvilleavenue because of the distances between the terminals it would be like working two portsrail traffic into the river terminals will limit the flow and will have to be considered in the planning the unit moving into the river terminals will require all of the rail assets going into all ofthe river terminals another possibility is to deploy an armored division at france road terminal the loading would be limited to two ships at time which would increase the time required to deploy the force to about 9 daysport of

orunloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximumthroughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughputyields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amount by three throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume avessel on berth at the selected berths 80 percent ofthe time in developing the throughput scenario weused statistical data developed from analysis ofdeployments that occurred during operationsdesert shield and desert storm these data helpedus develop mix of vessels likely to

pascagoula mississippi the pops model uses weaklinkanalysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems shiploading or offloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for eachsubsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughputyields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amountby three throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assume avessel on berth at the selected berths 80 percent ofthe time in developing the throughput scenario weused statistical data

port arthur the pops model uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading orunloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximumthroughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughputyields in ston throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assume avessel on berth 90 percent of the time in developingthe throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desert shield and desertstorm these data helped

marad planning orders digest does not call for use of the port of port hueneme facilities during national emergencies therefore we analyzed only those wharves including accompanying facilities that could possibly accommodate an fss vessel these include berths 3 4 and 6 we assumed that the army will have access to all of the open and covered storage identified in section i of this analysis port huenemes designated faclities for berthing fss vessels24requirements the likely requirement for the port of port hueneme is to deploy notional mechanized infantry brigadein 6 days the brigade has to move about 2600vehicles and 220 containers movement of this bri gade to the port will require 360 railcars 60 per day for the convoyrail option under this optiondeploying units would drive about 1220

pleasantvalley gates for deployment from berths 3 4 and 6 both the access roads and gates process ing subsystems can handle well over 1500 vehicles per day terminal handling highway25rail the classification yard and additional rail spurs could store about 400 railcars per day the vcy railyard could store an additional 100 railcars per day current service to the port is about 3 trains per day potentially 240300 railcars per day the port has variety of end ramps available for off loading operations if the port uses four end ramps for offloading it could offload about 40 railcars every 5 hours or more than 160 railcars per day staging the port of port hueneme has about 220 acres of open storage area 35 acres are near the port for military operations we estimate that mechanized infantry brigade needs at least 30 acres of open staging to support the concurrent nonsustained loading of three fss vessels divided between vehicles and containers the staging area requirement becomes 4 and 26 acres for containers and vehicles respectively shipping the number of ships needed to load this requirement depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would require three fss vessels and one cape h roro ship however the port harbor and ship berths are too shallow to allow passage and berthing of fully loaded fss or cape h roro ship based on this brigade cannot outload in 6 days using fss and roro vessels however deploying units could outload using selected breakbulk and containership vessels 26 vessel types loading condition sample ship mixfss rorocombcape h

shallow draft 35 feet mlw limit the port of port hueneme to selected breakbulk containership and roro vessels unless the army deploys partial fss and cape h shiploads presently fss operations have not occurred at the port of port hueneme the wind and current condi tions affect the steering of an fss vessel when entering the approach channel the naval construction battalion center ncbc is currently researching wind and current conditions at the port to determine the feasibility of fss operations the port harbor turning basin is too small to accommodate fss vessels this limits ship movement to pull in back out operations recommendations we do not recommend deploying mechanized infantry brigade from the port of port hueneme unless select ships are available for deployment the shallow port harbor and ship berths limit deployments to selected breakbulk roro and containership vessels the wind and current could cause unsafe conditions for steering an fss vessel when entering the port approach channel also the harbor turning basin is too small to accommodate fss vessels we recommend reevaluation of the port of port hueneme upon completion of dredging the harbor to 45 feet the port authority for the port of port hueneme has not established date for completing the harbordredging we recommend that ncbc continue their research to determine the possibility of fss operations at the

terminal through the fivelane gate on harbor scenic drive both the access road and the gate can handle more than 1000 vehicles per day rail the piers g and j terminal can receive 180 railcars per day two portable rail end ramps placed along the 2000foot railyard at the south side of the terminal could only offload about 164 railcars of military equipment per day this is within the capability of the rail reception of the facility but is not sufficient to meet the offload ing requirement operations on third track of the railyard would produce sufficient offloading capability but might create excessive congestion in the area timbers or other provisions are required to allow vehicles to cross tracks possible solution would be to deploy more equipment by highway and less by rail 38staging this analysis assumes that current downsizing continues and that nine fsssized ships will deploy an entire notional mechanized infantry division three ships will depart every 2 days because of this thestaging requirement is to support three sustained loading operations although an fss load of cargo canbe staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 acres are required for staging the 73 containers foreach fss the three simultaneous ship loading operations will require 48 acres of open staging of which about 6 acresare dedicated to containers the facilities analyzed in this report only include 15 acres of open storage this does not meetthe requirement of 48 acres shipping although this analysis assumes that nine

and storage tracks the harbor belt line up and sp have railyards adjacent to or near the terminals in this report these yards can store about 1000 89foot railcars the harbor belt line owns most of this capacity covered storage and apron track at indies terminal berth 222 southward viewopen staging acres25 ramps the port has permanent rail or truck end ramps the auto import facilities however have at least two railmounted bilevel ramps and three portable bilevel ramps these ramps will not support heavier military vehicles numerous locations are available that could support offloading with tempo rary or portable end ramps docks all together the terminals have 77 truck and 36 boxcar handling positions marshaling areaswithin port marshaling areas exist all open areas within the terminals are required for staging mil itary or commercial cargo alamitos armed forces reserve center the reserve center is about 12 miles to the east of the port area it has rail access but can provide at least 50 acres of marshaling area it has runway about 8000 feet long which was previously used by the naval air station the seal beach naval weapons station few miles south of the reserve center has rail access material handling equipment the terminals have total of 36 container cranes these container cranes are all at the west basin and terminal island terminals all have capacity of at least 40 tons various shipping and rental compa nies in the area own transtainers and other mhe mobile cranes with capacities up to 150 tons are avail able from local stevedore companies 150ton floating crane is also available 26 intermodal facilities sf up and csx have intermodal facilities in the angeles area however this report concentrates on the intermodal facility owned in part by the port of angeles

future development includes developing about 800 acres of the port using dredge spoils also the ports of angeles and long beach expect to jointly buy 20 miles of land from sp to develop an express transportation corridor for trucks and trains when finished the alameda corridor will reduce truck delays this is because of rerouting trains eliminating atgrade crossings and widening alameda street to six lanes trains will have more railcars and will travel at higher speeds 28 ship mix percentages container 15breakbulk 35barge 5 roro 45 ii throughput analysis general this section evaluates the throughput capability of the port of angeles using the port operational per formance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weaklink analysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of measurement tons mtons per day the analysis assumes that 80 percent of the port facilities will support military deployments also the ship mix is based on desert shield and storm statistics we weighted the percentages toadjust for differences in cargo deadweights and expectations for future deployments terminal handling staging shipping terminal throughput subsystems29 receptionhandling highway i110 and california 47 provide access to the port each terminal has designated entrance for trucks the road network in and out of the terminals including the gate processing of vehicles could handle about 540000 mton of equipment and supplies per day roadable vehicles in convoys will process directly to the staging areas vehicles on commercial or mili tary flatbed trailers without integral ramps will offload at portable ramps the port has permanent truck end ramps our analysis assumes the port has 14 portable ramps at various locations throughout the port these ramps could offload more than 7200 mton from flatbed trailers per day supplies in van semitrailers will proceed to the 77 van handling positions these docks can offload more than 512000 mton of van semitrailershipped material per day this report assumes that five rented container handlers are available for chassis operations these container handlers can offload about 48000 mton of cargo per day 30 rail rail reception at the port is fair with three major railroad companies accessing the angeleslongbeach areas the west basin section of the port has the best rail service this is because of the large container business handled by these berths tracks access thesan pedro main channel terminal this analysis assumes the port or unit can rent build or provide 11 portable rail end ramps these would be in addition to the five ramps regularly used for bilevel operations at the auto import facility at berth 195 we assume the additional portable ramps would be used at the railyard inland of berth 142146 the spurs inland of berth 174 and the railyard on the north side of terminal island one would be used inland of the shed at berth 5455 boxcars

perform operations on roro container or breakbulk ships the cargo mix depends on the anticipated vessel type for example cargo will be containerized if container ship is planned the chart below provides the staging capability for the cargo for each of these vessel types if combination ship is expected then portion of each involved capability should be assumed 32 shipping throughputs for each berth are shown below they are based on various factors including mhe used loading operational and berth usage rates as well as berth and ship compatibility 33 the type of ship preferred at each berth is based on the methodology described in the appendix the evaluation is based on snapshot view of the current physical characteris tics of the berths and the mhe available the evaluation to the right

vessels the 1988 revision for the planning orders digest issued by marad provided agreements for the military to use the port of angeles the agreements referenced the entire american president lines terminal the upcoming revision will not likely reference any part of the port of angeles if the military needs to deploy through the port of angeles it will most likely use the indies terminal the american president lines terminal is very busy and will not likely support the disruption of commercial businesses this report assumes that all of the indies terminal is available for militaryoperations in addition to the indies terminal this analysis assumes the military will negotiate to use the yusen terminal although the yusen terminal is very busy with commercial cargo its adjacent railyard fsscapability and proximity to the indies terminal make it good choice facilities on the july 1988 planning order digest41 requirements the most likely requirement for the port of angeles is to deploy notional mechanized infantry division in 6 days of reception and throughput the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the move ment to the port will require 1055 176 per day railcars using the convoyrail option under this option about 3650 610 per day roadable vehi cles would be driven and about 2320 387 per day would be towed mechanized infantry division total equipment volume 274518 mton weight 95010 ston area 1422844 sq ft vehicles 7800 containers 600 42 terminal handling highway vehicles and containers on chassis would access the terminals through the gates at morman and new dock streets the access roads and gates can handle at least 4000 vehicles per day rail the indies terminal can receive about 80 railcars per day of military equipment the rail yard inland of the yusen terminal can recieve about 100 railcars without disrupting the concur rent commercial operations this is sufficient to meet the requirement trackage at the indies terminal can only support offloading five railcars at time unless apron space is used three additional portable ramps each supporting the offloading of 15 railcars at the railyard inland of the yusen terminal will satisfy the requirement these four ramps will have the capability to offload 200 railcars per day 43 staging this analysis assumes that current downsizing continues and that nine fsssized ships will deploy an entire notional mechanized infantry division three ships will depart every 2 days because of this the staging requirement is to support three sustained loading operations although an fss load of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 acres are required for staging the 73 containers for each fss the three simultaneous shiploading operations will require 48 acres of open staging of which about 6 acres are dedicated to containers there are 162 acres of open staging that could support military operations at the two terminals this is enough staging area for the deployment 44 shipping although this analysis assumes that only nine fsssized ships can deploy the notional mecha nized infantry division the table below provides ship quantities for the current division size the number of ships required depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would consist of all eight fss ships plus two cape h roro ships the berthing capability at the two terminals is marginal for three simultaneous fss berthings the apron height of 15 feet above mlw might prevent roro operations

of ideal factors required to support the different ship mixes the evaluation takes into consideration the current physical characteristics and mhe available for berth this evaluation gives considerations for enhancements such as equipment berths 3233 24 and 6768 in that order appear to be the best choices for container operations the best choices for roro operations appear to be berths

throughput capability for deploying notional mecha nized infantry division using mainly fss vessels the analysis will use only those facilities designated in the 14 february 1994 planning orders digest issued by marad plus mpc the orders call for the port of oakland to grant priority use of certain facilities prior to and during national emergencies these facilities are the apl matson and sealand terminals44requirements the likely requirement for the port of oakland plus mpc is to deploy notional mechanized infantry division in 6 days the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the movement of this division to the port will require about 1055 176 per day railcars using convoyrail option under this option about 3650 610 per day roadable vehicles would be driven and about 2320 387 per day would be towed total equipment volume 247518 mton weight 95010 ston area 1422844 sq ft vehicles 7800 containers 20 ft 660 45terminal handling highway vehicles would access mpc from burma road through the bay bridge gate for deployment from pier 7 access to the sealand terminal is by way of maritime street through the sealand gate the matson trapac and seventh street marine container terminals are accessible via seventh street through the matson and seventh street gates rail the classification yards within mpc and the nearby rail linescould handle more than 1250 railcars per day assumes 50 per cent of total rail storage at railyards is available for military use also assuming 4 of the 10 available end ramps are used foroffloading the end ramps could offload about 50 railcars every 5 hours or more than 200 railcarsper day since not all of the endramps are used the capability would be much higher than this 200railcarperday estimate vehicles can access the apl terminal from middle harbor road through the apl gate containers on chassis woulduse all of the above terminals except pier 7 both the access roads and gate processing subsystems could handlewell over 1500 vehicles per day46staging combined the port of oakland and mpc have almost 210 acres of open storage area that could be assigned for military operations we estimate that mechanized infantry division needs about 48 acres of open staging to support the concurrent sustained loading of three fss vessels divided between vehicles and containers the staging area requirement for containers and vehicles becomes 6 and 42 acres respectively shipping the number of ships needed to load this requirement depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would require all eight fsss and two cape h roro ships the marad p lanning orders digest designates eight ship berths that are compatible with fss vessels assuming 2 days to load ship division can easily outload within the 6day requirement we estimate division can outload from the port of oakland in about 4 days 47summary the port of oakland and mpc can outload mechanized infantry division within the 6day outloading requirement for all except one terminal bay bridge terminal the shipping subsystem is the limiting subsystem for the bay bridge terminal the terminal handling capability is the limiting subsystem deployment plans show that 1557737 mton of cargo will flow through the port of oakland and mpc over 69day period pier 7 at mpc can handle the daily average of 22576 mton per day by itself the port of

based on weaklink analysis in which eachsubsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput val ues for three subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of measurementtons mton per day the analysis assumes that 80 percent of the port facilities will support militarydeployments also the ship mix is based on desert shield and desert storm statis tics we weighted the percentages toadjust for differences in cargo deadweightsand expectations for future deployments since terminal 1 is leased out we assumed that only 30 percent of the terminal 1 port facilities will support mili tary deploymentship mix percentages container

north columbia bou levard north burgard and north lombard streets northwest yeon and northwest front avenues all provide good access to the port of portland each terminal has at least one gate allowing access to the wharf area the road network in and out of the port including the gate processing of vehicles could handle almost 189730 mton of equipment and supplies per day roadable vehicles in convoys can proceed directly to staging areas vehicles on commercial or military flatbed semitrailers will first offload at the permanent end ramps at terminals 2 4 and 6 wide vehicles may have difficulty offloading at the truck end ramp at terminal 2 because of the side rails see picture in the end ramps portion of section i of this study the end ramp at terminal 4 is in need of repair assum ing offloading operations occur at these end ramps about 14400 mton of equipment could be offloaded per day supplies in van semitrailers will proceed to the warehouse docks for offloading these facilities provide 63 handling positions some of these double as rail dock facilities and could offload about 16640 mton of cargo per day containers on trucks will likely proceed to terminal 6 which is specially equipped with container cranes and other container handling equipment the container handling facilities could offload almost 52800 mton of cargo per day 34rail rail reception at the port of portland is very good with three commercial carriers serving the port land area the ptrr performs switching for terminals 1 and 2 the other terminals have reciprocal switching agreements the port storage tracks could store about 570 railcars the commercial railyards in the portland area could store about 4210 additional railcars availability of this storage space varies from 25 to 50 percent for the port yards and 10 to 30 percent for commercial yards current rail service to the port all terminals combined is about 16 trains per day the number of cars per train varies from five to sixty 89foot flatcars to 40 containersonflatcars cofc vehicles on flatcars could offload at two permanent end ramps at terminals 2 and 6 and light portable end ramp at terminal 4 the light end ramp at terminal 4 is too light for heavy equipment because the two permanent end ramps are connected to docks at covered storage facilities deploying units must exer cise care in offloading to avoid hitting posts or other portions of the facility the end ramp at the sp brooklyn yard is too far away from the port to offload tracked equipment boxcars could offload at the warehouses where 21 rail handling positions are available some of these positions double as truck docks containers would offload at any of the container handling facilities 35staging the port of portland has about 1678 acres of open storage for vehicles andor containers this acreage has the capability to store about 6975 mtons of rolling stock or 473555 mtons of containers or 382647 mtons of breakbulk cargo also 1002317 square feet of covered storage provides protection for about 33525 mtons of palletized cargo if combination cargo mix is expected then portion of each involved capability should be assumed shipping we

evaluate the throughput capability for deploying notional mechanized infantry division using primarily fss vessels the marad planning orders digest does not call for the use of port of portland facilities during national emergencies therefore the analysis will use only those berths and accompanying facilities that can accommodate an fss these facilities include berths 204 206 of terminal 2 berths 414415 of terminal 4 and berths 603605 of terminal 6 see figs 3 through 5 to locate these facilities requirements the most likely requirement for the port of portlandis to deploy notional mechanized infantry divisionin 6 days the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the movement of this division to the port will require 1055 176 per dayrailcars using convoyrail option under thisoption the deploying units would drive about 3650 610 per day roadable vehicles and tow another 2320 387 per day pieces of equipmentmechanized infantry division deployment data total equipment volume 274518 mton weight 95010 ston area 1422844 sq ft vehicles 7800 containers 660 44terminal inprocessinghandling highway vehicles would access the port of portland using i5 and north marine drive for terminal 6 i 5 north columbia boulevard n burgard street and north lombard street for terminal 4 and i5 and 405 northwest yeon and northwest front avenues for terminals 1 and 2 each terminal has at least onegate providing access to the wharf areas we estimate based on existing traffic volume that the access roads to the four terminals can handle an additional 3000 vehicles per day also the terminal gates can handle an additional 3500 vehicles per day rail the classification yards on and off port have combined total of about 4780 railcars per day however about 25 to 50 percent of the port railyards capacity and only 10 to 30 percent of the commer cial railyards capacity would normally be available for military use this means that normal daily storage would be about 563 railcars per day with the three available end ramps at the port stevedores or militarypersonnel could offload about 23 railcars every 5 hours this equates to 92 railcars per day we assumed that lighter vehicles will offload at the light portable end ramp at terminal 4 and the heavy vehicles will offload at terminals 2 and 6 at least one additional portable heavyduty end ramp at terminals 2 4 and6 will allow the port to more adequately meet rail reception requirements the portable end ramp at ter minal 4 is too light for offloading heavy equipment deploying units must exercise caution in using the permanent end ramps at terminals 2 and 6 these end ramps are part of the railtruck docks for the warehouses they serve heavy military equipment could damage the buildings andor dock areas at these ramps 45staging the port of portland has almost 168 acres of open staging available we estimate that mechanized infantry division needs about 48 acres of open staging to support the concurrent sustained loading of three fss vessels divided between vehicles and containers the staging area requirement becomes 42 and 6 acres for vehicles and containers respectively 46shipping the number of ships needed to load this requirement depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would require all eight fsss and two cape h roro ships berths 204206 2 406408 1 414415 1 and 603605 2

2 is the preferred terminal of use for deployment because it is the best for allaround operations and has the best roro shipping capability terminal 6 is the preferred terminal for container shipments because it has the most modern facilities is the easiest to access by highway and is the most compatible for containerized shipments the port of portland can outload mechanized infantry division within the 6day outloading requirement this conclusion is contingent upon procurement of at least three one for each terminal portable heavy duty end ramps to complement end ramps already at the port recommendations we recommend that the port of portland obtains at least three heavyduty portable end ramps to more adequately meet rail reception requirements and allow flexibility in offloading heavy equipment from both railcars and semitrailers if desired the port may construct these end ramps in lieu of purchasing them 121port of san diego san diego california san deigo californiaport of san

likely requirement for the port of san diego is to deploy notional mechanized infantry division in 6 days of reception and throughput the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the movement to the port will require 1055 176 per day railcars using the convoy and rail option under this option about 3650 610 per day roadable vehicles would be driven and about 2320 387 per day would be towed terminal handling highway vehicles and containers on chas sis would enter the terminalsthrough the gates the gate for the 10th avenue terminal has two lanes the gate for thenational

7800 containers 20 ft 660 23rail each terminal can receive about 60 railcars of military equipment per day without disrupting the simultaneous commercial business within the area this reception is insufficient to meet the requirement trackage at the terminals can support off loading about 110 railcars at time thiswill allow for about 440 railcars per day this offloading capability meets the require ment staging this analysis assumes that the current down sizing will continue and nine fsssized ships will deploy an entire notional mechanizedinfantry division three ships will depart every 2 days because of this the staging requirement is to support three sustainedloading operations although an fss load ofcargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres are required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about 2 arerequired for staging the 73 containers for each fss thus the three simultaneous shiploading operations will require 48 acresof open staging of which about 6 acres are dedicated to containers the terminals have 65 acres available including grass and unimproved landalthough shiploads may be broken into sepa rate areas this is enough staging area for the deployment 24shipping although this analysis assumes that nine fsssized ships can deploy the notionalmechanized infantry division the tablebelow provides ship quantities for the cur rent division

ramps docks the port has truck docks totaling at least 315 handling positions however many of these posi tions are at covered storage facilities under lease this means that offloading could occur but storage would have to occur at other facilities nineteen boxcar docks are available however most of these docks are at leased covered storage facilities such as freeze facilities some of the port rail facilities need maintenance the reason is that the bulk of business at the port of seattle is containers very few deliveries are via boxcars marshaling areas the port does not list any marshaling

each of the terminals has at least one gate that provides access to staging and wharf areas because of the large number of lanes going through the terminal gates the port roadways and gate reception can easily handle large number of vehicles per day roadable vehicles in convoys will process directly to staging areas the port of seattle has portable or fixed truck ramps unless makeshift truck ramps are jury rigged vehicles on commer cial or military flatbed semitrailers must offload at end ramps in local railyards although many storage facilities are under lease the us army could still potentially use the docks to offload about 165300 mton per day the port specializes in shipping containers and could handle almost 132200 mton per day reception handling offloading 27rail rail reception at the port of seattle is very good with two commercial carriers serving the seattle area railyards are on the port however local railyards could store about 652 89foot railcars this is based on 30 percent availability of track space the current rail service to the port varies but averages about three trains day for each of the two carriers since the port has rail end ramps offloading must occur at the local railyards the port receives very few boxcar shipments because of this there are few boxcar positions available for offloading many of these positions are at covered storage facilities under lease an rtch andor crane will offload containers staging the port has about 550 acres of paved open storage for vehiclesandor containers this acreage can store about 720500 mton of rolling stock or 1901300mton of containers or 1274800 mton of breakbulk cargo also 804255 square feetof covered storage provides protection for almost 32200 mton of palletized cargo 28shipping

infantry division mainly by fss vessels the marad planning orders digest does not call for use of the port of seattles facilities during national emergencies because most of the ports facilities are leased out the availability of these facilities may range from 25 to 50 percent during deployment the military traffic management command mtmc maintains an outport in the seattle area for coordinating military movements requirements the likely requirement for the port of seattle is to deploy notional mechanized infantry division in 6 days the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers the movement of this division to the port will require 1055 176 per day railcars under convoyrail option under this option the deploying units would drive about 3650 610 per day roadable vehicles and tow another 2320 387 per day pieces of equipmenttotal equipment volume 274518 mton weight 95010 ston area 1422844 sq ft vehicles 7800 containers 660mechanized infantry division deployment

from 11th avenue sw terminal 30 is accessible from i5 via s spokane street and marginal way s alaskan way two gates provide access to terminal 30 the access roads and gate processing subsystems for the port could handle an additional 4500 vehicles per day rail the classification yards near the ports could handle about 652 railcars per day for seattle using all available end ramps 4 fixed and 2 portable in the seattle area bn and up railyards steve dores or military personnel could offload about 41 railcars every 5 hours this equates to about 164 railcars per day this conclusion assumes 2 cycles within 5hour period at the 4 fixed rail ramps maximum of 2 railcars per ramp and 1 cycle every 5hour period at the 2 portable end ramps 12 railcars per ramp terminal handling33staging if 25 percent of the open staging facilities at the port of seattle are available to the military for deployment then deploying units would have access to about 146 acres we estimate that mechanized infantry division needs about 48 acres of open staging to support the concurrent sustained loading of three fss vessels divided between vehicles and containers the staging area require ment becomes 42 and 6 acres for vehicles and containers respectively 34shipping the number of ships needed to load this requirement depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would require all eight fsss and two cape h roro ships the preferred terminals for military deployment are terminals 5 18 25 30 and 3746 because of their deck strength and availability of container and wharf cranes based on 25

depth are adequate for fss vessels and portable heavyduty endramps are obtained for offloading railcars and semitrailers the port of seattle does not have any end ramps therefore offloading operations must occur at the nearby commercial railyards unless deploying units jury rig some temporary end ramps this may cause highway congestion leading from the railyards to the port the port of seattle may wish to obtain the mtmcteadesigned heavyduty ramps for offloading railcars and semitrailers these ramps should be available sometime in 1994 recommendations we recommend that the port of seattle obtain at least two heavyduty portable end ramps to allow flexibility in offloading heavy equipment from both railcars and semitrailers the mtmcteadesigned end ramp is potential solution to this

for deploying notional mechanized infantry division mainly by fss vessels the analysis uses only those facilities designated in the planning orders digest issued by marad these orders call for the port of tacoma to grant either exclusive or priority use of certain facilities before and during national emergencies these facilities are identified in the fol lowing chart and figure the military

staging priority blair b 12 32 backup priority 7 b 14 1 warehouse 96000 sq ft33requirements the likely requirement for the port of tacoma is to deploy notional mechanized infantry division in 6 days the division has to move about 7800 vehicles and 660 containers movement of this division to the port will require 1055 railcars 176 per day for convoyrail option under this option the deploying units would drive about 3650 roadable vehicles 610 per day and tow another 2320 pieces of equipment 387 per day mechanized infantry division deployment data total equipment volume 274518 mton weight 95010

openterminal although terminal 7 has two gates t7d husky gate is the primary access gate to terminal7 we estimate based on the existing traffic volume that port of tacoma road the access road to the three terminals can handle an additional 5000 vehicles per day also the terminal gates can handle an addi tional 1500 vehicles per day 35rail the classification yards near the port have capacity of about 2900 railcars per day however only about 30 percent of this capacity 870 railcars would likely be available for military use using the three available end ramps in the port of tacoma area stevedores or military personnel could offload about 34railcars every 5 hours this equates to about 136 railcars per day we assumed that lighter vehicles canoffload on the portable end ramps and heavy vehicles will offload at the fixed ramp at the bn railyardthis conclusion also assumes that offloading personnel can achieve 3 cycles within 5hour period onthe fixed rail end ramp at the nearby bn railyard 300 feet of track at this ramp with at least one additional portable end ramp the port could more adequately meet its rail reception requirements 36staging using the facilities designated by the marad planning orders digest the port of tacoma has 58 acres of open staging available for military operations we estimate that mechanized infantry division needs about 48 acres of open staging to support the concurrent sustained loading of three fss vessels divided between vehicles and containers the staging area requirement becomes 42 and 6 acres for vehicles and containers respectively shipping the number of ships needed to load this requirement depends on the shipping mix selected the best ship mix would require all eight fsss and two cape h roro ships the marad planning orders digest designates two terminals at the port of tacoma for military use one of the terminals at the port of tacoma is on blair waterway which is currently undergoing dredging from 35 feet mlw to 45 feet mlw this dredging will ensure an fss vessel can navigate blair water way at maximum draft based on 2 days to load ship division can outload within the 6day require ment from the port of tacoma

tacoma may not be enough to meet rail reception requirements the port of tacoma can outload mechanized infantry division within the 6day outloading requirement this conclusion is contingent upon completion of the blair waterway dredging project and procurement of at least two heavyduty end ramps to complement the portable end ramps already at the port the 11th street drawbridge across blair waterway restricts the channel width to 150 feet the military sealift command has shown reluctance in the past to navigate past this bridge this bridge is scheduled for removal in 1995 recommendations we recommend that the port of tacoma 1 continue to accomplish deepening of blair waterway to 45 feet mlw and removal of the 11th street drawbridge across blair waterway 2 obtain at least two heavyduty portable end ramps to allow flexibility in offloading heavy equip ment from both railcars and semitrailers mtmctea is currently designing an end ramp for use in offloading tanks and other heavy

executive summary the military traffic management command transportation engineering agency conducted site visit at the port of anchorage in june 1999 the port is compact but capable facility with theability to throughput brigadesize unit within 6 days this port can accommodate vessels aslarge as the fast sealift ship fss or large medium speed roll onroll off lmsr due to a29foot average tidal variation 41foot extreme tidal variation 2 ½hour window exists forconducting roll onroll off roro operations ship loadingoffloading twice day this restricts roro ship loadingoffloading operations for vessels such as the fss or lmsr to about 5 hours total per day the port of anchorage is not listed in the port planning orders ppoissued by the maritime administration marad currently none of the alaskan ports are listedin the ppo for deploying notional separate infantry brigade or any other military unit the port consists of 2221footlong overthewater marginal wharf divided into three ship berths the wharf extends over the water to accommodate the huge tidal variation the waterdepth at the ship dock is 35 feet mean lower low water mllw and the port is capable of break bulk limited or specialized roro container and barge operations in general the channel depth is 35 feet mllw however knik arm shoals at the entrance to knik arm has few shallowslimiting the water depth to about 25 feet mllw the port currently gets around this by restrictingship traffic to 6hour transit time twice daily in another year the future channel dredgingproject will provide consistent channel depth of 35 feet mllw the alaska railroad corporation arrc owns all tracks leading into the port and performs all of the rail switching at least three commercial airfields and two military airfields are in the anchorage area the two largest anchorage international and elmendorf air force base can handle c5 aircraft the port has three railmounted container cranes that primarily support theloadingoffloading of containers for sealand service inc at terminals 1 and 2 two of thecontainer cranes are rated at 30 short ton ston and the third is rated at 40 ston totem oceantrailer express inc tote currently operates at terminal 3 moving roro cargo betweenanchorage and tacoma washington tote successfully negates the effect of the huge tidal variation by using specialized roro ship ramps stored at the port of anchorage that are speciallydesigned to mate up with the tote oceangoing vessels although the port of anchorage does not have materials handling equipment mhe other than the container cranes the north star ter minal and stevedore company can provide other mhe including mobile cranes up to 300ston as required this stevedoring company is located about ½ mile from the port the onlyend ramps available for loadingoffloading railcars andor semitrailers would be through eitherarrc or north star terminal and stevedore companyport of anchorage alaska mtmctea 3a total of 2657 acres of paved open staging is available at the port other open storage areas of various surface material are available either at the port or nearby about 29400 square feet ofcovered storage is also available at the port the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of about 4030 ston 13660 measurement ton mtonper day roro and container throughputs are 3320 ston 13280 mton and 23510 ston 58780 mton per day respectively notional infantry brigade has about 12940 ston 65577 mton of vehicles and equipment estimates show that the port is capable of achieving closure for throughputting notional infantrybrigade in about 6 days if two fss can be loaded simultaneously 6 load per ship the brigadecan be loaded in 5 days although the port can easily achieve closure in 6 days peak day requirements may be as much as 8350 ston tea port enhancement analysis phase i 1999 in thereception and handling subsystem this would exceed the roro shipping subsystem capability 2500 ston per day for two fss vessel loading this means that equipment may require marshaling in various areas including elmendorf air force base afb and fort richardson for deployment operations about 25 acres of open storage are desired per lmsr to support daily sustained loading operations an entire notional separate infrantry brigade can be loaded on threequarters of an lmsr therefore about 165 acres are needed to stage the brigade the desiredstaging for an fss is about 16 acres of open storage per ship to support daily sustained loadingoperations the notional infantry brigade will require second fss with small partial load or both ships containing 6 of load the 2657 acres of paved open storage can meet the lmsr requirement provided at least 165 acres are available for deployment movement of the deploying units by rail will require 79 railcars per day using railconvoy option the arrc states thatthey can handle up to twothree trains per day at seventyfive to eighty 53foot railcars per train the us military would likely require 2000 feet of ship berth either terminal 2 or 3 or termi nals 1 and 2 16 acres of paved open staging and the transit shed for an actual deployment foran application we analyzed notional separate infantry brigade deploying from the port of anchorage using one lmsr vessel or two fss vessels to deploy notional infantry brigade in 6 days the port must throughput about 2160 ston of vehicles and equipment that includes10 containers per day when the required lmsr is available for loading the port meets the shipping requirements if the needed facilities and resources are available smaller ships will requireadditional time or berthsport of anchorage alaska mtmctea 4units from fort richardson can easily

military traffic management command transportation engineering agency conducted site visit at the port of seward in june 1999 the port is small port with one general cargo fingerpier two major ship berths owned by the alaska railroad corporation arrc it has the capability to throughput brigadesize unit and accommodate vessels as large as the cape d the portof seward is not large medium size roll onroll off roro lmsr or fast sealift ship fss capable although having general cargo capability the arrc pier generally handles cruise ships especially during the tourist season the arrc intends to fully convert the general cargopier into cruise terminal and build another general finger pier to handle general cargo the newarrc terminal will be adjacent to the old converted terminal and ready for operation by may2000 the port of seward is not listed in the port planning orders ppo issued by the maritimeadministration marad currently none of the alaskan ports are listed in the ppo for deployment of notional separate infantry brigade or any other military unit the port consists of finger pier with length of 735 feet and width of 200 feet dolphins extend out from the pier and cruise ships up to 866 feet in length routinely berth here transit shed ison the pier and is converted to cruise ship ticket office during the tourist season the conversionto ticket office will be permanent when the new general cargo wharf is completed in may 2000the water depth alongside the pier is 35 feet mean lower low water mllw the channel depthaccessing the port is very deep with minimum depth readings of 84 feet mllw the arrc owns all tracks leading into the port and performs all rail switching the arrc esti mates the ability to provide two 80railcar trains per day going from fort wainwright to the port of seward because the rail line going to seward is single rail line the arrc would have tomanage rail traffic going to and from the seward area also the rail line coming into seward hasa 24 percent grade the arrc uses 34 locomotives to safely transport trains going into sewardboth fixed end ramp and portable end ramp are available at seward seward has small commercial airport that has handled c130 aircraft in the past the north star terminal and stevedore company provides equipment and stevedoring services at the port of seward the company reported that 20 longshoremen are available during the summer and 4550 are available in the winter liftonliftoff operations for loadingoffloading ships are accomplished via mobile cranes the arrc pier does not have wharf or container cranes the port of seward has about 33 acres of gravelsurfaceunimproved open staging other poten tial open storage areas are available in the seward area the transit shed with covered storagearea of 25200 square feet is available at the arrc marginal wharf at the time of the port visitall covered storage was converted to cruise line ticket countersport of seward alaska mtmctea 3for deployment an infantry brigade requires about 14 acres of open storage per cape d vessel to support daily sustained loading operations the 33 acres of open storage easily meets openstorage requirements for cape d vessel several areas exist in and around seward that couldprovide an open storage capability should additional staging be needed for an application we analyzed notional separate infantry brigade deploying through the port of seward using three cape d vessels to throughput brigadesize unit out of the port of seward by cape d vessels deployment will require ship berth at least 750 feet long water depthalongside of 33 feet mean low water and wharf apron suitable for roro operations cape drequires about 14 acres of open storage for staging vehicles covered storage will be required tosupport helicopter shrinkwrapping and protect palletized cargo at seward deploying units willlikely use the 866foot long ship berth at least 14 acres of the available open storage and theavailable end ramps because the current transit shed also serves as cruise ship ticket office dur ing the tourist season covered storage may not be readily available during deployment open storage areas are not secure therefore security measures must be taken to avoid vandalism andtheft in deploying notional separate infantry brigade we estimate that the port of seward can achieve closure in about 6 days plus reception military units from forts richardson and wainwright candeploy through anchorage faster than seward because the travel times for highway and raildecrease by 35 hours and 4 hours respectively by going through anchorage the port of anchorage has the capability to load 2 fss 6 of load on each fss in 5 days plus reception the distance from anchorage to seward is about 130 miles by highway about 35 hours at a40 miles per hour road march also the port of anchorage has the facilities to better handlecontainers and is less likely to experience labor or materials handling equipment shortages although the port can achieve closure in 6 days peak day requirements may be as much as 8350 ston in the reception and handling subsystem this would exceed the shipping subsystemthroughput 3380 ston per day based on oneship berth loading operation during contin gency this means that equipment would require marshaling in various areas to avoid port satura tionport of

on the port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity for the port of seward the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloadingstaging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields inston throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth 90 percent of the time in develop ing the throughput scenario we used statistical datadeveloped from analysis of deployments thatoccurred during operations desert shield anddesert storm these data helped us develop mixof vessels likely to support military deploymentoperations we

alaska mtmctea 30summary the port of seward can load notional separate infantry brigade and achieve closure in 6 days using one berth and three cape d ships this port is not capable of berthing fss or lmsr ships the port must ensure that at least 14 acres of open storage are available for military use during adeployment because open storage areas are not behind fences security measures must also beimplemented to ensure vandalism and theft are not problem mhe and end ramps are availablethrough local stevedores and the arrc container cranes are at the port therefore loadingcontainers aboard ships must be accomplished via mobile cranes mobile crane handling rates areoften ½ of specialized container cranes the port of seward has both highway and rail access equipment deploying from fort wain wright will likely deploy by rail because the distance is greater than 400 miles because the railline accessing seward from anchorage is singletracked the arrc must carefully scheduletrains to avoid rail traffic problems also the steep grades between anchorage and seward willlikely require the use of 23 locomotives to ensure safe movement into seward equipment at fort richardson will likely deploy through the port of anchorage unless conditions require an alternative move the reason for this is that deploying units would not have to preparethe equipment for long distance highway transport if the port of seward is the seaport of embarkation then movement from fort richardson to seward will likely be by highway because thedistance is less than 400 miles the travel time from anchorage to seward is about 35 hours by highway 129 miles at 40 mph road march equipment at fort wainwright will also likely deploy through the port of anchorage the reason is that anchorage is directly in between fairbanks and seward by highway or rail deployment through the port of anchorage avoids an extra35 hours of travel time by highway andor 4 hours by rail also the port of anchorage has thebest facilities for handling containers and berthing lmsr or fss vessels shortages in labor areless likely in anchorage than seward and separate infantry brigade can be loaded in about5 days as opposed to 6 although the port can achieve closure in 6 days peak day requirements as much as 8350 ston in the equipment reception and handling subsystem may exceed the shipping subsystem capability for oneberth operation 3380 ston per day this means that equipment may require marshaling in various areas in and around seward the current arrc pier is undergoing conversion into specialized cruise terminal this conver sion is scheduled for completion in june 2000 replacement general cargo wharf is undergoingconstruction and is due for completion in june 2000 this wharf will have one ship berth about600 feet long but be capable of berthing ships up to 800 feet long because the number of shipberths for general cargo will decrease from two to one the corresponding overall throughput willalso

computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity for the port of valdez the pops model uses weaklink analysis to deter mine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloadingstaging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughputcapability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem interms of ston and mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields inston throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarlywe assume vessel on berth 90 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desertshield and desert storm these data helped usdevelop mix of vessels likely to support militarydeployment operations we further weighted themix percentages to adjust for

port can achieve closure within 6 days peak day requirements as much as 8350 ston in the equipment reception and handling subsystem identified in the tea port enhancement analysis march 1999 may exceed the shipping subsystem capability 5432 ston perday this means that equipment may require marshaling in various areas in and around valdez mhe and end ramps are available through local stevedores container cranes are available at the port therefore loading containers aboard ships must be accomplished via mobile cranes mobile crane handling rates are often about ½ of specialized container cranes because the port does not have rail access highway access is critical in getting equipment to the port the numberof commercial hetsflatbeds needed to transport the nonroadable vehicles from the brigade tothe port is 886 commercial resources may not be able to furnish the required number of hetsflatbeds to transport the brigade occasional avalanches occur in the thompson pass and keystone canyon areas in the late winterearly spring while the alaska department of highwayscan usually clear road closures in days time avalanches could still cause problem duringdeployment if strategic deployment is requirement for the port of valdez then an agreement should be made with the port authority to ensure the necessary facilities are available in contin gency deployment mileage from fort wainwright to valdez 355 miles is comparable to that from fort wainwright to anchorage about 360 miles the mileage from anchorage to valdez is about 290miles which adds about 725

useful at this time the port of whittier does not have deployment useful throughput we estimated throughput for whittier based onthe completion of improvementsmodifications to the arrc marginal wharf and delong pierthe port throughput was estimated using the port operational performance simulator popscomputer model the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of thethree primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port themodel yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and mton per day the numbers in this section show the throughput yields in ston throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assume avessel on berth 90 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurredduring operations desert shield and desert stormthese data helped us develop mix of vessels likelyto support military deployment operations we further weighted the mix percentages to adjust for differences in cargo and expectations for futuredeployment terminal throughput subsystemsterminal handling staging shipping ship mix percentages 3 22372 container breakbulk barge roroport of whittier alaska mtmctea 18results assuming the arrc marginal wharf and delong pier are made deployment useful the estimated mixed throughput for the port of whittier is 6765 ston per day this estimate assumes that theonly mhe used for shiploading is that which is available in the whittier area this means thatshiploading is restricted to breakbulkbarge and roro operations only large mobile cranes with capacity of at least 100 ston must be brought in to perform container operations unless lifton can occur using ship cranes or the containers are rolled on using container chassis our estimate also assumes the use of 165 acres of open storage using the 10 acres provided in the port information the staging throughput becomes the limiting subsystem and the overall portthroughput is reduced from 6765 ston to 3970 ston per day rail reception for the port is not problem and total reception will improve with highway access capability into whittier because the port of whittier is not considered to be deployment useful unit equipment will move through the port therefore the port would be restricted to occasional shipments of lightbreakbulk cargo because of its ability to throughput hazardous materials hazmatexplosivesthe port of whittier could also move occasional shipments of hazmat1return indexappendix berth evaluation methodology general this appendix provides technique for accomplishing comparative analysis of individual berths the first step is to evaluate the individual berths within port to determine their potential for breakbulk roro container and barge vessel operations individual berth evaluation for the individual berth evaluation comparison is made of the characteristics of each berth and the list of ideal factors required to support the different ship mixes tables 1 through 4 give the ideal factors for breakbulk barge roro and container ship mix operations as the tables show points are awarded for each factor these are then used to compare the potential for each factorthese are then used to compare the potential of each berth to support the four ship mixes ranking of individual berths is established for each type of shipmix operation based on comparison of the total points accumulated by each berth the berth receiving the highest accumulation of points is assigned value of 1 and the remaining berths are ranking

atlantic ocean entrance to the panama canal on the northeast ern shore of manzanillo bay south of coco solo point at 9o 22 north latitude and 79o 53 west longitude the port is 24 kilometers 15 miles eastnortheast of the center of colon and consistsof one long finger pier two small finger piers and one deteriorated wharf the facilities provide1518 linear meters 4980 linear feet of berthing space the maximum depth of 8 meters 26feet mean low water mlw severely restricts the types of vessels that may call at the port nous flag vessels other than barges can call here when fully loaded some breakbulk ships lessthan fully loaded could be accommodated some cargo vessels mainly small coastal freighters and fishing vessels call at the port the port handles mainly breakbulk and general cargo although it has the capability to handle small number of containers using mobile cranes or ships cranes and starboard slewedsternramp rorovessels can also be accommodated subject to draft limitations cargo operations can be conducted 24 hours per day and night berthing is permissible the port was originally part of the us controlled coco solo naval station however since 1979 the authoridad porturaria nacional national port authority has been charged with the adminis tration operation planning and coordination of port activities transportation access water access and harbor characteristics vessels in the atlantic ocean destined for the port of coco solo should head for the approach point 9o 26 53 north longitude and 79o 55 17 west latitude about 56 kilometers 35 miles north of the entrance to limon bay the entrance to mazanillo bay is at the east side of limon bay and is bordered on the north by breakwater and on the south by the city of colon channeldepths along the entry route vary from 14 meters 46 feet to 13 meters 426 feet at mlw thedepth alongside pier 1 ranges from 79 meters 26 feet to 91 meters 30 feet at mlw howeverthe draft alongside the rest of the piers is greater than 4 meters 13 feet mlw average tidalvariation is about 1 foot the port is well protected from waves and swells and vertical restrictions exist along the approach route or within the harbor3highway access one terminal gate referred to as main gate provides access to the port this gate provides access to all four piers another gate gate 4 is used only for pedestrian traffic although it couldbe opened for vehicular traffic if required the main gate is manned 24 hours per day the transisthmian highway also known as boydroosevelt highway is the main supply route msr serving

shallowdraft vessels the beths are designated piers 1 south andwest 2 3 and 4 which is deteriorated beyond use pier 1 finger pier can accommodate ships at three berths on its south side and at one on its west side the north side of the pier cannot handle vessels because of obstructions in the water alongside since pier 1 has the greatest depth alongside 26 feet mlw it is the pier most frequentlyused by small cargo vessels three transit sheds are along the length of the pier and the pier iswell suited for breakbulk vessel or barge operations the pier can accommodate small selfsus taining vessels and nonselfsustaining vessels using mobile cranes to handle cargo piers 2 and 3 small finger piers can berth vessels on their north and south sides because of their shallow alongside depths 13 feet mlw the piers are used mainly by fishing boats the onlycargo operations that could be conducted here are limited barge operations which would requireusing mobile cranes to load and discharge cargo pier 4 marginal wharf can handle only small vessels its alongside depth is 4 meters 13 feet mlw so this pier is used mainly by fishing boats this wharf is in extremely poor condition

this fence is not lighted access to the port complex iscontrolled by armed guards at the main gate guards also periodically patrol the port complex8support services pilotage although not required for most of the vessels entering the port of coco solo pilotage is compul sory for vessels larger than 150 grossregistered tons the panama canal commission pccemploys 240 pilots who assist vessels transiting the canal or entering the ports in the canal areaon the atlantic ocean side of the canal the pcc operates 13 pilot boats pilot service is available24 hours per day and night berthing at the port is permissible harbor craft two commercially operated tugboats each rated at 2400 horsepower are based in the port of cristobal and are available for berthing or barge operations at the port of coco solo the pccalso operates number of tugs to assist vessels in passing through the locks however these tugsare unavailable for normal port operations future developments the evergreen corporation has plans to fund the demolition of piers 1 and 2 and replace themwith new wharf after construction evergreen will operate the new facilities as modern container terminal much the same as manzanillo international terminal 1 mile away this new container terminal will accommodate deep draft vessels with about 12 meters 40 feet of wateralongside the berth is planned to be 612 meters long 2008 feet long with an open apron andstaging for container transfer operations estimated completion date for this new terminal is mid 1998 explosive and hazardous cargo operations only very limited hazardous cargo operations are permitted at coco solo the ports proximity to large civilian population centers prevent the port from performing explosive ammunition opera tions9ii conclusions port operations the port of coco solo is not capable of supporting us military cargo transshipment operations the port cannot accommodate us flag roro container or breakbulk vessels when fully loadedbecause of insufficient depths within the port pier 1 however is well suited for breakbulk operations involving some less than fully loaded breakbulk ships pier 1 has three transit sheds along its apron for general cargo lash and seabee barges could be discharged at any of the berths in this port however the mother ship would have to be moored at anchorage d in limon bay and tugs would be requiredto transport the barges to and from piers 22 kilometers 14 miles away mobile cranes for discharging the barges would have to be procured from local sources because the port has none future operations the port of coco solo will soon be unavailable for any military operation while the evergreen corporation moves forward with its plans to construct new modern container terminal the newfacilities will replace the existing piers 1 and 2 with new wharf this new container terminalwill accommodate deep draft vessels with about 12 meters 40 feet of water alongside and 612meters long 2008 feet long berth with an open apron for container transfer operations safety considerations the port of coco solo is surrounded by populated and developed areas many of these areas fallwithin the 940meter 3150foot quantitydistance arc established for the net explosive weightnew carried on lash barge loaded with ammunition based on these considerations ammunition barges should not be discharged at the port of coco soloport of cristobal panama i general data ii throughput analysis iii conclusion return to index2i general data cristobal is the largest and busiest of the panama national port authority autoridad portuario nacional operated ports the port handles wide variety of vessels and cargos and is the only npa operated port with significant container capability cristobal was constructed

pops model uses weak link analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem interms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this sectionshow the throughput yields in stons approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amount by 3 throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 80 percent ofthe time in developing the throughput scenario weused statistical data

activities provide support for the operating forces of the navy and other activ ities as may be required monitor security assistance matters represent the us navy in latin america and support authorities charged with defense of the panama canal the naval station ison the west shore of balboa bay on the pacific entrance to the panama canal the station contains 100 hectares 247 acres of land much of which was originally tidal marsh the panamacanal borders the east side of the naval station and the interamerican highway forms its southwest boundary and the area north of the station is tidal marsh the port of balboa is across thepanama canal from naval station the naval station has three finger piers which are used for fleet support activity of us naval vessels and occassionally the navies of other friendly foreign countries the average vessel traffic is estimated at over 200 ships per year piers 1 and 2 were turned over to panamanian controlin september 1996 in july 1997 the us navy will cease operating at the naval station transportation access water access the naval station is at the pacific ocean entrance to the panama canal on the western shore of the canal at 8o 58

transportation and military functions the port of balboa located next to panama city in the former canal zone is thepacific terminus of the panama canal it contains the administrative headquarters of the panama canal commission colon located on the atlantic coast entrance to the panama canal is the second largest urban area in panama the port of cristobal located in colon is the major port in panama it handlesmost of the imported freight david is the third largest urban area in panama it serves as regional transportation center because of its location on the segment of the interamerican highway and connects panama citywith costa rica geographically panama has two welldefined areas the atlantic watershed covered by tropical rain forest and the pacific watershed which has distinct dry

about 2 hours study conducted by mtmctea mtmc report 863a27 panama national railroad safety study dated may 1986 found the panama national railroad to be in poor condition with numerous defects evident throughout the system study results at that time were about 6 million dollars to restore the track network to safe operating conditions today conservative estimates toupgrade the rail network to safe operating conditions are around 60 million dollars based on itshazardous condition the railroad is not recommended as means of transporting military cargo orpersonnel panama national railcars carrying containers to the port of cristobal7inland waterways the major inland waterway in the country is the panama canal which extends across the isthmus of panama connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans except for the panama canal inlandwaterways in the country are suitable for only limited navigation although waterways serve asthe main form of transport to and from many sparsely populated areas they are of little commer cial or military value the waterways are natural streams and are undeveloped for navigational purposes transit generally is limited to shallowdraft vessels carrying local products and passengers low tides in estuaries low stream levels during the dry season and debris are the majorcause of waterway interruptions the canal is operated and administered by the panama canal commission us agency with ninemember board panama is gradually assuming control of the canal until the year 2000 whenthe canal will become an entirely panamanian operation an 827 kilometer 514 mile lockandlaketype waterway the panama canal is an artery for ships of all nations it is favorably situated to work centers of commerce and sources of raw materials and thus is an important link in the atlanticpacific trade routes the canal affords ships on these routes substantial advantages in reduced sailing distance time and operating expense the panama canal crosses the narrow central portion of the isthmus of panama low rounded hills and steep slopes between the eastern and western mountain chains comprise the continentaldivide this area 16 kilometers 99 miles wide centered on the axis of the canal and extending48 kilometers 3 miles beyond the mean low water mlw marks on each coast of the isthmuswas originally designated as the canal zone this designation was eliminated in the 1977 unitedstatespanamanian treaty the original boundaries were extended to include all of gatun andmadden lakes and portion of chagres river connecting the two lakes the city of colon is atthe caribbean entrance to the canal and the port of balboa is at the pacific entrance8vessels transiting the canal from the atlantic to the pacific follow the dredged channel tothe gatun locks which will raise vessels 26meters 85 feet once out of the locks shipscross gatun lake via channel to gaillard cut and transit the continental divide at the pacific end of the cut they pass

berth with the highest points is the first preferred berth for that specific loading style and is thereforerated 1 in general one berth is ideal forall military operations the best berthdepends on the type of ship loaded the container berth berth 1516 is the best berth at the port of mina sulman regardlessof what ship is planned this is because the berth has four container cranes open apron and deep water berth 1114 is the next preferred with the finger pier being the least desirable for loading military vehicles and equipment large vessel operations the berths on the finger pier are the least useful for military operations their aprons are too nar row and weak for practical application the berths are also too shallow to fully load large vessels of the remaining berths berth 1516 is preferred because of its container cranes and openapron allowing slight overlap into berth 14 the military can load two large lmsr or fss sized vessels at berth 1516 barge operations some of the berths not mentioned in this analysis might be used to support barge operations to the west of the finger pier are berths for harbor vessels small cargo vessels and offshore supplyand service vessels these berths total about 4000 feet 1200 meters and are 17 to 23 feet 52to 7 meters deep they can only support military operations with barges few key issues forplanning purposes are each mobile crane

engineering agency conducted capability analysis of the port of shuaiba kuwait based on site visits in late may 1997 and march 1999 the port can accommodate vessels as large as the lmsr or fss classes and can support military operations the port of shuaiba is the second largest port in kuwait in terms of annual business being newer than the port of shuwaikh it can accommodate deepdraft containerships it consists of adeep water basin roughly 2900 feet by 2100 feet with three container cranes and two wharf cranes tidal variation is 98 feet berths range in depth from 345 feet to 459 feet at mean low water mlw and all aprons are open two container freight stations provide covered storagethe inland corners of the basin provide support for straightstern roro operations the port is in the southern part of kuwait in generally undeveloped area with growing industrial facilities connector routes and the main highway are in very good condition there are rail roads in kuwait throughput the shiploading subsystem is the least capable of the transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of 21000 short tons ston per day the roro capabil ity is 25000 ston per day application we find the port capable of handling notional armored division in 8 days using three repetitions of two lmsr vessels the port has enough wharf space to simultaneously berth eight fully loaded lmsr or fss vessels if deployment operations use two repetitions of three lmsr vessels then the port can handle notional armored division in 6 days only 357 acres of paved open staging is required to support the unit for twolmsr operation fiftyfour acres are required for threelmsr operation two sixlane highways connect the port to the interstatesystem and can easily handle the additional trafficport of shuaiba mtmctea 3ii general data the military traffic management command transportation engineering agency conducted capability analysis of the port of shuaiba kuwait with support from the 831st us army transportation battalion southwest asia kuwait detachment the major source of data was theshuaiba port authority we visited the port on 27 may 1997 and interviewed port personnel transportation access waterthe port of shuaiba is about 28 miles 45 kilometers south of kuwait city although the port handles less cargo than the port of shuwaikh it can accommodate larger vessels with drafts up to449 feet at mlw 1371 meters at any tidal condition it is located at 29 02 n latitude and 48o 10 longitude the port was originally built to serve the regions industrial base mainly oil refining cement and fertilizer manufacturing and fish processing some berths are unsuitable to support military operations because of their shallow water and congestion of conveyor belts the port has very short entrance channel being situated on the edge of open water the gate between the breakwaters is 650 feet 200 meters wide and 459 feet 140 meters deep

should have the leastdraft of the nine the water at berth 6 will only permit the fss or lmsr to load to draft of 34 feet the number of large vessels that can be handled is restricted by the amount of paved open staging at the port typically 16 acres are required to conduct sustained loading operations on an fssand 25 acres for an lmsr discharging vehicles off vessels requires less staging and

visits in may 1997 and march 1999 updated information on the channel accessing the port was provided by the 831st transpor tation battalion in december 1999 silting has occurred in the ship channel thereby reducing allowable ship draft because the channel depth varies from 2066 feet 62 meters at low tide to 2394 feet 73 meters at high tide only small vessels such as lighterage barges and coastal vessels local to that area can likely access the port therefore we do not consider the port of shuwaikh to be deployment useful unless equipment is transloaded to smaller vessels that can accessthe port dredging is planned for the ship channel due to mercury in the sediment caused by alocal desalinization plant the port handles the most general cargo in kuwait it has 13304 feet of wharf but some

the military port operator should negotiate for use of berth 13 due to its deeper water longer length and availability of cranes berth 4 has essentially military usefulness because of itswater depth and length berth 13 is the preferred berth for all modes of shipping berth 4 has cranes is shallower than berth 13 and is too short for most ocean going vessels barge operations some of the berths otherwise not mentioned in this analysis might be used to support barge operations for example berths 5 through 8 are long enough to handle six seabee barges or nine lash lighters the water depth is only 13 feet along these berths making them unsuitable for military operations other than barges few key issues for planning purposes are each mobile crane can handle 829 mton or 331 ston per day assuming 20 productive work hours and 90 percent berth utilization factor seabee barges are 175 feet long typical lash lighters are 115 feet long crane operating every other barge or lighter provides sufficient working space assuming five mobile cranes are operating one crane for every other lash lighter the barge operations along berths 5 through 8 could support loading or unloading 1600 ston or 4100 mton per day large vessel operations the shallow depth of berth 13 would require large vessels to enter the port with drafts 4 to 6 feet shallower than fully loaded the optimal vessel for the port of salalah is the american eagle class such as the american falcon or the american condor fully loaded these vessels only draw 30 feet of water and could operate unrestricted at berth 13 cape d

ispossible the records of 11 sailings provide an average stow factor of 60 percent loading the vessels with only 60 percent stow factor ensures the vessels will notexceed maximum draft of the port each of the cape d class vessels can carry 108500 square feet of cargoassuming the 60 percent stow factor discussed above at this rate the deployment of the brigade would require six of these vessels unloading roro vessels this size can be done in less than 2 days to meet the 6day requirement the port will have to berth two of these vessels simultaneously throughout the6day deployment three twovessel operating cycles are required to deploy the entire brigadewith these partially loaded vessels two cape d class vessels can berth and operate at the port simultaneously the facilities map earlier in this section provides the berthing configuration summary the port of salalah can process notional armored brigade in 6 days the only concern in the process is the shallow draft of the berths because of the shallow draft 32 feet mlw large ves sels with drafts from 35 to 37 feet have to arrive at the port with less than full loads and possiblyat high tide therefore plans should call

boat harbor normally used for fishing boats and tugs can supporteight lash lighters the water depth is only 12 feet along these berths making them unsuitablefor military operations other than barges few key issues for planning purposes are each mobile crane can handle 331 ston or 829 mton per day assuming 20 productive work hours and 90 percent berth utilization factor seabee barges are 175 feet long typical lash lighters are 115 feet long crane operating every other barge or lighter provides sufficient working space assuming four mobile cranes are operating one crane for every other lash lighter the barge operations along the fishing boat berths could support loading or unloading 1300 ston or 3300mton per day large vessel operations the berth and channel depths are insufficient for any vessel considered in our analysis to operate fully loaded allowing 2 feet of clearance below the keel vessels calling on the port of dohashould have drafts greater than 27 feet 82 meters the vessel with the least restriction is thecape taylor even this vessel violates the 2foot margin safety rule with maximum draft of 28 feet the shallow depth of berths would require large vessels such as fsss and lmsrs to enter the port with drafts roughly 6 feet shallower than fully loaded the optimal vessel for the port ofdoha is the american eagle class such as the american falcon or the american condor fully loaded these vessels only draw 30 feet of water with proper planning these vessels could arriveat the port with cargo loads well enough below maximum draft to operate at the port analysis of this vessels draft is in the application section of this report cape d vessels can also operate at these shallow berths provided typical reduced stow factors occur to reduce the draft below

doha 23 to 29 feet mlw this study evaluates theoperation using american eagle class vessels such as the american falcon or the american condor these vessels only draw 3025 feet of water when fully loaded and have 183000 square feet of deck area in addition to this space for rolling stock the vessels can also carry 252 teusof containers using the stability manual for the american eagle the vessel can transport 10400 ston of military cargo without exceeding the 27 foot maximum allowable draft the pressure of notional armored equipment is about 0683 ston per square foot of cargo shadow area on the deck this allows the american eagle class vessels to be loaded with stow factor of 83 percent we assume cargo is containerized the stow factor will most likely be less considering theaverage stow factor for the eight sailings during desert shield and desert storm for these vesselswas only 62 percent the highest stow factor during these operations was 80 percent theamerican eagle class vessels should have problem at the port of doha cape d vessels can also operate at any berth in the port provided plans and stow factors are used to reduce the draft below their maximum of 33 feet to 27 feet the facilities used depend on decisions made by the doha port authority us military can only assume to have access to about 25 acres of open staging in small pieces at various

simultaneously these vessels only require 1500 feet of the 2995 feet available at berths 15 the facilities map earlierin this section provides the berthing configuration summary the port of doha can process notional armored brigade in 6 days because of the shallow draft 23 to 29 feet mlw large vessels with maximum drafts from 30 to 37 feet have to arrive at theport with less than full loads and possibly at high tide therefore plans should call for partiallyloaded vessels with shallow drafts such as american eagle class with 3025foot maximum draft to operate at the port of doha recommendation

capability of the port of messaieed using the port opera tional performance simulator computer model the model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal themodel yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping

operations to allow deep draft commercial operations wherever possible barge operations should occur in the shallow basin used for tugs and maintenance craft inland of berth 9 for example this shallow basin is about 520 feet long and 460 feet wide about eight barges could be staged for loading at the same time if half of the perimeter supported barge operations each mobile crane can handle 331 ston

or lighter provides sufficient working space with every other barge having crane operating these barge loading positions can handle 1300 ston or 3300 mton of military cargo per day large vessel operations the shallow depth of berths would require large vessels to enter the port with drafts 4 to 6 feet shallower than fully loaded the optimal vessel for the port of messaieed is the american

throughput capability of the port of ad dammam using the port operational performance simulator computer model the model is based on weaklink analy sis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capablesubsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems

craft harbor located south of the east pier is 12 to 15 feet deep and could support barge operations however this area is difficult to secure and is distant from the deepwater berths and anchorages where the bargecarrying vessel might berth the distance toshuttle barges to and from this harbor would reduce the overall operations the ammunition pier can certainly support barge operations but is restricted by the port authority to handle ammunition exclusively operation turbo cads in october 1997 involved barge operations at the container terminal berth 2326 barges were loaded near the roro ramp at the end of the pier the bargecarrying vessel was berthed just south of the barge operations the port authority allowed the usmilitary to use about 1500 feet of the quay this allowed four barges at pierside simultaneously the mobile crane used did not have the reach to access the second third and fourth row of barges future plans for barge operations should call for more wharf space if allowed by the port authority to handle more barges at pierside or else larger crane that can reach several rows of barges severe weather can seriously hinder barge operations each mobile crane can handle 331 ston 829 mton per day assuming 20 productive work hours and 90 percent berth utilization factor with every other barge having crane operating10 barge positions can handle 1600 ston 4100

six additional large vessels canberth at berths 45 and 1020 provided their drafts do not exceed 35 or 36 feet in nearly allcases cargo loads will not exceed these limits proper planning can ensure these vessels do notexceed these drafts the port can berth 13 large vessels the number of large vessels that can be handled is restricted by the amount of paved open stag ing at the port typically 16 acres are required to conduct sustained loading operations on anfss and 25 acres for an lmsr discharging vehicles off vessels requires less staging anddepends on how fast the equipment can be cleared from the port it is reasonable to assumeenough staging the port has 501 acres will be available for several simultaneous ship discharging operationsport of ad dammam mtmctea 20iv application this section evaluates the ports throughput capability for receiving notional armored divi sion since the water in the port of ad dammam is deep this study evaluates the receptionusing vessels of the lmsr

exercises to suggest reasonable stow factorfor these vessels our analysis will assume 65 percent stow factor the facilities used depend on decisionsmade by the ad dammam port authority although the container berths have the best lifting equipment at theport we assume that notall of the container facilities are available thisanalysis assumes the us military will use the facilities along the

very capable port with the ability to throughput an army heavy armored division in 65 days using lmsr vessels and 7 days using fss vessels the port hasseveral deepwater draft berths capable of berthing lmsr or fss vessels roro breakbulkcontainer and barge operations are all feasible at this port the port has 501 acres of open storage which far exceeds deployment requirements about 40 percent of this total is used on daily basis mostly in the container terminal because of future privatization and the estab lishment of freetrade zone some of the current open storage will become unavailable exceptthrough negotiation with the owners of these storage areas rail facilities will not likely beused to process us military vehicles and equipment because of the rail destination

sea port of debarkation spod for contingencies in thesouthwest asia swa region this port can throughput divisionsize unit and can support the berthing of lmsr and fss ships the port consists of 1 terminal with 16 berths total wharf length is 12464 feet and the water depth alongside varies from 39 45 feet lowest astronomical tide lat the channel depth forwater access into the port of jubail is 45 feet lat making this port fss and lmsr accessiblebreakbulk roro container and barge operations are all feasible the apron height above thewater line is about 16 feet and the tidal variation is about 12 feet this means that the rororamp angle is approaching the upper limits for performing roro operations when the water level is at low tide the port has excellent highway access with four gates and several sixlane highways connecting it to the dhahranjubail sixlane superhighway the abu hadriyah sixlane superhighway whichconnects bahrain to kuwait is also readily accessible to the port the nearest airport is dhahraninternational airport located about 1 hour south of jubail near ad dammam this airport canhandle c5 aircraft the port does not have rail access available materials handling equipment mhe include two container cranes at berths 15 and 16 three transtainers in the container terminal seven mobile cranes including 220 short tonston floating crane and three container

the least capable of the three transportation subsystems analyzed the port has mixed throughput capability of over 44500 ston per day notional armoreddivision has 101350 ston of vehicles and equipment computer simulations show that the portis capable of clearing notional armored division in about 5 days using lmsr vessels at threeberths simulations also show the port clearing the notional armored division in 6 days using fss ships at three berths using more ship berths will allow clearance in less than 6 days if desired application for practical application we analyzed notional armored division deploying to the port on lmsr or fss ships using berths 9 and 10 13 and 14 and 15 and 16 deploying notionalarmored division in 6 days requires 16900 ston of vehicles and equipment that includes 90 containers per day to be loaded when the six lmsrs or eight fss plus three cape h vessels deliver equipment to the port on schedule the port can meet port clearance requirements smallerships will require additional time andor berths the division will require about 13 acres of staging to offload and clear an lmsr through the port in 2 days for total of 39 acres per day for three lmsr berths this means that the port has morethan enough paved open staging immediately within the customs area to support the offloading offour lmsr vessels simultaneously the fss requires about 10 acres of open staging per ship off loading for total of 30 acres per day the port has total of 333 acres of paved open staging since the port is largely unused most of this open staging is available on daytoday basis the port of jubail has the capability to handle explosives and dangerous cargoes such as ammuni tion facilities are available to handle fires and other emergencies

pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity of the port of jubail the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloadingstaging and terminal receptionhandling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each sub system in terms of ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this sectionshow the throughput yields in ston throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed willsupport military operations similarly we assumea vessel on berth at the selected berths 70 percentof the time in developing the throughput scenariowe used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desert shield and desert storm these data helpedus develop mix of vessels likely to support military deployment operations we

berths in the port and six lmsr ships using eight fss and three cape h ships port clearancecan be achieved in roughly 6 days the difference in closure times between the lmsr and fssscenarios is due to the additional berthing times for five extra ships using additional ship berthscan place closure times well within the 6day requirement if other ships are used additional berths may be required to meet deployment requirements the port is viable for supporting deployment of notional armored division the lack of mobile cranes may contribute to delays in meeting deployment requirements for

feet long crane operating every other barge or lighter provides sufficient working space assuming five mobile cranes are operating one crane for every other lash lighter the barge operations along

have maximum draft of 34 feet 104 meters and an overall length of 950 feet 290 meters so far there is very little data from exercises to suggest reasonable stow factor for these vessels ouranalysis will assume 65 percent stow factor the facilities used depend on decisions made by the dubaijebel ali port authority this analysis assumes the us military will be able to berth where us navy vessels

the vehicles will likely convoy westward intosaudi arabia the main gate is wellequipped to handle the traffic and isnot far out of the way if however theship operations occur at berths along the west side of the port then gate 3 or 4 may be more practical even thesesmall pov security gates can bearranged to allow one lane of convoy vehicles to depart the port one lane through one of thesesmall gates can accommodate 1500 vehicles per day under controlled clearance procedures thisis sufficient to meet the requirement assuming constant flow of vehicles departing the port the daily clearance requirement is under 900 vehicles the jebel ali road network toward abu dhabi and further into saudi arabia can support the requirement to handle the armored division in 6 days open storage the port

vessels the application map earlier in this report provides the berthing configuration summary the country of uae has rail facilities vehicles and equipment must convoy from the port the port of jebel ali can deploy notional armored division in 6 days the port can accommodate lmsr or fss vessels turning such large vessels is difficult in the inner slip sufficient paved open area and extensive

of supporting military cargo operations it is the only croatian port with specialized container cranes and berths the port canaccommodate the largest of u s military sealift command vessels including fast sealift ships fss up to berth draft limit of 345 feet 1 port operators at rijeka identified four berths as capable of providing support to military operations the most capable berth is the eastwest berth at the container terminal the other berths are the northsouth berth at the container terminal the becko quay and theeast side of the francecshiev pier collectively these four berths can support daily mixed cargo throughput of about 16500 ston or 64400 mton this daily figure is determined by applying an expected ship mix to the overall capabilities of each berthtotal daily throughput estimates by cargo mode are breakbulk3500 ston or 8750 mton roro17700 ston or 70800 mton limited by staging to about 12600ston or 32000 mton and container5650 ston or 14500 mton over time military sustainment cargo operations can expect to throughput about 5000 ston or 15000 mton per day using the recommended berths other ongoing commercial operations in the port and limitations in recycling trucks will prevent some of the ports capability from being dedicated to military support about 4000 ston or 12000 mton per day via rail and about 1000 ston or 3000 mton per day by truck seem reasonable throughput estimates if vessels loaded with unit equipment discharge at the port then daily throughput capability will increase as result of self deploying vehicles moving inland from the port in convoys up to the daily limit shown above highway and rail connections from the port of rijeka inland to zagred were open and passable when the survey team visited the port other links are not considered in this report 1 berth eastwest at the container terminal 970 feet long has 36 feet depth alongside except for the easternmost 184 feet which has 345 feet depth3i general data transportation access water the port of rijeka lat 45º 19 north long 014º 26 east is located on the kvarner bay on the north west adriatic coast of the republic of croatia the port is in shelteredharbor the port is divided into two basins the rijeka port basin and the susak port basin the entrance to the rijeka port basin from the bay is 270 meters wide while the enclosed portion of the susak basin is 45 meters wide both basins are protected bybreakwaters but the container terminal although considered as susak basin is approached directly from the bay 4highway rijeka is located on the west side of the dinaric alps mountain range these mountains effectively separate the coastal region from the rest of the country three highway routes connect the town to the rest of croatia and other european destinations2 the most important of these is the european e65croatian highway 12 major eastwesthighway in croatia this route connects rijeka to the national capital zagreb and the eastern portions of the country the other routes connect the port to the southern region of croatia and to the north with slovenia and central europe croatian highway 2 north and south all routes are rather mountainous and offer significant accessibility problems in winter as result of snow and ice during the survey visit to the port the trip from zagreb to rijeka distance of only110 miles took more than 5 hours by car due to snow conditions the town of rijeka is built paralleling the port so most of the roads and streets in the town either access the port directly or connect with another that does the principle street along the port frontage is riva boulevard 2 highway infrastructure between rijeka and zagreb as well as routes to slovenia and central europe are open and passable links to the eastern regions of croatia and to bosnia are not addressed in this report andmay not be open or passable 5air the town of rijeka is not served by an operating commercial airport there is small general aviation airfield formerly used by the yugoslavian air force about 5 miles northeast of the town currently locals use this facility as an auto racing track light aircraft as well as helicopters could possibly use this facility with the approval of localauthorities rail the port of rijeka is served by the croatian national railways eastwest and northsouth railway lines these lines link the port to zagreb eastwest and the european railwaynetwork via ljubljana slovenia 3 3 port authorities informed the survey team that the rail line to zagreb is open and passable this report does not address lines beyond zagreb into bosnia 6most croatian railroads are single line with adequate passing points along each route to ensure flow according to port operating authorities rail cargo on these lines must meet the requirements the normal profile of the berne international railway clearancediagram appendix c one tunnel restricts the line between rijeka and zagreb the tunnel clearance prohibits large outsized equipment like m1 abrams tanks from moving over the line the croatian railway doesnt have any of the eight axle rail cars typicallyused to transport heavy tanks over european railways most containers moving through the port move via rail cofc7port facilities berthing four piers and six quays see site plan provide about 22 berths of varying lengths and depths at the port most of these have insufficient depth alongside to support military operations with standard military sealift command vessels three areas though offerberths with suitable length and depth to provide the support that military operations will require the best of these is the container terminal on the susak basin or east side of the port this terminal has two berths one of about 970 feet in length

staging the port of rijeka has about 565 acres of open staging available for use this area is spread throughout the port with much of the available area about 20 acres adjacent to thecontainer terminal covered staging the port has number of storage sheds totaling 855000 sq ft located throughout its operating area three large storage buildings support the container terminal area thesebuildings provide about 290000 sq ft of storage space there rail the port is well served by the railroad almost all of the berths are served directly by rail with rail lines extending along most berth aprons only the container terminal berths arewithout apron tracks but these berths have rail loading tracks just inland from the wharf edge the port area has three rail interchange yards in the immediate vicinity one of these is behind the container terminal and the other two are in the rear of thebudimpestansko and praskozagrebacko quay areas these yards collectively appear capable of storing more than 300 railcars many of the containers moving through the port enter and leave as cofc over the ports rail connections highway many of the towns streets access the port directly most of these are extremely congested convoys entering or leaving the port will require police escort through the town center to or from the main highway unloadingloading positions ramps the port of rijeka has fixed rail loadingunloading ramp the ramp is in the rear of the container terminal the ramp is side loading ramp 110 centimeters above the rail height with direct access unlike end ramps that permit circus style loading or unloading for about 15 european standard rail flatcars 60 feet long12docks docks exist for truck loading at the port if required portable or temporary loading docksramps will have to be procured or constructed likewise there are docksplatforms for loading boxcars at the port of rijeka marshaling areas marshaling areas exist near the port the only areas that could support marshaling requirements are the open staging areas around the piers and quays the most useful open staging area about 870000 square feet is in the vicinity of the container terminal materials handling equipment mhe explosive and dangerous cargo operations port authorities informed the survey team that loadingunloading of explosive or other dangerous cargo is permitted with prior arrangement cargoes of this nature must be eitherfirst off or last on and loaded directly to or from transport onward movement must be coordinated with local and national police agencies limit has been set for net explosive quantity neq or net explosive weight new of explosives each shipment 13will be processed on casebycase basis shipments must comply with international maritime organization which regulates carriage of dangerous goods aboard ship and us code regulations for movement of dangerous goods pol operations there are three areas under the control of the rijeka port authority for handling pol tankers at bakar there are two tanker berths accommodating vessels up to 80000 dwt and one berth for tankers up to 40000 dwt at the urinj oil refinery there is berth fortankers up to 200000 dwt another facility the omisalj oil terminal has two berths for tankers up to 350000 dwt port representatives told the survey team that arrangements for receiving storing and distributing pol products in bulk are possible from one of the areas they indicated that the refinery produces gasoline and jet fuel in several grades storage would beaccommodated in one of two ways the first alternative was for mixed storage in tanks holding general products with the facility operator certifying the content of distributed products the other was for accommodating our products in another tank holding themexclusively the decision would be based upon our needs and desires distribution of pol bulk products throughout the country is accomplished by rail and commercial truck tankers our contacts saw problems securing sufficient distribution means for pol14ii throughput analysis general based on the port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity of the port of rijeka the pops model uses weaklinkanalysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading staging and terminal handling the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for eachsubsystem in terms of short tons ston and measurement mton tons per day throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected sites 80 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we took statistical data from operations desert shield and desert storm these data helped usdevelop mix of vessels likely to support military deployment operations we further weighted the mix percentages to adjust for differences in cargo and expectations for future deployment 15terminal clearance and handling highway the port is connected to the main supply route e65highway 12 by two fairly congested city streets the routes into and out of the port complex including the two gateprocessing systems can handle over 20000 ston of equipment and supplies daily roadable vehicles will move directly through the terminal gates in manageable convoys from stagingmarshaling areas designated for these moves vehicles on commercial or military flatbed trailers not equipped with self loading capability will depend on portable ramps ramps exist in the port so they must be constructed or otherwiseprocured locally the pops analysis assumes two ramps at each of the major support sites the container terminal and becko quay areas these ramps will handle about 6400 ston of military cargo per day the port has truck docks the port has 4 transtainers wheeled in the container terminal as well as two reach stacker and four forklift type of container handlers assuming half of this equipment is available to support container chassis operations the port could handle over 12000 stonper day this assumes conservative 300 moves per day maximum daily handling capability for the port is mixed total of the three types of handling each up to its maximum not to exceed the highway limit of 20000 ston 16rail the croatian national railway can move at least 4 trains per day of about 20 cars each from the port in support of military operations this trackage limit is about 4000 ston vehicles loading to flatcars can load directly via the side ramp located in the container terminal this ramp supports about 15 flatcars per shunt the port doesnt have otherramps whether end or side for loading to railcars if required operators could construct an end ramp that could be sited at any of several locations throughout the port given the existing ramp and container handling equipment the port can easily support the 80 railcars day the railway will likely provide for military trains more than the four 20 car trains may become possible through coordination with railway and port officials 17staging the port has about 565 acres of suitable staging area paved distributed throughout its working area the largest single block of this about 20 acres is located adjacent to the container berths availability of the areas varies constantly there are usually number of containers stacked at the container terminal port operators assured the survey team thatthey will make sufficient suitable area available to support military operations the port also has about 855000 square feet of covered storage space like the open area much of this is usually in use storing cargoes moving through the port however covered space will be made available as required by military deployment operations the chart shows the available storage space in the areas of the recommended berths and the various cargo amounts by type that can be stored there the analysis assumed that about 135 acres of open staging area would support military operations the analysisconsidered about 400000 square feet of the available covered space 18shipping throughput totals for the recommended berths appear in the chart below they are based on various factors including mhe availability loading operational and berth usage rates and berthing capabilities for various vessel types assumptions and parameter values used for the pops analysis are shown in appendix ai 19ii conclusions the port of rijeka is fully capable of supporting us military cargo transshipment operations the port is fairly modern container terminal facility capable of accommodating vessels as large as the fast sealift ship up to the draft limits shown in the berthing characteristics table of the transportations subsystems analyzed the least capable is the ship loadingunloading subsystem vessel loadingunloading is limited to about 16500 ston per day of mixed cargo types the other subsystems have greater capabilities than this although the roro staging capability is limited to about 12600 ston this is for the four berths identified by port authorities as being the most likely sites to support military operations actual daily throughput sustainable over the long term will be further limited by other commercial operations taking place concurrently in the port the most likely scenario given past experience in ports of this type is for the daily rail throughput to be about equal to the track capacity for military trains shown on the chart about 4000 ston per day and highway throughput to be limited by the available trucks and the cycle times of same as much as 1000 ston per day with trucks is reasonable the sum of these capabilities is about 5000 ston per day if the port is used to receive unit equipment then self deploying convoys can increase the throughput estimates up to the daily shipping subsystem capacity 20 21 22 23 mtmctea october 1999 0port of antwerp belgium 1 1 antwerp monograph of world port hinterland 166e 2nd quarter 1995 page 23 footnote states source of

capacity of the port of bremerhaven the pops model uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems shiploading or unloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem interms of ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields in ston approximate mton yields were computed by multiplying the ston amount by three throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 70 percent of thetime in developing the throughput scenario we usedstatistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desert shieldand desert storm these data helped us develop amix of vessels likely to support military

operatedprivately owned port capable of handling rollonrolloff roro container bulk and breakbulk ships and barges the port has 2330footlong wharf that makes up the north and south piers and can accommo date two vessels as large as the fss and lmsr it is one of the few ports in northern europe designated for the transshipment of ammunition the port also has some capability of supportingus military cargo shipment operations it can load or unload mixed throughput of at least3080 short tons ston per day it would take about 9 days to load notional armored brigade the port of nordenham connects with the inland waterway network making barge transport an effective shipping method rail and barge are the normal methods of shipping to and from thisport the river however limits the effectiveness of highway transport to and from the port theport is on the west side of the river limiting movement to the east and most of europe highwaytraffic has to cross the river in bremen the 13foot tidal range limits normal roro operations at the port nordenham performs roro operations by driving vehicles onto pontoon barges and then lifting the vehicles to the apron or railcar the port has four wharf cranes three 24 ston and one 72 ston and container cranes it has 22 acres of open staging the port is certified for transshipment of ammunition and explosives the limit is 3 million pounds net explosive weight new for normal operations for contingency operations the limit is doubled to 6 million pounds new each breakbulk or container ship can be loadedunloaded in about 212 days the time required to loadunload the ship would be the limiting factor in thetime required to move the explosives into the portport of nordenham germany mtmctea 3ii general data nordenham is modern

pops model uses weaklink analysis todetermine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems shiploading or unloading staging and terminal handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum through put capability for the port the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this section show thethroughput yields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying theston amount by three throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will supportmilitary operations similarly we assume vessel onberth at the selected berths 70 percent of the time indeveloping the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desert shield and desertstorm these data helped us develop mix of vesselslikely to support military deployment operations wefurther weighted the

the port of nordenham has history of supporting us military deployments during recent exercise adventure express february 1997 the port was used to deploy 213 pieces of rolling stock and containers the units consisted of allied command europe mobile force land the 6th aviation brigade the 5th of the 2nd air defense artillery battalion battery and the 1125th field artillery battalion the equipment arrived in the port by rail and was lifted from the berth onto pontoon barges and then driven onto the ships two roro ships with stern doorramps mv arroyofrio dos and mv cap afrique were loaded at the port the mv arroyofrio dos was loaded 1 february 1997 between 0600 and 2100 hours the mv cap afrique was loaded 2 february 1997 between 1800 and 2200 hours loading resumed on 3 february1997 at0600 and completed at 1300 hoursport of nordenham germany mtmctea 20v conclusions the port of nordenham is multioperational with the capability to handle all types of vessels tainer roro breakbulk and barges the port is fully capable of supporting us military cargo transshipment operations although the tidal range limits normal roro operations the port can accommodate vessels as large as thelmsr and fss as shown in the berthing characteristics table the port also has developed aneffective way to handle roro operations even though it has large tidal variation of 13 feet this entails driving equipment from the ship onto pontoon barge and then lifted onto the apron or waiting railcar the port most likely will be used for ammunition transportation since it is one of the few ports designated for the transshipment of ammunition the inland water network makes barge transport an effective shipping method the port connects to this network and provides third alternative for moving cargo inland normal transport to and from this port will be by rail and barge for loading or unloading ships highway transport to and from this port would not be as efficient because of the river crossingsand limited highway network going to the port of the transportation subsystems analyzed the least capable is the shipping subsystem because of limited shipping in the port this system is limited to mixed throughput capability of 3080 ston using the north and south piers and the desert shielddesert storm ship mix commercial operations taking place concurrently in the port will limit actual daily throughput sustainable over time by an appropriate percentage of the terminals overall capability1port of ancona italy i general data ii throuput analysis return to index2i general data

throughput analysis general based on the port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capability of the port of ancona the pops model is based on weaklink analysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared tofind the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughputcapability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for threesubsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80 percent of the port facilities will supportmilitary deployments also due to thesize of the port we assume that the berths will have ships 80 percent of the time the ship mix is

the costa morenaterminal modern facility compatible with container and roro operations the inner harbor is for the old port and is in the congested downtown area of brindisi the wharves in the old port primarily support commercial ferry operations between italy greece andalbania the port has direct water access from the adriatic sea the only vertical or overhead restriction on ships entering the port is 98foot height restriction near the brindisi airport to ensure safe approach zone for landing aircraft the rest of the port does nothave any vertical or overhead restrictions deep draft anchorages are located near the portand turning basins are adequate inside the port water access3highway brindisi is large city with heavy traffic congestion in its downtown area highways to wharves in the inner harbor go through the congested commercial center of town the costa morena terminal has direct access to ss 379 and ss 16 via costa morenaextension this extension bypasses the heavily congested downtown area air brindisi has an airport northwest of the middle harbor the airport has two runways the longest being 3000 meters 9840 feet and is capable of landing large cargo planes rail major rail line extends northwestward from brindisi to bari another key rail line extends westward to taranto rail access and facilities at the port are good and extend toboth the middle and inner

multicargo port with specialization in commercial ferry operations the costa morena terminal is the most versatile of all the terminals and the most desirable for military operations it is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge operationsthe inner harbor wharves are used mostly for commercial ferry operations and somebreakbulk operations also the italian navy has facilities on both sides seno di ponenteand seno di levante of the inner harbor military operations will most likely take place at the costa morena terminal and the wharves on the east side of the seno di levante in the inner harbor other wharves areavailable in the inner harbor but will not likely be available for military operations because of the commercial ferry and italian navy operations also the heavy traffic to the inner harbor makes the use of these wharves impractical the availability of lightingvaries throughout the port lighting is poor at some piers and staging areas in theseareas night operations will

capability of the port of genova the pops model is based on weaklink analysis in which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximumthroughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values forthree subsystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 70 percentof the port facilities will support militarydeployments also due to the size of the port we assume that the

operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capability of the port of spezia the pops model is based on weaklink analysisin which each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal themodel yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging and terminalprocessinghandlingin terms of short tons stons per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 60 percent of the portfacilities will support military deployments also due to the size of the port we assume that the berths will have ships 70 percent ofthe time the ship mix is determined bydesert shield and desert storm

available much of this about 45 acres directly supports the tuscany docks terminal although the port does not have specific location for supporting helicopter operations the tuscany docks terminal offers the best possibility for these type of operations another area offering support for helicopters is the u s army facility at camp darby about 2 miles away byroad on one mission during operation desert shield 100 helicopters landed and were preparedfor ocean shipment at the tuscany docks terminal covered staging the port has about 415000 square feet of covered storage the warehouses and storage buildings providing this space are spread throughout the ports terminal areas most are privately ownedand operated availability of these areas to support military operations will require arrangement with the building operators nearby camp darby is an alternative site for covered storage the depot area has over 480000 square feet of covered storage the depot likewise has more than16

the terminals on the north end of the port and the old port railway station for those terminals on the south end all terminals are rail served including berth apron rail tracks at most of theterminals the railway network within the port has about 72 kilometers of track most of whichsupports intermodal rail operations several rail classification yards also support operations at the port the tuscany docks terminal has three loading or offloading spurs adjacent to the staging areas trains entering the tuscany terminal area must pass over swinging rail bridge thatcrosses the navicelli canal the navacelli canal connects the port to the tombolo docks atcamp darby an area used to support ammunition shipping there several locations throughoutthe port offer access for portable end ramps that can support circus style rail loading and unloading highway highway access to most of the ports newer terminals is very good an autostrada extension the livorno portflorence highway connects the tuscany docks terminal and other terminals on the ports north side to the national superhighway system access to the older terminal areas is calambrone railway station at livorno12adequate most of the time but extremely congested at normal commuting hours most roads leading to these older terminals pass through congested city streets the ports terminals areconnected by number of internal roads which are poorly marked and are often very congested the port is served by two main gates the tuscany dock terminal gate off the via massaua connects that terminal and other northern terminals to the highway system this route passes overthe calambrone bridge crossing the navicelli canal the older terminals are accessed by the gateon via porticolo once inside these gates the ports terminals are accessed by individualentrances from the internal roadway system there are unusual height or weight restrictionsleading into the port from the main highway network gate into tuscany docks

throughout the port offeradequate sites for employing these ramps the tuscany docks terminal has three rail spursadjacent to the staging area that are the best location for ramp usage likewise portable truck ramps can be used in the docks staging area docks docks exist for truck or boxcar loading or unloading at the port marshaling areas marshaling areas exist immediately adjacent to the port the closest areas usable for this purpose are located at camp darby and the depot together these areas offer more than 30 acres that could serve as marshaling areas to support military operations

livorno the pops model performs weaklink analysis inwhich each of three subsystems is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable the weakest subsystem determines the maximum throughput capability of the port the model yields throughput capability values for each of the subsystems terminal handlingprocessing staging and ship loadingunloading in terms of short tons ston and

ravenna the pops model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapable subsystemthe weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the modelyields throughput capability values for three subystems shipping staging and terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80 percent of the portfacilities will support military deployments also due to the size of the port we assume that the berths will have ships 80 percent ofthe time the ship mix is determined bydesert shield and desert storm statisticswe weighed the percentages to adjust for differences in cargo deadweights and expectations for future

simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity of the port of rotterdam the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation

each subsystem in terms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in thissection show the throughput yields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed bymultiplying the ston amount by three throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selectedberths 70 percent of the time in developing thethroughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occurred during operations desert shield anddesert storm

pilotage is requiredfor berthing and undocking pilots are available 24 hours day an explosives anchorage is alsonearby water access4highway the port is connected with state railways and highways network most streets in the port area except for major roads in and out of samsun are narrow and congested traffic is heavy most ofthe day the port has only one highway gate with one lane in each direction the gate is located off the black sea coastal highway which is in excellent condition and is four lanes for the first mile thenit narrows to two lanes northwest to sinop it also has two lane access southwest toward ankarawhere it becomes four lanes at the e88 merge east of samsun along the black sea coastalhighway the road begins with four lanes after the first 6 miles the road narrows to two lanes the port has bridges ramps or overhangs that cause height restrictions all paved areas within the port are hard surfaced and capable of withstanding heavy vehicular traffic there are

the pops model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapablesubsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminalthe model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping staging andterminal processinghandling in terms of measurement tons mton per day the analysis assumes that 70 percent of the port facilities will supportmilitary deployments and that theberths will have ships 95 percent ofthe time also the ship mix is basedon desert shield and desert

the port directly from the staging areas vehicles on commercial or military flatbed trailers not equipped with means for loading vehicles mustuse portable ramps we assume that troops will build or acquire two portable ramps for flatbedtruck and semitrailer operations these ramps could handle about 5800 mton of militaryvehicles and equipment per day the port has truck docks and will therefore use ramps to stuff vans approximately eight van semitrailers can load simultaneously at various locations throughout the port with 60 factor toaccount for delays resulting from the ramps these eight loading operations could load about 1100mton per day the port of samsun has container handlers available for use container on flatcar operations require mobile cranes 15rail rail clearance at the port is very good the tcdd could remove 3 trains of 30 railcars each day if necessary railyards within the port could store about 200 railcars outside the port is railyard that can store 200 railcars it is generally used for storing and handling agricultural shipments vehicles on flatcars would require portable end ramps to load we assumethe troop would build or acquire twoportable end ramps suggestedlocations for the ramps are shown in themap to the righ equipment or supplies in boxcars like van semitrailers would require rampsfor loading since the port has noboxcar handling docks

deploymentusing vessels of the 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamsea class such as the 1st lt daldomerolopez although these vessels have maximum draft of 32 feet 1 inch 98 meters we assumethe vessels will arrive with shallow enough draft to berth at the port during high tide the vesselshave lightship draft of only 14 feet 4 inches 44 meters currently the facility use depends on decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and mmaf because of the korean commitment to the defense of their country and considering cur rent facility use of the port we assume all of the port and the nearby kunsan rail station will bemade available for military use we also assume that other military units us or republic ofkorea will be competing for port assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship and clear the port the port of kunsan has mechanical roro ramp inneed of repair since the 2nd lt john p bobo class vessels have semislewing stern ramps ouranalysis does not consider the ports mechanical roro ramp potential port use during deployment 19requirements the likely requirement for the port of kunsan would be to deploy notional armored brigade to support the overflow of deployment operations at larger ports we assume the port must deploythe brigade in only six days of offloading and port clearance the brigade has to move about2820 vehicles and 150 containers although kunsan is far north in korea and rail deploymentsare unlikely we will analyze the deployment using the railconvoy option because vehicles willhave to road march to the kunsan rail station the gates of the port and the local roadwaysthrough the city of kunsan will have to handle the entire brigade about 1260 210 per day roadable vehicles would pass the rail station and continue

done in under two days to meet the six day requirement the port will have to berth two of these vessels simultaneously three twovessel operating cycles are required to deploy the entire brigade with these partially loaded vessels this analysis assumes the vessels arrive at the port at high tide with less than full loads the port can berth six of these vessels this exceeds the requirement to berth

the deployment process is the shallow draft of the berths because of the shallow draft 26 feetmlw large vessels will have to arrive at the port with less than full loads and at possibly at hightide even if additional ships are required to limit the drafts the port can deploy the brigade in therequired time the highway and rail access to the port are sufficient to meet the requirement and the

areas at the export wharf are converted to covered storage ships may need to be diverted tothe container wharf the development of open storage areas at the container wharf should easethe conversion of open storage to covered storage at the export wharf and will likely increase thenumber of fss ships that the port can handle arrangements should be made for selfdeployable vehicles to use the sixlane

operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capability of the port of masan the pops model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed

subsystems shipping hardstand mar shaling and terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80percent of the port facilities will sup port military deployments also due to the size of the port we assumed aberth utilization factor of 90 percent the ship mix is determined by desert shield and desert storm sta

to the terminals roadable vehicles will either process to an offport marshaling area or to hardstand marshaling areas within the port vehicles requiring transport on commercial or military flatbed trailers not equipped with means for loading vehicles must use portable ramps within the terminal we assume that the 1317th medium port command can provide two portable end ramps one foroperations on

based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping hardstand marshaling and terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80percent of the port facilities will sup port military deployments also due to the size of the port we assumed aberth utilization factor of 80 percent the

switching operations at the mokpo train station we assume that the military portoperator would make arrangements for use of two portable end ramps at mokpo one ramp couldbe placed at spur in the port and the other would go to spur two at the railyard however because only small cargo can be loaded at the spurs in the port to meet rail clearances between the port and railyard we assume all end ramp

days the rail subsystem is the weak link in the port clearance process equipment requiring rail transport must convoy throughmokpo to the rail station because rail line clearances are minimal on the spur connecting the portto the rail station the two rail spurs most likely to support end ramps together can hold only 17 railcars the access into the railyard at the rail station is onelaned and open storage is minimal if rail transport is not required the port can throughput an armored brigade in 5 days to accom plish this the port of mokpo must ensure at least 10 acres of open storage are available for mar shaling we assume that equipment and cargo will remain at the port for one day recommendation the port of mokpo has potential as an overflow port when problems or delays occur at the

general this section evaluates the throughput capability of the port of mukho using the port operational performance simulator pops computer model the model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal themodel yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping hardstand marshalingand terminal processinghandling in short tons ston per day this analysis assumes maximum of80 percent of the port facilities can be made available at any one time for this reason we ran all port analysesusing an 80 percent facility use factor also the ship mix is based ondesert shield and desert storm statistics we weighted the

armored brigade because of the shallow drafts at the port of mukho 21 to 30 feet this study evaluates the deployment using vessels of the 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamsea class such as the 1st lt dal domero lopez although these vessels have maximum draft of 32 feet 1 inch 98 meters we assume the vessels will arrive with shallow enough draft to berth accomplishing this mayrequire additional vessels the vessels have lightship draft of only 14 feet 4 inches 44meters currently the facility use depends on decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and mmaf because of the korean commitment to the defense of their country and considering current facility use of the port we assume all of the port will be made available for military use we also assume that other military units us or republic of korea will be competing for port assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship and clear theport potential port during deployment13requirements the likely requirement for the port of mukho would be to deploy notional armored brigade to support the overflow of deployment operations at larger ports we assume the port must deploy the brigade in only six days of offloading and port clearance the brigade has to move about 2820 vehicles and 150 containers as described earlier in this analysis the rail facilities at theport of mukho are insufficient to support military operations all deployment inland is by highway using an oconus motorconvoy option about 1260 210 per day roadable vehicleswould drive out the gates towing 820 140 per day trailers

equipment will marshal in open areas away from the aprons there are nearby areas that might provide additional offsite staging area marshaling the entire brigade of equipment 642645 square feet requires 37 acres we assume the maximum amount in the port at any time is about one and half days of the required portthroughput this requires the port to provide 154 acres of paved open area to support the deployment the port can not meet the requirement open storage 0510152015154acres capability requirement16shipping an armored brigade has 642645 square feet of vehicles and equipment the deck space on the 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamsea class vessels is 256566 square feet not including the tainer cells which can carry an additional 546 teus assuming 75 percent stow factor each of these vessels can carry 192242 square feet of vehicles and equipment at this rate the deployment of the brigade would require only 33 of these vessels if each were fully loaded since thewater depth at the port can not accommodate fully loaded 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamseaclass vessels we assume 27 additional vessels are required for the deployment unloadingroro vessels this size can be done in under two days to meet the six day requirement the portwill have to berth two of these vessels simultaneously three twovessel operating cycles arerequired to deploy the entire brigade with these partially

required amount the water at the port is too shallow to berth fully loaded 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamsea class vessels if the staging problem above can be resolved the deployment will require additional vessels to limit the draft two vessels will have to operate simultaneously to accomplish this the vessels must be berthed as shown on the earlier application map the highway access to the port is sufficient to meet the requirement there are rail facilities that can support military operations vehicles and equipment must convoy away for the port recommendation we do not recommend the port of mukho be considered for deployment of brigadesized units this is for three reasons the port does not quite have enough open area to support the deployment the water depth is insufficient to berth

simulator pops computer model the model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the least capable subsystem the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal themodel yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping hardstand marshalingand terminal processinghandling in short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80 percent of the port facilities will sup port military deployments also dueto the size of the port we assumed aberth utilization factor of 90 percent the ship mix is determined by desert shield and desert storm sta tistics we weighted the percentagesto adjust for differences in cargodeadweights and expectations for

port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capability of the port of pusan the pops model is based on weaklink analysis inwhich each subsystem is analyzed separately and then compared to find the leastcapable sub system the weakest subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for three subsystems shipping hardstand marshalingand terminal processinghandling in terms of short tons ston per day based on current activity level at the port the analysis assumes that 80percent of the port facilities will sup port military deployments also due to the size of the port we assumed aberth utilization factor of 90 percent the ship mix is determined by desert shield and desert storm sta tistics we weighted the percentagesto adjust for differences in cargodeadweights and expectations forfuture deploymentsship mix percentages 223 723 breakbulk container roro bargeterminal throughput

be seen from the bar chart below the congestedpusan roadways are more of weak link in the system rather than the gates to the terminals theefforts of the city to develop improved roadways in and around pusan to provide direct access tothe container terminals and to provide an inland container depot may do much to relieve conges tion roadable vehicles will either process to an offport

decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and mmaf because of the korean commitment to defense of their country and considering current facility use of pusan we assume that 50 percent of the jasungdae andshinsundae terminals would be available for military use in addition to pier 8 because the kamman container terminal is presently under construction we assume deploying units could use the unimproved storage area for additional marshaling if it is needed we also assume that other military units us or republic of korea will be competing for these facilities during the time thatthe armored division occupies the port we further assume that the required assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship and clear the port potential port use during deployment41requirements the likely requirement for the port of pusan would be to deploy notional armored division in 6 days of ship offloading and port clearance the division has to move about 8470

nine fssships will deploy notional armored division this division must deploy through the port in 6 days because of this the storage requirement is to supportthree sustained offloading operations although an fss load of cargo can be offloaded on as little as 8 acres of hardstand marshaling we determined 10 acres 40 510 square meter are required for sustained offloading operations the10acre per fss requirement depends on port clearing capabilities and the availability of offportmarshaling areas the highway and rail portions of this application show that port clearance should not be problem offport marshaling areas should be available in several nearby areas including the pusan storage facility k9 airfield and the undeveloped storage area at kammancontainer terminal of the 10 acres less

facility use depends on decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and mmaf because of the korean commitment to the defense of their country and considering current facility use of the port we assume all of the port will be made available for military use we also assume that other military units us or republic of korea will be competing for port assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship and clear theport potential port use during deployment 16requirements the likely requirement for the port of samchok would be to deploy notional armored brigade to support the overflow of deployment operations at larger ports we assume the port must deploy the brigade in only six days of offloading and port clearance the brigade has to move about 2820 vehicles and 150 containers as described earlier in this analysis there is direct accessby rail to the port of samchok the nearby rail station is only configured for bulk cement operations because of

feet 55 meters and the total deck space is 12882 square feet 1198 square meters currently facility use depends on decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries mmaf because of the koreancommitment to defense of their country and considering current facility use at sokcho we assumeall of the new wharf and associated storage area are available for military use we also assumethat other military units us or republic of korea will be competing for port assets and facil ities during the time that the armored brigade occupies the port we further assume that the required assets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship andclear the port the port of sokcho has not established that straightstern operations are feasiblehere we are assuming that the necessary adjustments can be made to make straightstern operations feasible potential port use during deployment17requirements the likely requirement for the port of sokcho would be to deploy notional armored brigade to support the overflow of deployment operations at larger ports we assume the port must throughput the armored brigade in 6 days of shiploading

routesappear adequate for handling the daily throughput of equipment port officials have not established that straightstern operations can occur here if adjustments can be made to accommodate straightstern ramp offloading we assume that the maximum number of ships that can offload simultaneously at the new wharf is four recommendation the port of sokcho has potential as an overflow port

tonghae per day overall the central pier and the outboard end of the north pier are best suited for military operations thereason is that they both canuse the open storage at thecentral pier although the central pier is short for fss operations an fss couldextend into the basin toconduct operations the coalpier also has some open area but it is largely obstructed by the coal conveyor and bulkloading equipment 15iii application this section evaluates the ports throughput capability for deploying notional armored brigade this analysis evaluates the deployment using vessels of the 2nd lt john p bobo mpsamseaclass such as the 1st lt daldomero lopez these vessels have maximum draft of 32 feet 1 inch 98 meters which is within the capability of the port the semislewing stern ramps can operate along contiguous wharfage currently the facility use depends on decisions made by the korean ministry of defense and mmaf because of the korean commitment to the defense of their country and considering current facility use of the port we assume all of the port will be made available for military use wealso assume that other military units us or republic of korea will be competing for portassets both transporters and people will be available to adequately offload the ship and clear the port potential port use during deployment 16requirements the likely requirement for the port of tonghae would be to deploy notional armored brigade to support the overflow of deployment operations at larger ports we assume the port must deploy the brigade in only six days of offloading and port clearance the brigade has to move about 2820 vehicles and 150 containers there are currently rail facilities at the port and the nearby rail station is insufficient to support military operations all deployment inland is by highway using an oconus motorconvoy option about 1260 210 per day roadable vehicles would drive out the gates towing 820 140 per day trailers also about 230 fortyfoot flatbeds

must be berthed as shown on the earlier application map including the adjacent undeveloped area the port has adequate open area to support the deployment the highway access to the port is sufficient to meet the requirement there are rail facilities that can support military operations vehicles and equipment must convoy away for the port recommendation we recommend the port of tonghae be considered to deploy brigadesized units provided further deployment by rail is not required plans should call for the use of the outboard section of the north berth and the central berth all the ports

ammunition transshipment operations occur at the anchorages the ammunition storage facilities of hiro and akizuki directly support ammunition operations at the anchorages still the anchorages are actually referred to in the milstamp as water port code ul1 kure this often causes confusion when operations are said to take place in either hiro or akizuki when in fact they occur in kure the purpose of our study was to determine the capability of each storage facility to trans ship cargo and not to argue geography therefore in this report the storage facilitieswill be linked to the

the transshipment operation includes stuffing munitions into containers staging the tainers loading the containers to barges and transferring the containers from barges to sea going vessels in stream or the reverse of this process using weaklink analytical approach to these functions will identify the least capable the weakest subsystem determines the maximum throughput capability of the facility the analysis yields throughput capability values for each of the subsystems terminal handlingprocessing staging and ships loadingunloading in terms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton and

ammunition storage areas of hiro and akizuki 20terminal handling container stuffingaccording to operations personnel at the 83d ordnance bn the hiro and akizuki stor age facilities stuffing teams can stuff about 16 containers per day at each facility addi tionally teams at kawakami ammunition storage area can stuff about 1821 containers daily 3 these kawakami containers can then be transported to hiro by truck this gives the battalion stuffing total of about 50 containers daily 4 converting teus to ston and mton this equates to about 650 stonmton per day highwayno explosive cargo is permitted to move through akizuki by highway japanese highway traffic regulations prohibit this type of movement current rules also limit the movement of explosives by highway to or through hiro and kawakami only 10 trucks daily are available to move containers between these two facilities because highway congestion limits speed each truck can only make about three round tripsper day this is reduced to two trips daily during winter as japanese law prohibits explosive laden vehicles from operation during hours of darkness 5 these ten trucks can move the 1821 containers loaded each day 3 mhe at kawakami can only support empty containers in order to support loaded boxes operators must contract for mhe 4 each twentyfoot equivalent unit teu is estimated to contain about 13 stonsmtons of cargo 5

limited of the three hiro has the most open staging area about 13 acres or about 566000 square feet most of this area is not paved so shoring material is required to support loaded containers staged there using planning estimate of 120 containers per acre for boxes staged onehigh these 13 acres can provide staging for as many as 1560 empty containers akizuki has about 5 acres spread throughout the facility that can be used for open stag ing this is about 220000 square feet there too shoring is required to support contain ers staged on unpaved areas the akizuki facility can stage as many as 600 containers note actual number of boxes staged at either of these facilities will depend on explosive safety factors and quantity distance considerations explosive safety limited staging will be

container capable crane tugs shuttle barges between the piers and the vessels at anchorage normally one barge is along side the vessel while another is at the pier mtmcs stevedoring contractor has 9 barges available to support ammunition operations8 six of these are 250 long ton lt capacity steel flatdeck barges which have removable wood framework that supports the spray skirt plastic tarp the other three are 200 lt bc type barges depending on the barge type and container weights between 9 and 16 containers move on each barge using conservative handling rate of about 8 lifts per hour then it takes between 68 and 120 minutes to load or unload barge with containers9 7 army watercraft and similar vessels can berth and work at the barge piers up to depth alongside limit the logistics support vessels lsv the largest vessel of this type for example can load or unload directly at the piers at about the same work rate as barges the lsv has payload of 50 double stacked containers or

must be selfsustaining container loadingmtmctea ammunition storage areas of hiro and akizuki 25the contractor provides up to four longshore gangs that load or unload containers to or from the barges each barge shuttle requires two gangs one at the facility and one aboard ship therefore the labor force can support two shuttle operations running currently these can take place either both at one of the storage areas or divided one at each location movement between pier and anchorage takes one hour or less assuming four barges support each operation one alongside the vessel one at the pier and two in route oneinbound and one outbound then work can proceed throughout the day with little if any stoppage contracted longshore personnel work shift from 0830 to 1800 hours daily or 95 hours japanese law prohibits them from transloading ammunition before sunrise or after sun set however blocking bracing and tiedown of containers aboard ship may continue until completed if the hourly lift rate of 8 boxes per hour is maintained at both the pier and the vessel and if one hour is used for lunch then each twogang team can load unload about 68 containers or 884 stonmton per day this means

throughput capacity for the port of hachinohe japan the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloading staging and terminal process ing and handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amount by 25 for breakbulk and container cargo and multiplying by 4 for roro cargo throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities ana lyzed will support military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 75 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis of deployments that occured during operation desert shield and desert storm this data helped us develop mix of vessels most likely to support military deploy ment operations we further weighted the mix percentages to adjust for differences in cargo and expectations for future deployments terminal throughput subsystems ship mix percentages 223 723 breakbulk container roro barge mtmctea port of hachinohe 19terminal clearance

throughput capability for deploying the 25th infantry division light using fss vessels the likely requirement for the port of pearl harbor is to deploy the 25th infantry division in six days of reception and throughput the division less the brigade in alaska is based at schofield barrackswithin 30minute drive of the port over highways h2 and h1 the movement to theport will largely be by convoy although some vehicles and outsize equipment may move by flatbed truck this analysis will assume fourday deployment for the divisions equipment to the port and fourday vesselloading period as shown in the chart below 3 terminal inprocessinghandling highway military vehicles and containers arriving by convoy or flatbed will enter one of several gates leading into the terminals the primary highway leading from schofield barracksto the terminals at pearl city and the main fisc area is the hawaii state highways h2to h1 then h1 to kamehameha highway terminal entry roads have two lanes port support activity personnel will assist base security police in receiving vehicles at the terminal gate and directing them to processing area flatbeds arriving will offload ateither the docks in the fisc area or at portable or temporary end ramp as required daily vehicle and equipment arrivals at the terminal are estimated 4 to be 52 flatbeds with loaded equipment two hets with heavy equipment 320 self propelled vehicles and 215 trailers additionally about 69 containers per day will arrive the total daily reception requirement is about 2750 ston of vehicles and equipment these dailydeployment rates do not exceed the capability of any of the three terminals to receivecargo 3 outload period could be compressed into as little as five days if operation is conducted at pearl city 4 estimate is based on the reduced size of the division in hawaii and represents about twothirds of light infantry divisions vehicles and equipmentday 123456 move to port xxxx shiploading xxxxus naval base pearl harbor 21shipping the current size of light infantry division requires 28 fsssized ships to deploy the 25th infantry division has only two of its brigades in hawaii therefore we will assume the vessel requirement is only two fsssized vessels all three terminals could load two vessels of this type concurrently the asmp deployment standard requirement is to outload division in six days in order to meet the deployment timeline pearl harbor terminal operators need to work only one vessel at time the pearl harbor berths can easily meet this requirement5 six day deployment period will provide more time than required for loading two fss sized vessels note although this analysis assumes the 25th division will deploy using two fsssizedships the number of shipsrequired depends on the shipping mix selected the adjacent table provides ship quantities requiredfor various other ship types staging although an fssload of cargo can be staged and loaded on 10 acres 16 acres arenormally required for sustained loading operations of these 16 acres about two acres are required for the staging of containers for each fss while all three of the terminal areas can easily berth the vessel requirement for outloading the division only the pearl city terminal has sufficient staging to warrantconsideration as first choice for this application analysis neither terminal area has the necessary 20 acres of staging required for two fsss the pearl city terminal area comes closest to providing the requirement with about 15 acres additionally theparking area adjacent to the aloha stadium could serve as an intermediate stagingvehicles and equipment there could be called forward to either the pearl city or fisc berths as needed without negatively affecting the loading 5

summary the pearl harbor complex has adequate facilities to support the deployment of the 25th infantry division staging near the berths is an issue if the two vessels are loadedconcurrently the availabile area is less than capable of staging all of the divisionscargo if the deployment uses only one vessel at time then there is adequate stagingat the pearl city terminal area to support the

computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity for us fleet activities sasebo the pops modeluses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transportation subsystems ship loading or unloading staging and terminal processing and handling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem interms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in thissection show the throughput yields in ston approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amount by 25 for breakbulk and container cargo and multiplying by 4 for roro cargo throughput computations are based on the assumption that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will support military operationssimilarly we assume vessel on berth at theselected beths 75 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis

capable of supporting military cargo trans shipment operations berths 23 46 and 78 are the preferred berths for military op erations and can accomodate vessels as large as the large medium speed rollon rolloff lsmr and fast sealift ship fss as shown in the berthing characteristictable however the 348 foot draft along side these berths could limit the amount ofcargo the vessels could take onboard the lmsr and fss have maximum draft of about 35 and 37 fet respectively india basin can handle many vessel types but be cause of the narrow apron width is more suited toward handling breakbulk combination ships and naval combatant vessels with draft of less than 348 feet the nearby akasaki pol terminal with its open apron offers more flexible accomo dations for vessels of all cargo types especially large deep draft roro and combination vessels berths 1 through 3 at akasaki have depths alongside of 37 to 40 feetakasaki also has wide work apronand nearby open staging areas which make itideal for performing shiploading operations on fss and lmsr vessels of the transportation subsystems analyzed at sasebo and based on the most likely ship mix the least capable is the ship loading

operations 6 six of these are 250 long ton lt capacity wooden well deck barges the other three are 200 lt bc type barges assuming each vessel operation requires three barges the two facilities can support three separate loading or unloading operations it takes about two hours to load each barge with palletized breakbulk cargo each load carries about 25 ston of muni tions assuming each barge handles two loads per day total daily throughput for both facilities is about 450 ston or about 500 mton of breakbulk munitions container if containerhandling equipment che is made available none currently available then hario could support two container operations depending on the barge type and container weights between 9 and 16 containers move on each barge using servative handling rate of about 8 lifts per hour then it takes between 68 and 120 minutes to load or unload barge with containers 7 assuming that us fleet activi ties sasebo personnel both military and japanese nationals work shift from 0800 to 1800 hours daily or 10 hours japanese law prohibits them from transloading ammunition before sunrise or after sunset however blocking bracing and tiedown of containers aboard ship may continue until completed if the hourly lift rate of 8 boxes per hour is maintained at both the pier and the vessel and if one hour is used for lunch then each twogang team can loadunload about 68 containers or 884 ston or 970 mton per day this means that the daily loadunload capability for two operations would be about 136 containers or 1768 ston or 1945 mton 5 army watercraft and similar

the northwest area of the tokyo bay at latitude 35o 2028 north and longitude 139o 3743 west surrounded by moderately rolling hills on the north west and south this ideal natural port opens to the sea on the east coast of japan major ports of japan breakwaters inside and outside the port protect its deep waters against winds and high waves the port of yokohama lies close to tokyo japans capital this region is the political economic and cultural center of japan it is huge consumer area linked by network of trunk highways to yokohama situated in the coastal industrial belt that includes the keihin industrial zone yokohama is the premier eastern port the shortest distance from the united states japans largest trade partner yokohama is situated in highly advantageous location geographically economically and socially it is also an international trade port since its opening 138 years ago yokohama has made great contributions to the japanese economy mtmctea port of yokohama 3transportation modes water access vessels destined for the port of yokohama should head for the entrance to tokyo bay at 35o 1024 north latitude and 139o 4554 east longitude located 5 miles 161o from kan non saki lighthouse here the bay pilot will board the vessel from tug the entrance channel yokohama passage has depth of 39 feet at mean low water mlw and width of 1312 feet at the yokohama bay bridge the inner habor has ample maneuvering room with turning basin of at least 1500 feet and draft of 39 feet mlw the yokohama bay bridge crosses the approach channel with vertical clearance of 180 feet at mean high water however this clearance poses vertical restriction on vessels entering the harbor water access nnorthdock honmoku pier mtmctea port of yokohama 4waves waves in the port of yokohama under normal weather conditions are mini mally affected by wind because the distance to shores is relatively short wave heights are generally determined by wind velocity and the distance to the shore on the basis of these two factors wave heights observed by the yokohama district weather bureau are most frequently 116 feet high under wind velocity of over 16 feet per second the annual occurrence of waves higher than 16 feet is about 17 percent while those exceeding 46 feet are rarely observed wave heights under abnormal conditions such as typhoons in the last few decades com puted on the basis of average wind velocity and distance from the shore are as follows typhoon kity 103 feet typhoon isewan 105 feet typhoon catherine 85 feettyphoon makurazaki 72 feet typhoon muroto 85 feet the highest wave was 105 feet during typhoon isewan maximum wave height during this typhoon was 6080 per cent higher than the average height under normal weather conditions it is therefore possible for waves 18 to 197 feet high to occur once every 1020 minutes although this wouldnt occur continuously the bohso and miura peninsulas virtually shelter the port from high seas swells even when there are 328feethigh swell in the pacific they are only 4 inches high in the har bor which is nearly insignificant currents the current in the port of yokohama varies from day to day affected by weather conditions the surface current is highly complex at flowing tide sea water comes in from the outer breakwaters at an average rate of not more than 16 feet per second at ebbing tide it goes out at much slower rate the currents on the navigation channels outside the outer breakwaters are the swiftest of all currents inside and outside the port but even they do not run at more than 33 feet per second tides the minimum tide in the harbor is about 15 feet below mlw the maximum tide is about 84 feet above mlw and the average tidal range is 4 feet above mlw mtmctea port of yokohama 5highway

tainer berths on jetty d will also be improved by dredging to accommodate larger tainer ships mtmctea port of yokohama 27ii throughput analysis general based on the port operational performance simulator pops computer model we evaluated the throughput capacity of north dock and honmoku pier the pops model uses weaklink analysis to determine the least capable of the three primary transporta tion subsystems ship loading or unloading staging and terminal processing and han dling the least capable subsystem defines the maximum throughput capability of the terminal the model yields throughput capability values for each subsystem in terms of short tons ston and measurement tons mton per day the charts in this section show the throughput yields in stons approximate mton yields can be computed by multiplying the ston amount by 25 for breakbulk and container cargo and multiplying by 4 for roro cargo throughput computations are based on the assump tion that 100 percent of the facilities analyzed will sup port military operations similarly we assume vessel on berth at the selected berths 75 percent of the time in developing the throughput scenario we used statistical data developed from analysis ofdeployments that occurred during operation desert shield and desert storm this data helped us develop mix of vessels most likely to support military deployment operations we

dock is capable of supporting us military cargo transhipment opera tions berths ef and gh are the preferred berths for military operations and could accommodate vessels as large as the large medium speed rollon rolloff lmsr and fast sealift ship fss as shown in the berthing characteristics table however the 32foot draft along side these two berths would severely limit the amount of cargo the vessels could take onboard the lmsr and fss have maximum draft of about 35 and 37 feet respectively north dock is more suited toward handling medium sized breakbulk and combination vessels with draft of less than 32 feet across the harbor honmoku pier sealand and american president lines offer more flexible accomodations for vessels of all cargo types especially large deep draft container vessels berths at sealand and american president lines have depths alongside of 39 and 42 feet respectively of the transportation subsystems analyzed and based on the most likely ship mix the least capable is

study is incorporated in the appendix in general the port is capable of breakbulk roro container and barge types of shipping operations the channel depth is 32 feet at mean low water mlw therefore ships with 30 foot water draft can navigate the channel includes 2foot clearance the tidal variation is listed at about 8 feet mina sulman does not have rail access the port consists of finger pier over 2600 feet in length with ship berths on both sides and quay used for general cargo and containers covered storage facilities consist of 14 sheds totalling 1000000 square feet mobile cranes up to 200 tons are available the container berths are located at berths 15 and 16 these berths have total of four tainer gantry cranes roro berth with an 18foot draft is available for small landing craft vessel types used in this analysis include standard vessels provided by the military sealift command msc to support deployment of us forces in performing the throughput analysis forthis port we used the following ship mix to provide the mixed throughput capability breakbulk22 percent roro 72 percent container 3 percent barge 3 percent these mixes represent only starting point actual final mix was
