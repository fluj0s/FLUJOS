since data on paraprofessionals were first collected by eds national center for education statistics in 1980 teacher aides accounted for 11 of tota l fulltime equivalent instructional staff by 2001 they composed 17 of all instructional staff3 paraprofessionals are also increasingly handling classroom responsibilitie s without supervision an ed report issued in april 2000 indicated that 95 of pa raprofessionals spent at least 60 of their time teaching wit hout teacher present4 the report further revealed that paraprofessionals accounted for more than half of all title i instructional staff about 69000 of all 135000 fulltime equivalent instructional personnel paid with title ia funds nationwide in the 199798 school year recognition that the quality of instruction in us schools is increasingly affected by the quality of parapr ofessional staff has bolstered support for federal teacher aide standards prior to the nclba the elem entary and secondary education act of 1965 esea

paraprofessionals who only serve as translators or who only conduct parental invol vement activities must have secondary school diploma or its equivalent but do not have to meet additional requirements the most recent nonregulatory guidance on paraprofessionals issued by ed on march 1 2004 clarifies number of ques tions that have been raised during implementation of the nclba the guid ance describes various school ttings under which paraprofessionals may or may not be required to meet the nclba rules the requirements apply to all paraprofessionals employed in schoolwide title i program without regard to whether the position is funde d with federal state or local funds in targeted assistance title i programs only thos paraprofessionals pa id with title i funds must meet the requirements not those paid with state or local funds however special education paraprofessiona ls in targeted assistance programs must meet the requirements even if only part of their pay comes from t itle i funds parapr ofessional who provides services to private school students and is em ployed by local education agency lea with title i funds must meet the nclba requirements however these requirements do not apply to those in the americorps progra m volunteers or those working in either 21st century community learning cent ers or head start programs leas have discretion when it comes to considering who is an existing paraprofessional and whether qualified status is portable if an lea laid off paraprofessional who was initially hired on or before january 8 2002 the lea may consider that person an existing employee wh the individual is subsequently recalled to duty also an lea may determine that paraprofessional meets the qualification requirements if the individual was previously determined to meet these requirements by another lea the ed guidance clarifies that two years of study means the equivalent of two years of fulltime study as determined by an institution of higher education ihe the definition of an ihe is specified in secti on 101a of the higher education act of 1965 continuing education credits may count toward the twoyear requirement if they are part of an overall training and development program plan and an ihe accepts or translates them to course credits section c of the guidance discusses issues related to the assessment of paraprofessionals the guidance indicates that state or lea may develop paraprofessional know ledge and ability assessment using either paper and pencil form performance evaluation or some combina tion of the two these assessments should gauge content knowledge eg in reading writing and math as well as competence in instruction which may be ssessed through observations the content knowledge should reflect state academic standards and the skills expected of child at given school levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22545crs4 6 ecs issue brief instructional paraprofe ssional statistics and trends denver co september

additi onal training may be needed most states are employing more than one type of written assessment along with performance evaluation two of the most co mmon tests are parapro developed by the educational testing service and workkeys developed by the american college testing program according to the education commission of the states ecs 36 states allow leas to use parapro for pa raprofessional assessment and 17 states allow the use of workkeys6 in addition 21states allow leas to develop their own assessments ecs considers 12 states to have established professional qualifications that exceed federal standards and identifies 10 states that requi re paraprofessionals to obtain professional certification7 the ecs also identifies 11 states that have profe ssional development programs for pa raprofessionals section d of the guidance discusses progra mmatic requirements that pertain to the supervision of paraprofe ssionals the guidance points out that esea section 1119g3a stipulates that paraprofessionals who provide instructional support must work under the direct supervision of highly qualified teacher further the guidance states the following paraprofessional works under the direct supe rvision of teacher if 1 the teacher prepares the lessons and plans the instru ction support activities the paraprofessional carries out and evaluates the achievem ent of the students with whom the paraprofessional is working and 2 the paraprofessional works in close and frequent proximity with the teacher 20059c2 of the title i regulations as result program staffed entirely by paraprofessionals is not permitted in addition the guidance states that the rule s regarding direct supervision also apply to paraprofessionals who pr ovide services under contract th at is paraprof essionals hired by thirdparty contractor to work in title i program must work under the direct supervision of teacher eve n though teachers employed by the contractor need not meet nclba highly qualified teacher requirements the ed guidance discusses funding sources for the professional development and assessment of paraprofessionals an lea must use not less than 5 of its title i part allocation for the professional developmen t of teachers and paraprofessionals leas may also use their general title i funds for this purpose funds for professional development of paraprofessionals may also be drawn from title ii part for core subjectmatter pers onnel from title iii part for those serving english language learners from title v part for innovativ programs and

guidance describes c onditions under which leas are prohibited from using title i funds to hire new professionals such prohibition may be imposed by state on an lea that has failed to make progress toward meeting the annual measurable objectives established by the state for increasing the percentage of highly qualified teachers and has failed to make adequate yearly progress for three cumulative years8 two exceptions to this rule are 1 if th hiring is to fill vacancy created by the departure of another professional and 2 if the hiring is necessitated by significant increase in student enrollment or an increased need for tran slators or parental involvement personnel fortytwo states and the district of columbia reported data to ed on the qualifications of their professionals for the 20032004 school year among them 10 states reported that fewer than half of their paraprofessionals met the nclba requirements four states repor ted that at least nine of ev ery 10 of their paraprofessionals met these standards9 however ed officials have recently indicated that most paraprofessionals ac quired the minimum qualifications by the june 30 2006 deadline10 the nclba authorized title ia throug h fy2007 oneyear automatic extension through fy2008 is provided under the genera l education provisions act however the nclba may be considered for reauthorization by the 110th congress possible reauthorization issues concerning the parapr ofessional provisions in title i include the following are the assessments used to eva luate paraprofessional quality rigorous enough and are they adequately tied to academic standards for students some consider the parapro and workkeys tests to be the easy route and claim they do not measur teacher aides ability to improve classroom instruction might reau thorized esea be more explicit about the nature of these tests by linking them to other accountability provisions should ed be given gr eater authority to enforce higher standards for paraprof essional assessments should the paraprofessional qualificati on requirements be applied to broader group of teacher aides for example should these requirements be applied to all parapr ofessionals with instru ctional responsibilities not just to those paid with title ia funds should the exceptions currently made for computer lab assistants translators and those assisting withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22545crs6 parental involvement be curtailed is the language regarding direct supervision too vague or too difficult to enforce do current provisions for the prof essional development of teacher aides adequately encourage states to improve the paraprofessional workforce should states be given incentives to adopt paraprofe ssional certification requirements as have been adopted in some states are there other ways to encourage parapr ofessional developmen t beyond the minimum qualifications that would positively affect the overall level of instructional quality have the paraprofessional qualification requirements significantly affected the extent to which title ia funds are used to hire these staff in particular have significant num ber of paraprofessi onals lost their jobs or been assigned to nontitle ia positions after the end of the 20052006 school year because they were unable to meet the paraprofessional qua lification requirements has this resulted in an overall decline or improvement in the quality of instruction should the roles of states versus leas in setting policies and implementing these requirements be clarified particularly in comparison to the teacher quality requi rements of the nclba there has been relatively little guidance from ed or clarity in the statute on state versuslea roles in the area of paraprofessiona l qualification requirements has the result been constructive form of flexibility or dysfunctional ambiguity
