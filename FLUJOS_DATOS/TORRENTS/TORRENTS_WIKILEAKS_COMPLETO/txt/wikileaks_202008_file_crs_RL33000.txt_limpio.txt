numerous amendments on the bill world events the death of the pope nominations and filibusters on judges put off action on the measure introduction congress is required by law to authorize the spending of appropriations for the state department and foreign policy activities every two years the authorization acts as ceiling for the appropriations the foreign relations authorization process dovetails with the annual appropriation process for the department of state within the science state justice commerce and related agency appropriation in the house and the stateforeign operations appropriation in the senate and foreign assistance activities within the foreign operations appropriation in both house and senate in the past 10 years congress has had an inconsistent record on getting stand alone foreign relations authorization bill passed and signed into law during the two decades prior to the government shutdown of november 1995 virtually every congress enacted standalone foreign relations authorization laws since 1995 however congress has waived the requirement to provide authorization prior to expenditures more times than it has met the requirement the most recentlyenacted standalone authorization act was for fy2003 pl 107228 hr 1646 signed september 30 2002 see appendix ii for foreign relations authorization history since foreign relations authorization legislation is typically passed the first session of each congress the senate foreign relation committee and the house crs2 international relations committee of the 109th congress began working on their bills early in 2005 the foreign relations authorization legislation typically provides authority for state department spending for such activities as salaries and other operating expenses passport and visa processing embassy and foreign service activities as well as public diplomacy and international broadcasting in addition the legislation often becomes convenient vehicle for numerous foreign policy related issues such as nonproliferation human rights international family planning policy and international health and environment issues congress can influence us foreign policy regarding specific regions or countries via this biannual legislation as well the foreign relations authorization bills introduced in the 109th congress house and senate differ significantly both contain similar provisions for the state department spending levels the operation organization and personnel of state s 600 goes beyond that to include titles on 1 authorizing foreign assistance programs 2 radiological terrorism security 3 global pathogen surveillance 4 safe water 5 protection of vulnerable populations during humanitarian emergencies and 6 reconstruction and stabilization issues hr 2601 includes measures on 1 democracy promotion 2 reform 3 export controls and security assistance and 4 nonproliferation because of congress inability to get an authorization bill to the presidents desk in some congresses some members in both house and senate committees are determined to produce foreign policy authorization legislation this year since they see it as one of their primary responsibilities selected measures in both hr 2601 and s 600 titles in both bills include state department authorizations of appropriations state department authorities and activities organization and personnel of the department of state international organizations and international broadcasting board of governors the two bills have foreign assistance measures in common as there are substantive foreign assistance provisions in the hr 2601 state department authorizations of appropriations by law authorization to spend funds for foreign policy agencies and programs is required

provisions that call for reports to congress on us strategies for combating international terrorism in western africa but the two reports regional and programmatic foci differ as do their respective reporting requirements the proposal in hr 2601 focuses specifically on the sahara region and the plan of the us government to expand the pan sahel initiative psi into robust counterterrorism ct effort the transsahara counter terrorism initiative tscti the report would be submitted by the secretary of state in classified form within 120 days after the passage of hr 2601 it would require list of

recipient country entities and description of public diplomacy and related assistance that will be provided to promote development and counter radical islamist elements that may be gaining foothold in the region the measure would require all relevant us government agencies to cooperate fully with and assist in the implementation of tscti the measure in s 600 focuses on broader region west africa which commonly is taken to include both subsaharan sahel and coastal countries in western africa it would require that the secretary of state in consultation with other relevant agencies submit report to congress on strategy for combating terrorism in west africa during the threeyear period six months after passage of s 600 the strategy would contain comprehensive assessment of international terrorist organization activities in west africa an interagency plan for dealing with the threat of such activities and description of resources necessary to implement it and an analysis of the expected level of cooperation that countries in west africa and elsewhere would provide toward that end the report would also describe planned coordination between the planned strategy and all other regional counterterrorism efforts including psi and the east africa counterterrorism initiative eacti and any other similar regional programs including in north africa background armed activities by groups alleged to have connections with qaeda have been reported in the sahel region of west africa other groups such as hizballah and hamas have reportedly provided social services and other types of aid in this region the united states has provided security assistance to regional governments to counter such groups one such program is the pan sahel initiative regional ct border security and regional security cooperation program that has provided military training and related equipment to the governments of mali niger chad and mauritania psi is intended to create military rapid reaction

program funding to 132 million for first year startup costs and about 125 million per year in subsequent years for five to crs7 six year program6 according to state department officials tscti is at present technically conceptual plan only but has reportedly been agreed upon by key us implementing agencies at the deputy principal level the administration has sought congressional approval to use mix of about 11 million in state department and 5 million in defense department fy2005 and fy2006 funds to initiate tscti start up activities it may then request full tscti funding under its fy2007 budget proposal despite the state departments view that tscti is not yet fullyfledged program us european command eucom already uses the term tscti to describe its activities under psi which eucom documents have described as formerly known as psi as well as some training exercises these include exercise flintlock june 2005 effort in which us special operations forces provided seven saharan host country armed forces with tactical military training aimed at improving regional security and stability eucoms decision to use this term before tscti was fully authorized by the state department reportedly created tensions between it and the defense department humanitarian crises7 there is shortage of humanitarian emergencies worldwide stemming from natural disasters or manmade conflicts as result of these crises population movements often occur within the affected country or flow to those countries that are within close proximity definitions of status are assigned to various groups and may include refugees internally displaced persons stateless persons and vulnerable populations such as women children and the elderly all can emerge as groups requiring particular protection the basis of which may be found under international humanitarian law and emergency assistance which is typically provided by agencies governments international organizations and nongovernmental organizations different aspects of this problem are addressed in s 600 and hr 2601 s 600 title xxviii protection of vulnerable populations during humanitarian emergencies focuses on women and children and the development of strategies to protect them from exploitation and abuse before during and following crisis it outlines three categories program and policy coordination prevention and preparedness and

administrations initiatives to enhance us civilian capabilities to carry out stabilization and reconstruction sr activities in unstable states have met with both enthusiasm and skepticism in congress the senate in particular the senate foreign relations committee sfrc has provided both impetus and support for the establishment of the state department office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs additional senate support has been expressed by the senate armed services committee which in its report accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 s 1042 srept 109069 may 17 2005 commended the department of defenses dod active support of and cooperation with scrs the house on the other hand appears skeptical of the initiatives providing little funding thus far in 2006 several prominent foreign and defense policy think tanks advanced proposals in 2003 and 2004 to establish civilian capabilities through an office similar to scrs sfrc chairman lugar and ranking member biden submitted legislation s 2127 with companion bill hr 3996 introduced by representative schiff in 2004 to establish similar office legislation with similar aims was proposed in the house in 2003 by representative farr hr 2616 and by representative dreier in 2004 hr 4185 and 2005 hr 1361 supporters perceive the development of civilian capabilities as means to relieve the stress on the us military caused by the need to devote troops to postconflict statebuilding functions and to rectify the ad hoc nature of each sr operation by creating cadre of personnel experienced in such operations and trained to work together in july 2004 the administration created scrs which now has some 35 staff members on detail from the department of state and other executive agencies it is tasked with designing and in some cases establishing the new structures within the state department and elsewhere that would allow civilian agencies to develop 8 prepared by nina m serafino specialist in international security affairs and martin weiss analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division crs9 effective policies processes and personnel including ready response corps to build stable and democratic states in postconflict situations the administration requested fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations for scrs as the office was created well after the fy2005 budget request was submitted in february 2004 the 172 million request included funding for scrs startup operations and software and for development of ready response cadre of state department personnel and the design of related training and exercises while the senate in floor action approved an amendment supporting the full request the conferees on the supplemental appropriations measure provided the senate appropriations committees 77 million an amount closer to the houseapproved 30 million hr 1268 pl 10913 signed into law may 11 2005 the presidents 241 million fy2006 budget request for scrs would provide for 54 new scrs positions and the establishment of 100person ready response cadre within the department of state the president also requested the establishment of noyear 100 million automatically replenishable emergency conflict response fund to be administered by scrs in order to prevent or respond to conflict or civil strife in foreign countries or regions or to enable transition from such strife critics some of whom label themselves supportive skeptics question whether scrs would do sufficiently more than existing capabilities to justify the additional cost while recognizing the importance of planning for postconflict reconstruction assistance several analysts have criticized various aspects of the administrations request especially the creation of the 100person ready response cadre critics question the state departments ability to create baseline template for post conflict reconstruction assistance when there are few similarities among the cases that the united states has been involved with so far whether the state department is the appropriate agency to coordinate postconflict reconstruction assistance and to what extent ready response cadre may duplicate existing reconstruction efforts already being undertaken by agencies such as the department of defense usaid and the department of the treasury among others s 600 as reported would authorize the administrations full 241 million fy2006 funding request for scrs and such sums as may be necessary for its personnel education and training equipment and travel costs in fy2007 as well as the 100 million conflict response fund it would also provide scrs with statutory status and authorities for its operations it would authorize larger ready response corps than requested by the administration 250 rather than 100 person force hr 2601 as reported contains authorization for fy2006 funding for scrs in july 19 2005

with this assessment they argue that us assistance overemphasizes military and counterdrug assistance and provides inadequate support for protecting human rights and encouraging peace process in

consideration of hr 2601 obstetric fistula which affects an estimated two million women mainly in africa occurs primarily from prolonged labor that results in hole or rupture in tissues between the vagina and bladder and at times the rectum women with this condition are stigmatized and often shunned by their family and community it is especially common in girls aged 1519 whose bodies are not fully developed for childbirth and in girls and women suffering from malnutrition obstetric fistula occurs almost exclusively in developing countries where access to health care services is severely limited11 hr 2601 as reported by the house international relations committee earmarked 5 million in fy2006 and fy2007 to create 12 centers for the treatment and prevention of obstetric fistula in developing nations the provision specified that to the maximum extent possible each center would perform certain services including surgical repair and postsurgery support educational activities to prevent incidents of fistula and expanded access to contraceptive services for the prevention of pregnancies among women that were at high risk for prolonged or obstructed childbirth during floor debate representative smith nj proposed an amendment that deleted the requirement for each center to expand contraceptive services for highrisk women and added new activity requiring centers to broaden abstinence education postponement of marriage and childbearing until after teenage years and activities to expand access to family planning services for women in highrisk category unlike the treatment services that each center must provide to the maxim extent possible the revised prevention activities would be provided at the discretion of the centers the smith amendment further increased funding to 75 million annually in support of his amendment congressman smith argued that the changes would allow faithbased hospitals to perform the required activities something that would not have occurred under the committeereported language because of 11 for more information on obstetric fistula see crs report rs21733 reproductive health problems in the world obstetric fistula background

include contraception opponents of the amendment however charged that the revised text gutted the prevention aspect of the obstetric fistula centers by making these activities discretionary rather than mandatory in the original text they contend that the most effective method to reduce the incidents of obstetric fistula is to ensure that young girls and highrisk women do not get pregnant the

and for the publication of us official documents that list countries and their capitals unless they identify jerusalem as the capital of israel these prohibitions have been in past legislation in 1967 israel annexed east jerusalem and declared the reunified city to be its eternal undivided capital the foreign aid authorization bills reflect the views of many members of congress who maintain that

furthermore the title would amend existing law on training in processing and facilitating visa applications for students and exchange visitors altering us assistance to egypt15 some lawmakers believe that us assistance to egypt has not been effective in promoting political and economic reform and that foreign assistance agreements should be renegotiated to include benchmarks that egypt would need to meet to continue to qualify for us foreign aid others have periodically called for restrictions on us aid to egypt based on the allegations that egypt indirectly supports palestinian terrorism suppresses its own population including minority christians and continues to allow egyptian stateowned media outlets to publish unsubstantiated conspiratorial theories regarding israel and the jewish people the administration and egyptian government assert that reducing egypts military aid would undercut peace between israel and egypt overall many us observers believe that us support for egypt stabilizes the region and extends us influence in the most populous arab country supporters of continued us assistance note that egypt helps train iraqi and palestinian security forces cooperates with the us military and will be helping to patrol the egyptiangaza border after israels withdrawal an amendment offered on july 15 2004 to the house fy2005 foreign operations bill hr 4818 would have

provisions relating to export control policies of the united states what follows is brief summary of key sections of this title of the house committee bill as reported to the house s 600 has almost directly comparable provisions at this stage of its consideration in the senate it is possible that some of the matters addressed in hr 2601 may become the subject of amendments during senate floor consideration of its related bill section 711 would amend the state department basic authorities act of 1956 by creating the position of deputy under secretary of state for strategic export control making the under secretary of state for arms control and international security the chairman of an interagency strategic export control board to be established by section 712 of this bill and authorizing the use of defense trade registration fees to offset costs related to the work of the strategic export control board section 712 would establish strategic export control board composed of representatives of departments having export control policy licensing or duties for enforcement of the us export controls and related matters the chairman of this board is to be the under secretary of state for arms control and international security section 721 would require the departments of commerce and state to publish the results of their determinations regarding export jurisdiction in the federal register and on their internet websites this is intended to make clear which items are being controlled through the united states munitions list and those controlled through the commodity control list 16 prepared by richard f grimmett specialist in national defense crs19 section 722 would amend section 36 c of the arms export control act to establish congressional notification requirement for the new socalled comprehensive export licenses not currently subject to mandatory congressional review section 723 would direct the state department not to provide preferential treatment in the processing of licenses for export to other parties of items needed for us armed forces and allied forces participating in united statesled coalitions operations section 724 would require the state department to include information on the number of officers assigned to munitions export licensing and their workloads in the quarterly report to congress required by section 36a of the arms export control act section 725 would amend the reporting requirements of section 655 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 to require that the information found in this report to congress on us munitions list items transferred or licensed for export abroad be maintained in database format that can be searched by the general public section 726 would require the state department office responsible for processing us munitions list export licenses to designate coordinator for small business affairs to aid small defense firms in application procedures and related matters section 727 would require the secretary of state to create an exemption from export licensing in the international traffic in arms regulations for certain technical data related to foreign sales marketing of commercial satellites under conditions and parameters for this data established by the secretary of defense section 728 would amend the reporting requirements of section 655 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 to require inclusion in the report to congress of information concerning the volume and types of defense articles being exported without license section 731 would require an annual report to congress on certain sensitive items warranting licensing scrutiny before being transferred to foreign person located within the united states in the future any us munitions list item specified in this new report would require license before it could be transferred section 732 would require report by the secretary of state certifying that there is national security risk arising from the current exemption in the international traffic in arms regulations which permits any foreign person to bring unclassified weapons temporarily into the united states from canada without prior us government review and approval the report would also have to certify that the state department is providing guidance to homeland security and border protection personnel needed to enable them effectively to detect and enforce the unlawful use of canadian license exemption crs20 section 733 would amend section 38 of the arms export control act to require that the united states does not transfer items on the us munitions list or the commodity control list to any entity of an embargoed country other than the military intelligence or other security forces of such country and only through issuance of an export license in which the secretaries of state and defense concur section 735 would amend section 3 of the arms export control act to require report to congress regarding any unauthorized transfer of us defense article by foreign person to nation designated by the united states as state sponsor of international terrorism this provision would apply to articles licensed under section 38 of the arms export control act other sections of title vii of hr 2601 provide for various reporting requirements on technical matters authorizations for transfers of specific decommissioned naval vessels transfers of obsolete and surplus military stocks and terms of reimbursement for international military education and training provided by the united states in floor amendment to the bill during house consideration chairman henry hyde added new title ix sections 901910 which contains number of congressional policy statements and other detailed provisions to tighten oversight by the united states over exports of its defense articles services and technology to other nations who might reexport such items to china this title contains number of reporting requirements that the president provide specific information relating to arms exporting activities of nations in the european union that might transfer us origin defense items or technology to china as well as reporting requirements related to us defense exports licensing generally to ensure that defense items or technology that potentially find their way to china have been rigorously scrutinized in advance to ensure that risk to us national security interests are involved missile nonproliferation17 section 734 would require the secretary of state to annually certify that us missile technology controls are clearly established and updated this certification requirement is in response to government accountability office gao findings that jurisdiction over about 25 percent of missilerelated items controlled by the missile technology control regime mtcr is ambiguously shared between the departments of state and commerce and that there is longstanding absence of export license requirements for many dualuse mtcr items exported to canada the issue of export license requirements for canada is likely based on need to close an identified loophole to avoid the reexport of missilerelated items from canada to nations of concern section 741 would require that any foreign person entity or government that has been sanctioned by the us for missile transfer violations will be on probation for the issuance of dualuse licenses for period of three years after the expiration of the designated period of formal sanctions the three year probation can be waived 17 prepared by andrew feickert specialist in national defense crs21 if the president informs congress that the person entity or government has verifiably ceased their illegal activities and have instituted program of transparency in order to verify compliance these provisions are intended to raise the potential costs for those involved in proliferation activities as well as provide means to monitor their activity by placing them on watch list section 742 increases the period of us missile sanctions from two to four years which is also intended to raise the potential costs to proliferants there are similar provisions in s 600 section 743 would expand us missile sanctions to all foreign persons including responsible government entities this provision is intended to deter foreign governments from using individuals or front companies to conduct government sponsored trade and transfers of missiles and related technologies as means to avoid us sanctions this is considered by some as very powerful measure whereby the us government could sanction an entire country over the illegal activities of individuals or companies from that country even in situation where foreign government is not using front companies or persons to further its missile programs this provision might compel governments to exercise greater monitoring or export control over missilerelated trade in order to avoid the possibility of us sanctions against their country crs products crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status nuclear black market elimination act18 nonproliferation experts were shocked in 2004 by the revelation that

international atomic energy agency safeguards and expansion of the proliferation security initiative much of the nonproliferation language in hr 2601 addresses the nuclear black market issue and policy proposals title viii the nuclear black market elimination act seeks to strengthen us leverage in shutting down nuclear black market transfers the bill has four basic components sanctions penalties for corporate entities associated with proliferation activities incentives for proliferation interdiction cooperation and nonproliferation conditions for us assistance subtitle would authorize the president to impose any or all sanctions listed eg bans on foreign assistance aid defense articles licenses for defense and dualuse articles and for any commodities other than food agriculture medicines and medical equipment to individuals that transfer enrichment and reprocessing technology to nonnuclear weapon states that do not already have fully operational capability as of january 1 2004 that do not have in force an additional protocol or are developing nuclear weapon the sanctions which 18 prepared by sharon squassoni specialist in national defense crs22 would be imposed for two years or more may be suspended by the president after 15 days with congressional notification subtitle c would authorize assistance to other countries cooperating in proliferation interdiction including provision of defense equipment section 836 prohibits transfer of excess aircraft or ships to states that have not agreed it will support us interdiction efforts subtitle d would make nonproliferation cooperation precondition for us assistance and would suspend arms sales licenses and deliveries to countries that host nuclear proliferation networks the president would need to certify to congress that those countries are fully investigating such networks are taking steps to halt such activity are fully cooperating with the united states and have enacted laws to prevent future activities these measures appear to address the frustration among some in congress that the united states seems to have little leverage over pakistan in uncovering and eliminating the aq khan network in addition there are several sense of congress resolutions in title xiv miscellaneous provisions related to nonproliferation on iran section 1402 calls for the g8 governments to insist that russia terminate all assistance to the bushehr nuclear facility including fuel and condition russias continued membership in the g8 on that termination of assistance on aq khan section 1423 calls for the us government to ask pakistan for direct access to khan to learn more about the operation of his illicit nuclear black market network and to take the steps to ensure that pakistan has verifiably halted any cooperation with any country in the development of weapons of mass destructionrelated wmd technology material or equipment there is also sense of congress resolution in section 1431 on the proliferation security initiative urging the secretary of state to seek ways of strengthening psi along the lines of what the president proposed in february 2004 in particular says hr 2601 the united

that access to credit from 19 prepared by jonathan sanford specialist in international political economy foreign affairs defense and trade division crs23 the world bank helps iran to fund indirectly its nuclear program others assert that while the case for indirect financing may be debatable the present situation suggests that the international community is not seriously concerned about the irans current activities hr 2601 includes language sec 1406 directing the secretary of state to work in consultation with the secretary of the treasury to secure the support of governments represented on the board of executive directors of the world bank group to oppose any further activity in iran by the bank group until iran abandons its program to develop nuclear weapons notification by the secretary to the appropriate congressional committees is required the g8 and other european countries have working majority on the world bank executive board if the united states can persuade them to oppose further assistance to iran then future assistance would be approved barring extraordinary circumstances however it seems unlikely that the bank could discontinue projects which it has already approved and for which it is contractually obligated from 1993 to 2000 there was consensus on the executive board opposing new loans in 2000 however the consensus broke down as several major european countries sought to influence irans policy through constructive dialog more than halfdozen loans have been approved since that time the new legislation might help strengthen the administrations efforts to reestablish the prior consensus on the other hand unless the united states and major european countries agree on their basic strategy efforts to recreate the earlier consensus may be futile directing the secretary of state to take the lead will bring the resources of the state department to bear on the issue however the department of the treasury has jurisdiction for us participation in the world bank and other international financial institutions and would normally be the one to lead this effort in any case the president is required by sec 10 of the iran and libya sanctions act of 1996 pl 104172 to undertake an international effort to persuade countries to pressure iran to cease development of weapons of mass destruction this effort would presumably include efforts to stop lending by the world bank so long as iran continues to pursue wmd ambitions typically legislative jurisdiction for matters pertaining to the world bank lies with the house financial services committee

bush administration has said the president would veto legislation that included such text mexico city policy with direct funding of abortions and involuntary sterilizations banned by congress since the 1970s the reagan administration in 1984 announced that it would further restrict us population aid by terminating usaid support for any organizations but not governments that were involved in voluntary abortion activities even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds us officials presented the revised policy at the 2nd international conference on population in mexico city in 1984 thereafter it become known as the mexico city policy the policy continued in effect until lifted by president clinton in 1993 but was reimposed by president bush in early 2001 critics of the mexico city requirements oppose it on several grounds they argue that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding opponents also believe the conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign nongovernment organizations ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and impose so called gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations the latter restriction these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states supporters of the policy argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible that organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for legal activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the policy they contend stops the fungibility loophole during debate on s 600 the senate approved 5246 on april 5 an amendment offered by senator boxer that would effectively overturn the presidents mexico city policy specifically the boxer language states that foreign ngos shall not be ineligible for us funds solely on the basis of health or medical services they provide including counseling and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services do not violate the laws of the country in which they are performed and that they would not violate us laws if provided in the united states the amendment further provides that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities shall be subject to 23 prepared by larry nowels specialist in foreign affairs foreign affairs defense and

to humans in hong kong resulting in several human deaths this marked the first documented occurrence of direct transmission of an avian flu virus from birds to people despite efforts to contain the virus through massculling of poultry flocks the virus also called h5n1 for specific proteins on its surface reemerged in 2003 it has since been reported in domestic poultry andor migratory birds in cambodia peoples republic of china taipei hong kong indonesia japan republic of korea laos malaysia thailand and vietnam31 also since 2003 it has infected 97 people in cambodia thailand and vietnam resulting in 53 deaths32 as yet the virus has not developed the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person were that to occur asia could become the epicenter of global influenza pandemic

killed as many as 2 of the worlds population and was substantial cause of mortality among us military personnel serving in world war i33 us and world health authorities believe that while influenza pandemics are inevitable and cannot be stopped their progress may be slowed by rapid detection and local efforts to control spread the added time would allow affected nations to better manage the situation and countries not yet affected to better prepare to realize these benefits asian countries affected by avian flu must be able to track the spread of the virus in birds and quickly detect and investigate suspected human cases hence countrys capabilities in epidemiology laboratory detection and other public health services affect the welfare of the global community as well as the country itself this fact presents developed nations with novel policy challenges such as whether to reserve scarce health resources such as antiviral drugs for themselves or to rapidly deploy them to developing nations at the center of an emerging pandemic section 2117 of s 600 calls on the president to establish an interagency task force to design and implement comprehensive international strategy to prevent and if necessary respond to outbreaks of avian flu and to assure that us efforts are well coordinated with those of other nations the task force is to be composed of officials at the assistant secretary level or higher in addition the act would authorize 25 million for fy2006 through section 491 of the foreign assistance act for assistance in preventing and responding to avian

crs31 global pathogen surveillance act35 title xxiv of s 600 the global pathogen surveillance act would authorize 35 million for fy2006 to enhance the capability of developing nations to detect identify and contain infectious disease outbreaks whether naturally occurring or the result of bioterrorist attack the legislation was first introduced in the 107th congress by senators biden helms kennedy and frist s 2487 where it passed the senate amended in august 2002 further action was taken on the measure during the 107th congress similar legislation was introduced in both chambers in the 108th congress but was not ultimately enacted hr 2601 is silent on the matter of pathogen surveillance infectious disease outbreaks need not originate in the united states to pose threat to the nation the outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease sars in 2003 and growing concerns about pandemic influenza underscore the importance of global surveillance system to detect and track the spread of infectious diseases around the world whether of natural origin or from bioterrorist attack international trade travel and migration facilitate the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another in turn widespread outbreaks of infectious disease threaten the health economic and social stability not just of those countries directly affected but of their neighbors and trading partners as well global surveillance is crucial in containing microbial threats before isolated outbreaks develop into regional or worldwide pandemics in 2000 the world health organization who established the global alert and response network to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the world but many developing nations lack the trained personnel laboratory facilities and public health infrastructure to detect emerging pathogens and track evolving disease patterns the global pathogen surveillance act states that priority for provision of assistance will be given to those countries that provide early notification of disease outbreaks share data with appropriate us authorities and permit who and cdc officials to investigate outbreaks of infectious diseases on their territories section 2404 the act includes several provisions intended to strengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of developing nations first it would provide for incountry training for medical and laboratory personnel and permit eligible nationals of developing countries to come to the united states to pursue master of public health degree or advanced training in epidemiology sections 2406 and 2407 second it would provide assistance for the purchase of basic laboratory equipment for the collection analysis and identification of pathogens and communications equipment and information technology for the dissemination of information on disease patterns throughout regional health networks excluding any types of equipment subject to export controls sections 2408 and 2409

us government labs overseas section 2411 and 7 million to assist who and existing regional surveillance capabilities and to develop new regional health networks section 2412 safe water36 lack of access to safe water and sanitation affects the health and livelihoods of billions of people in developing countries this absence is widely viewed as undermining development and poverty reduction efforts appreciation of the linkages between water development and health is leading to reassessment of the delivery of international water assistance several recent international development initiatives recognize the importance of improving access to water and sanitation as means for achieving broader development and security objectives almost 11 billion people lack access to improved drinking water sources an estimated 26 billion people lack access to improved sanitation these circumstances affect health and development through numerous pathways including the health and economic costs of waterrelated diseases and work and educational time lost to water collection in response title vi of s 600 safe water currency for peace act of 2005 has been introduced to make access to safe

that currently has the lowest overall rates of improved water and sanitation coverage the foreign assistance act currently specifies numerous development assistance objectives all generally aimed at promoting economic development and many focused on health issues however improving access to safe water and sanitation is not stated priority title xxvi would establish as policy objective for us foreign assistance the promotion of health and economic development by providing assistance for expanded access to safe water and sanitation sound water management and improved hygiene the second
