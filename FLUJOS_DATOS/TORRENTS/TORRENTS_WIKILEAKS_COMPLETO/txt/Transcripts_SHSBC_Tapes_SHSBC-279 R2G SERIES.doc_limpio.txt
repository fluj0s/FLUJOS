r2g series lecture given on 21 march 1963 good evening how are you this is the 21st of march ad 13 saint hill special briefing course okay well how are you oh thatsthats good thats good fine well now this evenings lecture concerns the 2gs the 2gs routine 2gs and this lecture is an offthecuff lecture about these very valuable processes but the first announcement on it that has some importance is that goals findinggoals findingnot goal runninggoal finding becomes routine 2 process now why is that probably startles you little bit but the reason for this is that the most therapeutic and the least dangerous auditing that you can give anybody is finding goals thats very interesting isnt it in other words the most unlimitedup to the point of finding his goal of courseand least dangerous process is goals finding now if you do something with the goal that becomes very horrifying if its the wrong goal youyou understand that thatnothing has changed about that at all but because things were so terrible and so grim and so awful and pcs caved in so hard when you ran them on wrong goal our tendency up to now has been to safeguard goals just as an identified subject just safeguard goals you know and thats been thean identification but actually theres nothing nothing dangerous at all about finding goals and therefore it is quite safe to put goals finding in the hands of the most amateur auditor so he goes over the goal so he leaves the goal behind him well so the pc will arc break but we can even teach him this datum now thats about the only dangerous thing that will happen in finding goals its running goals that is dangerous you take wrong goal and run it and youll wish you hadnt therefore with this distinct proviso that one must not run the goal he has found routine 2 trained auditor is now authorized to find goals you see something funny here has happened something very remarkable has happened it takes now much more time to find the goal in some cases than it does to run the goal and some goals are very very hard to find indeed and great deal of preliminary work has to go in on the case and so forth so this puts tremendous burden on saint hill auditors well their functiona class iv auditorof course is to check out goals and to see that they get run properly but when you give them the whole burden of finding goals and they have assistance in finding goals at all it puts an immediate ceiling on the amount of service which district office central organization or field auditor can provide now goals finding can be taught and you find that its quite simple it doesnt mean however that it is easy to find goal that is to say it is easy to find goal on every preclear thisthis is not the message iton some preclears it is very very far from easy to find goal but lets look at it this way the actions now entailed in finding goal are relatively easy all you have to do is do those actions and you will find somebodys goal now it may takeit may take hours but thats unlikelymore likely tens of hours and in some cases weeks and weeks and weeks and in some cases months to find goal this is this is according to our findings on this but this of course makes it very feasible to turn loose hpashcas onto the action and operation of finding goals and getting them checked out and so forth now you notice theres been very very little released on the subject of finding goals here for the last few months ive actually been working on processes which found goals and in working on those processes ive made some interesting discoveries and some of those discoveries are very oversetting to some of the older things which we believed such as this the first one i gave you that you can go on finding goals and trying to find goals and trying to find goals and you deliver more gain auditing to the pc than in doing anything else thats interesting isnt it youll do him more good than even problems intensive and thats rather considerable so whatwhat do wewhat do we find ourselves with here the necessity to codify goalsfinding processes and reduce them to very precise activity that can be taught and make those processes relatively simple and train people in them now theyre about to teach some hcs courses in the united states and i think about as far as theyll get in teaching these is teaching somebody to find goal now this discovery that goals finding is the least damaging and the most therapeutic short of clearing auditing that pc can have winds us up with this consideration that we should have series of designations which are simply goalsfinding designations and include in those everything that we do on the subject of finding goals and use in them everything that is of use and interest on this subject now problems intensive has never had designating number it was just twentyfivehour intensive that they found would be of some use now thisthis intensive this problems intensive we have to include in our general overall scheme of things so long as it is problems that we are addressing in that but in actual sober fact there are few pcs that you will find around that the moment we address this problems intensive wholly and completely to the subject of goals will plow in just like that why in other words well give some pc problems intensive that is addressed in the direction of purposes you know and we give it across span of time that is to say we say since 1950 hashow has purpose been suppressed something like that well unfortunately were going to find that some banks are messed up the person possibly might be living his second gpm in his present time existence in other words he alreadyhe has sort of suspended efforts on the first gpm and he isnt increasing that and hes in actual fact sort of living in the second gpm in other words its been terrifically restimulated and the more we run problems intensives on period of time having to do with present time you understand present timethe more we have to do with present time on this person you know in present time on this problem or something like that or on this purpose has anything been suppressed why the better off well be at large now this doesnt mean that it wouldnt operate on many pcs and so forth but in view of the fact that it on few of them it wont operate that is enough to sweep away time consideration with regard to goals type problems intensive you probably dont completely grasp what im talking about and some of youone of you had new one going the other day you give hard time you know trying to catch up with you you know youyouas the one you got going out there now i mean not you all of you just just just you there thats sitting in that chair there it read for it rocket read for but it doesnt rocket read for the instructor 1 1 thats thats the sort of thing we get going but on this matter of the first gpm and the second gpm wed better clarify we mean the first gpm contacted by the auditor we cannot number the gpms from the year 200 trillion years agothe year zero in other words we cant number them forward as the first gpm the second gpm the third gpm so forth because we dont know how many there areso therefore we could never number the present time gpm now the case is entered at the present time gpm the one he is in now and that is the first gpm on some cases however the present time gpm is the second gpmthe person has suspended operation on the first gpmand so we have to have better definition and wed say the first gpm is the latest gpm on the track and the second gpm is the next to the latest on the track and the third gpm is third from the latest on the track and i dont know what number the gpm is back at the year 200 trillion on some pcs it will probably be number 52 and on some pcs itll be number 31 dont you see so to get consistent numbering when we say the first gpm we mean the one which is nearest or the latest formedlet us say that wayits the latestformed one its the goal of that one that you have to have but some pcs have skidded their wheels theyve listened to speeches by the democrats or theyve theyve looked over australian legal procedure or something like that and theyve skidded their wheels and theyve gone back to the second gpm and are living this life in the second gpm you understand that theyve met an oppterm let us say in the second gpm of sufficient magnitude to cause them to be the terminal of the second gpm you understand thats horrifying isnt it well ill tell you why its horrifying because if you found the goal that they are living at this moment it wouldnt run that makes some pcs more difficult to find goals on than others you follow that now whatwhat is more complicated is that the first gpm may or may not be fully formed you may have only the first eight items of the first gpm formed or you may have only the first sixteen items of the first gpm formedbecause of course the pc normally is forming these things progressively as you move on up the track well as we were saying last night it is really too bad that we didnt have somebody at various points of the track and he took gun and he saidhe said with this gunhe said everyone will now postulate his sixtyfifth gpm goal bang you see and we all did it at once only it didnt work that way some fellows postulated theirs thousands of years ago some billions of years ago and some trillions of years ago so this of course makesthis of course makes it an uneven number now the only thing missing if you look in the maymarch 13th bulletin 63 and you look at that line plot some gpms arent formedlet us say theoretically they arent formed any further forward than cabaret singer thats the top item you find in the thing so its not very reliable finding it wed ask himwed find this terminal wed say well what is the goal of cabaret singer or what is the goal of hostile audience dont you see and it doesnt answer up well for the goal cabaret singer theyd say to sing to exhibit myself to experience life to appear on tv you see to be miss america something like that and pretty soon why theyd come around on it and theydah well it there isnt any goal there dont you see if it was formed all the way to the top of course because youve got the overtthe goal as an overt at the topagainst mute what goal would be an overt against mute and the pc would tell you almost at once to scream and what is the goal of the most screamish naturally to scream but halfway down the bank what have we got hoohhooh weve got cabaret singer versus hostile audience thats the pair interesting what is the goal of hostile audience to hiss to boo never to scream so its tough to find these things when theyre amputated thats an amputated gpm youll find everything below that however isis quite standard its just that its bobtailed now thats complication now the pc let us say who has one of these bobtailed gpms easily skids and let us say thatthat next goal below there by the way is to be happy it was never put in on that march the 13th bulletinand you get miserable sod thats thethe terminal you see miserable sod and the pc is accustomed to being miserable sod he was that for quite while and he didnt complete the thing to scream hell move on forward there his next life or something like that but just at the present time hes grinding to slow halt being miserable sod and be part of the kennedy clan in ireland you know something like this and there he is miserable sod and hes confronted all the time with happy peoplehappy people ohho brother he cant stand it you know just happy people rrrrrrrrr maybe he had an aunt or something who was happy person you know who went around all the time being happy you know with exclamation points you see you couldnt hear yourself think in the house you know she of course hishis aunt would just be mad at everybody who wasnt happy you see and so here youve got this oppterm happy people and youve got the terminal miserable sod and you go listing terminalsand youve done some 212 on this character or something you seeyou get this goal to be happy well it ticks and it clicks and itzzzt goes out and you spend thirtysix hours prepchecking it and it doesnt shape up and finally somebody sees it rocket read couple of times and they say well lets list it lets list it so you start listing the thing with heavy grind and you it finally delivers up finally delivers up happy people and the rocket read on the goal was about threeeighths of an inch by the time you get to happy people well itll be about quarter of an inch and you get miserable sod and its going to be about an eighth of an inch and then you get your next item and and so on and the pc has got somatics and so forth funny part of it is it almost runs but youve just got trouble trouble trouble whatd you do by accident you have picked up the second gpm you havent picked up the first gpm by the way the goals that go out hardthe goals that go out hardare very often goals of the third fourth fifth sixth gpm you see but you startyoure trying to run this second gpm well my golly theres all those terminals in the first gpm above it dont you see the second gpm with one of these bobtailed first gpms will almost run but youve got bypassed items as matter of fact you havent just got bypassed items youve got bypassed gpm and life can look pretty grim to the pc but the goal is not behaving well one of the things that this goal has to do is fire better if properly handled and not overlisted not overlistedyou get too long source list and you get all the gall the items all the ris in the bank are on the goal oppose list you know you could practically go back down the thing and find every rr item that gave dirty read drill the thing you get it to fire nicely and so forth itll byou could almost dissemble whole gpm off one of these overlists you know and bypassed items like mad sometimes therell be as many as two and three items additional on one of these item oppose lists which are overlisted the gaiety with which some auditors run through flat spots and get more rrs and all this sort of thing the way they fool around of course they get bypassed items well getting lot of bypassed items will upset pc but nothing will upset pc more than missing whole gpm well this makes the finding of goals difficult on some pcs the average pc that you run into hell be in his first gpm and you list the goals one way or another and you find his goal bangand it rocket reads little bit occasionally and then you list it and it gets rocket reading items and its all better and how you go on down the bank and the rocket read now is half inch and the rocket read is an inch and quarter and the rocket read is two inches see the more items you find the more it rocket reads and then the goal starts to fire with an rs and an rr alternately you know you call it bangbangbang and to scream rr to scream rs to scream rr and next thing you know why this thing is firing early and late its to screampssww and to pssww it doesnt fire on time its in messedup bank see i mean the bank is unable to support that charge any more and then the goal goes to tick and you keep running it and you get on out the bottom of the bank and youre away thats the way goal should behave as it goes on down the line its all given in that march 13th bulletin but some pc you get ahold of him you get this goal you see to be happy it rocket reads you prepcheck it it rocket reads its okay it does all right it checks out pc is kind of unhappy about it but it checks out and you get the first item and you get the second item and you get the third item and by that time the goal read is almost microscopic and you get the fourth item you get the fifth item you get the sixth item you cant detect anything on the list everything is disappearing pcs rr is going off and so forth its mess and so you slug away youve got headaches you know eventually you get smart and decide that youre going to find another goal and you do and you find something that practically explodes in your face see and it just runs like mad and you find few items they all rocket read and it all comes off and the goal does blowdown and so forth youve gotten rid of your first gpm but that pc can be dramatizing terminal or oppterm of the second gpm and actually have first gpm where the goal is to be found adds randomity what kind of randomity it means you try to prepcheck his present time and youre prepchecking the second gpm i thinkthink thats quite fascinating dont you all of present time is connected with the second gpm at least that appears to to be the way some of these banks may lie so you try to do prepcheck you try to do problems intensive you try to do auditing on this characterand hes always arc broke why because youre in the middle of the second gpm thats life life to him is the second gpm well he was busy forming the first gpm and he was going on all right but because the second one is so handy he dropped back into the second ones goal he saidhis mama for instance told him he had to be good and so forth and the second gpms goal is to be good in other words he gets dropped back well you try to do problems intensive on this person from date youll get away with it as long as its problems but the second it becomes purposes youre in trouble youre in bad trouble because you say since 1950 how has purpose been suppressed and it darn near tears the pcs head off why because since 1950 theyve been living in the purpose of the second gpm and that is an intolerable area its just as though he were trying to run the first gpm while the p or trying to run the pc through the third gpm you see while you had the second gpm intact oh man it its just blahh so whats this mean well in the first placein the first place it means that goals finding is very difficult on some pcs and this isnt any majority of pcs and it means that pc youre having troublean awful lot of troublefinding the goal on by standard methods has got thea couple of gpms mixed up and youre having trouble with him that way it also means that you have to be terribly permissive the way you run any kind of an intensive and goals intensive would have to be run without regard to time span so we get what is designated right now as 2gx1 and that is goals intensive by prepcheck and that is very very very very permissive now eventually bunch of reworked buttons will be put out but the you can use those eighteen buttons you have to have blunted thwarted perverted in there as buttons when youre handling purposes the way you do this is you just sit the pc down in chair whether hes connected to the emeter or not and you give him purpose intensive there thats the goals intensive by prepcheck2gx1 how do you do it now listen to now listen to the commands of this are very dangerousand they mustnt be changed around you change them around and youre going to wind that pc around athe nearest telegraph pole if you were to say what purpose have you suppressed youre going to run up stacks and stacks and stacks of missed withholds because he wont tell you how he suppressed it and thatll all amount to missed withholds and your pc practically goes rigid turns into board and hell eventually not even be able to talk why because youre running five six eight twelve missed withholds every command that you give him so its very important to follow this command its very tricky the way its been worked out youve got to get the overt against the purpose but it is not necessary to get the purpose you understand youre not interested in what the purpose in the answer isyou are interested in the overt you have to stay interested in the overt otherwise otherwise the pc is going to have the overt from you as missed withhold thats one important fact and the next important fact ive already given you is it mustnt be run against time span there must be presenttime time span why pc might be in the second gpm you dont know so give him very very permissive type that doesnt mean that he doesnt have to answer the questions but give him very permissive type of command see the wording of the things got to be very permissive its got to get the overt it doesnt have to get the purpose all right the command then is precisely this command its not since anything it is simply how has purpose been mid rud button by permissive repetitive prepcheck keep driving him on this thing is going to take long time you get the idea youre not going to clean up this first button on suppresswell under three hours or something like that its going to take time and youre actually looking at about twentyfivehour intensive and you just take all of those mid rud buttons which of course in 2gx1 will be shifted around to fit the idea of purpose most of the old ones are left in and these new goals things are added and you just run this as prepcheck its just how has purpose been suppressed see and then how has purpose been invalidated and how have you been careful of purpose see it all must be howhow not ever whatnever never never never never whatits catastrophic now supervised supervised to the degree that they flatten these questions and that the auditor stays pretty muzzled and that that auditing command never never never varies over to whatwhat purpose you seebut must stay on how has purpose youve got just about the finest coaudit process you ever wanted to look at and that is natural for coaudits pc finally runs down and doesnt have any more and so forth well let him go on to the next button you see it can be run actually meterless if youre running that kind of coaudit now thats going to show you up somesome interesting views in actual fact the person whose goal is in an area he has now retreated from temporarily will actually be able to find enough in present time that is an harmonic on the first gpm to be able to run it but if you force it with the present time or an in this lifetime or since 1950 or anything of that characterif you enforce this and force him to answer that auditing command as though it is with an axthis lifetimeyoure making him run the wrong goal interesting isnt it on some cases youll actually run the wrong goal its taken quite bit of threading around and that sort of thing toto get these data and theyre quite valuable but then on the surface of it routine 2gx1 is just about the simplest idiots delight that you ever had anything to do with thats just that there it is it is just how has purpose been suppressed how has purpose been suppressed how has purpose been suppressed how has purpose been suppressed how has purpose been suppressed for about three hours you see and then how has purpose been invalidated how has purpose been invalidated how has purpose been invalidated you see and on and on and on and youll find the pc cycles and you want to cycle him back up to present time you use the cyclic rules in this thing you know i mean lot of the old auditing rules come in but actually you cant go very wrong with the thing providing you dont say in present time got it well thats 2gx1 thats conditional numbering too by the way but probably hold true now you say well what happens to the problems intensive well weve had problems intensive for quite while and hasnt had number and it is not vital that you run problems intensive to find the goal youll find problems intensives on great many people will locate the goal but on some people because youre using present time youre not going to find the goal and its not going to unburden itll do them lot of good but its not going to find any goal so therefore the old twentyfivehour problems intensive does not belong in the 2g series whats the g stand for goals of course all right now that sets the case up loosens them up so they can get an idea of goals and that basically is the most elementary process i know to set case up to find goals now thats still got an x on it and thatll be taken off in due course or the process will be shifted or adjusted to account for any other variables but as far as i can see at this present moment early testsnot on that process but on all the processes that didnt work demonstrate that thats about the only one that will now our nextour next item here on these is what for years has simply been listing and finding goals youve all been doing that you know all about it but that becomes 2g2 there doesnt have to be any x connected with it because we know it of old well what does it consist of you write list of goals you take list of goals off the pc and you null the list and you put in the big mid ruds on the goals which remain ticking on the list thats the most elementary form of it there is more elementary form but it very often misses the goal so were not going to say that it is the most elementary form it isnt the most elementary form its simply the oldest and that is to say we write list of goalsthe oldest form was we took short list of goals read them over found out which one dived the most on the meter and called that the pcs goal its not very accurate the next one is we made long list of goals and we eliminated and that onewith tiger drill we didnt have it thenand that one which still ticked we called the pcs goal that was very susceptible to wrong goals an awful lot of right goals were found that way but some wrong ones were found that way too now that old elementary systemthat old elementary system is not the best goals system nor is it the most elementary or fundamental the most fundamental system on finding goals is simply to list some goals on the pc null those goals by elimination calling each goal three times in case the pcs attention is wandering take those that still tickbecause you see the odd part of it is is even though the goal has been invalidated and that sort of thing the invalidations add up to read by elimination and do the whole lot get two three four five something like this that have dr on them or tick left on them that didnt go out by elimination and just put in the big mid ruds on each one of those theres shorter method than that which is just to put in the left hand buttons on each one which is suppress careful of and fail to reveal but on an operation of this character youd better put in the big mid ruds because you may have pc whos protesting or deciding or that sort of thing and its safest to put in the big mid ruds so that is in actual fact the most elementary goals finding method now when we list the goals if we list them on meter we dont change the process it is simply that we can mark in an rr if we see it or an rs if we see it and that helps the auditor because hes not going to take goal that he saw an rr on and give it light dustoff dont you see so that is simply security you need meter but the listing on the meter is not absolutely essential to 2g2 not absolutely essential but neat 2g2 would list it on the meter and you would see whether or not these goals rred or rsed as you wrote the things down you got that and when its being done by an auditor thatthat would bethat would be fine in actual fact the reason why we say it isnt absolutely essential that we do that is youre going to find coaudit practice occasionally will be to list somebodys goals and even though we give the person meter to list them on the designations which they give are not necessarily accurate and therefore it doesnt matter what these things are designated you still do the same things see whether its listed on the meter or not listed on the meter you do the same action just listing it on the meter helps you out and that action consists of first to list the goals from the pc some pcs have goals lists theyve already done and that sort of thing well that can be included but shouldnt at this stage of the game be encouraged thats not 2g2 and you take some goals you list them then when youve got this list in section or full list or with tone arm action or without tone arm action we dont care anything about the tone arm actionwe dont care how many goals we list we dont care if we list hundred goals we dont care if we list thousand goals we dont care anything about that at all but the suggestion is to keep it downkeep it down to couple of pages just keep it down to couple of pages in other words we do couple of pages of goals we null those two pages of goals we put in the big mid ruds on those that still rred or ticked and then we take another couple of pages of goals and then we null that couple of pages of goals and so forth and put in the big mid ruds in other words this is based on finding over the years we have found that as one of you is doing to pc at the present time about the cruelest thing you could do to the pc is to list goals and never null them thats very cruel thing and if youve got long cumbersome list the auditors tendency is not to null it because it is just too long and hard now in view of the fact that in most pcs the goal occurs in the first 150 goals listed you can see there thatthats fact theyre the first 150 listed that if you list those things in little sectionsyou know just couple of pages front and back of the page you know that sort of thing and then null them and so onyoure never going to get into big hightension situation with the pc pcs get very anxious they put their goal on the list and youre nulling this 500 goals list dont you see you say what happened to the 850 goals list well what happened to yesterday see were talking now about 2g2 and it has nothing to do with what we were doing so you list this list you null this list you put in the big mid ruds on what youve got left you watchbang youll eventually see some fireworks on the thing well most of your goals are going to be found that way just as elementary as that just moreno more upset than that when youve got 2g2 up to thousand goals and you havent got the pcs goal let tell you something that pc is in the second or third gpm in present time and present time has nothing to do with the first gpm you s this so this pc is dislocated as far as the bank is concerned and the goal isnt readily available this is your first conclusion now what do you do well you could keep this up i dont really see any reason to keep it up beyond about thousand goals because ive seen those pcs who have gone above thousand goals still havent put their goal on the list i havent seen them put their goal on the list tillup to about three thousand goals five thousi know one pc who had about five thousand goals and didnt get his goal on the list i finally had to dig it up out of so on by other means but theretheres limit then to 2g2 if you easily find the pcs goal by this method why do anything else if you dont easily find the pcs goal by this method and the auditor actually knew when the meter read and when it didnt and actually could null list somewhat there isnt really any point in continuing 2g2 frankly to continue it beyond five hundred you start wasting time but lets put it on as an absolute limit of thousand and lets put it on if youre going to do 2g2 at an absolute minimum absolute just minimum minimum of two hundred because the average is that well its some percentage of pcsi dont know some guesshalf the pcs you run into have their first goal in the first 150 goals they give you and that actually is the totality of this action thats the totality of it now administration enters in here youre going to turn goalsfinding loose for gods sakes preserve the lists impress people with the necessity of writing down the full goal as given by the prec i ran into some old south african acc goals lists goals lists that was pretty good i mean it was the first ones taken down there this is what taught they took piece of paper seethey took this piece of paperand they lets take goal to be railroad foreman see and it says rr 4 and thats written this way see and then over here its to be kchunh and then over here its like run like anything and over here someplace is queen to be queen to shoot queen what see get them to take the full goals down in an orderly column with the pcs name and the date of the list on the top and null it with the standard method of nulling xs and slants in other wordsrs rr and so forth and preserve that list its valuable thats the main danger in goals finding is not that some student auditor or hpa or somebody like that is going to goof and not find the fellows goal we dontcouldnt care less so he goes over the top of the fellows goal the troublethe trouble that comes up weve hadweve had goals list after goals list that somebodys gone back and nulled the goals list and they found the goal in the first seventy five goals you know somebody had just ridden right over the top of it reading like mad the trouble comes when they take that piece of paper and dont put it in folder and when they wrote it down in the first place didnt write the full goal down and didnt date it and didnt put the pcs name on it and didnt put it in the folder and when they didnt do that they put the pc in trouble thats what made the trouble the only way you can get pc in trouble then with 2g2 the only way you can get him into trouble is to fail to write down the full goal as given by the pc put the pcs name and date on the thing and to put it in folder and then keep the folder and dont lose it thats the mainthe main thing that has to be taught on that along with everything else you teach dont fool with that because pc is actually put in danger by this the odd part of it is is sometimes its such failure to them not to have their goals found that theythey never put it on list again for instance ive looked over i dont know how many thousands of goals and you know i never put my first goal down on list the second time it wasnt until the auditor was one day nulling or listinglisting some goals and listed another goal and id spotted spot where id thought of the first goal and all of sudden gave the first goal and i think the thing read dialwide rocket read ii said thats thats thats my goal you know thatsthat wait whoa whoa whoa whoa thats my goal see it had already been checked out and hadnt fired abouti dont know three four five times been on ait had been on list for over year its within i think the first 130 goals or something like that its one of the very very early goals ive forgotten what number it is maybe its number 98 or something like that now all during that year idjust had never put it on another list i put everything else on lists but not that one so those early lists are quite important and they must be kept and you must impress on anybody who does this that the list must be accurate must be dated must have the pcs name on it and must be kept and made available to future auditors that pc must know that that is valuable piece of paper he wont think it is but hes got to have it that way hes got to realize that it is available and the auditor must must realize that it is very valuable thats 2g2 all right now 2g3 consists of taking any and all items that have ever been found on the pci just described it to you in the last lecture i gave you any and all items ever found on pc by any means or any method of any kind and you list goals on them what might be the goal of just as though they were all oppterms you know the opptermsthe early oppterms have the pcs goal and then if you dont find it then why then you list every item of any kind ever found on the pc and anybody used it for anything whatsoever you list it with what goal would be an overt against it and what goal would be an overt against t9 you know and youyou list every item that way why you list terms and oppterms in other words 2g3 does not differentiate between term and oppterm it only differentiates between two actions listing any item ever found on the pcwhat goal might be the goal of or what might be the goal of whatever the item is and then if the goal is not found in that way then we treat the whole thing as an oppterm the way we used to treat oppterms that is what goal would be an overt against every item on the list actually thats best used for terminals as you look at that march 13th line plot youll find out why so anyway this operation is very easy operation and once more about the only crime you can commit with it is not to null the pcs goals once listed so you actually dont write down the goals of fifteen items and then null them all you dont do thatyou dont do that youyou write down the what might the goal of catfish be you write and list until the question is clean and usually that is never more than fiftysixty goals something like thatat the absolute outside then you take that fifty or sixty goals as unit and you dont go on to something else now you take that one and you null it and you put the big mid ruds against the ones that are still left and youre going to get some commotion there and that will be it all right you go on and on and on that way and eventually if you dont find the pcs goals using all these things ever found and so forthif you dont find the pcs goal by saying what might the goal be you see you say what goal would be an overt against t and you list them all that way and you eventually pick up the persons goal but take one item at time and list it as though thats all youre ever going to do and finish up that cycle of action and so forth its very cruel thing to list goals on pc and then not null them this is very bad thing i know because my pc has done lot of long lists wrote in her own time and so forth and ive never nulled these things she i mean every once in while is bringing these things up and that sort of thing now you do that piece by piece then its all little piecework and any moment youre liable to turn upwell you list from the earliest item forward earliest item why well its much more likely to have been the top itemthe top oppterm of the gpm if it was found on the pc long time ago so 2g3 takes care of oldtime people who have had lot of things found on them so therefore is somewhat specialized process well where does that put us with raw meat that has items of any kind whatsoever well it puts us into 2g4 and 2g4 is the new name of routine 212 only its different process than routine 212 because it does not require that you find any item on it and oppose it now its merely the first stages of 2 12 but actually its also 3ga criss cross now i dont mean to leave you in confusion because its one of theseone of these elementary actions elementary action indeed you make list use the 3ga titles for the same reasons i gave you earlier in the lecture you do not use present time or present lifetime or any such questions because youre dealing with goals and the pc might be elsewhere than in the first gpm so here we have situation where we make list well those are the old 3ga lists theres particular reason i should give you whole bunch of lists on this but ill give you an idea of the type of list these things are who does everybody more or less dislike who or what does everybody more or less dislike and youll find the pc will give you the top oppterm you see its simple huh well you you run list and you hope that the auditor will see it rr or rs or do something active and find out that that is the item but in actual fact in actual facti correct something here i said its the itsits not the full of 212 in this 2g4its only the vague shadowings because theres more of it as you go up in higher numbers this onethis one is very simplevery simple you have the guy who or what does most everybody dislike or detest or something of this sort and you hope he sees some of these things rs and he gives you long list of these things and you hope that the rs is more or less accurate so we get in agreement with the pc we dont depend upon the auditors meter read see we dont depend on his nulling the list we dont depend on him finding items we have him get in cahoots with the pc and have the pc agree that certain one of these things certainly aredo match up to the situation in other words we let the pc examine the list they go over it together and hell usually pick the rock slamming items but thats beside the point do you know how many items we can pick off that list well we can use five we can use six items off that one list then of course we had our old headings who or what have you detested and who would you rather not associate with and also who do people not associate with you see who or what do people not associate with youve got various types of 3ga headings but none of these are present life see you dont say in this lifetime or in present time or anything like that because you might run into this scrambled gpm phenomena and how do you use those how do you use those i know it horrifies you you say you take five items off this list and list goals against each one of the five items yes you dont find the item for the list you got the idea thats left to 2g5 now if somebodys really sailing he notices theres some rses on this thing he can make fourway package if he hasnt found the goal yet he can actually find the item on this oppose it oppose it and oppose it and get fourway package and you have 212 in full total use of 212 thats what its relegated to now because its numbers have been popularized so well keep on calling it that well keep on calling it 212 but remember that in goals finding and when it is used for goals finding it is totally dedicated just to finding some items on which you can list goals and you see now thats builtup series of added complications you see that the actual action of listing some goals and then nulling the goals and putting in the big mid ruds you seethat was 2g2 the actual action of taking hatful of items and listing goals against those and doing 2g2 on them see and then the actual action of getting list and picking some things off of this list to list goals against you see is actually 2 3 and 4 and now taking that and building fourway package with it is 2g5 you got it so actually its the same item with the added complication of an additional number the added complication of additional number the added complication of additional number and of course you get the tougher and tougher case you see that so if you dont find the goal by this method then you find the goal by the next method and if you dont find the goal by the next method you find the next method well how low down does this start it starts with 2g1 and youll find out certain number of pcs after you have given them 2g1 all of sudden look at you fixedly their eyes widen and they say my goal is so that of course is the simplest method of goals finding you didnt you didnt do anything and there it rocket reads and everything and it and youre all set so thatsof course that is the most fundamental method of goals finding of course 2g1 can be so simple that you say how has purpose been suppressed well with you sitting there not listening to when i tell you that my goal is to catch catfish it rocket reads and youve got the pcs goal i can see some auditorhes all set here for the next hundred hours hes studied you see hes got this all taped beautiful shape and he says all right now were going to start this intensive now how has goal been suppressed by your refusing to listen to that my goal is to catch catfish pssww and to what terrible isnt it but also look at the plight of the other fellow who has gone upclear up to 2g5 and he still doesnt have the pcs goal and he is getting old and bowed and it looks like its professional activity well by that timeby that time let us hope and let him hope that i have by that time invented 2g6 thats the only answer i can give you anyway you see those are the old goals finding methods all brought forwardall brought forward from the simplest to the late now all of these have worked and there are certain sins that accumulate to each one and that is failure to administer and the other is failure to null what youve listed thats always cruel now this can be taught and this can be done and as matter of fact youre looking at preview of the schedule you will be on next week because we intend now by our plotout and so forth to find the goal of the person in the x unit and not let them out of the x unit until he does have his goal and to bung him over into the unit at the earliest after his goal has been found so this isbecomes very important youre going to get rearrangement ofof schedule based against the reality of exactly what youre doing it doesnt change or discredit any of your checksheets and it doesnt cost you any lost ground thein these lectures is there anything you have been anxious about anywayanyway allallall good fun aside therethere are the 2gs and well be doing those things in the x unit and in the unit youll be studying youryour 3m and getting ready to run it you should realize that it is one thing to find the goal it is quite something else to run one and running goal has become hazardous profession its notits not that it is difficult to do its that auditors list so enthusiastically they slide over the top of ris and they bypass items on their lists and they do various things like this and it makes it more complicated than it should be it is really very mechanical it is the auditor making it complicated that is giving us trouble at the present time and we can get around that too but the pointthe point is here that we mean to find the persons goal in the x unit and run it in the z unit and it immediately and directly breaks down the course into routine 2 and routine 3 doesnt it well you say well what happened to v unit oh wellwellwell thats expiring thats expiring as of monday morning it will be thing of the past because too many people have been relaxing i am told and flunking themselves down to the v unit so they get some auditing the v unit ran itself up an enviable record of finding goals and so forthand thats supposed to be done in the x unit now so there we are student first coming in is not going to be given even grace period now hes just going to go straight onto rudiments and havingness as soon as hes got his rudiments and havingness thats rudiments havingness and sec checking soon as hes got this down so he looks good he moves straight and directly up to the x unitwe start working with his goals he finishes up his checksheet as soon as hes got his goal and his checksheets are finished he goes into the unit he studies in the unit nothing but study in the unitgets all ready to go into the z unit and run goals thats the way im streamlining the situation and itll work out lot better for you were going for blood on this we want goals we want clears and theres time to goof around on it so im arranging the schedule just to that degree to make sure that it moves on forward now you see you dont think you ever cause anything you see and ive had my ear to the grindstone1 think it was my earand i heard some of you complaining about lack of checkouts or complaining about this and complaining about that and you complained yourself into brandnew schedule so its all your fault its all your fault and i havent anything to do with it but im running goal at the present moment my fifthand the goal is to be responsible so you willyouyoull forgive meyoull forgive if im slightly aberrated on the subject at this particular moment its all your fault okay all right well thats all we have and i hope you can put this this routine 2 information to very good effect and i hope where youre going that you can teach hpas and hcas how to find these things and youll notice that they stack right up with each additional step following in behind the next so theres waste of motion on it finding goals has been researched over period now of two or three years and i think youll find its pretty good all right well thank you very much thank you very much and good night
