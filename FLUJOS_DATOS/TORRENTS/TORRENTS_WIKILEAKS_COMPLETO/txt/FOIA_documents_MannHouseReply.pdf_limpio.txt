july 15 2005 via federal express joe barton chairman house committee on energy and commerce ed whitfield chairman subcommittee on oversight and investigations 2125 rayburn house office building washington dc 20515 dear chairman barton and chairman whitfield this letter responds to your letter of june 23 2005 which seeks information on issues relating to my research on the histor ical record of temperatures and climate change 1 your letter lays out number of c oncerns about the research my colleagues and i have conducted about global warming ur letter also inquire s about the role i played in the preparation of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change third assessment report the socalled tar i will address each of your questions in turn before doing so however let state that my research findings which suppor t the conclusion that the earths surface is warming and that recent warming is due in large part to human influences are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change my research has been subject to intensive peerreview ot her scientists have repl icated all facets of my research and have found it accurate and reliable the specific conclusion published by my colleagues and that late 20th century northern hemisphere warmth is anomalous in the context of at least the past millennium is common to many studies based on multiple supporting studies the tar came to similar conclusion the tar did not rely solely on the work of my colle agues and in reaching this conclusion recent work since the tar has provided furt her support for this conclusion which is now common to more than dozen independe nt studies published in the peerreviewed scientific literature i have provided for reference comprehensive review by jones and mann in the journal reviews of geophysic s of the american geophysical union agu the criticisms your letter cites have been soundly rejected by the scientific community 1 this response is submitted wit hout waiving any object ion i might have to the committees jurisdiction over th subject matter of this inquiry 2 the most serious contention in your letter namely that my work has not been subject to replication because i have failed to make availabl the underlying research data is incorrect your letter notes that the national research councils gold standard for scientific research is the ability of ot her scientists to repl icate firstgeneration research and i fully agree my colleagues and i follow the national research councils guidance with regards to the disclosure of research data and all of our data and methodologies have been fully disclosed and ar available to anyone with computer and an internet connection as result of our willingness to share our research with others an independent team of scien tists has used the research da ta my colleagues and i have made public to replicate our research and confirm the reliability of our findings see wahl er ammann cm robustness of the mann bradley hughes reconstruction of surface temperatures examination of crit icisms based on the nature and processing of proxy climate evidence climate change 2005 forthcoming and associated website httpwwwcgdeduccramma nnmillenniummbh_reevaluationhtml let now turn to your specific questions which ask that i provide the following information q1 your letter first asks that i furnish the committee my curriculum vitae along with list of all studies relating to climate change research for whic h you were an author or coauthor and the source of funding for those studies this material is attached q2 your letter next asks th at i list all fi nancial support i have received to support my research see attachment q3 your letter requests that i provide for all work involving federal grants or funding support under which you were recipient of funding or principal investigator all agreements relating to those underlying gr ants or funding including but not limited to any provisions adjustments or exceptio ns made in the agreement relating to the sharing of research results these requests are not directed to the appropriate person the committee should contact the university of massachusetts and university of virginia offices of grant administration for these materials with respect to the umass nsf research funds which supported the 1998 nature article it should furtherm ore be noted that i was not the principal investigator for this nsf projec t and i am not nor ve i ever been in possession of any official paperw ork related to this grant q4 your next question asks for the locat ion of all data archives relating to each published study for which i was an author or coauthor and whether such data would be sufficient to permit other res earchers to replicate the work 3 the data descriptions of methods and results related to my research more than sufficient to permit other researchers to replicate the research have been extensively archived in many cases in seve ral archives on public websites and data links within the websites the webs ite addresses appear in the margin2 q5 this question begins by stating that according to the wall street journal you have declined to release th exact computer code you used to generate your results the question then poses series of questions is that correct b what policy on 2

question presumes that in order to replicate scientific research second researcher has to have access to exactly th same computer program or code as the initial researcher this premise is false the key to replicability is unfettered access to all of the underlying data and methodologies us ed by the first researcher my data and methodological information and that of my colleagues are available to anyone who wants them3 as noted above other scientists have reproduced our results based on publicly available information it also bears emphasis that my computer program is private piece of intellectual property as the national science foundation and its lawyers recognized the national science foundation the government agency th at establishes policy in this area has confirmed that my colleagues and i have t every requirement of transparency and openness in our research my research is ll based on data sets regarding the earths 3 all of the proxy data treerings coral ice cores and historical documents used in mann et 1998 has been available since may 2000 on this public website ftpholocen eevscvirginiaedupubmbh98 the methodology used by my colleagues and is described in detail in the initial publication and further expanded upon in july 2004 on nature s supplementary website httpwwwnaturecomnaturejourna lv430n6995suppinf onature02478html and on our own website ftpholocen eevscvirginiaedupubmannetal98 moreover independentlyderived source codes for implementing our algorithm and all required input data have been posted on the website of the national center for atmospheric research see httpwwwucareduccrammannmille nniumcodes_mbhhtml for these reasons charges that our work is not subject to replication are unfounded the initial description of the work was sufficient to permit researchers to independently produce the key algorithms see eg zorita f gonzalez rouco and s legutke testing the mann et al1998 approach to paleoclimate reconstructions in the

ether our results can be reproduced and whether i make my computer programs publicly available or not is decision that is mine alone to make since other scientists have used the methods we described and the data we archived to replicate our results the issue of whether my computer program is available has bearing whatsoever on the veracity of our results the question you posed whether i have fully sa tisfied established scientific standards for datasharing has been fully considered by the national scie nce foundation as your letter notes two canadian researchers steve mcintyre nd ross mckitrick contacted nsf to inquire whether i had complied with national scie nce foundation requirements the national science foundation twice informed them that i have in fact complied with all applicable transparency and openness standards and that under longstanding foundation policy the computer codes referred to by the wall street journal are considered the intellectual property of researchers and ar not subject to disclosure4 4 for the sake of completeness t quote in its tirety the email message sent by dr david j verardo di rector paleoclimate program division of atmospheric sciences national scie nce foundation to mr steve mcintyre copied to on december 17 2003 in response to previous email that mcintyre had sent to dr verardo copied to dear mr mcintyre i apologize if my last electronic message was not clear but let clarify the us nsfs view in this current message dr mann and his other us colleagues are under obligation to provide you with any dditional data beyond the extensive data sets they have already made available he is not required to provide you with computer programs codes etc his res earch is published in the peerreviewed literature which has passed muster with th editors of those journals and other scientists who have reviewed his manuscr ipts you are free to your analysis of climate data and he is free to his th passing of time and evolving new knowledge about earths climate will eventually tell the full story of chan ging climate i would expect that you would respect the views of the us nsf on the issue of data access and intellectual property for us investigators as articulated by to you in my last message under the advisement of the us nsfs office of general counsel respectfully david j verardo director paleoclimate program division of atmospheric sciences national science foundation 4201 wilson blvd arlington va 22203 even more recently the national scien ce foundation confirmed its view that my computer codes are my intellectua l property recent issue of the chronicle of higher education states according to davi d stonner of the congressional 6 with this background in mind let now respond to your specific inquiries q5a i have made available all of the research data that i am required to under united states policy as set by the national science foundation in accordance with the rules promulgated by the foundati on and supported by the foundations general counsel i maintain the right to decline to release any computer codes which are my intellectual property q5b the policy regarding sharing research and methods i and my colleagues follow is to disclose any information that might be useful to other researchers including the data description of met hodology and so forth that would enable competent scientist to replicate our work the proof here of course is that other scientists have in fact succeeded in rep licating our work and as noted above our policies are fully in keeping with those established by the national science foundation aq5c the source of these policies is the national science foundation aq5d my computer program is piece of private intellectual property as the national science foundation and its lawyers r ecognize it is bedrock principle of american law that the government may not take private property without public use and without just compensation that notwithstanding the program used to generate the original mann et 1998 temperature reconstructions is posted at this website ftpholoceneevscvirginiaedupubmannetal98 see methods subdirectory q6 the committee next asks that regarding study data and related information that is not pub licly archived what request s have you and your coauthors received for data relating to climate change studies what was your response and why i can of course only speak for myself but i do not believe that there is any study data used in my published work that is not publicly archived having said that i do respond diligently to any requests from scientific colleagues for data or methodological details relating to our research affairs office at the national science foundation mr mcinty re contacted the foundation last year to ask for mr mann s computer code mr stonner said the agency had told mr mcintyre that the code was the intellectual property of mr mann richard monastersky congressman demands

7q7 this question poses number of ques tions based on an article published by mcintyre and mckitrick in energy environment the question states that these authors report number of rrors and omissions in mann et 1998 and how these may affect the underlying conclusions of the wor k the question goes on to list number of topics that i should address in narrative explanation i want to begin by emphasizing that nothing in mcintyre and mckitricks article undermines the conclusion of my resear ch my colleagues and i stand foursquare behind our work so does th scientific community the various claims of mcintyre and mck itrick including the ones repeated in your question have been exhaustively ex amined by two different groups of climate researchers who have found th eir objections to be unfounded5 see also national center for atmospheric research media advisory the hockey stick controversy new analysis reproduces graph of late 20th century temperature rise may 11 2005 available at httpwwwucaredunewsre leases2005ammannshtml moreover it is my understanding that several othe r groups of climate research ers have examined mcintyre and mckitricks criticisms and also have found their criticisms lacki ng in merit on the other hand i know of independe nt scientific group that s found any of mcintyre and mckitricks claims to be valid nor is that surprising energy environment is not peer reviewed scientific journal it is journal primarily devoted to policy rather than science that appears to engage in at most haphazard review of its ar ticles and neither mc intyre nor mckitrick is trained climate scientist according to the biographical data on their websites mr mcintyre is mining industry executive with formal training in any discipline related to climate research and mr mckitrick is an economist with scien tific training hardly credentials that lend force to their academic arguments see httpwwwuoguelphcarmckitricvhtml and httpwwwuoguelphcarmckitr iresearchstevebiodoc adding to the problem the editor of energy environment ms sonja boehmer christiansen has candidly acknowledged that the publication has clear editorial bias in the september 5 2003 issue of the chronicle of higher education ms boehmer christiansen is quoted as desc ribing the editorial policy of energy environment in this way im following my political agenda bit anyway but isn t that the right of 5 see eg rutherford s mann osborn tj bradley rs briffa kr hughes mk jones pd proxybased northern hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions sensitivity to methodology predictor network

of criticisms based on the nature and processing of proxy climate evidence climatic change 2005 forthcoming 8an editor as to peer review ms boehmerchristiansen has acknowledged in an email to dr tim osborn of the climatic resear ch unit at the university of east anglia uk that in her rush to get the mcintyre and mckitrick piece into print for political reasons energy environment dispensed with what scientis ts consider peer review i was rushing you to get this paper out for policy impact reasons eg publication well before cop9 as ms boehmerchristianse n added the paper was amended until the very last moment there was trade off in favour of policy mcin tyre and mckitricks work has been discredited by ample peerreviewed scientific work nonetheless let try to res pond to the committees specific questions a7a7b the committee inquires about the sensitivity of the results of the mann et 1998 study to the inclusion or omission of certain north american treering data the bristlecone pine series and archiv ed gaspe tree ring data referred to in the committees letter for complete scien tific response you shoul d consult the article my coauthors and i published back in 1999 addressing precisely th issues mann bradley rs and hughes mk northern hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium inferences uncertainties and limitations geophysical research letters 26 75962 1999 the issues raised by the committee invol ve 100 year subinterval of our reconstruction from ad 14001500 as my coauthors and i explained in our 1999 article cited above given the pr oxy data available at that time certain key treering data including the series mentioned above were essential if the rec onstructed temperature record during early centuries were to have any climatologic skill that is any validity or meaningfulness these conclusions were of course reached through analyses in which these key datasets were excluded and the re sults tested for statistical validity our conclusions have been confirmed by wahl and ammann see above these researchers have demonstrated that the reconstructions produced by mcintyre and mckitrick result from ignoring these key data and fail the ccepted basic tests for statistical validity moreover wahl and ammann demonstrate that the climatologically improbable results obtained by mcintyre and mckitr ick which would suggest that the northern hemisphere was unusually warm during the 15 th century the middle of the socalled little ice age are statistically meaningless and an artifact of both their exclusion of key proxy data as discussed above and the use of flawed implementation of the mann et 1998 method see httpwwwcgducareduccramm annmillenniumcodes_mbhhtml chart at the bottom of the page since 1999 new proxy data have become available and new methodologies developed for using them studies using th data and methodologies have confirmed the primary conclusion of our work eg mann et 1998 and mann et 1999 that the most recent decades were likely the warmest of the past 1000 years for the northern hemisphere on the average the most recent such study published in nature in fact extends this conclusion to at least the past 2000 years moberg dm sonechkin k holmgren nm datsenko and w karlen highly variable northern hemisphere 9temperatures reconstructed from low and highresolution proxy data nature 433 613617 2005 a7c the committee inquires about the ca lculation of the r2 statistic for temperature reconstruction especially for the 15 th century proxy calculations in order to answer this question it is impor tant to clarify that i assume that what is meant by the r2 statistic is the squared pearson dotmoment correlation or r2 ie the square of the simple linear correlation coefficient between two time series over the 18561901 verification interval for our reconstruction my colleague s and i did not rely on this statistic in our assessments of skill ie th reliability of statistical model based on the ability of statistical model to match data not used in c onstructing the model because in our view and in the view of other reputable scientists in the field it is not an adequate measure of skill the statistic used by mann et 1998 the reduction of error or re statistic is generally favored by scientists in the field see eg luterbacher jd et european seasonal and annual temp erature variability trends and extremes since 1500 science 303 14991503 2004 re is the preferred measure of statistical skill because it takes into account not only whether reconstruction is correlated with the actual test data but also whether it can closely reproduce the mean and standard deviation of the test data if reconstruction cannot do that it cannot be cons idered statistically va lid ie useful or meaningful the linear correlation coefficient r is not sufficient diagnostic of skill precisely because it cannot measure the ability of reconstruction to capture changes that occur in either the standard deviation or mean of the series outside the calibration interval this is well known see wilks ds s tatistical methods in atmospheric science chap 7 academic press 1995 cook et spatial regression methods in dendroclimatology review and comparison of two techniques international journal of climatology 14 379402 1994 the highe st possible attainable value of r2 ie r2 1 may result even from reconstruction that has statistical skill at all see eg rutherford et proxybased northern hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions sensitivity to methodology predictor network target season and target domain journal of climate 2005 in press to appear in july issueavailable at ftpholoceneevscvirginiaedupubmannruthetaljclimateinpress05pdf for all of these reasons we and other re searchers in our field employ re and not r 2 as the primary measure of reconstructive skill as noted above in contrast to the work of mann et 1998 the results of the mcintyre and mckitrick analyses fail verification tests using the accepted metric re this is key finding of the wahl and amma nn study cited above this means that the reconstructions mcintyre and mc kitrick produced are statistically inferior to the simplest possible statistical reconstructio n one that simply assigns the mean over the calibration period to all previous reconstructed values it is for these reasons that wahl and ammann have concluded that mcintyre and mc kitricks results are without statistical and climatological merit 10a7d the committee asks what validation statistics did you calculate for the reconstruction prior to 1820 and what were th results our validation statistics were described in detail in table provid ed in the supplementary information on nature s website accompanying our orig inal nature article mann bradley rs hughes mk globalscale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries nature 392 779787 1998 these statistics remain on nature s website see httpwwwnaturecomnaturejournal v392n6678suppinfo392779a0html and on our own website see ftpholoceneevscvirginiaedupubmannetal98 a7e the committee asks how i choose part icular proxies nd proxy series again this information is furnished in tail in both our original 1998 article in nature and expanded upon in followup article published in 2000 see mann et global temperature patterns in past centur ies an interactive presentation earth interactions 44 129 2000 specifically this link therein httpwwwncdcnoaagovpaleoeiei_nodendrohtlm as our 1998 study and the additional inform ation mentioned above make clear we made use of all longterm annuallyresol ved proxy indicators available to us in the public domain or through colleagues at the time the research was initiated 19961997 that met requirements for suitable length ag model reliability and in the case of tree ring series replication intercorrelation and metadata as described above q8 this question asks to explain in detail my work for and on behalf of the intergovernmental panel on climate chan ge including my role in the third assessment report referred to as tar and host of information as to how tar was prepared and how the authors of tar veri fied the soundness of the data that formed the basis for the conclusions set forth in tar as is set forth on my curriculum vitae i was one of ten lead authors of chapter 2 of tar and i served as contribu ting author for chapters 7 8 and 12 of the report given the breadth of the project ther were two layers of editorial review that oversaw the work of the lead authors for each chapter so the chapter reflected consensus scientific view not merely the views of any single au thor the tar had 672 scientist reviewers in the united states anyone who want ed to review the drafts was allowed access to them to provide review i am not myself familiar with any scientific document that has been more comprehensively reviewed than the tar information concerning the dates of key meetings the steps taken by reviewers and lead authors to ensure the data were sound and accurate and the identity of people who wrote and review ed portions of tar should be obtained directly from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as i am sure you can appreciate i am not an agent of th ipcc and i am not empowered to speak on ipccs behalf on these matters nor have i been authorized by the ipcc to make public information that the ipcc itself has not chos to make publicly available if the committee is interested in pursuing these matters i would urge that the committee

to in this lette r please let know if you have questions respectfully submitted michael mann phd associate professor and director of earth system science center department of meteorology the
