iteria for future federal grants designed to encourage states to increase their safety belt use rates or enact primary safety belt laws such laws allow police officers to stop vehicle when violation of safety belt use regulation occurs that debate is taking place within the context of deliberations over reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs including various tr affic safety grants provide d to the states proposal also is being discussed that would subject any state that does not adopt and enforce primary belt law with the loss of porti on of its federal high way trust fund monies s 1993 supporters assert that such acti on is needed to convince many reluctant state legislatures to enact primary laws wh ich lead to increases in belt use rates and associated safety payoffs opponents of the penalty appro ach cite federal interference in state matters potential loss of construction funds and privacy concerns about allowing officers to stop vehicle simply because of belt violation in many crashes research indicates that safety belts when used properly are one of the most effective and least costly occ upant protection devices and thus increasing their use is key strategy intended to reduce crash fatalities and serious injuries the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa estimates that more than 164700 lives were saved as result of belt use from 1975 through 2002 and each percentage point increase in the national safety belt use rate represents about 28 million more americans using belts and 270 additional lives saved and 4000 serious injuries prevented each year research s shown that lapshoulder belts when used reduce the risk of fatal injury to front s eat occupants of passenger cars by 45 and the risk of moderatetocritical injury by 50 fortynine states have mandatory adult belt use laws in effect and 20 of these have primary belt laws national safety belt use rates daytime use in the front s eats have been increasing from 58 in 1994 to 79 in 2003 the increases are not consiste nt nationwide most of the states with use rate above 80 have primary forcement law the senate commerce science and transportation committee re ported out s 1978 which authorizes grant program encouraging states to adopt primary laws or increase safety belt use rates that program is similar to that proposed by the administration s 1978 and the administrations reauthor ization proposal would initially reserve most of these grant funds to encourage states to enfo rce primary belt w and both recommend similar amounts of fundi ng for fy2004 to fy2009 for state grants starting in the 120125 million range in fy2004 the house transportation and infrastructure committee proposal hr 3550 would keep the basic structure of the occupant protection grant authorized in 23 usc 405 but would now allow states with safety belt use rate of 85 or greater to receive funds hr 3550 would provide 140 million in fy2004 for occupant protection grants and would increase that amount by 5 million per year through fy2009 that bill also would authorize 10 million per year to support national enfo rcement campaigns to improve occupant protection as well as to reduce impaired driving whereas the senate commerce bill s 1978 would provide 24 million for advertising and ducational initiatives to support these campaigns th is report will not be

safety is an important theme integral to the debate on reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs attention is focused on ways to reduce the impacts of motor vehicle crashes whic h are responsible for about 95 of deaths and 99 of injuries on us highways according to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa safety belt use is the single most effective strategy person can employ to prevent deaths nd injuries and reduce the costs associated with motor vehicle crashes1 many experts throughout the traffic safety community agree with this conclusion as discussed below the strategies or laws used to increase belt use however give rise to controversy among some groups this report presents background inform ation and analysis on the policy issues associated with increasing safety belt use rates and the federal role in this area first statistics on the use of safety belts are pr esented then summary of various state laws and use rates is pres ented followed by discussion on some of the concerns that have been expressed by various parties regarding belt laws next current federal policies and programs affecting safety belt use are detailed paying particular attention to the activities of nhtsa th key federal agency responsible for promoting traffic safety and the use of safety belts as part of the reauthorization proce ss congress is considering proposals that seek to increase belt use rates or encourage states to adopt primary belt laws these proposals are summarized and compared to each other and to current law authorizing comparable federal incentives this report then discusses three of the key policy issues associated with increasing the use of safety belts and the reauthorization of funding for the federal highway programs these issues are the level of federal funding that might be authorized for federa l grants to encourage occupant protection the eligibility criteria that might be used to determine which states qualify for future funding and the proposal to impose fina ncial penalty agains t states federal highway apportionment if that state does not adopt and enforce primary belt

p es2 safety belt statistics safety belts are part of an occupant protection strategy to reduce injury that includes improvements in vehicl design proper use of ch ild safety seats and booster seats and front and side air bags this re port focuses only on the ro of safety belts research indicates that pshoulder belts when used reduce the risk of fatal injury to front seat occupants of passenger cars by 45 and the risk of moderate to critical injury by 502 these studies found that for light truck occupants safety belts also reduce the risk of fatal injury by 60 and moderate to critical injury by 653 both the literature and experience indicates that safety belts when used properly are one of the most effective and least costly ways of saving lives and reducing injuries from many traffic crashes sometimes belted passengers and belted drivers however die or are severely injured in some crashes nhtsa estimates in 2002 that about 14000 lives were saved and 315000 serious in juries were prevented saving about 50 billion in medical care lost productivity and other related costs because of the use of safety belts4 for 2002 nhtsa estimates that more than 7300 people died and 100000 were seriously injured in traffic crashes due to their failure to wear safety belts these occurrences cost society over 20 billion5 nhtsa estimates that more than 164700 lives were saved as result of belt use from 1975 through 20026 according to nhtsa each percentage point increase in the national safety belt use rate represents about 28 million more americans using belts and 270 additional lives saved and 4000 serious injuries prevented each year7 this agency calculates that increasing the national safety belt use rate from the current 79 to 85 would save about 1600 lives annually8 as the number of belt users increases eg the pool of nonusers decreases more lives are sa ved for each incremental point increase in belt use according to the transportation re search board the board points out that the reason is that those most resistant to buckling up tend to exhibit other high risk behaviors eg alcohol use speeding and are more frequently involved in crashes9 the literature also indicates that be lt use is lower about 40 for drivershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs3 10 ibid es1 11 written communication from nhtsa 2004 12 ibid 13 nhtsa the national initiative for increasing safety belt use april 2003 pp 12 14 httpwwwhwysafetyorgsafety_factsstate_l awsrestrainhtm since state laws may change from time to time one should check w ith appropriate state enforcement personnel continued in severe crashes and that nonusers of belts tend to be invol ved in more crashes than belt users10 in the united states about one in five drivers and front seat passengers ride unbuckled of the 32598 passenger vehicle ccupants killed in us traffic crashes in 2002 59 were not w earing safety belt11 crash data show repeatedly that not wearing safety belt could ve dire consequences esp ecially in certain types of crashes consider for example the 8768 people who were killed in 2002 in single vehicle rollover crashes of light vehicl which are those with less than 10000 pound gross vehicle weight rating accord ing to data from nhtsa 76 of these people were not wearing safe ty belts and 79 of these unrestrained occupants were partially or completely ejected from the vehicle12 furthermore nhtsa notes safety belts are 80 percent effective in reducing fatalities in light trucks including sport utility vehicles during rollover crashes13 also it is well documented that inpatient medical costs are much lower fo r those traffic crash survivors who were belted compared to t hose who were unbelted nevertheless despite all of the research that has been completed on this occupant protection device there remains some debate in the scientific community on how to measure the benefits and costs that should be attributed to safety belts there is an associated question of whether some people take greater risks when driving with belt than they would otherwise without belt some scientists ask to what extent does offsetting risky behavior attenuate safety benefits from increased belt use rates how is this phenomena measured objectively there is also the question of ensuring the proper use of effective safety belts these devices must be designed to ensure that they work properly and that they are safe the devices need to be free of flaws defects and failures and these devi ces need to be worn correctly safety belt laws and use rates fortynine states and the district of columbia have mandatory adult belt use laws in effect according to the insurance institute for highway safety in most states these laws cover fronts eat occupants only although belt laws in 16 jurisdictions alaska california di strict of columbia kentucky maine massachusetts montana nevada new mexico new york oregon rhode island utah vermont washing ton and wyoming cover all rear seat occupants too people in passenger cars pickups suvs and vans are required to comply with belt laws in most jurisdictions but in few jurisdictions occupants of some kinds of vehicles usually pickups are exempt14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs4 14 continued for the latest state traffic safety code and should not rely solely on the information presented in this report 15 nhtsa traffic safety facts laws strengthening safety belt use laws increase belt use decrease crash fatalities and injuries may 2003 16 httpwwwnrdnhtsadotgovpdfnrd30ncsarpts2002809500pdf the 4 increase in belt use rate from 2002 to 2003 is notable especially when one considers that few states adopted and began to enforce new primary belt use laws during 2003 and the large increase in use rates that has been achieved during the last 10 years as of january 2004 20 states puerto ric and the district of columbia have primary laws that allow police officer to stop vehicle and issue citation because of violation of safety be lt law the extent and natu re ie which occupants are covered and which ages can vary depe nding upon the specifics of each states primary law for example in some states primary law applies to all occupants of certain age for all seating positions in some states their primary law pertains to occupants of only certain age in only the front seats and in other states other parameters apply since 1997 about 10 stat have passed primary enforcement law the rest of the states except new hampshire which according to nhtsa has adult safety belt use law have secondary law ie an officer may write citation for failing to wear belt only after vehicle is st opped for some other infraction or reason experience shows that one of the most effective or nearterm ways to increase belt use rates in state with secondary law is to convince that state to adopt and enforce primary law many traffic safety advocates assert that enactment of primary safety belt law sends message to motorists that belt use is an important safety issue that must be taken serious ly nhtsa points out that enforcement officers consistently preferred primary laws and that secondary laws were major deterrent to issuing citations15 many organizations including the governors highway safety associati on national transportation safety board and nhtsa support enactment of primary safety belt laws as expl ained in the next section there are some who are opposed to primary enforcement laws in specific and some who are opposed to belt laws in general national safety belt use rates have been increas ing from 58 in 1994 61 in 1996 69 in 1998 71 in 2000 73 in 2001 75 2002 to 79 in 2003 the highest rate since measurements began16 belt use is typically about 8 higher in states with primary safety belt law verage belt use rate of 83 based on 2003 national survey data than in state that enforces secondary law average belt use rate of 75 based on 2003 national survey data this difference can vary year to yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs5 17 nhtsa explains the difficulty of conver ting additional nonusers of belts to belt users as follows although use has increased about two percentage points per year in recent years nhtsa does not expect this tr end to continue since it would require converting greater percentage of nonusers each year that is as safety belt use rises each percentage point increase in use becomes increasingly more difficult to achieve thus conversion model is more appropriate than linear one for deriving projections it will even be difficult to maintain an 85 percent conversion rate for very long as hardcore nonusers comprise growing portion of the unconverted in each successive year for further information see httpwwwnhtsadotgovpeopleinjurysafetybeltopipt_finalrpt _07170 3html_ednref1 18 observers suggest that elements of strong safety belt use law could include primary law that pertains to all vehicle types covers all positions equipped with safety belt provides for significant penalties eg 50 or more to serve as deterrent for nonuse and specifies that personal injury awards are reduced for damages from crashes when safety belt was not worn 19 insurance institute for highway safety status report january 11 2003 23during the last few years convincing mo re and more people to wear their safety belts has often proven to be difficult challenge17 many people who previously did not regularly wear their safety belt now do so despite this challenge national safety belt use rates in recent years have increased gradually because of the combined impact of numerous interrelated and sometimes overlapping factors for example as previously noted 20 states are enforc ing primary belt laws state grant funds obtained from the federal highway trust f und discussed in later section have been used in most states to pay for high visibility enforcement efforts intended to increase belt use rates also many insura nce companies state dot agencies grass root community organizations as well as many employers and various health care groups are sponsoring diverse array of activities to increase the use of belts many experts suggest that to increase be lt use rates state should enact strong belt law followed up by periodic highly visible enforcement efforts underpinned by media events that let people know that ticke ts will be issued for failure to wear belt18 this strategy been used successfully in many states for example washington which has the highest statewide use rate 93 in 2002 and 95 in 2003 enforces primary belt law that resu lted in more than 1000 citati ons per month may through september 2002 and an 86 penalty pe r citation of failing to use belt19 as shown in table 1 using 2003 state survey data about 13 of the states have use rate above 80 about 13 have use rate between 70 and 80 and the rest are below mostly in the 6069 range most states with use rate above 80 have

people to determine attitudes and knowledge regarding occupant protection most of the surveyed public 87 support laws that require frontseat occupa nts to wear belts overall 61 of the people surveyed thought that law officers should be allowed to enforce primary belt laws20 but in general many people do not want law enforcement officers to have the authority to stop vehicle solely because an occupant of their car failed to wear safety belt some maintain that imposition of primary law would add to their concerns regarding government interferen ce or intrusion in their personal lives and their ability to make safetyoriented d ecisions for themselves some opponents of primary laws see such measures as maki ng government more intrusive and as means of dismantling an individuals free dom of choice so opponents of safety belt laws especially of primary belt laws maintain that when they are pulled over for belt violation they could be subject to an unwarranted search during traffic stops conducted as part of an enforcement campa ign intended to increase belt use rates police officers also have issued thousands of citations or arrests for offenses unrelated to safety belt usage there are some groups however that oppose safety belt ws in general although the national motorists association nma encourages seat belt use it does not support mandatory belt ws and the intrusiv and punitive policies they spawn21 they maintain that individua ls should retain the freedom and responsibility to make choices affecting their own safety and that of their families nma states at each stage of the evolution of mandatory seat belt laws we warned that this was an incremental process that would eventually lead to heavy handed enforcement practices and onerous penalties our predictions are proving correct22 also some critics of safety belt laws maintain that people should wear safety belt because it is their choice or it is co mmon sense to do so and not b ecause they are compelled to by law some view safety belt enforcement campaigns merely as revenue source the legal penalty for not wearing belt varies widely in many states there are penalty points assigned against someones driver license in most states the maximum penalty for first ffense ranges from 10 to 25 and in only few states is the penalty more than 50 spokesman for the libertarian party has questioned the diversion of police resources to stop harass ticket or arrest citizens who forget to wear safety belt23 some people assert that points issued against ones drivers license for not wearin g belt could lead to increased insurance rates and higher financial penalties imposed by the courts or enforcement agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs9 24 nhtsa the national initiative for increasing safety

the context of increasing enforcement of safety belt laws the issue of racial profiling or targeting is frequently raised some have expressed concern that safety belt enforcement campaigns could be

with this issue directly for exam ple nhtsa points out that in the click it or ticket campaign discussed below in tail efforts have been taken to ensure that segment of the population received unf air

various minorities to discuss these and other issues and gain their support for ongoing efforts to increase safe ty belt use rates nhtsa points out that the congressional black caucus states that increasing belt use among african americans is an urgent health priority that the national urban league supports primary belt laws and that aspira an organization promoting the leadership development of hispanic youth also supports primary belt legislation24 support for primary enforcement is comparatively greater among hispanics 72 and african americans 68 as compared to whites 5925 nhtsas

effectiveness of primary belt use laws developed estimates to demonstrate the ec onomic benefits to states of increasing safety belt use and encouraged vigorous enforcement of safety belt use laws27 in fact promoting increased safety belt use ranks the highest among this agencys priorities28 also nhtsa conducts research on various aspects of occupant protection evaluates the eff ectiveness of

state television nd radio advertising in the may 2003 campaign nhtsa purchased 8 million and states purchased 16 million of advertising to underpin enfor cement activities many ads warned the public

the major bills being considered in the 108th congress would increase the amount of funding available for the section 402 grant program this grant program which is used to advance many traffic safety

senate environmental and public works committee has stricken the administrations safetea proposal and has substituted its own reauthorization proposal in the bill now be ing considered by the senate as s 1072 s 1978 which has been reported out of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation srep t 108215 and hr 3550 the house transportation and infrastructure co mmittee proposal to large extent the administrations safetea proposal and the senate commerce committee bill are similar with respect to many provisions pertaining to occupant protection grants and therefore these are discussed together th house proposal is discussed in separate section34 the administrations safetea proposal s 1978 and hr 3550 would change the structure ie the eligibility criteria of the section 405 program and the amount of funding available administrations safetea proposal with respect to encouraging improved occupant protecti on the bush administration s safetea pr oposal would provide incentive funds to those states that adopt and enforce primary safety belt law for all passenger motor vehicles or attain belt use rate of 90 or better for the preceding fiscal year and secondarily th is proposal would pr ovide additional funds to those states that increase their safety belt use rate35 with respect to incentive funding provided to the states the bush administration proposal calls for twopart incentive primary safety belt use law grant s and safety belt use rate grants table 2 shows the proposed funding level for these two grant programs for fy2004 through

is proposing grant program with the first component identified as primary safety belt use law grants in table 2 that initially reserves most of th funds made available to courage states that did not have primary safety be lt law as of december 31 2002 to adopt and enforce such law36 under the primary safety belt law grants the administrations safetea also proposes to provide lesser amounts for states that already had primary law in effect prior to that date and this safetea proposal also authorizes second smaller grant program identified as safety belt use rate grants in table 2 to reward states based upon their achievement or annual progress in increas ing their safety belt use rate as specified in the administrations safetea proposal states could transfer safety funds among diverse programs administered by dot if they develop performancebased comprehensive strategic highway safety plans that identify their highest priority safety impr ovements thus specified percentage of funds up to 50 could be flexed between funds inte nded for infrastructure purposes and funds authorized for behavioral traffic safety grants including occupant protection measures the senate commerce sc ience and transportation committee bill discussed below also contains flex ing provision seve ral interest groups representing both behavioral and infrastruct ure concerns have requested congress to oppose this flexing37 s 1978 bill reported by senate commerce science and transportation committee this bill is the senate commerce committees contribution to senate legislation reauthorizing various federal surface transportation programs with respect to the financial assistance specifically provided to states to adopt primary safety belt laws achieve use rate of 90 or more or increase belt use rates this committees proposal is simila r and often identical in many respects to the administrations safetea proposal for example both of these proposals would establish new safety belt incentive grant program with two major components primary safety belt law grant and safety belt use rate grant that is described above but s 1978 diffe rs in two major aspects the eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs14 38 other provisions of the senate commerce committee bill that would likely affect federal support for efforts to increase belt use rates include increasing funds for the section 402 prog ram which authorizes funds for state and local governments to improve many di fferent aspects of their traffic safety programs including occ upant protection and increasing authorization for section 403 efforts which provides funds for nhtsas traffic safety activities including those to increase belt use rates criteria used to determine the allocation of funds specifically seeking to increase safety belt use rates safety belt use rate grants and the total funding level for the grant program pertaining to safety belts eligibility criteria for the sa fety belt use rate grants s 1978 states that qualifying state must achieve specified increases in safety belt use rates within specified period of time or by certain year in order to receive safety belt use rate grant for example state can qualify fo r funding if it increases its measured use rate by three percentage points above its average of the two previous years in contrast the administrations proposal would allow nhtsa through rulemaking to set the eligibility criteria for receiving funds under the safety belt use rate grant funding level as shown in table 3 funding amounts for the proposed primary safety belt use law grants for fy20042009 as reported by the senate commerce committee are the same as thos proposed in the administrations safetea proposal see table 2 but the amounts proposed by the commerce committee for the safety belt use rate grants are slightly less each year than those proposed by the bush administration the senate commerce committee bill s 1978 also requires the administrator of nhtsa to establish and administer program under which three high visibility traffic safety law enforcement campaigns would be carried out each year nationwide to increase belt use and to combat impaired driving the bill authorizes 24 million per year for fy2004 through fy2009 for advertising and educational initiatives to support the campaigns38 table 3

the section 405 program but would add sepa rate criterion under which state could qualify for funding na mely performancebased criterion more specifically hr 3550 would allow state to continue to qualify for funding if it meets four of the existing six criteria previously discussed and the bill also would allow states with safety belt use rate of 85 or greater as of the date of the grant to receive section 405 funds the bill would provide more funds specifically for occupant protection incentives than would either the adminis trations safetea pr oposal or the senate commerce bill for occupant protection grants the proposal would authorize 140 million in fy 2004 nd would increase that amount by 5 million per year through fy2009 the house committee propos also would authorize 10 million per year to support high visibility forcement program to improve occupant protection as well as to reduce impaired dr iving whereas as previously indicated the senate commerce bill would au thorize 24 million for that purpose other approaches several other bills to improve occupant protection have been introduced in the 108th congress these include s 1993 and s 1337 s 1993 proposes twoprong approach to encourage occupant protection measures the first approach is know as transfer pena lty the bill specifies that for fy2005 and each fiscal year thereafter 10 of the funds made available to state under the proposed highway safety improveme nt program hsip must be obligated for projects under section 402 unless by octobe r 1 of the fiscal ear that state has in effect primary safety belt law or demonstrates that its safety belt use rate is at least 90 percent39 also that bill includes penalty or sanction approach that threatens state with the loss of portion of its federal aid funds unless that state by october 1 2010 has in effect primary safety belt law or demonstrates that its safety belt use rate is at least 90 the deta ils of this proposal are presented below40

pr ogram intended to promote effective safety belt laws and increas safety belt use however this proposal was defeated during the markup session held on s 1978 by the senate commerce committee41 issues associated wi th reauthorization as part of the reauthorization process congress is considering several policy issues that pertain to safety belts these include how much money might be allocated to increase safety belt use rates or encourage states to adopt primary belt laws how might these grant programs be structured to maximize benefits what criteria must state meet in order to be eligible to receive these grants if state does not adopt and force primary safety belt law should it lose portion of its fe deral highway trust fund monies funding levels for fy2003 the last full year of funding under tea21 132 million wa s authorized to reward states for achieving certain levels of safety belt use or conducting certain activities or enforcing cer tain laws pertaining to occupant protection the proposal repor ted by the senate commerce committee and that offered by the administration w ould each authorize about 125 million during fy2004 nd slightly larger amounts through fy2009 see tables 2 and 3 to encourage the states to adopt primary safe ty belt laws or achie ve use rate of 90 or more or increase their safety belt use rates however under both bills it is not possible to determine the exact amount of funds that would be spent on occupant protection measures because as previously indicated both bills allow funds to be flexed for infrastructure purposes with respect to the house proposal there is flexing allowed so therefore it can be concluded that there would be more funds made available and used to promote occupant protection

on competition foreign commerce and infrastructure may 22 2003congress has heard from many state offici als and safety organizations seeking substantially increased funding for traffi c safety activities including funding to promote occupant protection given the di fficult budgetary constraints facing many states supplemental federal funds for tra ffic safety including funds for occupant protection take on increased importance some groups such as the governors highway safety association ghsa ar disappointed in the funding levels proposed in safetea as well as thos specified in the senate commerce committee bill for the behavioral safety traffic safety grant programs ghsa favors the higher amounts proposed by the house t i bill as k swanson representing ghsa stated with increased funding states could put more resources into enforcement of traffic safety laws particularly safety belt speed and impaired driving laws better enforcement would help deter viol ations of traffic laws funds could be used to enhance staffing levels and to purchase new enforcement technology better enforcement would help convince populations that are resistant to traditional safety messages such as the 25 percent of unbuckled drivers of the need for compliance42 in its recommendations to congress ghsa requested 175 million in yearly funding for occupant protection incentives this amount is considerably more than the amount proposed by the administration in safetea before any flexing and the amount in the bill reported by the senate commerce committee before any flexing as well as the amount proposed by the house co mmittee also advocates for auto and highway safety an alliance of consumer health and safety groups and insurance companies and agents testified in favor of additional funding for nhtsas programs including increased funds for the states to emphasize more enforcement of laws encouraging belt use43 as part of the reauthorization pro cess requests for additional funding to promote occupant protection ar being considered within the context of many other funding requests more specifically congress faces the difficult challenge of allocating limited funds that are likely to be set aside to ddress the behavioral aspects of traffic safety among many diverse challenges including increasing safety belt use rates reducing impaired driving enhancing the safety and mobility of older americans and providing sufficient funds to enhance driver licensing systems not only are funds allocated among such divers behavioral concerns but funds are also allocated to enhance other safety purposes eg to finance hazards elimination infrastructure barriers and guardrails and to promote safety at highwayrail grade crossings also there are tradeoffs between meeting various safety specific objectives and meeting other broader tran sportation needs that address primarilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs18 44 personal communication with dot spokesperson 2003 mobility and congestion concerns each competing for scarce resources from the federal highway trust fund structure of grants and eligibility criteria as previously indicated both the administrations safetea proposal and the bill reported by the senate commerce committee include provision that specifies that if state enacts and enforces primary safety belt law for all passenger motor vehicles after december 31 2002 or achieves use rate of 90 or more in the preceding fiscal year it receives onetime grant of fi ve times that states share of the section 402 funds for fy2003 states that already have adopted and enforced primary law prior to that date receive onetimes their fy2003 sec tion 402 allotment under both proposals any funds left over after bonuses to states w ith primary safety be lt laws or use rates of 90 or more have been pa id would be made available to all states based on their safety belt use rates such carryover funds would be adde d to the sums identified as safety belt use rate grants funds in tables 2 and 3 at least for the first two years of th grant program proposed by either bill safetea and senate commerce most of the funding would likely be used to reward states that either already had enacted primary safety belt laws or to reward states that have newly enacted primary sa fety belt use laws about 72 million of the 100 million that would be authorized would be used to pay states with primary enforcement laws in effect before the end of december 20 02 according to dot spokesman the balance of the 500 million proposed under the primary belt law grants would be available to states that dopt and enforce new primary laws after that date or achieve use rate of 90 or better in the preceding fiscal year in some states an incentive of five times its s ection 402 allotment as proposed in both safetea and the senate co mmerce bill might help c onvince some legislators to vote for primary belt law this might be especially true in state that was close to passing such bill even in the absence of federal incentive or in state with particularly difficult budget situation adversely affectin g transportation funds in fact dot spokesman has indi cated that an incentive of five times states section 402 allotment may be sufficient to convince several states to adopt and enforce primary safety belt use law44 nevertheless because the potential impacts of this incentive generally remain uncertain and would vary state to state it is not possible to predict with much accuracy how many dditional states would adopt primary belt law because of this proposed incentive the grant eligibility criteria proposed in both safetea and s 1978 would represent substantial change from the eligibility criteria now used for the occupant protection financial incentives secti on 157 and 405 funds authorized in tea21 under tea21 state receives grant funds unde r these sections based on use rates exclusively see section 157 incentive porti on of the grant program or enactment of certain occupant protection laws and performance of certain programs or activities see section 405 the eligibility criteria and grant struct ure of the administrations proposal as well as those included in s 1978 have rais ed the concerns of the ghsa and othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs19 45 httpwwwstatehighwaysafetyorghtmlmediapress_releases061103html 46 as specified by ghsa eighty percent of the funds would be av ailable for grants to states that meet either of the following criteria increase in safety belt usage rate above base rate or above national average the base rate would be determined by averaging belt use between 2000 and 2002 this would continue the criteria under the current 157 incentive grant program but update the years used for determining states base safety belt use rate or enact and enforce primary belt law states qualifying under the first criteria would receive grants equal to the cost savings to the federal government of we aring safety belts the same allocation method as the current 157 program all the remaining funds would be allocated to states that have enacted primary safety belt laws criteria two in order to implement this program nhtsa woul d determine how many states would quality under criteria one and how much each would receive any remaining funds would be awarded to states that quality under criteria two funds to primary belt states would be apportioned based on formula that is the same as the 402 formula if state enacts primary belt law and increases its belt use rate the state would receive funds under th criteria that yields the larger share of funding the remaining 20 of funds would be available as grants to noncomplying states although this association supports incentives to encourage states to enact primary belt laws ghsa is concerned about aspect s of both bills especially the provision that would reward states that enact primary belt law with grant of five times their basic highway safety allotment ghsa want s each state to be rewarded equally for passing that legislation45 instead of the approach recommended by the administration the ghsa proposes fina ncial incentive program to encourage increases in safety belt use rates similar to that included in the existing section 157 program or other incentives to enact primary belt law details of some of key aspects of the ghsa propos are presented below46 the house committee bill does not include provisions that would reward state with financial incentives if it only adopted and enforced primary safety belt law as previously indicated hr 3550 w ould allow state to continue to qualify for funding if it meets four of the six cr iteria now specified in section 405 but the bill also would allow states with safety belt use rate of 85 or greater as of the date of the grant to receive section 405 funds although the bill provides the states with an additional way to qualify for this grant it does not appear that this proposal would greatly increase the number of states receiving assistance over the number of states that now qualify for funding during fy2003 31 states qualified for ssistance under section 405 these same states would likely continue to qualify in fy2004 and later ears under the proposal unless the secretary determines that their occupant protection laws or enforcement and educational programs longer qualify fo r purposes of meeting the section 405 criteria which is rather likely also every state except one arizona that has safety belt use rate above 85 as m easured by the latest state survey data available already qualif ies for the section 405 program under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs20 47 for example 31 states also qualif ed for the section 403 program in fy2001 48 personal communication with nhtsa 2004 so in study conducted for the national safety council prepared by neil k chaudhary et it was concluded that failure to implement primary laws in all states resulted in more than 12000 lives were lost during the years 19952002 if the situation remains the same as in 2002 an estimated additional 1400 motorists will be killed next year alone 49 national conference of stat legislatures transpor tation series dec 20026existing tea21 criteria and would likely c ontinue to qualify for funding under the house proposal experience also shows th at the same states that qualify for the section 405 funding in one year do so the next unless eligibility criteria are changed47 furthermore all of the states that are close those with use rate of 80 or above to reaching the 85 performan cebased incentive criteria already qualify for section 405 funds on the other nd hr 3550 would provide greater amounts of funds directly to the qualifying states to support occupant protection enforcement and paid media activities than would be provided by the senate bill financial penalt or sanction as part of the bate over reauthorization some are considering legislation that would impose financial penalty sometimes called sanction against any state that is not enforcing primary safety belt law by specified date under such proposal eg s 1993 state would lose certain percentage of much of its highway trust fund monies if it did not adopt and enforce such law or achieve 90 or better use ra by specified date congress has used sanction approach in other areas of traffi c safety for example this approach has proven effective in convincin g all states to adopt national minimum drinking age laws and zero tolerance laws for drivers under 21 years of age and more recently in encouraging most of the states more than 40 to adopt and enforce 008 blood alcohol concentration bac vel standard for drunk driving supporters of sanction approach presen t many arguments in support of their position they quote nhtsas estimate that if all states adopted primary laws an additional 1400 lives now lost in traffi c crashes would be saved each year48 many of those supporting sanction approach note that even after many years of debate only 20 states have adopted pr imary belt laws furthermor they assert that many state legislatures are not inclined to dopt such measure without federal pressure in the form of financial pe nalty or sanction against that states federal aid highway apportionment they note that many st ate legislators are responding to their constituents objections to the prospect of traffic stop solely to enforce safety belt law as the national conference of state legislatures points out many bills establishing primary safety belt law die in state legislatures because of the perception that they will provide law enfo rcement officers the opportunity to stop and search vehicles under the guise of enforcing the seat belt law49 although advocates for highway and auto safety supports enactment of dots proposed incentive grant program encouraging primary laws safetea that association recommends mandatory sa nction of states federal aid highway funds after reasonable time period to ensure that each state passes such law by the end of the authorization period that or ganization asserts that financial incentives have been tried for years and that the funding redirection program proposed by

associationadministration will not be effective50 advocates for highway and auto safety also asserts that switching from secondary forcement law to primary enforcement law entails additional co sts or burdens and is th erefore not an unfunded mandate51 on the other hand some are opposed to the sanction approach for example the ghsa states that sanctions are heavyhanded onesizefitsall policy that are not suited to diverse state needs and problems52 some critics also note that sanctions or financ ial penalties will adversely affect funds needed for highway construction many state legi slators and highway safety officials maintain that each state should determine its own traffic safe ty laws without fe deral pressure ghsa states sanctions create tremendous amount of state resentment toward the federal government even if the sanctions are fo r good public policy purposes repeated use of penalties and sanctions do much to reinforce negative state attitudes toward safety issues exactly the opposite of what the federal government intends53 s m further observe that penalties threatened ag ainst the highway apportionment of state have not always worked because they ve been revoked befo re implemented in sum many state officials dont want the to be forced to enact primary belt laws because of federal law conclusion experience demonstrates that safety belt use law and concerted enforcement underpinned by effective pub lic educational ssages will convince more people to buckle up many assert that the united stat could continue to increase the national average belt use rate using this strategy some suggest that national safety belt use rate of 90 or better is r easonable and attainable goal they point out that several states and foreign countries already have reached this use rate on the other hand others assert that the setting of traffic safety goals should be up to the states some state advocates simply do not want the dot heavily influencing state safety matters thus there is disagreement on whether nd how occupant protection goals should be achieved and what the federal role should be despite this controversy support for at least continuing the current federal role in occupant protection nd probably for expanding it with additional incentives appears to be growing the progress made in the reauthorization process to date documents the support of many in the sena particularly am ong members of the commerce science and transportation committee for new financial incentiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32214crs22 grant aimed at encouraging all of the states to enact primary safety belt laws or achieve use rate of 90 or more and sec ondarily to increase belt use rates in the house particularly among members of the committee ther is support for continuing the section 405 eligibility criteria and allowing the states to also qualify for funding by incorporating perform ancebased eligibility criterion thus it appears likely that eligibility criteria and structure of reauthorized federal occupant protection grant program will change from the tea21 model in order to meet new policy goals it remains uncertain whether there is sufficient support to impose financial penalty or sanction against states apportionment of its federal aid highway funds for not adopting and enforcing primary sa fety belt law based on the results of similar penalty provisions now in curre nt federal law eg the 08 bac and minimum drinking age laws such an approach would likely accelerate the rate of enactment of primary safe ty belt laws on the ot her hand opponents of sanctions assert that such penalties adversely affect states rights delay highway projects and impose other costs on society that need to be balanced against potential benefits
