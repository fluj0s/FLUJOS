richard p cronin specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the capture and subsequent release of five japanese civilians in two different hostagetaking situations by islamic terrori st groups in iraq in april 2004 underscored the high stakes for both the japanese govern ment of prime minister junichiro koizumi and for the usled coaliti on except for the small comm unist and socialist parties japanese political leaders across the board supported koizumis ad amant stance against responding to the hostagetakers demands th at japan withdraw its contingent of some 550 troops that were deployed to samawah in southern ir aq in early 2004 while this show of resolve by japan has been welcom ed by the bush administration the longer term effect of the hostagetaking and the upsurge in anticoalition violence may reinforce the views of many in japan incl uding the main opposition party that agreeing to send japanese troops to iraq was mista ke number of japa nese commentators and political leaders have suggested that the g overnments main motive for sending troops was to strengthen usjapan alliance c ooperation in the face of perceived security threats from north korea and rising china not because of strong agreement with us policy in iraq from this perspective tokyos steadfastness could have positive influence on other coalition governments who may now be reconsidering their commitments while the withdrawal of japanese forces as many in japan are demanding could cause significant complica tions for the us effort in iraq and adversely affect broader us japan alliance relations this report will be updated as news events warrant crisis provoked by the hostage situation the april 8 2004 seizure of three japanese civilian volunteers

north koreas nuclear weapons program and ballistic miss iles as well as longer term c oncern about rising china has had major influence on how japan views its broader alliance relations with the united states and its own international role including its role in iraq the first indication of shift in japans security outlook was apparent in the koizumi governments unusually assertive support to the united states afte r the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington among its more important actions the koizumi government pushed controversial legi slation through the diet parliament that allowed japan to send small flotilla of the maritime selfdefense forces msdf into the indian ocean to provide fuel and water to u s and allied ships supporting ope rations in afghanistan this naval deployment wh ich was unprecedented since the end of world war ii marked new chapter in usjapan alliance cooperation7 japans vocal diplomatic support of us policy toward iraq

against iraq8 on december 9 2003 despite the devastating bombing of the italian police hea dquarters in nasiriyah in southern iraq few weeks earlier and the ambush killing of two japanese diplomats on december 1 the koizumi cabinet adopted basic plan for the deployment of up to 1100 japanese troops to iraq in late december 2003 and ear ly 2004 japan deployed its first contingents of some 550 troops

in his thinking10 in january 2004 after announcing that japanese troops would be sent to iraq koizumi told skeptical members of parliamentar committee that japan cannot ensue its peace and safety by itself and thats why it has an alliance with the united states denying that his government was abandoning japan s uncentered foreign policy koizumi argued that in the event of crisis involving japanese security t he will not deploy forces to fight with japan and prevent an invasion11 some american and japanese analysts also see japans increased support of us global and regiona l policies as carrying the implied expectation of reciprocity in the form of greater us recognition of japans interests and concerns rega rding the korean peninsula12 the most noteworthy aspect of japans logi stical support of us and allied warships operating in the indian ocean and its later depl oyment of noncombat troops to iraq is the extent that these actions stretched what previously had been regarded as clear constitutional constraints article 9 of japa ns usimposed postworld war ii nowar constitutionrenounces war and the right of be lligerence under longstanding finding by cabinet legal office the constitution allo ws japan to cooperate with the united states militarily for purposes of selfdefense but bars participation in collective defense involving third countries these constraint s have been viewed widely in japan as stretched to the limit by the deployment of ground troops to iraq especially because it could not rule out that the troops might co under fire by iraqi insurgents as consequence japans main po litical parties and according to polls as much as 65 of the public now agree that the time has come to consider revising the constitution regardless of their views on japans role in iraq koizumi has charged committee of the ldp with drafting suggested revisions by the end of 200513 japanese response and implications for japans future international role and us japan alliance cooperation despite the favorable outcome the hostage incidents have had significant impact on both the political and bureaucratic leader ship in japan and on public opinion the japanese public which genera lly did not favor sending tr oops to iraq nonetheless has appeared recently to be warming to japans larged international role in past hostage situations going back to the 1970s japanese policy often has appeared to be motivated primarily by the desire to save the lives of the hostages in this case however editorials press commentary and statements by government officials indicated awareness that the countrys international standi ng and the usjapan allian ce would be seriously damagedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816crs5 14 the most egregious example occurred in 1997 wh members of the japan red army faction radical leftist group in japan hijacked japan airlines jal plane in dacca bangladesh and demanded 6 million and the release of their members from japanese

some 88 of younger japanese supported this position15 nonetheless the deterioration of the security situation in iraq and the hostagetaking incidents appear generally to have undercut public and political support for the koizumis policy any further incidents of hostagetak ing or serious attacks on the sdf troops could seriously weaken prime minister koizumis threeparty coalition government in addition to criticism from the opposition mocratic party of japan dpj number of senior ldp politicians including former head of the japan defense agency also have expressed the view that it was mistake to agree to join the usled coalition16 for the bush administration faced with th worst fighting since the fall of bagdad in april 2003 and the withdrawal of for ces by spain honduras and the

alliance also despite sending replacement troops there are indications whether japan w ill carry out its original intention to send up to 1100 troops to iraq japans commitment to keeping its forces in iraq could also weaken if the koizumi government were to perceive that us policy towards north korea longer was in accord with japanese interests
