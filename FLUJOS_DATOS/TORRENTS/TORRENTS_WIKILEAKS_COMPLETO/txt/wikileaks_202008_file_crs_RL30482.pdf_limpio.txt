current state of school crime and safety across the nation and to periodically monitor and upda those indicators which they believe is required to ensure safer schools11 the indicators study draws information from variety of independent data sources wh ich include national representative sample surveys of students teachers and principa ls and complete array of data collected from federal

as well as affect bystanders and the adjacent community also the report found that in 2005 as in both 1999 and 2001 st udents were more lik ely to be afraid of being harmed at school than while away from school in 2005 as grade levels increased it was found that the percentage of students who reporte d fearing an attack at school or on the way to or from school declined29 the study revealed that feelings rega rding safety at sc hool depended on the racial andor ethnic group grade level nd school location of the students in 2005 larger percentages of black and hispanic st udents feared attack

stated that such outdated and limited data is misleading and creates false sense of security34 in november 2004 trump summarize d what he believed to be the situation with school violence nationwide by observing that federal statistics grossly underestimate the extent of sc hool crime and public perception tends to overstate it nobody knows exactly how ma ny school crimes occur or whether there is an upward or downward trend becau there is mandatory school crime reporting and tracking laws in the united states35 furthermore trump stated that unlike the federal bureau of inve stigations

as writing note or journal entry or they make threat in over half the incidents that were examined some type of signal was given while the rate of schoolassociat ed violent deaths events has decreased significantly during the study time period the number of multiplevictim events has increased more than 50 of all schoola ssociated violent death events occurred during transition times dur ing the school day either at the beginning or end of the day or during lunchtime homicide perpetrators were far more likely than homicide victimsto have expressed previous suicid behaviors or had history of criminal charges been gang member associated with highrisk peers or considered loner or used alcohol or drugs on weekly basis among students homicide pe rpetrators were twice as likely than homicide victims to have been bullied by peers the rate of schoolassociated viol ent deaths was over twice as high for male students50 researchers concluded and emphasized that such deaths remained rare events but occurred often enough to indicate pattern s and to identify possible risk factors therefore this information might assi st schools in responding to the problem centers for disease control and prevention 2001 reported study the cdc which has been involved in school associated violent deaths research in collaboration with ed and doj as mentioned above also collected data to assess whether the risk for such d eaths varied during the school year the case definition for schoolassociated violent deaths used in this study was the same one that was used in the 1996 study discussed above researchers analyzed monthly counts of schoolassociated homicides and suicides for seven school terms from september 1 1992 to june 30 1999 that occurred among middle junior and senior high school students in the nation for that seven year period 209 schoolrelated violent deaths occurred involving either homicide or suicide of student an average of 014 schoolrelated homicide incidents occurred each school day which translated to one homicide every seven school da ys homicide rates usually were highest near the beginning of the fall and spring semester s and then declined over the subsequent months an average of 003 suicide inci dents occurred each school day which was one suicide every 31 school days the overa ll suicide rates were higher during the spring semester than in the fall semester but did not vary significantly within semesters51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30482crs10 51 continued united states 19921999 mmwr weekly vol 50 31 aug 10 2001 pp 657660 at

disease control and preven tion school associat ed violent deaths updated 100606 at h ttp wwwcdcgovncipcsc hshootinghtmthe cdc researchers believe that thes findings could be useful for school personnel in planning and implementing school violence prevention programs they point out possible explanations for wh high schoolrelated homicide rates were highest at the beginning of each semester one suggested explanation is that conflicts that began either before or during the semester or holiday break might have escalated into deadly violen ce when students returned to school for the start of new semester another suggestion was that the beginning of new semester represented time of considerable change and stress for students when they have to adapt to new schedules teachers and classmates such stressors might contribute to violent behavior for these reasons they propose that schools should consider policies and programs that might ease student adju stment during the transitional periods the researchers warn that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution because incidents were identified from news media reports therefore any such event that was not reported in the ne ws media would not have been included in the study reports of suicides were of pa rticular concern because media coverage of such events might be limited or discourag ed if underreporting of suicides did occur the report states coverage probably did not vary by time of year and would not account for the higher rate obs erved during the spring semester52 source of

but those plans started collecting dust also he observed that staff members were named to task forces or committees but many of these programs are now inactive school administrators are under enormous

2001 the mean number of studentper petrated rampages increased from an average of 053 incidents per year to an average of 327 incidents per year65 although that increase might have skewed the publics perception about the safety of children and youth at school ccsvc noted that such occurren ces were not entirely new phenomena ccsvc investigated both lethal school vi olence which were incidents involving more than one victim their core operational definition for most of their work and school rampages which included cases in which more than one person was injured and there was significant potential for lethal violence as well as those in which people were actually killed66 the committee observed that the numbers of lethal school violence and school rampage incidents were very small and that the increase in such incidents in the 1990s might be explained in part by media reporting ccsvc believed that although such school rampages would have been newsworthy during the earlier period the medi might have been more sens itized to the sc hool shootings issue in the late 1990s and began covering them more diligently than previously ccsvc concluded that if this was the case then the increase might partly be explained as the result of more news accounts of such incidents rather than an increase in the basic rate of those events67 ccsvc collected data from an assemblage of

atypically adult ma committed suicide some experts believe that the pennsylva nia incident might have been case of copycat violence fostered by media attention69 james fox criminologist at northeastern university in boston stated that he believes the news media bear some responsibility for the copycat phenomena he remarked that this is especially the case when attackers personalities and grudg are exposed to highprofile public analysis as when two teenage attackers in the columbine attack were featured on the cover of news magazine wh ile most sympathize with the vic tims others empathize with the shooters its the publicity they get that turns the shooter into celebrity that spawns more of them70 another similarity between the colorado and pennsylvania shootings is that in both incidents girls were the targeted victims katherine s newman harvard urban studies professor and coauthor of the book rampage the social roots who has researched school shootings since the 1970s observed that the predominant pattern in school shootings of the past th ree decades is that girls are the victims though it is impossible to know whether gi rls were randomly victimized in those cases in every case in the us since the early 1970s we do note this pattern of girls being the majority of victims71 both the colorado and pennsylvania multiplevictim shootings occurred in rural settings newman reports that it is uncommon for such incidents to occur in urban areas revenge she observed can be particularly fertile in rural settings72 cheryl meyer wright state university psychology professor in dayton ohio has conducted research on school shooting similarities in rural and small towns she noted that its so often about revenge even if something happened 20 years ago it

communities students parents teachers and school officials could do to help prevent further violence in schools there are some things communities can do to improve school safety such as ensuring that every school has comprehensive crisis plan that every school involves students parents law enforcement and community groups in the development of its crisis plan and prev ention programs and trains educators in how to use the crisis plan and that school s ensure that every student is connected to responsible adult in the school or community you as student can help ensure that schools remain safe you can do that by reporting threats and criminal incidents speaking out agains t those who bully or harass others and serving as peer mentor to someone who needs helping hand whether student parent

rise but still near its recent peak in teenage use84 furthermore johnston noted that because most of the illegal drugs like lsd ecstasy cocaine and heroin have shown considerable declines in recent years while the misuse of prescriptiontype drugs has been growing the latter have become more important part of the countrys drug problem85 also he observed that marijuana is still the most widely used among all illicit drugs nd recently its use has gradually decreased among the class of prescrib ed psychotherapeutic drugs86 used for purposes other than medical regimen researchers found that amphetamines constituted the only drug in this class that had not shown recent increase in use among teens 87 new question was added to the study in 2006 regarding the use of overthe counter cough and

statistically significant amounts between 2003 and 2004 it was reported that over those two years there had been significant increases in the proportion of students wh perceived marijuana use as

declines however were much sma ller in 2004 and did not reach statistical significance although such decreases in ecstasy use occurred in all three grades100 in 2005 only 12th graders showed any further decline in ecstasy use101 in 2006 12th graders showed slight but insignificant increase in the annual prevalence of ecstasy use there was very little change however in the proportion of 8th or 10th graders saying that they used the drug102 the perception that there is great risk associated with experimenting with ecstasy johnston believed accounted for most of the turnaround in ecstasy use prior to 2006 since 2000 there has been an in creased disapproval of ecstasy use among teens that continued among 10th and 12th grade students in 2004 also fewer students in 2004 believed that the dr ug was readily available103 in 2006 however johnston noted that over the past one to three ears there had been reduction in the proportion of students who belie ved that using ecstasy was dangerous or who stated that they disapproved of using the drug johnston warned that this change could be setting the stage for resurgence in the use of this drug since use often moves with these beliefs and attitudes104 other illicit drug use in 2006 as previously mentioned resear chers found or very little decline at any grade level in the use of lsd hallu cinogens other than lsd cocaine powder

considerably since 2001110 johnston observed our cern about this drug is that new generation of young pe ople particularly the 8th graders do not see lsd as dangerous this leaves them vulnerable to possible new epidemic of use at some time in the future if easy availability returns111 in 2005 the 30day prevalence of crack cocaine use held steady for 8th and 12th graders and slightly declined for

cocaine was used once or twice or regularly but data indicated an increase in perceived risk if the drug was used occasionally115 the use of inhalants called huffing after long and continuous decline in all grade levels significantly increased among 8th graders in 2003 researchers believed that such use among 8th graders was likely because inhalant products such as glues aerosols butane paint thinner and nail polish remove r were inexpensive legal and easy to obtain in 2004 inhalant use among 8th graders continued to rise and for the first time in recent years also increased among 10th and 12th graders116 in 2005 there was further increase among 8th and 10th graders in such use but some further increase occurred among 12th graders researchers believed that the increase in use among 12th graders might reflect c ohort effect as mentioned above117 researchers noted that over the past four years the perceived dangers in using inhalants declined among both 8th and 10th graders johnston observed that this fact continues to suggest the need for greater attention to this class of drugs in media messages and inschool prevention programming118 in 2006 as previously stated researchers

that is more than five or more drinks in row at least once in the prior two weeks continued to slightly decline among all grade levels researchers noted however that over the past two year s there has been only modest decrease in binge drinking among 8th and 10th graders and decline among 12th graders there has been an increase among all grades in the perceived risk to health as result of binge drinking and an increase in disapproval of such behavior only 12th graders showed further decline in 30day prevalence of alcohol use in 2006 researchers believed th at this result suggested that the decline in such use might have ended for 8th and 10th graders but was continuing among the older youth for while longer as result of the cohort effect that is teens who were previously in lower grades who had entered the upper grad survey results showed that there were high prevalence rates among all teen s of being drunk at least once during the previous month despite those results the analysts noted that the data actually reflected proportional declines from r ecent peaks of drunkenness that occurred among the students in previous years but further improvement that is declines occurred in 2006123 flavored alcoholic beverages som etimes referred to as alcopops or malternatives used in the past 30 days were first measured in all grades in 2004 in 2006 the prevalence of such use declined to slightly lower levels among all students than in the previous survey the analysts reported that despite the fears of some the use of these types of alcoholic beverages did not app ear to be expanding among teens but rather appeared to have declined somewhat in teen use124 the perceived belief that alcohol is r eadily available if wanted has steadily declined among 8th graders that is they do not belie ve it is readily available since 1997 and declined slightly among 10th graders since 2001 among 12th graders however more than 90 believe that alcohol is readily av ailable belief

been the leaders in smoking trends among teens129 in addition although declines in smoking were noted among 10th and 12th graders researchers believed that those decreases would likely end in the near future in 2004 researchers cautione d that despite the decreases substantial numbers of teen smokers were evident 25 of 12th graders 16 of 10th graders and 9 of 8th graders reported having smoked 30 da ys prior to taking the survey130 one finding that analysts found to be encouraging was that in 2004 the proportion of current smokers had declined by lf from mid1990s peak levels among 8th and 10th graders and by onethird among 12th graders131 johnston cautioned in 2005 among the facts that we would like to share with young people who are thinking about taking up smoking are these in 2005 about half of all 10th and 12th graders said that they strongly dislike being ne ar people who are smoking and 75 percent to 80 percent of them say that they personally prefer to date nonsmokers it is clear that there is high social price to be paid for any teen becoming smoker today and thats all in addition to the serious costs in terms of ones eventual health and length of life nd of course the other fact they should know is that once the smoking habit is established most people find it terribly difficult to quit even though many teenage smokers say they expect to quit most fail to do so132 mtf

into 12th grade134 for 30day prevalence in smoking ll grades showed small continuing decline most notably data for m onthly smoking among teens were down substantially from the mid1990s when such smoking reached peak135 johnston noted that much fewer st udents in 2006 had ever tried smoking cigarettes than in 1996 when the peak in lifetime usage was atta ined he observed that the decline was expected to continue among 12th graders as the younger less tobaccoexperienced students move into the 12th grade136 researchers noted however that there appeared to be leveling off in the decline in cigarette smoking among teens in recent years they attributed this change to reduction in anti tobacco advertising campaigns that were widespread in the mid1990s after the tobacco settlement occurred between major tobacco companies and state attorneys general focusing on the hazards of sm oking and questionable practices of the tobacco industry the researchers believe d these campaigns probably contributed to less favorable attitudes toward smoking they conte nd however that since the tobacco settlement is now over and there ar fewer heated public debates regarding the problems with smoking or with the tobacco industry national antismoking ad campaigns have declined and the reduction in teen smoking has diminished137 over the past two years the proporti on of students who be lieved that smoking was dangerous johnston obser ved leveled off among 10th graders and has begun to drop among 8th graders he stated generally we have found perceived risk to be an important indicator of changes in future use of drug so this is not favorable development the good news is that disa pproval of cigarette smoking is still rising and is at very high levels among teens138 the analysts found however that the perceived risk of cigarette smoking among 8th and 10th graders is declining that is fewer of them believe that smoking is dangerous and the reductions in the percentages of such youth w ho smoke cigarette s have ended139 in 2000 because of concern about po ssible increase in use among teens of small flavored cigarettes imported from india called bidis the mtf study introduced new

the data ppeared to be little deceptive because boys accounted for nearly all smokeless tobacco use of which one in 9 males in 12th grade had used the product in 2006143 analysts believed that one important reason for the considerable declines in smokeless tobacco use by teens between 1995 and 2004 was that growing portion of such youth believed that using the product could be dangerous144 that belief showed slight turnaround in 2005 johnston noted that in 1995 teens began to get the message that using smokeless tobacco could cause mouth and throat cancer and were probably deterred from using such pr oducts he believed that new group of teens would also have to hear the same message if the rates in such use were to remain low145 mtf 2004 survey data indicated that using smokeless tobacco was perceived as great risk among 8th and 12th graders such perception declined among 10th graders but that 8th and 10th graders disapproved of its use the 12th graders were not asked the question rega rding whether they disapproved of the product146 johnston noted that rise in di sapproval often starts year after an increase in perceived risk is observed for drug which is what we saw here as well i think reasonable interpretation of the dynamic is that young people eventually become more disapproving of using drug after they have come to see its use as dangerous147 in 2006 the mtf survey data indicated that fewer 8th and 10th graders compared with the percentage of such students in 2005 believed that using smokeless tobacco regularly could be harmful to ones health while 12th graders believed that such use would be great risk to health furthermore the percentage of such teens who disapproved of using the product declined for 8th graders but remained steady for 10th graders
