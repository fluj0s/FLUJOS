the late 1980s extensive foreign bt and degraded natural resources in developing nations led to the creation of debtfornature initiatives that reduced debt obligations allowed for bt repayments in local currency as opposed to hard currency and generated funds for the envi ronment these initiatives called debtfor nature swaps typically involved restruct uring reducing or buying portion of developing countrys outstanding debt with percentage of proceeds in local currency being used to s upport conservation programs w ithin the debtor country most early transactions involved debt owed to commercial banks and were administered by nongovernmental conser vation organizations and referred to as threeparty swaps since 1987 threeparty tr ansactions have generated more than an estimated 117 million in local currency for cons ervation projects as result of the purchase of approximately 168 milli on in debt face value for 49 million other debtfornature initiatives invol ved official public debt and were administered by creditor governments directly with debtor governments termed bilateral swaps in the early 1990s the united states re structured and in one case sold debt equivalent to face value of nearly 1 billion owed by latin american countries these transactions were authorized by c ongress as part of the enterprise for the americas initiative eai which broadened the scope of debt swaps to include number of social goals nearly 178 milli on in local currency for environmental natural resource health pr otection and child developm ent projects within debtor countries was generated from these swaps the model for debtfornature initiatives outlined in the eai was expanded in the tropical forest conservation act tfca to include countries around the world with tr opical forests under this program debt can be restructured in eligible countries and funds generated from the transactions are used to support programs to conserve tropical forests within the debtor country since 1998 952 million has been used under the tfca to restructure loan agreements in 12 countries and near ly 1625 million in local currency will be generated in the next 1226 years for tropi cal forest conservation projects the tfca was authorized for appropria tions under p l 108323 until fy2007 the tfca is being considered for reauthor ization under hr 2185 and s 2020 in the 110th congress

debtor nations ecology new york times oct 4 1984 sec p 31debtfornature initiatives and the tropical forest conservation act status and implementation background information debtfornature initiatives were conceived to address the rapid loss of resources and biodiversity in developing countries that were heavily indebted to foreign creditors conservationists had noted that the pressure to pay off foreign debts in hard currency was leading to increased levels of natural resource exports ie timber cattle minerals and agricultu ral products at the expense of the environment in many cases indebted developi ng countries had difficulty meeting their hard currency debt obligations and defau lted reducing foreign debt and allowing for portions of it to be paid with local currency while increasing funds for the environment was thought to improve environm ental conditions in developi ng countries and had the advantage of relieving the debtor country s difficulties in procuring sufficient hard currency to pay off its debts1 money generated from debt fornature transactions has been used to fund variety of projects ranging from nationa l park protection in costa rica to supporting ecotourism in gh ana and conserving tropical forests in bangladesh since 1993 there has been declining tr end in the number of debtfornature transactions involving offi cial public and private funds accounting changes requiring new appropriations to support official public bt transactions in creditor countries such as the united states and higher price of commercial debt on secondary markets are two reasons sugge sted for the decline of debtfornature transactions while congress has periodically authorized us participation in three party debtfornature swaps and has s upported two bilatera l debtfornature initiatives appropriations to support these types of effort s have generally diminished over the years debtfornature initiatives and their mechanisms threeparty swaps threeparty debtfornature swaps i

debt and then renegotiates the debt obligation with the debtor country2 the debt is generally sold back to the debtor country for more than it was purchased for by the ngo yet less than what it was on the secondary market the proceeds gene rated from the renegotiated debt to be repaid in local currency are typically put into fund that often allocates grants to local environmental organizations for conservation projects see figure 1 in these cases the fund is administered by the cons ervation organization representatives from local environmental groups and the debtor government money to buy the

percentage of debt is reduced thereby minimizing the positive benefits of debt reduction in developing countries for example in some transactions under the tfca the interest paid for the debt is used for cons ervation projects while the principle of the debt remains supporters point out that while the percentage of debt reduced by debt fornature transactions is small conservati on funds generated for debtor countries are generally significant relative to what th country would have originally spent on conservation16 the relationship between bt reduction and lower resource extraction rates is controversial some analysts suggest that debt reduction has direct relationship to lower extraction rates of minerals or timber in developing countries with foreign debt17 advocates of debtfornature initiatives note that the united states has history of supporting debt reduction initiatives in developing countri and appropriating funds for environmental causes recent appropriations by the united states to support the heavily indebted poor count ries hipc initiative 22 usc 262p6 support the claim for reducing bt in developing countries18 hipc was created by international creditors the world bank nd imf to reduce debt of poor countries that have demonstrated social and economic policy reforms that enable fluid export revenues and capital inflows19 funds generated for the environment in developing countries are argued to improve local nvironmental conditions promote sustainable resource use and help to preserve gl obal biodiversity and ecosystem services advocates also suggest that debtfornatur transactions that generate funds to support tropical forest conservation are especially appropriate most tropical countries with high levels of total debt owed to the unite d states also have some of the largest areas of tropical forest cover for example brazil and peru have debts to the united states totaling over 1 billion eac h and have two of the largest areas of tropical forest

pattern however these countries may be ineligible for debtfornature transactions under the tfca due to political and economic eligibility requirements21 those who oppose debtfornature transactions often argue that they are not adequately enforced by debtor countries generate insufficient funds to improve environmental problems and may infringe on national sovereignty22 threeparty debt swaps have historically had weak enforcement mechanisms however bilateral debt swaps such as those conducted under th eai generally include safeguards and default provisions to protect the us government from losing funds national sovereignty became an issue in bolivia when conservation organization was reported to have obt ained title to forested lands there was public outcry and ensuing political crisis when the bolivian pe ople thought large pa rt of their country had been given to foreign organization consequently cons ervation organizations involved in recent threeparty swaps have generally refrained from directly buying land in debtor countries with c onservation funds earned from swaps decline of debtfor nature transactions the number of debtfornature transactions has declined in recent years perhaps due to accounting changes that require great er appropriations to fund debtfornature transactions with official public debt nd higher price of commercial debt on the secondary market see figure 3 before 1991 appropria tions were required for debt cancellations and the united stat cancelled between 11 and 12 billion in debt between 1988 and 1991 this changed with the federal credit reform act of 1990 2 usc 661a et seq this law re quires that the net present value npv to the united states of debts of foreign countries be used to report the cost of debt restructuring buybacks swaps and cancella tions to the us government the npv of the cash flow of the loan is calculated often giving consideration to projected default losses fees and inte rest subsidies therefore appropriated funds for these programs must be used to cover the interest fee longer coming to the united states in the case of funds set up under eai and tfca and the difference in the npv of the loan that may result from restructuring23 decline in threeparty commercial debtfornature swaps may also be due to the conclusion of brady plan operations by latin american countries the bradyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31286crs14 24 the world bank world debt tables 1996 washington dc 1996plan allowed for partial debt forgiveness with restructuring of the remaining debt into bonds that could be trad ed on the securities markets when this program was concluded the price of debt on the sec ondary market increased and financing leverage decreased making it difficult and less attractive for environmental organizations to acqui re debt for resale24 further debt relief for developing countries is available through other pr ograms that allow for relatively greater amounts of debt to be cancelled eg hipc these programs may be more desirable to developing countries with debt than debtfornature initiatives under the eai or tfca under the tfca there was an 18month period from 2004 to 2006 when transactions were made lastly the po litical and economic requirements needed to be eligible for debtfornature transactions make it difficult for several countries to participate in eai or
