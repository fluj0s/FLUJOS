nearly universal agreement with respect to the general purpose of the emoluments clause the delegates believed that express protection against possible corruption of members of the legislature from the lure of civil office was necessary specifically the delegates feared that election to congress would be seen merely as stepping stone to more lucrative public office and that members would use their legislative positions to create or increase the compensation of such offices in addition the delegates feared the growth of an overly powerfu l executive branch that could use the enticement of public office to influence members of the legislature the text of the clause itself represents compromise over an issue on which there was agreement that disqualification from office was the proper method of redress but disagreement with respect to the proper duration of the disqualification initially the prohibition was introduced as part of the virginia plan and would have rendered members of both houses ineligible to any office 1 see eg jeff mason and caren bohan obama names clinton gates to lead foreign policy washington post december 1 2008 p a1 abdon m pallasch obama taps lahood for

states except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of each branch during the term of service and for the space of unspecificied years after its expiration3 opposition arose to the proposal and an amendment was offered to limit the prohibition by excluding those offices that were created under the national government4 the amendment generated considerable debate with those like alexander hamilton5 who favored strong executive in suppor t while those fearful of too much power being allocated to the executive such as george mason6 opposed compromise was drafted by james madison who proposed that disqualification attach only in situations where an office was created or the compensation of an existing office was increased7 ultimately the matter was referred to the committee on detail who reported out the following language the members of each house shall be ineligible to and incapable of holding any office under the authority of the united states during the time for which they shall respectively be elected and the members of the senate shall be ineligible to and incapable of holding any such office for one year afterwards 8 limited debate followed the introduction of this language but the proposal was tabled pending further developments related to the distribution of power between the senate and the executive with respect to the appointment power9 when debate resumed new language had been drafted by the committee of eleven10 stating that the members of each house shall be ineligible to any civil office under the authority of the united states during the time for which they shall respectively be elected and person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office 11 by the time this draft was introduced it had been decided that the appointment power would be divided with the president having the authority to make appointments subject to the advice and consent of the senate the new language addressed two issues first by continuing the ban against the appointment of members of the legislature it addressed the issue of undue executive influence and second it introduced new provision namely prohibition against dual office holding 12 the debate focused largely on the incapacity language with amendments introduced to limit the effect of the clause on only those offices created during members respective term of office further compromise was sought with an amendment to the amendment urging that the incapacity ought at least to be extended to cases where salaries should be increased

were adopted by vote of five states in favor and four against with one state divided14 the resulting language as ratified by the states reads as follows senator or representative shall during th time for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the united states which shall have been created or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time and person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office 15 from these debates it may be fairly concluded that the consensus of the delegates was that it was necessary to enact some prohibition on the eligibility of members of congress for executive office to guard against the possibility of both office seeking and executive influence it is also clear that the compromise that was reached was based largely on fear that complete disqualification during term of office and for one year thereafter would materially affect not only the supply of able men available to assume executive positions but also the ability of the legislature to attract capable individuals to run for office moreover the debates provide strong indication that the prohibition ultimately agreed to was intended to be absolute as there is indication of contrary position the debates indicate that at minimum what was sought to be prevented was direct and blatant grant of legislative or executive favor although the final language in the constitution represents compromise to prevent total and permanent exclusion of worthy men from office it was clearly intended to prohibit the use of the appointment power by the executive to gain influence over the members of the legislature additional support for the position that executive infl uence in the form of offers for civil office would not be effective during the term of individual members is found in several postconvention documents including the federalist papers for example in federalist 55 madison sought to meet the argument that the proposed house of representatives had too few members to be entrusted with the great powers it was granted madison utilized the purpose of the emoluments clause in rebutting this contention as follows the members of the congress are rendered ineligib to any civil offices that may be created or of which the emoluments may be increased during the term of their election offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties and to suppose that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the people selected by the people themselves is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated and to substitute an indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy with which all reasoning must be in vain 16 alexander hamilton defending in federalist 76 the integrity of the senate in the nomination and confirmation process against speculation that undue influence would be brought upon it by the president relied in part upon the emoluments clause language hamilton wrote that 13 2 farrand supra note 3 at 490 14 id at 492 15 us const art 1 6 cl 2 16 the

flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices will see sufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the senate to rest satisfied not only that it will it be impracticable to the executive to corrupt or seduce majority of its members but that the necessity of its cooperation in the business of appointments will be considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate nor is the integrity of the senate the only reliance the constitution has provided some important guards against the danger of executive influence upon the legislative body it declares that senator or representative shall during the time for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the united states which shall have been created or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time and person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office 17 finally joseph story in his commentaries on the constitution of the united states described the purpose of the emoluments clause as to take away as far as possible any improper bias in the vote of the representative and to secure to the constituents some solemn pledge of his disinterestedness18 story however criticizes the prohibition on the grounds that it did not go far enough in restricting member from appointment to civil office during his term in the legislature according to story this left in full force every influence upon his mind if the period of his election is short or the duration of it is approaching its natural termination 19 thus if evasions of the clause are to take place they would have to take place after members term expired

jersey william paterson to be an associate justice of the united states supreme court governor paterson had been member of the senate when the law creating the position was adopted and although he had resigned from the senate to become governor of new jersey the term for which he had been elected to the senate would not have ended until march 4 1793 on february 28 1793 president washington notified the senate that it has since occurred that paterson was member of the senate when the law creating that office was passed and that the time for which he was elected is not yet expired i think it my duty therefore to declare that i deem the nomination to have been null by the constitution 21 17 the federalist 81 alexander hamilton at httpavalonlawyaleedu18th_centuryfed81asp 18 joseph story

appointment legislation was introduced in the senate that upon enactment would reduce the salary of the secretary of state to 8000 per annum records of the floor debate in the house of representatives include an unofficial opinion from assistant attorney general charles russell examining the question of the legislations compatibility with the emoluments clause30 the opinion notes that according to the commentaries on the constitution and the convention debates the sole purpose of the emoluments clause was to destroy the expectation representative or senator might have that he would enjoy the newly created office or the newly created emoluments 31 therefore the unofficial opinion concludes that because the proposed legislation would destroy any hope for greater emolument than was available at the commencement of his service in congress the appointment carrying an unimproved salary falls outside the purpose of the law and is not within the law32

president roosevelt nominated senator black to be an associate justice of the supreme court during senator blacks confirmation hearings it was argued that since retirement benefits for supreme court justices over 70 had recently been increased he was constitutionally barred by the emoluments clause from taking the post the senators supporters responded that he would not receive the increased

documents indicates th at the emoluments clause has traditionally been interpreted in two ways prior to the appointment of senator knox the dominant interpretation was strict textual basis reading of the clause and its requirements during the debate over the knox confirmation and throughout subsequent appointments that have required saxbe fix the preferred method of interpretation has centered around more functional purposebased approach this report will discuss each of these interpretations g22g142g161g157g158g138g149g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 textual analysis of the meaning or application of the emoluments clause should begin with close examination of the plain text of the provision where those words are clear unambiguous and not in conflict with any other provision of the document the search for meaning does not proceed further as the supreme court stated in lake country v rollins 58 the object of construction applied to the constitution is to give effect to the intent of the framers and of the people in adopting it this intent is to be found in the instrument itself and when the text of constitutional provision is not ambiguous the courts in giving construction thereto are not at liberty to s earch for its meaning beyond the instrument there is even stronger reason for adhering to this rule in the case of constitution than in that of statute since the later is passed by deliberative body of small numbers large portion of whose members are more or less conversant with the niceties of construction and discrimination and fuller opportunity exists for attention and revision of such character while constitutions although framed by conventions are yet created by the votes of the entire body of electors in state the most of whom are little disposed even if they were able to engage in such refinements the simplest and most obvious interpretation of constitution if in itself sensible is the most likely to be meant by the people in the adoption 59 plain text reading of the emoluments indicates th at ineligibility for appointment to civil office attaches to all members of congress during the remainder of their term if new office is created or if the compensation of an existing office increased during the term in which they are serving the text provides for exceptions to this rule indeed reference to the last clause of section 2 and person holding any office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office 60 lends further support to this construction taken in its entirety the article i section 6 reads as consistent unqualified prohibition against office holding under strictly specified circumstances when those circumstances are satisfied strict reading of the clause renders the person ineligible for the appointment early conflicts involving the emoluments clau support strong textual application as discussed above president washingtons withdrawal of justice patersons appointment

interpretation of the clauses text for example in ruling that the resignation of thengovernor kirkwood from the senate prior to the passage of legislation creating an office nevertheless does not cure the ineligibility attorney general benjamin harris brewster indicated that there was need to go further than the text of the emoluments clause62 according to attorney general brewster it is unnecessary to consider th question of the policy which occasioned this constitutional prohibition i must be controlled exclusively by the positive terms of the provision of the constitution the language is precise and clear and in my opinion disables him from receiving the appointment 63 similar textually based analysis was relied upon by acting attorney general holmes conrad when advising as to whether the fact that senator ransoms term had expired prior to his receipt of his commission and his assumption the office of ambassador to mexico absolved him of any conflict with the emoluments clause64 supporters of senator ransoms appointment argued that because the president did not actually sign the commission until after the senators term had expired there was conflict with the emoluments clause the acting attorney general disagreed referring directly to the text he noted that it must be observed that the language of the constitution is that senator shall during the term for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the united states 65 thus the relevant fact for emoluments clause analysis is not when the commission was signed by the president but rather when the appointment was made in the case of senator ransom because the appointment was made during his term as senator in which the emoluments of the office were increased he was according to the acting attorney general in eligible to serve as ambassador to mexico 66 textually based analyses have been used to preserve presidential appointments in the face of emoluments clause challenges as well in two instances after the enactment of the postal revenue and federal salary act of 1967 67 the member receiving the appointment in question has resigned from congress after emoluments increase has been announced but prior to it becoming law and taking effect in the first instance attorney general ramsey clark utilized strict reading of the text of the emoluments clause to argue that representative melvin laird was eligible to be appointed secretary of defense68 this interpretation prevailed despite the fact that continued since occurred that paterson was member of the senate when the law creating that office was passed and that the time for which he was elected is not yet expired i think it my duty therefore to declare that i deem the nomination to have been

while representative laird was still serving as member an increase in the salary for all cabinet members according to attorney general clark the constitutional language prohibits the appointment of legislator to an office the compensation of which shall have been increased prior to the making of such appointment the ban clearly does not apply to an increase in compensation which is proposed subsequent to the appointment69 given that congress still legally possessed the power to disapprove of the salary increases the mere fact of their proposal prior to appointment created constitutional concerns70 therefore the attorney general concluded that the emoluments clause is inapplicable where as here it is possible but not certain at the time of the appointment that proposed salary increase for the appointee may receive final approval at future date71 in similar situation after representative abner mikvas appointment to the federal bench the president announced that he was seeking an

an opinion determining that despite the fact that he was still member of congress when the salary increases were announced representative mikva was constitutionally eligible to receive the appointment72 the rationale provided by olc was that the plain language of the emoluments clause through the use of the phrasing shall have been increased requires the increase in emoluments to have occurred before the appointment 73 since representative mikvas appointment was made prior to the increase in salary either being announced by the president or actually taking effect he was not barred from accepting his appointment commentators have concurred with the textual reading employed by the attorney general and office of legal counsel in the laird and mikva cases but nevertheless point out that such reading of the clause leaves the door open for potential abuse74 the concern involves the fact that it is the appointment that is the disqualifying event despite the fact that plain reading of the clause suggests that the disability lasts for the duration of members elected term the gap in time between the announced salary increase and its effective date created by the postal revenue and federal salary act of 1967 has created situation where resignation from congress is possible to avoid an emoluments clause conflict specifically the commentators point to the appointment of representative james f battin to be us district court judge as an example 75 because representative battins appointment preceded the effective date of the salary increase he was able to resign from congress receive his commission and take office all prior to the salary increase taking effect thus the emoluments clause was never applied to representative battin because he was appointed before the disqualifying salary increase occurred had the salary increase taken effect prior to his appointment resignation would not have cured representative 69 id 70 idstating that the salaries in question

kirkwood discussed above leads to an apparent conflict over the effect of resignation on members ineligibility76 in that situation governor kirkwood had resigned from the senate prior to the passage of the law which created the office for which he was then appointed because the creation of the office occurred during the term for which governor kirkwood was elected to the senate his resignation was of moment and he was held to be ineligible to have received his appointment77 resolution has ever been sought to these conflicting results this appears to be largely because after the questions raised by the mikva appointment the president and congress have sought to avoid the application of the emoluments clause adopting more flexible approach to its interpretation which has led to the enactment of legislation designed to cure any ineligibility

one commentator the socalled saxbe fix is legislation whereby congress purports to remove the disability of member for appointment to federal office by reducing the emoluments of the office to the level the office commanded at the time the prospective nominees term in congress began 78 although named for its 1973 recipient senator william saxbe the notion that congress could cure an emoluments clausebased ineligibility by legislation was first employed in 1909 with the appointment of philander knox to be secretary of state79 the rationale for such legislative solution is based on focusing the analysis on the word increased in the clause itself as the unofficial opinion from the assistant attorney general in the knox situation stated the sole purpose of the emoluments clause was to destroy the expectation representative or senator might have that he would enjoy the newly created office or the newly created emoluments 80 thus if ineligibility is triggered by increases in emoluments then it stands to reason that subsequently reducing the emoluments thereby removing any benefit that the member might receive by assuming the office resolves the issue such focus on the purpose of the clause as opposed to its text was the basis for the opinions expressed by president nixons department of justice regarding the appointment of senator saxbe to be attorney general according to statements made to the senate by acting attorney general robert bork the senate traditionally did not consider member of congress to be disqualified from federal office unless the emoluments of that office were higher at the time of appointment than they were at the start of the members term of office 81 according to acting attorney general bork the purpose of the constitutional provision is clearly met if the salary of an office is lowered after having been raised during the senators or representatives term of office82 additional arguments made on behalf of the saxbe fix focused on the elimination of 76 see supra notes 56 and accompanying text 77 see 17 p atty gen 365 1882 78 oconnor supra note 16 at 122 citing to reduce the compensati on of the office

attorney general robert g dixon jr because the administration was pushing for all of the benefits to be removed prior to senator saxbe assuming office it could not use the increased salary as basis for attempting to influence or corrupt senator saxbes vote83 moreover assistant attorney general dixon argued that failure to permit the legislation to pass would itself be violation of one of the emolument clauses purposes as it would result in the disqualification of otherwise qualified member of congress to serve in civil office 84 duke university professor of law william van alstyne has argued that the only way to fully effectuate the meaning of the emoluments clause is to abandon literal reading of the text in favor of an interpretation based solely on the clauses purpose and intent specifically professor van alstyne asserts that the purpose of the clause was to prevent any improperly motivated executivelegislative collaboration that would result in spoils system 85 read literally however the clause does not prevent such system fro m being created by collusion between the two branches one way for the scheme to work would be for congress and executive to conspire to permit an appointment of member of congress and then after the appointment provide for lucrative emoluments increase86 the only way according to professor van alstyne to remedy this concern is to permit the person to retain the office but not retain any of the spoils of post appointment increases in emoluments87 the saxbe fix achieves this goal as it not only prevented senator saxbe from taking advantage of any increase in emoluments that were in effect prior to his appointment but it prevented him from benefiting from any postappointment increases as well until his term as senator would have expired88 it appears that the saxbe fix has not always been regarded as remedy to an ineligibility caused by the emoluments clause as evidence commentators point to the events that preceded the appointment of thenjudge robert bork to fill the seat vacated when associate justice louis f powell jr retired from the supreme court in 1987 89 according to the commentators prior to judge borks nomination senator orrin hatch was seriously considered to fill the vacancy however he faced an emoluments clause conflict because the salaries of the associate justices had been increased during the senators current term90 as part of the vetting process president reagans office of legal counsel apparently re ndered an opinion that concluded the saxbe fix could not erase that fact that the salary of asso ciate justices had been increased during senator hatchs term making him ineligible for appointment until his term ended in 198991 the opinion has never been made public and as recounted by one

the request however the department of justice did indicate that such document exists93 court has ruled on the constitutional effect that saxbe fix may have on an appointment or confirmation however most of legal literature appears to take the position that the such legislation does not cure the ineligibility94 the primary basis for such arguments is that the meaning of the clauses text is clear and thus should be respected and applied literally phrased another way in this view the clause does not permit congress to create an exception to the ineligibility created by an increase in the emoluments of civil office during members term note that none of these arguments suggest that the legislation itself is unconstitutional rather they question the effect that its passage has on the constitutional eligibility of the appointment congress clearly has the constitutional authority pursuant to the appropriations clause 95 to amend or adjust the salaries of government employees for any reason it desires96 the constitutional question that the courts have yet to resolve is whether such an action by congress cures the apparent defect in the appointment created by the emoluments clause

judicial power to cases and controversies107 thus it has been said that the law of article iii standing is built on single basic idea the idea of separation of powers108 according to the supreme court to satisfy the constitutional standing requirements of article iii plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief109 in addition to the constitutional questions posed by the doctrine of standing federal courts have also adhered to well developed set of prudential principles that are relevant to standing inquiry110 similar to the constitutional requirements these judicially selfimposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction are founded in concern about the proper and properly limited role of the courts in democratic society111 however unlike their constitutional counterparts prudential standing requirements can be modified or abrogated by congress112 the prudential components of the doctrine of standing require that 1 plaintiff assert his own legal rights and interests rather than those of third parties 2 plaintiffs complaint be encompassed by the zone of interests protected or regulated by the constitutional or statutory guarantee at issue and 3 courts decline to adjudicate abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances pervasively

years and therefore as applied to him it was not an increased emolument motion was filed in the united states supreme court requesting that cause be shown as to why the appointment was not violation of the emoluments clause the court in per curiam opinion dismissed stating that the plaintiffs interest was insufficient as all they could demonstrate was that they were citizens and members of the supreme court bar 115 the court noted that continued house of representatives 525 us at 32829 107 us const art iii 2 stating that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising

individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining direct injury as the result of that action and it is not sufficient that he has merely general interest common to all members of the public 116 the second case mcclure v carter 117 involved the appointment of representative abner mikva to seat on the united states court of appeals fo r the district of columbia circuit dc circuit pursuant to the postal revenue and federal salary act of 1967 president carter notified congress of salary schedule change that included pay raise for all federal judges118 according to the terms of the act the pay raise was scheduled to take effect on october 1 1979 unless congress disapproved of the increase by joint resolution 119 on september 26 1979 prior to the raise taking effect judge mikva was confirmed resigned from the house and commissioned120 senator mcclure who opposed the nomination on the senate floor on the grounds that it violated the emoluments clause proposed jurisdictional statute that permitted challenges regarding judicial appointments to the dc circuit during the 96th congress to be heard in federal district court by special three judge panel121 the threejudge district court that heard the case ruled that senator mcclure despite the jurisdictional statute adopted by congress did not have article iii standing to challenge the appointment and confirmation of judge mikva the court first addressed senator mcclures standing without reference to the jurisdictional statute and concluded that the senator lacked sufficient personalized stake in the outcome and therefore united states senator suing in either his individual capacity or his official capacity as senator lacks standing to challenge the validity of the appointment of federal judge 122 next the court considered what effect if any the jurisdictional statute adopted by congress had on senator mcclures standing according to the court senator mcclure even with aid of the special jurisdictional statute on which he seeks to rely does not have standing to bring this suit the statute under which senator mcclure brings this suit casts members of congress in the role of special attorneys general to plead before this court for second opinion as to whether their judgments were right in voting for or against the confirmation of judge mikva under the constitution it was the duty of congress itself in the first instance to determine judge mikvas qualifications both on the merits and on the issue of whether he was constitutionally eligible to serve as judge to allow members of congress to change hats as it were to plead the unconstitutionality of their own acts before this court on the basis of an argument already debated in the senate but lost there by vote would we suggest set dangerous precedent 123 it should be noted that although there are tw cases challenging appointments on emoluments clause grounds neither was brought against appointments to positions in the executive branch rather both cases involved appointments to the judiciary thus it may be possible to distinguish these cases from the potential current situation depending on the specific circumstances it may 116 id citing tyler v judges 179 us 405 406 southern ry co v king 217 us 524 534 newman v

analysis for example should member be appointed and confirmed as cabinet secretary challenge could arise if the secretary takes an action that adversely affects the rights of an individual citizen one example might be the denial of passport export license or other international travelrelated document issued by the department of state thus under those circumstances it may be possible for an individual or company to satisfy the supreme courts test article iii standing analysis what appears more certain however is that members of congress who either vote against saxbe fix legislation or vote not to confir m individuals on emolumen ts clause grounds would not have standing to challenge the appointments in court in addition to the mcclure decision which appears to foreclose member standing with respect to the emoluments clause in 1997 the supreme court decided raines v byrd 124 which presented constitutional challenge to the line item veto act125 the court in an opinion by chief justice rehnquist held that plaintiffs all of whom were members of congress who had voted against the act lacked standing because their complaint did not establish that they had suffered an injury that was personal particularized and concrete126 the majority distinguished between personal injury to private right and an institutional or official injury127 holding that congressional plaintiff may have standing in suit against the executive if it is alleged that the plaintiffs have suffered either personal injury eg loss of members seat or an institutional one128 that is not abstract and widely dispersed but rather amounts to vote nullification129 as result it appears that congressional plaintiff is more likely to succeed in establishing standing where there is an allegation of particular injury as opposed to an injury related to either generalized grievance about the conduct of government or an injury amounting to claim of diminished effectiveness as legislator130 while the court in 124 521 us 811 1997 125 line item veto act pl 104130 692a1 110 stat 1200 1996 126 raines 521 us at 81820 although the holding was based on the courts finding that plaintiffs did not satisfy the first standing requirement personal injury the court quest ioned whether the plaintiffs could meet the second standing requirement that the injury be fairly traceable to unlawfu l conduct by the defendants since the alleged cause of plaintiffs injury is not the executive branch defendants exercise of legislative power but the actions of their own colleagues in congress in passing the act id at 830 n11 127 justice souters concurring opinion seemed to attach less importance than the majority to the distinction between personal and official injury but he nevertheless agreed w ith the majority that the plaintiffs lacked standing see id at 831 justice breyer however dissented arguing that there is absolute constitutiona l distinction between cases involving personal harm and those involving an official harm and would have granted standing see id at 841 843 unlike the majority which viewed injury to legislators voting power as an official injury justice stevens in his dissenting opinion asserted that legislator has personal interest in the ability to vote and stated that deprivation of the right to vote would be sufficient injury to establish standing see id at 837 n2 128 see chenoweth v clinton 997 f supp 36 3839 ddc 1998 affd 181 f3d 112 dccir 1999 holding that personal injury claims are more likely to result in grant of standing but mere institutional injury is sufficient under raines see also planned parenthood v ehlmann 137 f3d 573 57778 8th cir 1998addressing the standing of state legislators 129 in 1939 the court had held that kansas state legislators had standing to bring suit against state officials to recognize that the legislature had not ratified proposed amendment to the united states constitution see coleman v miller 307 us 433 1939 the plaintiffs in coleman included twenty state senators whose votes against the measure would have been sufficient to defeat it but whose votes were ssentially nullified by the tieb reaking vote of the states lieutenant governor the presiding officer of the senate in favor of ratification in raines the court distinguished the injury alleged by the plaintiffs from the injury asserted in coleman and therefore found it unn ecessary to decide whether coleman might also be distinguished on other grounds see raines 521 us at 826 therefore raines did not address the question of whether coleman would warrant granting standing in suit by federal legislators even though such an action raises separation of powers concerns not present in coleman see id at 824 n8 130 see raines

based on personal injury to private right it nevertheless concluded that an injury to legislators voting power is an official injury131 furthermore it appears that the limits on member standing established in raines would likely preclude member from obtaining standing in suit to challenge an act of congress such as saxbe fix 132 because of the availability of legislative remedies including but not limited to the repeal or amendment of the act in question133 which would prevent court from finding vote nullification in addition raines appears to greatly restrict standing to challenge executive action although there may be better opportunity to achieve standing in this setting134 even in cases where plaintiff member can show the nullification of vote by the executive and thus establish an institutional injury135 decisions of the dc circuit that have followed raines have attempted to clarify both the meaning of nullification as well as the status of pre raines circuit rulings regarding the meaning of the term nullification the dc circuit concluded in campbell v clinton that the availability of legislative remedy precludes any finding of nullification136 with respect to the status of its pre raines rulings majority of the court of appeals in chenoweth v clinton believed that the courts decision in raines has limited but not overruled its precedent137

part of the senior executive service ses and are set directly by executive order not fixed by statute140 nevertheless pursuant to statute members of the ses are entitled to annual pay adjustments141 given the manner in which the pay for cabinet officials is determined there is an argument that the increase in salary was not subject to vote in congress and was not increased with any involvement directly or indirectly by sitting member of congress applying the less textuallybased interpretations that have guided the congress with respect to the saxbe fix it would seem possible to argue that because the annual pay increases are automatic and based on law passed well before the 110 th congress the purpose of the emoluments clause is not violated the treatment of annual pay adjustments with re spect to other parts of the constitution would also appear to be relevant to discussion of their constitutional implications specifically annual pay adjustments and their effect on the 27th amendment provide potential analogous situation the 27 th amendment commonly referred to as the madison amendment142 which was not ratified until may of 1992 provides that law varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives shall take effect until an election of representatives shall have intervened143 according to the amendments author its purpose was to ensure that congressional pay increase cannot be for the particular benefit of those who are concerned with determining the value of the service144 thus the amendment does not prohibit the passage of laws that adjust congressional pay but instead governs the implementation of such laws by requiring that they not take effect until after the next election of members of the house to date there appear to have been only two cases addressing the specifics of the 27th amendment in the first boehner v anderson 28 members of congress 108 defeated congressional candidates and others challenged provisions of the ethics reform act of 1989 era145 including the annual pay provision as violating the 27th amendment146 the federal district court for the district of columbia held that the era in providing methodology for automatic annual adjustments to congressional salaries meets both the language and the spirit of the 27th amendment147 in addition the court found that any pay raises stemming from the act satisfy the terms of the amendment148 furthermore the district court questioned whether the constitutionallyrequired delay mandated by the 27th amendment was applicable to the era which was enacted more than two years before the amendment was ratified149 specifically with respect to the annual pay provision the court held that the era complied with the text of the 139 consolidated

intervened between the enactment of the law in november 1989 and the effective date of the first annual pay adjustment pursuant to the law january 1991150 finally the court held that each annual pay adjustment becomes effective by the terms of the 1989 act and is not law subject to the requirements of the 27th amendment151 the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed holding that because the annual pay adjustmentprovision took effect after the 1990 election of representatives it did not violate the twentyseventh amendment 152 several years later in schaeffer v clinton 153 district court for the district of colorado dismissed lawsuit similar to boehner in that it also alleged that annual pay adjustments granted under the era are subject to the 27th amendment and therefore unconstitutional the district court adopted the reasoning of the boehner court with respect to the merits stating that adjustments to congressional salaries under the ethics reform act are not discretionary acts of congress the adjustments are calculations performed by nonlegislative administrative staff following specific formula provided by congress in the act members of congress do not participate in the calculation of pay increases in removing members of congress from the pay adjustment process the ethics reform act accomplishes the goal of the founding fathers manifested in the twentyseventh amendment the act eliminates the possibility that congress will grant itself new pay raise during its current session 154 the court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed the district courts decision to dismiss not on the merits but rather on the ground that plaintiffs lacked the constitutionally required standing to bring the suit155 using this same rationale namely that automatic annual pay adjustments are nonlegislative administrative increases following preexisting formula it appears possible to argue that they do not present the same threat that the drafters of the emoluments clause feared vote is taken in congress and therefore corruption or collusion with the executive branch is possible moreover the argument could be made that because the system of automatic annual pay adjustments was adopted prior to the 110th congress it is violation of the clauses compromise to hold present members ineligible based on system they did not vote to establish much less vote to implement in other words to hold mbers ineligible for mere annual pay increases to other offices in the government acts as the very type of permanent disqualification that the drafters of the emoluments clause so famously compromised to avoid156 conversely committed textual interpretation of the emoluments clause would lead to the argument that the plain language of the provision does not distinguish between legislatively 150 see id at 142 151 id at 143 152 bohener 30 f3d at 163 see also id at 162 153 54 f supp 2d 1014 dcol 1999 affd on other grounds 240 f3d 878 10th
