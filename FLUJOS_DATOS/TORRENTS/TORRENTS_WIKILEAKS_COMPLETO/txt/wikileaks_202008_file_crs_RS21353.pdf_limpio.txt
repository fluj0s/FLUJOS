collectively formulated and promoted by leading african heads of state it was endor sed and adopted in mid2001 by the organization of african unity oau founded in 1963 during the decolonization era and later also endorsed by the african ion which in july 2002 superseded the oau1 nepad seeks to reduce poverty and increase economic growth across africa in part by improving the policymaking and implementation capacities of african states it has won the support of many african leaders and re gional intergovernmental organizations and has been generally wellreceived by leaders of international multilate ral organizations and the group of eight g8 nepad is base d on policy blueprint the new african initiative nai which merged several earlier continental economic development planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21353crs2 objectives nepad seeks to spur economic growth and improve socioeconomic development across africa by increasing capital flows to africa in the form of private sector investment development assistance debt relief and broadened market access for african exports key nepad aim is improving the institutional regulatory and planning capabilities of african states to allow them to achieve gains both as individual entities and as economically integrated sub regional groupings nepad seeks to increase democratic decision making transparency and accountability in governance improve economic policymaking and public sector management and increase investments in infrastructure other goals include expanding access to social services and education eradicating poverty and promoting p eace security and human rights sectoral investment targets include agriculture energy nvironment physical and communications infrastructure and institutional efforts to increase economic diversification and trade economic integration nepad endeavors both to strengthen linkages among african countries and to deepen nd accelerate africas economic and political integration with other world regions key aim is to ensure that africa surmounts what one nepad text asserts is the significant degree of africas marginalization in the face of increasingly interconnected global trade and markets at the same time nepad seeks to buffer africa from the perceived negative ffects of globalizati on on public health local industries the envir onment and public safety some nepad critics assert that increased african economic integration with global markets may yield significant unanticipated pr oblems such as increased external pressure to adhere to trade rules and regulatory fra meworks defined by market forces and policy makers outside of africa some critics fear that rates of natural resource extraction in africa possibly accompanied by increased rates of environmental degradation may grow they also argue that as greater integration takes place africas rela tive lack of industrial capacity will prevent it from taking adva ntage of potential earnings opportunities generated by valueadded s econdary processing of expor t commodities which typically takes place in importing countries critics also maintain that weak prices for many key african exports may make it vulnerable to exploitation by powerful global economic actors while global labor markets may drain africa of much of its educated work force governance and reform nepad aims at promoting good governance democratization and public sect or reforms as primary means of attracting greater foreign investment political support and aid flows to africa the main nepad document posits these ends as necessary prerequisites fo r socioeconomic policy success longterm political stability and social justice it ca lls for marketoriented economic and governance reforms that substantially mirror those advocated by multilateral lenders and western donor governments nepad requires however that these policies be implemented and monitored by african states themselves not by foreign actors new nepad institution the african peer review mech anism aprm discussed below has been described as primary means of imp lementing nepads governance goals organizational stru cture and

and specialized functional agencies particularly as regards cr ossborder initiatives few refe rences to specific amounts required for the financing of nepad goals or sectorfocused projects appear within nepad texts the primary nepad policy document however anticipates that to achieve the goal of reducing by half the proportion of africans living in poverty by the year 2015 africa needs to fill an annual res ource gap of 12 of its gdp or 64 billion it also calls for an annual 10 billion increase in funding for public health3 meeting such goals it asserts will require increased domestic savings and improvements in the public revenue collection systems it also states that the bulk of the needed resources will have to be obtained from outside the continent in the form of debt reduction and overseas development assistan ce oda as complementary ex ternal resources required in the short to medium term private cap ital flows are described by the document as longerterm concern some analysts have criticized the lack of specific cost projections and the general nature of many statements in the document asserting that it contains few measurable explicit benchmar ks by which to judge the success of its implementation current issues defining the goals of nepad the nepad implementation committee was enlarged in july 2002 in part to broaden and diversify the base of support for nepad and to accommodate leaders who had not played key roles in its formation key figure in this regard was libyan leader muammar alqadhafi he has long advocated greater african integration but has also emphasized need for broad afri can political autonomyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21353crs4 4 ranjeni munusamy mbekis african plan under fire june 16 2002 sunday times pretoria 5 dave clark african

these sentiments efforts to bridge the differe nces between alqadha fi and advocates of nepad in particular president mbeki of south africa appear to have been successful albeit broadly in favor of the south african agenda libya has indicated its acceptance of nepad and the aprm and has joined the nepad implementation committee some commentators view nepad as statecentric elitegenerated framework created with little input from political opposition parties or civil society although many civic activists see much hope in nepad some warn that nepad may fail without greater public engagement in its implement ation criticism publicly recognized by leading nepad architects such as president mbeki african peer review mechanism under the aprm signatory states will monitor one anothers adherence to the co llective economic and corporate governance goals codes and standard s contained in the nepad declaration on democracy political economic and corporate governance aprm participation is voluntary and african leaders emphasize that it will function by providing positive incentive structure for longterm incremental po litical reform and regime transformation they stress that the aprm is not intended as punitive instrument or as mechanism through which aprm member states would c ondemn or sanction their peers despite such assurances some nepad critics believe that implementation of the aprm will eventually cause nepad to become subject to donor demands for externally defined economic and political reforms imposed as conditions on ai d the effectiveness nd intent of the aprm was questioned by many obser vers after south african president thabo mbeki made statements that appeared to fundamentally redefine the purpose nd scope of the aprm he reportedly suggested that the aprm would assess states economic performance but not their governance or human rights records his remarks were seen by some observers as having the potential to significantly undermine donor support for nepad however march 2003 nepad document the african peer review mechanism organization and processes which lays out an aprm organizati onal and procedural structure makes specific reference to aprm assessments on matters relating to human rights democracy and political governance which will be conduc ted by range of specialized au organs5 the aprm will become

for nepad and indicat ed that they may provide assistance for it the broad thrust of nepad but not exp licitly the 64 billion in increased capital flows that nepad envisions as deriving mainly from outside the continent was endorsed in principle by the g8 group summit in kana naskis canada in june 2002 in their g8 africa action plan which contains range of tailed but nonbinding commitments to africa that largely mirror nepad goals g8 heads of state declared that they would establish enhanced partnerships with af rican countries whose performance reflects the nepad commitments on the basis of measured results this will lead us to focus our efforts on countries that demons trate political and financial commitment to good governance and the rule of law investing in their people and pursuing policies that spur economic growth and alleviate poverty we w ill match their commitment with commitment on our own part to promote peace and security in africa to boost expertise and capacity to courage trade and direct growthoriented investment and to provide more effectiv official development assistance while recognizing that the prime responsibility fo r africas future lies with africa itself some analysts see prospects of exponen tially increased capital flows to africa as unrealistic and interpret the 64 billion figure as bargaining target not set nepad requirement such views are reflected in g8 kananaskis summit statem ent entitled building new partnership for africas development new partnership which qualifies the g8 response to nepad it states the g8 africa action plan is political response to political initiative it is not pledging document g8 leaders nonetheless recognized that additional resources are needed to help give effect to the nepad in the action plan they indicated that half of the new overseas development assistan ce they had announced at monterrey could go to africa if the nepad is implemented this would amount to us6 billion per

financing leading nepad advocates assert strongly that nepad is an africaninitiated endeavor that must for reasons of sustainability legitimacy and in order to build local capacities for long term selfreliance remain fu lly controlled by africans they reject the explicit linking of policy conditions by outside actors in exchange for financing related to nepad several donor governments how ever including the united states have stressed that if the au fails to implement political reformrelated aspects of nepad early in its development investment in africa and ex ternal support for nepad may be undercut us policy bush administration the bush administration has welcomed nepad as an ambitious africaninitiated policy framework but has not offered specific assistance in support of nepad instead administration fficials assert that the united states is already pursuing development assistance and supporting policy reforms in africa by providing substantial assistance under existing and forthcoming us assistance programs congressional reception congressional reactions to nepad have been mixed on march 20 2003 representative m eeks introduced hres 155 which proposes sense of the house

the bush administrations millennium challenge account mca developing initiative that seeks to direct added development aid to countries committed to political and economic reform we need to better understand how these two initiatives complement one another but also how they differ from past development aid plans and approaches calls for greater development aid whether from africa or here at home must confront the fact that hundreds of billions of dollars of such aid has been spent in africa much producing few results while i have always had doubts about big economic and social plans and their bureaucracies i certainly hope nepad meets its goals7 some congressional and administration policymakers have warned that future us support for nepad may not materialize unle ss african leaders undertake demonstrable concrete actions to activ ely confront and hold to account undemocratic aunepad member states some have specifically cited what they view as the reluctance of african leaders to criticize the government of zimbabwe for what us officials see as an extensive record of violent political oppression and human rights abuses8
