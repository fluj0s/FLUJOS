describe an employment status conversion whereby an individual transfers from federal appointed noncareer position to career position in the executive branch critics of such conversions note that they often occur during the transitional period in which the outgoing administration prepares to leave office and the incoming administration prepares to assume office conversions are permissible when laws and regulations governing career appointments are followed but they can invite scrutiny because of the differences in the appointment and tenure of noncareer and career employees appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law and regulations that are codified in title 5 of the united states code and title 5 of the code of federal regulations and are defined as personnel actions in taking personnel action each department and agency head is responsible for preventing prohibited personnel practices for complying with and enforcing applicable civil service laws rules and regulations and other aspects of personnel management and for ensuring that agency employees are informed of the rights and remedies available to them such actions are required to adhere to the merit principles and prohibited personnel practices that are codified at 5 usc 2301b and 2302b respectively these principles and practices are designed to ensure that the process for selecting career employees is fair and open competitive and without political influence the office of personnel management opm has general authority to examine conversions additionally from march 17 2008 through january 20 2009 conversions of employees from noncareer positions to career positions in the competitive service and the career senior executive service are subject to preappointment review by opm certain senior politically ppointed officers are prohibited from receiving financial awards during the presidential election period defined in statute and currently covering june 1 2008 through

serving in appointed noncareer positions in the executive branch convert to career positions in the competitive service the senior executive service ses or the excepted service1 this practice commonly referred to as burrowing in is permissible when laws and regulations governing career appointments are followed while such conversions may occur at any time frequently they do so during the transition period when one administration is preparing to leave office and another administration is preparing to assume office generally these appointees were selected noncompetitively and are serving in such positions as schedule c noncareer ses or limited tenure ses 2 that involve policy determinations or require close and confidential relationship with the department or agency head and other top officials many of the schedule c appointees receive salaries at the gs12 through gs15 pay levels3 the noncareer and limited tenure members of the ses receive salaries under the pay schedule for senior executives that also covers the career ses4 career employees on the other hand are to be selected on the basis of merit and without political influence following process that is to be fair and open in evaluating their knowledge skills and experience against those of other applicants the tenure of noncareer and career employees also differs the former are generally limited to the term of the administration in which they are appointed or serve at the pleasure of the person who appointed them the latter constitute work force that continues the operations of government without regard to the change of administrations paul light professor of government at new york university who has studied appointees over the past several administrations reportedly believes that the pay benefits and job security of career positions underlie the desire of individuals in noncareer positions to burrow in 5 the president of the senior executives association carol bonosaro echoed this viewpoint in stating the following remember not everybody who comes in is going to have very highprofile job where they are going to be able to leave and make really good money not everyone has had 1 appointments to career competitive service positions include requirements for approved qualification standards public announcement of job vacancies rating of applicants and completion of probationary period and three years of continuous service career ses positions include revi ew by the office of personnel management opm and certification of candidates ability by qualifications review board and career excepted service positions allow agencies to establish their own hiring procedures but require those systems to conform to merit system principles and veterans preference 2 appointments to ses positions that have limited term may be for up to 36 months and those that are to meet an emergency unanticipated or urgent need may be for up to 18 months 3 gs refers to the general schedule the pay schedule that covers whitecollar employees in the federal government as of january 2008 the salaries from gs12 step 1 to gs15 step 10 in the washington dc pay area ranged from 69764 to 149000 4 salaries for members of the ses are determined annually by agency heads under rigorous performance management system and range from the minimum rate of basic pay for senior level sl employee 120 of the minimum basic pay rate for gs15 114468 as of january 2008 to either ex level iii 158500 as of january 2008 in agencies whose performance appraisal systems have not been certified by opm as making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance or ex level ii 172200 as of january 2008 in agencies whose performance appraisal systems have been so certified 5 christopher lee political appointees

been campaign worker6 beyond the fundamental concern that the conversion of an individual from an appointed noncareer position to career position may not have followed the legal and regulatory requirements burrowing in raises other concerns when the practice occurs there may be these perceptions whether valid or not that an appointee converting to career position may limit the opportunity for other employees who were competitively selected for their career positions following examination of their knowledge skills and experience to be promoted into another career position with greater responsibility and pay or that the individual who is converted to career position may seek to undermine the work of the new administration whose policies may be at odds with those that he or she espoused when serving in the appointed capacity both perceptions may increase the tension between noncareer and career staff thereby hindering the effective operation of government at time when the desirability of creating common ground between these staff to facilitate government performance has been emphasized 7

proper procedures some of the apparent improper procedures included selecting former noncareer appointees who appeared to have limited qualifications and experience for career positions creating career positions specifically for particular individuals and failing to apply veterans preference in the selection process 15 the gao findings are examined closely by congress as evidenced by correspondence sent to the opm director by representatives henry waxman then the ranking member and now the chairman of the house committee on oversigh t and government reform and danny davis then the ranking member and now the chairman of the house subcommittee on federal workforce and agency organization following the most recent evaluation in letter dated may 25 2006 both members directed opms attention to the gao evaluation and urged the agency to consider whether its procedures for preappointment review of conversions are sufficient to prevent further abuses the letter emphasized that the meritbased federal workforce is critical to ensuring competent government that will enforce laws consistently across administrations and stated that selecting political appointees on the basis of favoritism jeopardizes this 16 g22g145g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561 members and committees of congress scrutinize conversions as part of their oversight of government operations particular focus in the 110th congress for example has been on staffing at the departments of homeland security dhs nd justice doj

administration we f illed our deputy slot with gale rossides who also has had 30year federal career and has served at tsa since its inception six years ago and we are training and crosstraining such senior career people to ensure that dhs will have the continuity of leadership it needs following the transition 19 the wall street journal discussed the initiative in january 11 2008 article noting that dhs has begun an unusualand potentially controversialeffort to smooth the transition to new administration20 on february 7 2008 representative bennie thompson chairman of the house committee on homeland security wrote letter to dhs secretary michael chertoff he reiterated his concerns about personnel vacancies at dhs and stated these views i am sure that you would agree that it would be inappropriate to fill career nonpolitical executive level positions with political appointees absent an open and fully competitive process while i understand that some could argue that these individuals may be wellqualified and can provide continuity during transition period others could well argue that to permit political appointees to occupy nonpolitical positions could be viewed by some as an attempt to insulate political appointees from the vagaries of the political appointment system and provide an internal obstruction to the policies of the new administration clearly the latter interpretation is deeply troubling 21 representative thompson also requested that secretary chertoff issue policy directive to prohibit the burrowing in of political appointees into nonpolitical career positions within the department22 crs research did not locate publicly available record of any such directive with regard to personnel actions at the department of justice senators dianne feinstein and charles schumer members of the senate committee on the judiciary reportedly wrote letter to attorney general michael mukasey on july 24 2008 according to the washington post the letter asked the attorney general to exercise vigilance against political appointees moving into career positions and stated that when unqualified political appointees take over jobs better left to skilled candidates it threatens the agencys professionalism and independence we dont need ideological stowaways undermining the work of the next administration 23
