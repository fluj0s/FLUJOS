agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the presidents modification of tariffs under this statute was likewise held to be valid under the treaty clause federal courts having acknowledged that not all international undertakings of the united states are conc luded as treaties nd that congressional executive trade agreements could find constitutional basis in the joint exercise of congresss tariff and commerce authorities and the presidents foreign affairs power4 as gatt parties began to ne gotiate more extensively to eliminate nontariff trade barriers in number of areas congress enact ed legislation that would both provide the president with negotiating credibility and ensure that congress carried out its constitutional responsib ilities regarding legislative imple mentation of the agreements since ntb agreements could address variet of regulatory matters eg subsidies government procurement pr oduct standards these agreements might require more elaborate changes in federal law than tariff agreements which for the most part could be implemented through preauthorized pr esidential proclamation reducing tariffs on particular items in contrast if legislation were needed to implement ntb agreements congress could choose not to vote on such gislation or could add amendments that might be viewed as inconsistent with agreement obligations at the same time overly broad delegations of authority to the pr esident to implement ntb agreements or legislative vetoes of executive implementing actions might not comport with constitutional requirements regarding the passage of legisla tion in the trade act of 1974 congress provided the president with new authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements for limited period of time allowing him to proclaim certain tariff reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97896crs4 5 modifying an administration pr oposal the house in 1973 approved legislation that would have authorized the president to negotiate tariff nd

because of the perceived effect of the agreements on states10 the issue also arose in judicial challenge to the nafta in which it was alleged that the failure to use the treaty process rendered the agreement and its implementing legislation unconstitutional in made in the usa foundation v united states an alabama federal district court held in july 1999 that the president had the authority to

courts view the foreign commerce clause combined with the necessary and proper clause and the presidents article ii foreign relations power provided constitutionally sufficient basis for agreement the court preliminarily held that institutional but not individual plaintiffs had standing to sue and that the political question doctrine did not bar it from ruling on the merits on appeal the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit while agreeing that appellants had standing held that the issue of whether an international commercial agreement such as the nafta is treaty that must be approved by twothirds of the senate was nonjusticia ble political question12 the court dismissed the appeal and remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate the supreme court denied certiorari 534 us 1039 2001 under the pol itical question doctrine court will decline to rule on the merits if it finds that the underlying ma tter is committed to the discretion and expertise of the legislative and executive branch in the case at hand the court applied tripartite inqui ry that it said was suggested by justice lewis powell in goldwater v carter 444 us 996 1979 distillation of criteria for determining justiciability originally identified in baker v carr 369 us 186 1962 the three questions posed by the court were i do the issue involve resolution of questions committed by the text of the constitution to coordinate branch of government ii would resolution of the question demand that court move beyond judicial expertise iii do prudential consid erations counsel against judicial intervention regarding the first question the court stated that with respect to commercial agreements we find that the constitutions clear assignment of authority to the political branches of the government ove r our nations foreign affairs counsels against an intrusive role for this court in overseeing the actions of the president and congress in this matter pointing to the vast express constitutiona l grants of power conferred upon the political branches in foreign affairs and commer ce and the supreme courts longstanding recognition of the power of the political branches to conclude agreements that do not constitute treaties in the cons titutional sense regarding the second question the court concluded that ruling on the merits would require it to consider areas beyond its expertise noting inter alia that the treat clause did not set fo rth circumstances under which clause procedures must be followe d when approving international commercial agreements and that having to determine the significance of an international agreement as the key factor in determining whether it should be treaty or not would unavoidably thrust the court into making policy judg ments of the sort unsuited for the judicial branch as for the third question the cour t cited inter alia the need for the nation to speak with uniformity in the area of foreign affairs and commerce and the fact that judicial order declaring th nafta invalid could have profoundly negative effect on this nations economy and its ability to deal with other foreign powers noting that such an order would not only affect the validity of nafta but would potentially undermine every other major international commercial agreement made over the past halfcentury
