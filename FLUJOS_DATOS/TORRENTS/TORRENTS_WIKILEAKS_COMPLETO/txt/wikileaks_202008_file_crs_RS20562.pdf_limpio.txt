report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs20562 updated january 29 2003 merger and antitrust issues in agriculture statutes and agencies jerry heykoop policy analyst resources science and industry division summary continuing trend toward consolidation within agriculture has generated legislative interest in the effect of concentration and consolidation on us agriculture the changing structure of the agriculture sector particularly with respect to mergers between major grain companies and concentr ation in the livestock sector has brought up questions about the federal governments role in pursuin g cases of unfair competition or violations of antitrust laws although various regulations target business practices in the agriculture industry important social issues associated with concentration and consolidation may not be fully addressed by existing antitrust laws this report briefly sets out the philosophy underlying antitrust enforcement the fe deral statutes and agencies currently involved in antitrus t regulation affecting agriculture and congressional activity on the matter this report will be updated as events warrant1 antitrust issues in agriculture2 many issues associated with concentra tion and consolidation such as job loss change in ownership structure and other qualityoflife issues are not addressed by antitrust laws but it is these qualityoflife issu that often are the driving force behind calls for stronger regulations and law enforcement in agriculture within agriculture issues involve the loss of rural lifestyles the disruption of fa rming families and the continuing trend of fewer nd larger farms coupled with the loss of smaller farms nevertheless antitrust enforcement does not encompass the broader range of possible economic and social effects that may be associated with mergers such effects result not only from mergers but from many other forces as well including technological changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20562crs2 3 economic report of the president february 1999 p 39deregulation and intern ational competition so have argued that mergers may be more symptom of broad change in the economy than cause others similarly argue that concentrationconsolidation is occurring in response to external factors including international competition they suggest that po licies that are best for dealing with these changes include promoting full employment and macroeconomic stability developing skilled and welltrained work force providing adequate unemployment insurance and other safety net programs and helping rural communities adapt to economic change basis of antitrust enforcement the goal of antitrust regulation is to protect competition for the benefit of consumers regulations are not intended to keep existing competitors producers in the market but rather to protect the market from unlawful anticompetitive behavior thus agencies involved might approve large merg er if competition is not reduced and they may challenge small merger if it is likely to reduce competition when the antitrust agencies federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the department of justice review mergers they do so with an eye to protecting competition for the benefit of consumers they pay c onsiderable attention to mark et definition over how large market the merged firm might exert market power and what competitors it faces in that market so that the effects of merger are evaluated in the proper context3 mergers or acquisitions that are likely to substantially lessen competition in market are violation of section 7 of the clayton act the purpose of merger review by the department of justice doj or the federal trade commission ftc is to prevent anti competitive conduct before it occurs the prin cipal focus during merger review is not on the conduct of the merging par ties but on whether the merger would change the market structure to such degree that competition likely would be substa ntially lessened the premerger remedies dojftc seek for merger that would violate the clayton act is suit to stop the merger or to insist that approval depends on whet her it can be modified to remove the cause for antitrust concern eg through divestiture in addition to potentially anticompetitive mergers there are two other classes of anticompetitive behavior that may be subject to findings of antitrust unlawfulness collusion violation of section 1 of the sher man act occurs when separate firms agree among themselves not to compete with each other but instead join forces against their consumers or their suppliers monopolization or attempt to monopolize violation of section 2 of the sherman act may be used with the antimerger provisions of the clayton act there are several ways to monopolize including the use of pred atory practices andor exclusionary conduct major antitrust statutes w ith particular emphasis on

commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice conc erning clearance procedures for investigations march 5 2002 http www ftcgovopa200204clearanceove rviewhtm although the memorandum is supported by several members of congress and several former antitrust officials it is also strenuously opposed by at least one senator and by some consumer groups 5 for example in number of cases the clearance process consumed significant share of the initial 30day review period and the reviewing agency was forced to issue second request simply to preserve its time to investigate effectivelynegotiation between the parties and the review ing agency if in fact negotiation has not already begun if suit to enjoin the merg er is announced or filed the proposed merging companies may take one of three courses of action 1 drop the merger 2 prepare to fight the lawsuit or 3 negotiate with the agency if that process has not already begun in an attempt to restructure the merger to alleviate the governments concerns eg via divestiture of selected assets negotiation often is seen as being in the interests of all parties because going to court can be expensive timeconsuming and risky federal trade commission ftcs role in maintaining fair competition in agriculture involves the review of mergers similar to the doj ro described above on march 5 2002 doj and ftc issued memorandum of agreement designed to both streamline and increase the transparency of their clearance procedures the processes under which the agen cies determine which of th em will handle given merger or conduct an investigation4 although clearance procedures traditionally have emphasized the agencies experi ence in dealing with specific industries and sectors they contend that rapid technolog ical change and deregulation have created convergence issues lengthened the clearance period and re duced the effectiveness of experiencebased allocation5 pursuant to the memorandum allocations to ftc include grocery manufacturing and operation of grocery stores pharmaceuticals and biotechnology other th an that associated with agriculture and the operation of re tail stores

additive market and received 100 million fine which was the largest corporate fine in history at the time railroads7 mergers in the railroad industr are important to agricultu re because of the potential impacts on commodity transportation rail merg ers are handled differently from mergers in other industries in three aspects first the surface transportation board stb has final authority on allowing or disallowing mergers doj and ftc are allowed to testify similarly to other parties at merger hearing but stb can disallow merger regardless of either agencys position for example doj opposed the merger in 1996 of union pacific nd southern pacifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20562crs6 railroads however stb granted permissi on and the railroads merged under the name union pacific second railroad mergers cannot proceed wit hout stb permission that is different from mergers in other industries which are reviewed by dojftc in those industries mergers can proceed unless blocked by doj or ftc for example the recent tysonibp merger proceeded since neither agency moved to block the merger within 30 days of the premerger filing third stb can oversee results of merger in order to ameliorate adverse effects because stb maintains oversig ht over railroads it may pl ace additional conditions on railroad after the merger that is differe nt from mergers in other industries in that dojftc do not maintain oversight after merger rather they attempt to structure merger in manner that would prevent any potential future anticompetitive practicesissues stb merger guidelines in december 1999 burlington northern santa fe bnsf and canadian national cn announced plans to merge under the name north american railways inc it was widely sp eculated within the ra ilroad industry and among shippers that bnsfcn merger would spur the final round of rgers among railroads it was believed the final resu lt would leave the railroad indus try with only two very large class 1 railroads that span the continent before the merger application was filed stb held hearings on march 810 2000 to review mergers in the ra ilroad industry and to determine if merger moratorium was warra nted after the hearings stb announced 15month moratorium in order to review nd update its merger procedures in accord with the moratorium stb announced it woul d not accept merger applications between class 1 railroads during that period effectively blocking bn sf and cn from filing their merger application bnsf and cn appealed stbs decision to the district of columbia court of appeals however the

cn called off their proposed merger on june 11 2001 stb announced its new merg er review guidelines among other issues railroads hoping to merge would have to prove not only that merger would maintain competition but rather that merger would enhance competition 2002 farm bill the new farm law titled farm security and rural investment act of 2002 signed into law may 13 2002 pl 107171 hr 2646 extends
