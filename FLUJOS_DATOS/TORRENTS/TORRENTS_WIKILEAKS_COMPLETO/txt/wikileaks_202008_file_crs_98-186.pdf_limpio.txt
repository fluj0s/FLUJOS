president and federal civil officers b impeachment has been placed by constitutional mandate in the hands of th legislative branch of the united states government although rooted in the soil of english impeachme nt experience the american impeachment system differs from its english forebear in some significant respects recorded incidents of englis h impeachments may begin as early as 1376 and one source would place the first i n 1283 more fixed procedure appears to have begun in 1399 with the passage of1 the statute of i henry iv c 14 whichever date one chooses it is clear that th e2 english practice took root well before the colonial beginnings of our country i t ceased to be used in england at about the time that it became part of the american system of government the last two impeachments in england appear to have been those of warren hastings in 1787 and of rd melville in 1805 the english system3 permitted any person to be impeached by the house of commons for any crime r misdemeanor whether the alleged offender was peer or commoner4 unlike the british system which permitted penal sanctions to attach upo n convicti on of impeachment the american system is designed to

american system seems more designed to protect the public interest than to punish the person impeached nevertheless much of the procedure and practice involv ed in this countrys application of its

appears to have expressed concern over the impact upon president that could result from subjecting him to judicial process as reflected in letter from thomas jefferson to united states attorney george in connectio n with the trial of aaron burr from june 20 1807 the leading principle of our constitution is the independence of th legislat ure executive and judiciary of each other and none are mor jealous of this t han the judiciary but would the executive be independent of the judiciary if he were subject to the commands of the latter t imprisonment for disobe dience if the several courts could bandy him from pillar to post keep him constantly trudging from north to south east to west and withdraw him entirely from his constitutional duties th intention of the constitution that each branch should be independent of the others is further manifested by the means it has furnished to each t protect itself from enterprises of force attempted on the m by the others and to none has it given more effectual or diversified means than to th executive17 this letter reflects concerns raised by chief justice marshalls holding in unite d states v burr 25 fed cas 30 14692d ccd va 1807 that subpoena duces tecum could be issued to the president jefferson raised similar concerns in letter to geo rge dated june 17 1807 regarding dicta in burr on the issue f whether court might compel personal attendance of the president at trial t comply with such calls would leave the nation without an executive branch whos agency nevertheless is understood to be so constantly necessary that it

remainder of t his sentence following the semicolon reads and for this purpose19 his person must be deemed in civil cases at least to possess an official inviolability the first clause of the sentence seem s unequivocal discrete and complete in itself and directly on point however it would seem possible that this second clause if read in pari materia with the first ght be viewed as narrowing the scope of the first to those circumstances where president might be subject to arrest imprisonment or detention in connection with civi l matter perhaps in the context of contempt of court alternatively it might be argued that this inviolability in ci vil matters simply reflects the holding in the burr case in which president jefferson was subject to subpoena duces tecum to produce evidence sought by the defense in criminal trialin 1833 justice joseph story stated in 1563 of his commentaries on th constitution of the united states vol iii at 418419 there are other incidental powers belonging to the executiv department which are necessarily implied from the nature of the functions which are confided to it among these must necessarily be included th power to perform them without any obstruction or impedimen t whatsoever the president cannot therefore be liable to arrest imprisonment or detention while he is in the discharge of the duties of his office 19 more recently

presidency i s embodied the continuity and ind estructibility of the state it is not possible for the government to function without president and the constitutio n contemplates and provides for uninterrupted continuity in that office obviousl the presidency cannot be conducted from jail nor can it b effectively carried on w hile an incumbent is defending himself in criminal trial and the incumbent cannot be replaced or suspended or deprived of his function as president while he is alive and not declared physicall disabled as he now may be under the 25 amendment that the 25th th amendm

committee was directed t inquire who the editor of the newspaper was by what authority he had published specifie d information regarding copy of particular bill and statement that senator pinckney had never been consulted on the bill and who or what the origin was of assertions made in th article about the senate and its members senator tracy believed some of the information in the article t be

suggestion by senator tracy on march 5 1800 that the house decide on the propriety of referring the motion to the committee of privileges occasioned several senators to raise objections to the substance of the resolution itself as seeking to exercise powers beyond those constitutionally granted to senate s intruding upon the power of the people to examine public measures and as jeopardizing the freedom of the press pinckney in his discourse on the floor of the senate raised all of these concerns having listed the privileges of the legislative branch included in article i continuedfreedman clearly disagrees with bickels view that the 25 amendment was tth intended to reach circumstances outside those involving physical disability although he finds bickels position more persuasive in section 4 context than in one in which section 3 of the 25 amendment was called into play th raoul berger in his article the pre sident congress and the courts supports his conclusion that the impeachment of president need not precede indictment b negative implication from the absence of ny indication of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution in the constitutional language from the burr trial and fro m historical concerns over abuses of executive power with which the framers wer familiar coupled with st atements by charles pinckney and james wilson bergers argument rests in part upon the explicit inclusion in the constitution of article 1 section 6 which states in pertinent part the senators and representatives shall in all cases excep t treason felony and breach of the peace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at th session of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same and for any speech or deba in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place similar express treatment exists in the constitution of privilege from arrest r prosecution for the president berger appears to believe that such an omission was made advisedly and that by implication the president must therefore be amenable to criminal prosecution while in office berger further bases his position upon statement made by senator charle s pinckney who was one of the framers speaking i n the senate in 1800 that it never was intende d to give congress any but specified privileges and those ver limited privilege indeed further berger noted that pinckney stated during th e20httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs11 continued20 sections 5 and 6 of the constitution and having underscored the specificity of thes privileges senator pinckney then emphasized that the powers they are to exercise and the persons and cases they are to operat upon are all distinctly marked nd named nor is there word or sentence in the whole that can by any possible construction be made to mean that for any libels or printed attack on the public conduct or opinions of either house of congress or of any of its members that their privilege shall extend to ordering the persons charged with the offence before them and imprisoning them at their will 10 annals of cong 71 1800 pinckney sought further support for his position by noting that if such privilege existed the congress would have the obligation to legislate wit h respect to it laying out the manner in which it would be executed yet such legislatio n existed he then stated i assert th at it was the design of the constitution and that not only its spirit but letter warrant i n the assertion that it never was intended to give congress or either branch any but specified and those very limited privileges indeed they well knew how oppressivel the power of undefined privileges had been exercised in great brita in and were determined such authority should ever be exercised here they knew that in free countries very few privileges were necessary to the undisturbed exercise of gislative duties and those few only they determined that congress should possess the never meant that body who ought to be purest and the least in want of shelter from the operation of laws equally affecting all their fellow citizens should be able to avoid them they therefore not only intended but did confine their privileges with in the narrow limits mentioned in the constitution and here sir let ask are not these privileges all that are necessary they have complete authori ty to keep order and decorum within their own chamber to clear the galleries if an audience are unruly and to punish their own members to take care that arrests except for treason felony or breach of the peace shall keep their mbers from their duty and for all libellous attacks or misrepresentations the laws are open to them and if unjustly attacked doubt the juries of thei r countrymen who are interested to preserve the dignity and independence of their legislature will give them the most ample satisfaction id at 7172 s pelling as in the original this is the context from which the first of th pinckney quotes raised by raoul berger is drawn 10 annals of g 74 1800 this quote is also drawn from pinckneys remarks in21 response to the substance of the motion by senator tracy of connecticut as he continued his remarks senator pinckney articulated his understanding of the gist of the reasoning i n support of the tracy resolution to be that each branch must possess this power to punish for breach of privileges whic h they must judge as circumstance s arise and require that every legislative body or continuedcourse of this discourse thatno privilege of this kind was intended for you r executive

must be exercised as their discretion directs because it may frequently be necessary to exercise i t immediately when the public safety would make it imp ossible to wait for reference to other bodies or tribunals and that if man was approaching to knock u down it would be absurd instead of defending yourself to deliberate whether you were authorized to do so that you must act instantly as the occasion demands and that as each individual in society possesses this inherent right to protec t himself so does each branch of the legislature id at 7273 he states further that this reasoning is said to be str engthened by the practice and precedent of the british parliament and the co lonial legislatures before the revolution and most of the stat legisla tures since and is now universally received as the true doctrine on thi s subject that it is the doctrine and practice of the british parliament i will allow but it was because the doctrines there held are utterly inadmissible in fre government and to prevent any influence from the m and their precedents and the improper practice of the colonial and state legislatures that this limitation of the privileges of congress was here purposely introduced will any man undertake to say that th privilege of the parliament of great brritain sic ought to be that of the congress of this country do you suppose that all their members and their property and even their servants should be protected from arrests during th whole time they are elected for many of them for twenty years together or during their lives would it be thought safe in this country that small majority of small body or single branch of legislature should claim and exercise th authority whenever they please to send and seize any man in your community however important and confine him in loathsome dungeon for six month s together merely because he has differed with them in politics and criticized as he had right to do on their legislative acts id at 73 pinckney felt that s uch result was clearly not intended by the constitution he found further support i n the enactment of legislation creating federal crime for writing uttering publishing or printing any libel against the president or either branch of congress h contended that if either branch already possessed the power to punish such acts themselves such law would not have been enacted he argued further but to prove this sti ll more clearly let us inquire why the constitution should have been so attentive to each branch of congress so jealous of their privileges and have shewn so little to t he president of the united states in this respect why should the individual mbers of either branch or either branch itself have more privileges than him he i s himself as far as his qualified negative goes branch of the legislature he is besides your executive he is the sword of the law and does he possess any privileges like these if man meets him walking alone in the streets and insults him or if one of ruffian manners should enter his house an d even abuse him there has your president any privil eges like these can he commit and imprison without trial sir he must resort to the laws for satisfaction where the person charged with the outrage will be he ard and where each party will continuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs13 continued21 have justice done th em by men who ought to be so impartially summoned as that undue bias w ill be found when they come to decide privilege of this kind was intended for your executive nor any except that which i have mentioned for your legis lature the convention which formed the constitution well knew that this was an imp ortant point and subject had been more abused than privilege they therefore determin ed to set the example in merely limiting privilege to what was necessary and more id at 74 this then was the context from which the second pinckney quotation by berger was taken 2 j elliot debates in the several state conventions on the adoption of the federal22 constitution 480 1836 quoted in r berg er the president congress and the courts 83 yale lj 1111 112627 1974 this quote is drawn from discussion by wilson of th executive authority under the constitution he stated the next good quality that i remark is that the executive authority is one by this means we obtain very important advantages we may discover from history from reason and from experience the security which th is furnishes the executive power is better to be trusted when it has screen sir we have responsibility in the per of our president he cannot act improperly and hide either hi s negligence or inattention he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality appointment can take place without his nomination and he i s responsible for every nomination he makes we secur vigor we well know what numerous executives are we know there is neither vigor decision r responsibility in them add to all this that off icer is placed high and is possessed of power far from be ing contemptible yet not single privilege is annexed to his character far from being above the laws he is amenable to them in his privat character as citizen and in his public character by impeachment r berger the president congress and the courts 83 yale lj 1111 11333 423 1974 framer speaking to the pennsylvania ratification convention stating that not single privilege is annexed to the presidents character in addition berger argues22 that if an impeachment must pre cede related criminal trial of president then if the house did not vote to impeach or if the president was not convicted and remove d from office in senate impeachment trial the president might be immune fro m prosecution and if the statute of limitations were to be allowed to run during tha t time that immunity could conceivably be permanent 23 as is apparen t from the discussion above arguments can be marshaled on both sides of the issue regarding whether sitting president can be subjected to criminal prosecu tion or whether president must be removed from office throug h impeachment before criminal prosecution may proceed as yet the ultimat resolution of this issue remains unknown while the stitutional provisions establish the basic framework for american impeachm ents they do not begin to address all of the issues which may arise during the course of

senators t receive evidence and take testimony at such times and places as th commit tee may determine and for such purpose the committee s appointed and the chairman thereof to be elected by the

testimony in open s enate or by order of the senate having the entire trial in open senate former judge nixon arguing that the senates failure to give him full evidentiary hearing before the entire senate violated its constitutional duty to try l impeachments sought declaratory judgment that his conviction by the senate was void and that his judic ial salary and privileges should be reinstated from the date of his conviction the district c ourt held that his claim was nonjusticiable 938 f2d at 241 the us cou rt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit agreed id judge williams writing for the court d etermined that the constitutional language granting the senate the sole power to try all impeachments also gives it sol discreti on to choose its procedures id at 245 this textual commitment f impeachment trials to the sena coupled with the need for finality led the court tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs15 apply the political question doctrine in determining that the issue presented by former judge nixon was nonjusticiable id judge randolph in his concurrence framed the question before the court s whether the judiciary can pass upon the validity of t he senates procedural decisions my conclusion that the courts have such role to play in the impeachment process rests on my int erpretation of the constitution id at 248 his analysis seems t focus specifically upon the text of the constitutional grant to the senate of the sol power to try impeachments and upon the framers intentional exclusion of th judiciar from role in the impeachment process rather than upon the politica l question doctrine judge edwards concurred in the judgment but dissented in part he would have found former judge nixons constitutional challenge justiciable but would find that the senates use of special committee to hear witnesses and gather evidence did not deprive nixon of any constitutionally protected right id the nixon case was decided by the supreme court on january 13 1993 nixon v united states 506 us 224 1993 chief justic rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court for himself and justices stevens oconnor scalia kennedy an d thomas the court held the issue before them to be nonjusticiab the chief justice based this conclusion upon t he fact that the impeachment proceedings were textually committed in the constitution to the legislative bran ch in addition the court found the lack of finality and the difficulty in fashioning relief counselled agains t justiciability id at 236 to open the door of judicial review to the procedure s used by the senate in trying impeachments would expose the political life of th country to months or perhaps years of chaos id quoting the court below 938 f2d at 246 the court found that the word try in t he impeachment clause did not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to th senate id at 238 justice stevens in his concurring opinion emphasized the significance of th framers

consi deration of the constitutional sufficiency of the senates rule xi procedure justices white and blackmun addressing the merits of the claim before the court were of the opinion that th senate had fulfilled its constitutional obligation to try judge nixon id at 239 justice sout er agreed with the majority that the case presented nonjusticiable political question although his reasoning was somewhat different the impeachment trial clause commits to the senate the sole power to try all impea chments subject to three procedural requirements the senate shall be on oath or affirmation the chief justice shall presid when the president is tried and conviction shall be upon the concurrence of twothi rds of the members present us const art i 3 cl 6 i t seems fair to conclude that the clause contemplates that the senate ma determine within broad boundaries such subsidiary issues as th procedures for receipt and consideration of evidence necessary to satisf its duty to try impeachmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs16 in so doing while judge sporkin appended copy of rule xi to his decision he did24 not discuss the rule xi requirement that all rulings s to competency materiality or relevancy must be made by the full senate nor did he address the fact that the rule xi procedur permits the full senate to take further testimony or to take all evidence in open senate judge sporkin described the rule xi committee as deliberative body 802 f supp at 494 bu t seems not to have focused upon the fact that committee formed to take evidence pursuant to rule xi reports to the senate certified copy of the tra nscript of proceedings and testimony given before the committee these committees do not appear to have made an recommendations as to the merits of the impeachment cases before them id at 253 justice souter found the conclusion that the case presented non justiciable political question supported by the the unusual need for unquestionin g adherence to political decision already made and the potentiality f embarrassment fro m multifarious pronouncements from various departments on one question id quoting baker v carr 369 us 186 217 1962 he noted however that if the senate were to act in manner seriously threatening th integrity of its results convicting say upon cointo ss or upon summary determination that an officer of the united states was simply bad guy ju dicial interference might well be appropriated in suc h circumstance s the senates action might be so far beyond the scope of its constitutional authority and the consequent impact on the republic s great as to merit judicial response despite the prudential concerns tha t would ordinarily counsel silence id at 25354 in contrast to the decisions in nixon judge spork in of the united states district court for the district of columbia initially rul ed for the plaintiff in hastings v united states 802 f supp 490 492 ddc 1992 the court there framed the question before it as follows the key issue in this case is whether lifetenured article iii judg who has been acquitted of felony charges by petit jury can thereafter be impeached and tried for essentially the same alleged indiscretion by committee of the united states senate consisting of less than the ful l senate this court determines that the answer is judge sporkin determined that hi s court was not foreclosed from reaching decision in the hastings case by what might have been viewed as c ontrolling court of appeals decision in nixon because the supre court had agreed to take certiorari in nixon on issues identical to those before him judge sporkin conc luded that the issue before him was justiciable and further that the rule xi procedure did not provide n adequate trial before the full senate id at 501 in particular the court considered the taking of evidence process which required the presence of all the senators so that each could judge credibility with his or her own eyes and ears judge sporkins24 decision seems to turn upon his reading of the implications of th constitutional phrase giving the senate the sole power to try all impeachments in light of his analysis judge sporkin

impeach judges invo lved in the case these resolutions were also referred to the house judiciary committee as is apparent from the instances noted above the impeachment mechanism while not used frequently has provided means of exploring allegations f misconduct involving with the one notable exce ption of senator blount civil officers from both the judicial and executive branches the bulk of the inquiries begun have not resulted in impeachment trials of those which have gone to trial half of the m have led to convictions all involving federal judges the impeachment proces s provides means of monitoring and checking misconduct by such officials through the use of legislative forum the mechanis m is cumbersome one which takes time away from other legisla tive business yet its very cumbersomeness might be viewed as necessary to minimize the chance that so serious course would be engaged i n lightly in this light its complex and somewhat unwieldy nature could be considered an attempt to deter unwarranted legi slative intrusions into the business and personnel of the other two branches the impeachment process might be seen as constitutional effort to balance these two countervailing forces who are civil officers of the united states unde r article ii sec 4 of the constitution perusal of the examples included in the list of impeachment trials and of inq uiries with an eye towards possible impeachment may provide som indication as to what sort of officials have been considered civil officers of th united states within the scope of th impeachment powers the term is not defined in the constitution with the exception of the trial of senator blount all of thos listed above were from either the executive or the judicial branch senator blount was not convicted in

ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be

therefore overruled41 what kinds of conduct may give rise to an impeachment the second fundamental issue which each congress contemplating impeachment of federa l official must confront is whether the conduct in questio n falls within the constitutional parameters of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors treason is defined in the constitution art iii sec 3 cl 1 and in statute 18 usc 2381 to mean levying war against the united states or adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort the constitution requires that conviction on charge f treason be supported by the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or confession in open court the statutory language expressly applies only to thos owing allegiance to the united states bribery is not defined in the constitution although it was an offense at common law and the first congress enacted bribery statute the act of april 30 1 790 1 stat 112 117 which with some amendment is now codified at 18 usc 201 thus treason and bribery may be fairly clear as42 to their meanings but the remainder of the language has been the subject f considerable debate the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors is not defined in the constitu tion or in statute it was used in many of the english impeachments which were proceedings in which criminal sanctions could be imposed upo n conviction as alex simpson jr amply demonstrated in his discussion of th constituti onal conventions debate on this language and the discussion of it in th state conventions considering ratification of the constitution in federa l impeachments 64 u pa l rev 651 676695 1916 confusion as to its meaning appears to have existed even at the time of its drafting and ratification definitive list of types of conduct falling within the high crimes and misdemeanors language has been forthcoming as resul t of this debate but some measure of clarification has emerged article 1 section 3 clause 7 appears to anticipate that some of the conduc t within this ambit may also provide grou nds for criminal prosecution it indicates thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs25 see the discussion of the debates on this subject in the minority views

implying that the impeachment proceedings would precede the judicial process but as is evident from the impeachments of judge claiborne in 1986 and of judges hastings and nixon in 1988 and 1989 at least as to federal judges an d probably as to most civil officers subject to impeachment under the constitution the impeachment process may also follow the conclusion of the criminal proceedings whether impeachment and removal of president must precede any crimina l prosecution is as yet an unanswered question the debate on the impeachable offenses during the constitutional conventio n in 1787 in dicates that criminal conduct was at least part of what was included in the treason bribery or other high cr imes and misdemeanors language however the43 precedents in this country as they have developed reflect the fact that conduct which may not constitute crime but which may still be serious misbehavior bringin g disrepute upon the public office involved may provide sufficient ground fo r impeachment for example judge john pickering was convicted on all four of th articles of impeachment brought against him among those charges were allegations of mishandling case before him in contravention of f ederal laws and procedures 1 by delivering ship which was the subject of cond emnation proceeding for violation of customs laws to the claimant without requiring bond to be posted after the ship had been attached by the marshal 2 by refusing to hear some of the testimony offered by the unit ed states in that case and 3 by refusing to grant the united states n appeal despite the fact t hat the united states was entitled to an appeal as matter of right under federal law however the fourth article against him alleged that h appeared on the bench in an intemperate and intoxicated state judge halsted ritter was acquitted of six of the seven articles brought against him he was convicted on the seventh which summarized or l isted the first six articles and charged that the reasonable and probable consequences of the actions r conduct involv ed therein were to bring his court into scandal and disrepute to the prejudice of said court and public confidence in the federal judiciary and to render him unfit to continue to serve as such judge the factual allegations upon which this statement was based included assertions that ritter while federal judge accepted large fees and gratuities and engaged in income tax evasion this article wa s challenged unsuccessfully on point of order based upon the contention that article vii repeated and combined facts circumstances and charges from the preceding six articles the president pro tempore ruled that article vii involved separate charge of general misbehavior44 it has been suggested that the impeachment provisions and the good behaviour language of the judicial tenure provision in article iii sec 1 of the constitutio nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs26 see 3 deschlers ch 14 310 at 4495245 id46 3

impeachab offenses for judicial officers from those which would apply to civil officers in the executive branch is not altogether clear during th impeachment investigation of justice douglas in the 91st congress representative paul mccloskey jr reading the impeachment and good behavior provisions i n tandem contended that federal judge could be impeached for either imprope r judicial conduct or nonjudicial conduct amounting to criminal offense then46 minority leader gerald ford inserted in the congressional record memorandum taking the position that impeachable misbehavior by judge involved proven conduct either in the administration of j ustice or in his personal behavior which casts doubt on his personal integrity and thereby on the integ rity of the entire judiciary during47 the douglas impeachment debate representative frank thompson jr argued that historica lly federal judges had only been impeached for misconduct that was bot h criminal in nature and related to their judicial functions and that such construction of the constitutional authority was necessary to maintaining an independen t judiciary in the final report by the special subcommittee on hres 920 of th e48 committee on the judiciary of the house of representatives 91st cong 2d sess comm print sept 17 1970 as cited in 3 deschlers ch 14 313 th subcomm ittee suggested two concepts related to this question for the committee to consider these concepts shared some common ground as the subcommitte observed both concepts would allow judge to be impeached for acts whic h occur in the exercise of jud icial office that 1 involved criminal conduct in violation of law or 2 that involved serious dereliction from public duty but not necessarily in violation of positiv statutory law or forbidden by the common law sloth drunkenness on the bench or unwarranted an d unreasonable impartiality sic manifest for prolonged period ar examples of misconduct not necessarily criminal in nature that woul d support imp eachment when such misbehavior occurs in connection with the federal office actual criminal conduct should not be requisite t impeachment of judge or any other federal official while such conduct need not be criminal it nonetheless must be sufficiently serious to b offenses against good morals and injurious to the social body both conce pts would allow judge to be impeached for conduct not connected with the duties and responsibilities of the judicial office whic h involve sic criminal acts in violation of law49 thus it would appear that this common ground represented those general principles which the subcommittee deemed fundamental to conduct upon which impeachment of federal judge could be basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98186crs27 see 3 deschlers ch 14 37 at 42934 50 hr rept

those articles on the theory that president nixon abused the powers of his office causing injury to the confidence of th nation and great prejudice to the cause of law and justice and resulting in subversion of constitutional government that he failed to carry out his constitution obligation to faithfully execute the laws and that he failed to comply with congressional subpoenas needed to p

these are then presented to the senate for trial in the sen ate trial the house of representatives is represented by managers who may be assisted by counsel the individual impeached also is entitled t
