defense and trade division august 15 2008 abstract as of mid2008 there are indications that aqi leaders are relocating from iraq to join qaeda leaders believed to be in remote areas of pakistan near the afghanistan border that perception if accurate could suggest that aqi now perceives afghanistan as more fertile ground than is iraq to attack us forces the relocation of aqi leaders to pakistan

oust saddam hussein from power the administration asserted among other justificati ons that the regime of saddam hussein had working relationship with the qaeda organization the administration assessed that the relationship dated to the early 1990s and was based on common interest in confronting the united states the administration assertions were derived from us intelligence showing pattern of contacts with qaeda when its ke founder osama bin laden was based in sudan in the early to mid1990s and continuing after he relocated to afghanistan in 1996 critics maintain that subsequent research demonstrates that the relationship if it existed was not operational and that hard data has come to light indicating the two entities conducted any joint terrorist attacks some major hallmarks of an operational relationship were absent and several experts outside and within the us govern ment believe that contacts between iraq and qaeda were sporadic unclear or subject to alternate explanations another pillar of the administration argument whic h has applications for the current us effort to stabilize iraq rested on reports of contacts between baghdad and an islamist qaeda affiliate group called ansar alislam based in northern iraq in the late 1990s although the connections between ansar alislam and saddam husseins regime were subject to debate the organization evolved into what is now known as qaeda in iraq aqi aqi has been numerically small but operationally major component of the sunni arabled insurgency that frustrated us efforts to stabilize iraq since mid2007 in part facilitated by combat conducted by additional us forces sent to iraq as part of troop surge the us military has exploited differences between aqi and iraqi sunni political tribal and insurgent leaders to virtually expel aqi from many of its sanctuaries particularly in baghdad and in anbar province us officials assess aqi to be weakened almost to the point of outright defeat in iraq although they say it remains lethal and has the potential to revive in iraq attacks continue primarily in northcentral iraq that bear the hallmarks of aqi tactics and us and iraqi forces continue to conduct offensives targeting suspected aqi leaders and hideouts as of mid2008 there are indications that aqi lead ers are relocating from iraq to join qaeda leaders believed to be in remote areas of pakista n near the afghanistan border that perception if accurate could suggest that aqi now perceives afghanistan as more fertile ground than is iraq to attack us forces the relocation of aqi leaders to pakistan could also accelerate the perceived strengthening of the central qaeda organization this report will be updated as warranted by developments see also crs report rl31339 iraq

g343g561part of the debate over the bush administration decision to use military action to overthrow the regime of saddam hussein centers on whether or not that regime was allied with qaeda in building an argument that the united states needed to oust saddam hussein militarily the administration asserted that iraq constituted gathering threat to the united states because it continued to develop weapons of mass destruction wmd that it could potentially transfer to international terrorist groups including qaeda with which iraq was allied this combination produced the possibility of catastrophic attack on the united states according to the administration the first pillar of the administration argument for ousting saddam husseinits continued active development of wmdhas been researched extensively after the fall of the regime in april 2003 us forces and intelligence officers in an iraq survey group isg searched iraq for evidence of wmd stockpiles comprehensive september 2004 report of the survey group known as the duelfer report 1 said that the isg found wmd stockpiles or production but said that there was evidence that the regime reta ined the intention to reconstitute wmd programs in the future the formal usled wmd search ended december 20042 although us forces have found some chemical weapons caches left over from the iraniraq war3 the unmovic work remained formally active until security council resolution 1762 terminated it on june 29 2007 the second pillar of the administration argumentthat saddam husseins regime had links to qaedais relevant not only to assess justification for the invasion decision but also because an qaeda affiliate qaeda in iraq or aqi became key component of the postsaddam insurgency among sunni arabs in iraq the admi nistration has maintained that the qaeda presence in iraq fighting alongside iraqi insurgents from the ousted ruling baath party members of former regime security forces and other disaffected iraqi sunni arabs demonstrates that there were prewar linkages on the other hand most experts believe that qaeda and other foreign fighters entered sunniinhabited central iraq after the fall of saddam hussein from the kurdish controlled north and from other middle eastern countries these foreign fighters are motivated by an antius ideology and target of opportunity provided by the presence of us forces there rather than longstanding ties to the former iraqi regime according to this view

g344g561the administration argument for an iraqal qaeda linkage had few major themes 1 that there were contacts between iraqi intelligence and qaeda in sudan afghanistan and pakistan dating from the early 1990s including iraqs assistance to qaeda in deployment of chemical weapons 2 that an islamist faction called ansar alislam the partisans of islam in northern iraq had ties to iraqs regime and 3 that iraq might have been involved in the september 11 2001 plot itself of these themes the september 11 allegations are the most widely disputed by outside experts and by some officials within the administration itself some administration officials including president bush have virtually ruled out iraqi involvement in the september 11 attacks while others including vice president cheney have maintained that the issue is still open5 secretary of state powell presented the administration view in greater public detail than any other official when he briefed the united nations security council on iraq on february 5 2003 although most of that presentation was devoted to iraqs alleged violations of requirements that it dismantle its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs according to the presentation6 iraq and terrorism go back decades but what i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially more sinister nexus between iraq and the qaeda terrorist network nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder iraq today harbors deadly terrorist network headed by abu musab alzarqawi an associate and collaborator of osama bin laden and his qaeda lieutenants going back to the early and mid1990s when bin laden was based in sudan an qaeda source tells us that saddam and bin laden reached an understanding that qaeda would longer support activities against baghdad we know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s iraqis continued to visit bin laden in his new home in afghanistan after bin laden moved there in mid1996 from the late 1990s until 2001 the iraqi embassy in pakistan played the role of liaison to the qaeda organization ambition and hatred are enough to bring iraq and qaeda together enough so qaeda could learn how to build more sophisticated bombs and learn how to forge documents and enough so that qaeda could turn to iraq for help in acquiring expertise on weapons of mass destruction secretary powell did not include in his february 5 2003 briefing the assertion that iraq was involved in the september 11 plot some analysts suggest the omission indicates lack of consensus within the administration on the strength of that evidence in january 2004 press interview secretary powell said that his briefing had been meticulously prepared and reviewed saying anything that we did not feel was solid and multisourced we did not use in that speech7 additional details of the administrations argument as well as criticisms are discussed below postsaddam analysis of the issue has tended to refute the administration argument on saddam qaeda linkages although this issue is still debated the report of the 911 commission found

g345g561no evidence of collaborative operational linkage between iraq and qaeda8 in his book at the center of the storm in may 2007 harper collins press pp 341358 former cia director george tenet indicated that the cia view was that contacts between saddams regime and qaeda were likely for the purpose of taking the measure of each other or take advantage of each other rather than collaborating others note however that some of tenets prewar testimony before congress was in line with the prevailing administration view on this question contrasting with the views in his book in march 2008 study by the institute for defense analyses written for the us joint forces command and based on 600000 documents captured in postsaddam iraq found that iraq during the early to mid1990s actively supported egyptian islamic jihad which in 1998 formally merged with qaeda but that the documents do not reveal direct coordination and assistance between saddam husseins regime and qaeda9

information that the bush administration relied on to judge linkages between iraq and qaeda was publicized not only in secretary of state powells february 5 2003 briefing to the security council but also and in more detail in an article in the weekly standard 10 vice president cheney has been quoted as saying the article represents the best source of open information on the issue11 the article contains excerpts from memorandum dated october 27 2003 from undersecretary of defense for policy douglas feith to senators pat roberts and jay rockefeller the then chairman and vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee the memorandum reportedly was based on research and analysis of intelligence and other information by the office of special plans an iraq policy planning unit within the department of defense set up in early 2002 but disbanded in the fall of 2002 the following sections analyze details of the major themes in the administration argument

accounts12 include assertions that iraqi intelligence developed relationship with qaeda in the ea rly 1990s brokered by the islamist leaders of sudan at the time osama bin laden was in sudan he remained there until sudan expelled him in mid1996 after which he went to afghanistan according to the purported memo the iraqal qaeda relationship included an agreement by qaeda not to seek to undermine saddams regime and for iraq to provide qaeda with conventional weapons and wmd the administration view is that iraq was highly isolated in the arab world in the early 1990s just after its invasion of kuwait in august 1990 and that it might have sought relationship with qaeda as means of gaining leverage over the united states and common enemy the regime of saudi arabia from this perspective the relationship served the interests of both even though 8 911 commission report p 66 9 iraqi perspectives project saddam and terrorism emerging insights from captured iraqi documents

secular leaders with islamic states the purported dod memorandum includes names and approximate dates on which iraqi intelligence officers visited bin ladens camp outside khartoum and discussions of cooperation in manufacturing explosive devices it reportedly discusses subsequent meetings between iraqi intelligence officers and bin laden and his aides in afghanistan and pakistan continuing until at least the late 1990s the memorandum cites intelligence reports that qaeda operatives were instructed to travel to iraq to obtain training in the making and deployment of chemical weapons secretary of state powell in his february 5 2003 briefing citing an qaeda operative captured in afghanistan stated that iraq had received qaeda operatives several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poison gases according to press accounts some administration evaluations of the available intelligence including reported draft national intelligence estimate nie circulated in october 2002 interpreted the information as inconclusive and as evidence of sporadic but not necessarily ongoing or highlevel contacts between iraq and qaeda 13 some cia experts reportedly asserted that the ideological differences between iraq and qaeda were too large to be bridged permanently14 for example bin laden reportedly sought to raise an islamic army to fight to expel iraqi troops from kuwait following the iraqi invasion in august 1990 suggesting that bin laden might have viewed iraq as an enemy rather than an ally according to some accounts the saudi royal family rebuffed bin ladens idea as unworkable deciding instead to invite in us forces to combat the iraqi invasion the rebuff prompted an open split between bin laden and the saudi leadership and bin laden left the kingdom for sudan in 1991 15 ideological differences between iraq and qaeda were evident in february 12 2003 bin laden statement referring to saddam husseins regimedominated by his secular arab nationalist baath partyas socialist and infidel although the statement also gave some support to the administration argument when bin laden exhorted the iraqi people to resist impending us military action 16 as noted above iraq had an embassy in pakistan that the administration asserts was its link to the taliban regime of afghanistan however skeptics of saddamal qaeda link note that iraq did not recognize the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan when the taliban was in power during 19962001 it was during the period of taliban rule that qaeda enjoyed safehaven in afghanistan of the 12 qaeda leaders identified by the us government in 2003 as either executive leaders or senior planners and coordinators none was an iraqi national17 this suggests that the iraqi nationals did not have the sanction of saddam hussein to join qaeda when he was in power an alternate explanation is that very few iraqis had the opportunity to join qaeda during its key formative year s the years of the antisoviet jihad in afghanistan 19791989 young iraqis who might have been attracted to volunteer in afghanistan were serving in iraqi units during the 198088 iraniraq war and were not available to

administration assertions was the presence in iraq of group called ansar alislam partisans of islam this aspect of the administrations argument factored prominently in secretary of state powells pr esentation and is the most directly relevant to analysis of the qaeda presence in iraq today ansar alislam is considered the forerunner of qaeda in iraq aqi ansar alislam formed in 1998 as breakaway faction of islamist kurds splitting off from group the islamic movement of iraqi kurdistan imik both ansar and the imik were initially composed almost exclusively of kurds us concerns about ansar grew following the us defeat of the taliban and qaeda in afghanistan in late 2001 when some qaeda activists mostly arabs fled to iraq and associated there with the ansar movement at the peak about 600 arab fighters lived in the ansar alislam enclave near the town of khurmal18 ansar fighters clashed with kurdish fighters from the patriotic union of kurdistan puk one of the two mainstream iraqi kurdish parties around halabja in december 2002 ansar gunmen were allegedly responsible for an assassination attempt against puk prime minister of the kurdish region barham salih now deputy prime minister of iraq in april 2002 the leader of the arab contingent within ansar alislam was abu musab alzarqawi an arab of jordanian origin who reputedly fought in afghanistan although more recent assessments indicate zarqawi commanded arab volunteers in afghanista n separate from those recruited by bin laden zarqawi was linked to purported qaeda plots in the 1990s and early 2000s he allegedly was behind

lieutenants baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization ansar alislam that controls this corner of iraq zarqawis activities are not confined to this small corner of northeastern iraq he traveled to baghdad in may 2002 for medical treatment staying in the capital for two months while he recuperated to fight another day during this stay nearly two dozen extremists converged on baghdad and established base of operations there from his terrorist network in iraq zarqawi can direct his network in the middle east and beyond however some accounts question the extent of links if any between baghdad and ansar islam baghdad did not control northern iraq even before operation iraqi freedom oif and it is questionable whether zarqawi were he tied closely to saddam

april 9 2001but did not confirm that he met with iraqi intelligence during those visits the dod memo reportedly also contains reports indicating that iraqi intelligence officers attended or facilitated meetings with qaeda operatives in southeast asia kuala lumpur in early 2000 in the course of these meetings the qaeda activists were said to be planning the october 12 2000 attack on the

major issue facing the united states is the degree to which qaeda elemen ts are threatening the us effort to stabilize postsaddam iraq commenting on the iraq insurgency in its early stages president bush said in speech on september 8 2003 that we have carried the fight to the enemy we are rolling back the terrorist threat to civilization not on the fringes of its influence but at the heart of its power 27 in his january 20 2004 state of the union message president bush said these killers iraq insurgents joined by foreign terrorists are serious continuing danger28 similar statements followed in subsequent years as the administration sought to assert that iraq had become the central front in the broader postseptember 11 war on terrorism and that it is preferable to combat qaeda in iraq rather than allow it to congregate elsewhere in the region and hatch plots inside the united states itself 29 in january 10 2007 major speech announcing the us troop surge president bush made similar points we will continue to pursue qaeda and fore ign fighters qaeda is still active in iraq its home base is anbar province qaeda has helped make anbar the most violent area of iraq outside the capital captured qaeda document describes the terrorists plan to infiltrate and seize control of the province this would bring qaeda closer to its goals of taking down iraqs democracy building radical islamic empire and launching new attacks on the united states at home and abroad in july 24 2007 speech specifically on the issue 30 president bush said our troops areopposing ruthless enemies and enemy is more ruthless in iraq than qaeda they send suicide bombers into crowded markets they behead innocent captives and they murder american troops they want to bring down iraqs democracy so they can use that nation as terrorist safe haven for attacks against our country critics of this view maintain that qaeda or proal qaeda elements were motivated by the us invasion to enter iraq to fight the united states there according to this argument the us presence in iraq has generated new qaeda followersboth inside and outside iraqwho might not have become active against the united states had the war against iraq not occurred this view draws some support from the unclassified key judgments of july 2007 national intelligence estimate nie that said we assess that qaeda central leadership s association with aqi helps qaeda to energize the broader sunni extremist community raise resources and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives including for homeland attacks 31 27 ibid 28 state of the

g350g561other critics maintain that the administration has emphasized an qaeda component of the insurgency as means of bolstering us public support for the war effort in iraq according to this view the administration has repeatedly attempted to link in the public consciousness the iraq war to the september 11 attacks in part because of consistent public support for military component of the overall war on terrorism g3g19g556g11g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g162g561g138g151g141g561g20g152g149g142g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g144g142g151g140g162g561 in analyzing the debate over qaeda involvement in iraq major question is the degree to which aqi has driven the insurgency against us forces and the government of iraq few dispute that there has been from almost the inception of the insurgency in mid2003 foreign fighter component in november 2003 early in the insurgency one senior us commander in iraq 82 nd airborne division commander maj gen charles swannack said in response to reports that foreign fighters were key to the insurgency i want to underscore that most of the attacks on our forces are by former regime loyalists and other iraqis not foreign forces32 at that time other commanders emphasized the foreign fighter role in the insurgency by asserting that the high profile suicide bombings that occurred were having significant impact in undermining us and international confidence in the us ability to stabilize postsaddam iraq as examples of such attacks that caused doubt in the us ability to stabilize iraq commanders cited the august 19 2003 bombing of headquarters in baghdad and the august 29 2003 bombing of major mosque complex in najaf that killed the leader of the large shiite faction supreme council of the islamic revolution in iraq mohammad baqr hakim the group renamed itself in june 2007 as the islamic supreme council of iraq isci as result the united states has consistently focused on combatting abu musab alzarqawi his foreign fighter network in iraq and his successors on march 15 2004 his ansar alislam group was named as foreign terrorist organization under the immigration and nationality act on october 15 2004 the state department named the monotheism and jihad groupthe successor to ansar alislamas an fto the designation said that the monotheism group wasresponsible for the headquarters bombing in baghdad 33 later that month perhaps in response to that designation zarqawi changed the name of his organization to qaeda jihad organization in the land of two rivers mes opotamia iraqcommonly known now as qaeda in iraq or aqi the fto designation was applied to the new name along with the designations came stepped up us military efforts to find and capture or kill zarqawi there were several reported near

attackattributed to ansar alsunna by the state department country reports on terrorism 2006 released april 2 007 by the state department office of the coordinator for counterterrorismwas the december

g3g19g556g11g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g162g561 before his death zarqawi had largely set aqis strategy as an effort to provoke all out civil war between the newly dominant shiite arabs and the formerly preeminent sunni arabs in this strategy zarqawi apparently calculated that provoking civil war could at the very least undermine shiite efforts to consolidate their political control of postsaddam iraq if fully successful the strategy could compel us forces to leave iraq by undermining us public support for the war effort and thereby leaving the shiite government vulnerable to continued aq i and sunni insurgent attack the strategy might have been controversial among qaeda circles as evidenced by purported letter if genuine from the number two qaeda leader ayman zawahiri to zarqawi in july 2005 in that letter zawahiri questioned zarqawis strategy in iraq by arguing that committing violence against shiite civilians and religious establishments would undermine the support of the iraqi people for aqi and the sunni resistance more broadly 36 to implement its strategy aqi under zarqawi focused primarily on spectacular suicide bombings intended to cause mass shiite casualties or to destroy sites sacred to shiites several suicide bombings were conducted in 2005 against shiite celebrations causing mass casualties the most significant attack the february 22 2006 bombing of the shiite golden mosque in sunniinhabited samarra salahuddin province wi dely attributed to aqi the attack largely destroyed the golden dome of the mosque it touched off widespread shiite reprisals against sunnis nationwide and is widely considered to have started the civil war that raged from the time of the bombing until late 2007 when it began to abate on several occasions president bush has said that zarqawi largely succeeded in his strategy although he and other senior administration officials did not even at the heig ht of the violence in late 2006 characterize the iraq as in state of civil war aqis most lethal attack and the single deadliest attack of the war to date was the august 2007 truck bombings of yazidi villages near sinjar in northern iraq killing an estimated 500 persons mostly yazidis by the end of 2006 and in early 2007 most senior us officials were identifying aqi as driving force or even the driving force of the insurgency in his threat assessment

of the suicide bombings in iraq and that defeating it was main focus of us operations some us commanders said that while most foreign fighters going to iraq become suicide bombers others are contributing to the overall insurgency as snipers logisticians and financiers37 however other us commanders notedand continue to notethat these major bombings constituted small percentage of overall attacks in iraq which in early 2007 numbered about 175 per day and that most of the us combat deaths came from roadside bombs and direct or indirect munitions fire likely wielded by iraqi sunni insurgent fighters

administration and outside that us policy was failing to produce stability the deterioration in the previous us strategy was attributed in part to the burgeoning sectarian violence that aqi had helped set off the cornerstone of the new strategy was to increase the number of us troops in baghdad and in anbar province in order to be able to protect the civilian population rather than conduct combat operations against militants the us troop surge reached full strength in june 2007 the us troop surge was intended to try to take advantage of growing rift within the broad insurgency that was being observed by us commanders in iraq as early as mid2005 the zarqawi strategy of attempting to provoke civil war and some of its ideology and practices in the sunni areas were not universally popular among iraqs sunnis even among some sunni insurgent groups strategically iraqi sunnis have discernible political goals in iraq and some aqi tactics such as attacks on shiite civilians were perceived as preventing future power sharing compromise with the shiites aqi fighters have broader goals such as defeating the united states and establishing sunniled islamic state in iraq that could expand throughout the region iraqi sunni insurgents believed that attacks should be confined to combatant targets iraqi government forces most of which are shiite iraqi government representatives and us and other coalition forces other iraqi sunnis resented aqi practices in the regions where aqi fighters congregated including reported enforcement of strict islamic law segregation by sex forcing males to wear beards and banning all alcohol sales and consumption in some cases according to variety of press reports aqi fighters killed iraqi sunnis who violated these strictures other sunnis particularly tribal leaders involved in trade and commerce believed that the constant fighting provoked by aqi was depriving iraqi sunnis of their livelihoods others believe that the strains between aqi and iraqi sunni insurgent fighters were competition for power and control over the insurgency according to this view iraqi s unni leaders more wanted to be dominated by foreign sunnis than they did by iraqi shiites or us soldiers during 20032006 these strains were mostly muted as iraqi sunnis cooperated with aqi toward the broader goal of overturning the shiitedominated usbacked power structure in iraq

103000 of which about 80 are sunnis the 20 who are shiites are opposed to shiite extremist groups such as that of moqtada sadr to retain the loyalty of the sons of iraq us officials are trying to fold them into the official iraqi security forces isf which would then pay their salaries however the shiitedominated maliki government fears that the sunni fighters are trying to burrow into the isf with the intent of regaining power in iraq and have only agreed to accept about 35000 sons of iraq fighters onto the isf payrolls not all of which are sunni us commanders say that this hesitation by the maliki government risks driving the sunnis back into insurgent ranks and back into cooperation with aqi some sons of iraq have already abandoned their positions out of frustration particularly in diyala province although they have not necessarily resumed insurgent activity by june 2007 at the height of the us troop surge gen petraeus called security improvements in anbar breathtaking and said that security incidents in the province had declined by about 90 he and other commanders reported an ability to walk incident free although with security in downtown ramadi city that had been major battleground only months earlier and which us military intelligence experts reportedly had given up as lost in late 2006 general petraeus testified in april 2008 that he estimates that anbar province could be turned over to provincial iraqi control by july 2008 although the handover has been delayed by power struggle between the awakening tribal figures and the more urban established iraqi sunni parties such as the iraqi islamic party iip the positive trends observed in anbar encouraged other antiaqi sunnis to join the awakening movement in may 2007 diyala salvation council was formed in diyala province of tribal leaders who wanted to stabilize that restive province in early 2007 amiriyah was highly violent but was stabilized by the emergence of former s unni insurgents now

military established supported this trend in the course of the baghdad security plan troop surge by establishing about 100 combat outposts including 33 joint security stations in partnership with the isf to clear neighborhoods of aqi and to encourage the population to come forward with information about aqi hideouts prime minister maliki said on february 16 2008 that aqi had been largely driven out of baghdad and assessment that has not been subsequently contradicted by us officials gen petraeus attempted to increase the momentum of the awakening movement and the sons of iraq program with

general petraeus appeared before four committees of congress during april 89 2008 to discuss progress in iraq 40 he testified that the assistance from the sons of iraq coupled with relentless pursuit of aqi by us forces had reduced substantially the threat posed by aqi on may 10 2008 cia director michael hayden said qaed is on the verge of strategic defeat in iraq because of its reduced presence and activity in large parts of iraq on august 10 2008 gen james conway commandant of the marine corps told journalists that aqi had permanently lost its foothold in large parts of iraq that it is longer welcomed by sunni populations in iraq and theat aqi fighters had begun to shift their focus to afghanistan where their efforts against the united states might be more effective in late july 2008 reputed aqi leader in anbar told the washington post that aqi leader abu ayyub almasri had left iraq to go to afghanistan or to the border areas of pakistan where qaeda leaders are believed to be hiding on the other hand general petraeus testified and has said in other settings that aqi remains highly active in and around mosul and views mosul as key to its survival in iraq because it is astride the entry routes from syria he testified that aqi is still capable of lethal attacks and that the united states must maintain relentless pressure on the organization on the networks outside iraq that support it and on the resource fl ows that sustain it he also testified that qaedas senior leaders still view iraq as the central front in their global strategy and send funding direction and foreign fighters to iraq on august 12 2008 the us national intelligence officer for transnational threats ted gistaro in prepared remarks told washington dc research institute washington institute for near east policy that despite setbacks in iraq aqi remains qaedas most prominent and lethal regional affiliate while qaeda leaders likely see the declining effectiveness of aqi as vulnerability to their global recruiting and fundraising efforts they likely continue to see the fight in iraq as important to their battle with the united states osama bin laden and qaeda deputy leader ayman alzawahiri since late 2007 have issued eight statements to rally supporters donors and prospective fighters by publicly portraying the iraq jihad as part of wider regional cause to liberate jerusalem

about the contribution of the foreign fighters to the overall violence in iraq estimates of the numbers of foreign fighters have remained fairly consistent over time at least as percentage of the

5000 10000 making it the largest sunni extremist group in iraq this estimate is somewhat higher than what many experts might expect in light of the official us command assessments of the weakening of aqi by us operations and strategy another issue is the rate of flow of foreign figh ters into iraq us commanders said in july 2007 that approximately 6080 foreign fighters come across the border every month primarily the iraqsyria border to participate in the iraq insurgency 43 press reports say that us commanders estimate that the flow slowed to about 40 in october 2007 in part because of us raid in september 2007 on desert camp at sinjar need the syrian border that was the hub of operations to smuggle foreign fighters into iraq 44 general petraeus testified in april 2008 that about 50 70 foreign fighters were still coming across the syrian border into iraq and that syria has taken some steps to reduce the flow of foreign fighters through its territory but not enough to shut down the key network that supports aqi in june and july 2008 us commanders estimate the flow at about 2030 fighters per month another issue is the specific nationalities of the foreigners one press report in july 2007 quoting us officials in iraq said that about 40 of the foreign fighters in iraq are of saudi origin45 the november 22 2007 new york times article cited above says that saudi arabia and libya accounted for 60 of the 700 foreign fighters who came into iraq over the past year that article was consistent with the findings of study produced by the combating terrorism center of west point

significant aqi relocations to the pakistan tribal areas bordering afghanistan are correct this would suggest that the links are tightening between aqi and qaedas central leadership as represented by osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri both qaeda leaders are widely believed to be hiding in areas of pakistan near the border with afghanistan and many assessments since 2007 say that qaeda is enjoying increasing freedom of movement and action in the border regions if qaedas ranks are now augmented by an influx of aqi fighters from the iraq battlefront it could be argued that qaedas overall

qaeda involvement in the insurgency in afghanistan beyond financing and logistical facilitation although it is not certain whether any of this added assistance to the afghan insurgency is coming from

border is discussed in crs report rl30588 afghanistan postwar governance security and us policy by kenneth katzman on the other hand as noted above the fact that aqi fighters and leaders are leaving iraq represents blow to qaeda and could weaken its ability to recruit new adherents the links between aqi and qaedas central leadership might be tightening but they are not new as discussed above on july 24 2007 president bush devoted much of speech to the argument that aqi is closely related to qaedas central leadership the president noted the following details including in 2004 zarqawi formally joined qaeda and pledged allegiance to bin laden bin laden then publicly declared that za rqawi was the prince of qaeda in iraq president bush stated that accord ing to us intelligence zarqawi had met both bin laden and zawahiri he asserted later in the speech that according to us intelligence aqi is full member of the qaeda terrorist network after zarqawis death bin laden sent an aide named abd alhadi aliraqi to help zarqawis successor almasri but aliraqi was captured before reaching iraq that captured aqi leader an iraqi named khalid almashhadani had told us authorities that baghdadi was fictitious in july 2007 brig gen bergner us military spokesman told journalists that mashhadani is an intermediary between almasri and bin laden and zawahiri that aqi is the only insurgent group in iraq with stated ambitions to make the country base for attacks outside iraq referring to the november 9 2005 terrorist attacks on hotels in zarqawis native jordan president bush said aqi dispatched terrorists who bombed wedding reception in jordan referring to an august 2005 incident he said aqi sent operatives to jordan where they attempted to launch rocket attack on us navy ships docked at the port of aqaba some experts believe that links between qaedas central leadership and aqi have been tenuous and that the few operatives linking the two do not demonstrate an ongoing substantial relationship others point to the zawahiri admonishment of zarqawi discussed above as evidence that there is not close connection between the two still others have maintained that there is little evidence that aqi seeks to attack broadly outside iraq and that those incidents that have taken place have been in jordan where zarqawi might have wanted to try to undermine king abdullah ii whom zarqawi opposed as too close to the united states since the 2005 attacks noted above there have not been any attacks outside iraq that can be directly attributed to aqi
