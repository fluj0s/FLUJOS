the formal nomination to the senate there are number of steps in this stage of the process for most senateconfirmed positions first with the assistance of and preliminary vetting by the white house

oversees the clearance process which often includes background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of inves tigation fbi internal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the office of the c ounsel to the president has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and clearance stage is ofte n the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays pa rticularly if many candidates are being processed as at the beginning of an ad ministration or if c onflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between new presidents inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team recent amendments to the presidential transitions act of 19635 encourage presidentselect to submit for security clearance potential nominees to highlevel national security positions as soon as possi ble after the election6 for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by cu stom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state if neither senator is from the presidents party he usually defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from nators of the opposition party because of their positions in the senate before maki ng nomination to federal position at the state or national level the president would likely consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nominee has legal authority to assu the duties and re sponsibilities of the position the authority comes with senate confirmation and pres idential appointment nominee who is hired by the agency as consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumstances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee recess appointment to the position see below recess appointments may have po litical consequences however particularly if senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role some senateconfirmed positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the vacancies

confirmation or s econd stage the senate alone determines whether or not to confirm nomination8 the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the impor tance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy impli cations generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy9 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination the senate confirmation process is centered at the committee level committee nomination activity generally includes inve stigation hearing and reporting stages as part of investigatory work committees may draw on information provided by the white house as well as information collected by the committees hearings provide public forum to discuss nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be res ponsible even if confirmation is thought to be virtual certainty hearings may provide senators and the nominee with an opportunity to go on the record with partic ular views or commitment s senators may use hearings to explore nominees qualifications articulate policy perspective or raise related oversight issues some committees hold hearings on nearly all nominations others hold hearings for only some the committee may discontinue acting on nomination at any point upon referral after investigation or after hearing if the committee votes to report the nomination back to the full senate it has three options it may report the nomination to the senate favorably unfavorably or without r ecommendation if the committee elects not to report nomination the nate may under certain circumstances discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor10 although the senate conf irms most nominations some are not confirmed rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee occur for variety of reas ons including opposition to the nomination an inadequate amount of time for considera tion of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of th nomination if nomination is not acted upon by the senate by the end of congress it is returned to the president pending nominations also may be returned automatically to

recess appoi ntments during each recess presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment pow er to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess ppointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes r ecess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the r ecess appointee may not be pa id from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the nd of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given rece ss appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the nd of the session and nother individual was given the recess appointment recess ppointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of th next session of the senate13 for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending14 in addition although recess appointees whose nominations to full term are subsequently rejected by the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32906crs6 15pl 108447 div h 609 118 stat 3274 th

congress has provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring senate confirma tion under the federal vacancies reform act of 199816 when an executive agency position requiring confirmation becomes vacant it may be filled temporar ily in one of three ways 1 the first assistant to such position may automatically assume the functions and duties of the office 2 the president may direct an officer in any agency who is occupying position requiring senate confirmation to perform those tasks or 3 the president may select any officer or employee of the subject agency who is occupying position for which the rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay at the gs15 level and who has been with the agency for at least 90 of the preceding 365 days the temporary appointment is for 210 days but th time restriction is suspended if first or second nomination for the position is pe nding in addition during presidential transition the 210day restric tion period does not begin until either 90 days after the president assumes office or 90 days after the vacancy occurs if it is within the 90 day inauguration period the act does not apply to positions on multiheaded regulatory boards and commissions or to certain other specific positions which may be filled temporar ily under other statutory provisions17 appointments during the 108th
