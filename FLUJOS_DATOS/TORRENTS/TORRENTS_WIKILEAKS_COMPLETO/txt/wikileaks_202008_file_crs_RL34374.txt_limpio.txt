government and finance division estate tax legislation in the 110th congress summary under provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 the estate tax exemption is scheduled to continue to rise from 2 million for decedents dying in 2008 to 35 million in 2009 the estate tax is repealed for decedents dying in 2010 only the gift tax is to remain in place in 2010 with an exclusion of 1 million in addition when the estate tax is repealed in 2010 there is scheduled to be significant change in the method used to determine the basis of all capital assets transferred at death from stepup in basis to modified carryover basis the estate tax provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset at the end of 2010 that explains why the repeal of the estate tax is currently scheduled to last for only one year if congress does not change the law beforehand on january 1 2011 estate and gift tax law will return to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted the unified estate and gift tax will be reinstated with combined exclusion of 1 million the maximum tax rate will revert from 45 in 20072009 to 55 these large yeartoyear differences in the estate tax law mean that wealthy individuals face wide and erratic variation in their potential estate tax liability over the next four years 20082011 depending upon which year they might happen to die following egtrra in each of the past three congresses the house passed bill to permanently repeal the estate tax but the senate did not pass any legislation addressing the estate tax in the second session of the 109th congress the house also passed two bills that would have modified and retained the estate tax the concurrent budget resolution for fy2009 approved by the senate on june 4 and the house on june 5 2008 provides budget room for extending the 2009 estate tax law with an exclusion of 35 million per decedent and top tax rate of 45 but separate legislation must be enacted in order to change the tax law thus far in the 110th congress eight bills to permanently repeal the estate tax have been introduced in the house and four in the senate seven bills to retain but modify the estate tax have been introduced in the house and two in the senate the repeal bills differ on whether or not they would preserve the other changes made by egtrra to the taxation of gifts and the basis for inherited assets the modification bills differ on the level of the exemption what year it would take effect whether or not it would be indexed for inflation and whether any unused exemption could be carried over to the estate of the surviving spouse they also differ on the tax rates whether special relief would be given to familyowned farms or businesses and whether the gift tax would be defined separately from or unified with the estate tax the treasury departments february 2008 estimates show the annual revenue loss from total repeal of the estate tax rising steadily from 58 billion in fy2012 up to 84 billion in fy2018 although estate and gift taxes account for less than 2 of federal revenue permanent repeal of the estate tax accounts for one quarter of the estimated revenue loss

exclusion and approximate tax on taxable estate of 4 million 2008 to 2011 and beyond 1 table 2 treasury department and jct estimates of revenue losses from permanent repeal of the estate tax 12 estate tax legislation in the 110th congress underlying issues there are several reasons why congress might address the estate tax sooner rather than later the law governing the estate tax over the next four years is highly erratic the applicable exclusion amount popularly known as the exemption under the estate tax is 2 million for people who die in 2008 the exclusion is scheduled to rise to 35 million in 2009 the estate tax is repealed for people who die in 2010 only then because the current law governing the estate tax is scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 the estate tax is set to be reinstated in 2011 with an exclusion of 1 million per person for 2011 and beyond these changes result in dramatic variations in the potential estate tax liability depending upon which year wealthy person might happen to die as shown in table 1 the approximate estate tax due on taxable estate of 4 million for example would be 900000 if the owner died in 2008 225000 in 2009 0 in 2010 and 1495000 in 2011 and subsequent years furthermore there is uncertainty about the law that may govern in future years it is difficult for individuals and families to do longterm tax planning for their estates under law which contains such large yeartoyear differences table 1 estate tax exclusion and approximate tax on taxable estate of 4 million 2008 to 2011 and beyond year of estate tax top approximate

source tax liability calculated by crs see crs report rl33718 calculating estate tax liability 2001 to 2011 and beyond by nonna noto the taxable estate is equal to the gross estate the aggregate value of assets minus eligible deductions including administrative expenses of the estate state death taxes debts charitable bequests and transfers to the surviving spouse the tax liability is described as approximate because other items could affect the final calculation for example not taken into account here are gift taxes that may already have been paid on lifetime taxable gifts and foreign taxes paid on the estate crs2 such large differences in anticipated estate tax liability could even influence the timing of deaths or at least the officially recorded date of death1 indeed there is evidence that when australia eliminated its estate tax on july 1 1979 over half of those who would have paid the estate tax in its last week of operation managed to avoid doing so2 taking this evidence into account congress may choose to address the estate tax well before the tax is repealed on january 1 2010 and before the estate tax provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 sunset on december 31 2011 bills addressing the estate tax generally fall into one of two categories those that would permanently repeal the tax and those that would retain the tax but modify it here are some of the hotly debated claims commonly made by opponents and proponents respectively of the estate tax supporters of permanently repealing the estate tax maintain that the tax reduces savings and investment thereby reducing longterm economic growth is form of double taxation taxing money that has already been subject to the income tax leads wealthy individuals to undertake economically unproductive efforts and expenses in order to reduce their potential tax liability and unduly burdens family farms and businesses3 and penalizes successful entrepreneurship supporters of maintaining the estate tax argue that the tax does not significantly discourage saving and investment is an important component of progressive tax system is needed to break up the concentration and dynastic transmission of wealth is backup for capital gains taxes not collected on the increase in asset values during decedents lifetime encourages charitable bequests generates revenue that helps reduce the federal budget deficit and 1 wojciech kopczuk and joel slemrod dying to save taxes evidence from estatetax returns on the death elasticity review of economics and statistics vol 85 2 may

businesses economic issues by jane g gravelle and steven maguire cites evidence from estate tax returns filed in 2006 crs3 can help states levy estate or inheritance taxes4 if the choice is to repeal the estate tax questions still remain as to whether assets transferred at death should have carryover basis or stepup in basis5 and whether there should be gift tax the definition of basis has important implications for the capital gains tax liability of heirs when they sell an inherited asset the presence of gift tax protects the income tax but discourages the transfer of assets during persons lifetime if the choice is to retain the estate tax but modify it there are numerous design elements to consider in addition to setting the level of the exclusion there are the questions of whether the dollar amount should be indexed for inflation and whether any unused exclusion should carry over to the surviving spouse to date little attention has been given to the tax rate structure is it important to have schedule of several graduated tax rates instead of just one or two rates at high level should the thresholds between the rate brackets be indexed for inflation should the estate tax rate be established on its own or should it be set in terms of another tax rate such as the top income tax rate or the rate on longterm capital gains should there be special treatment for familyowned farms and businesses should there be credit or deduction for state death taxes should there also be gift tax and if so should it be separate from or unified with the estate tax it may also be appropriate to design an estate tax that is consistent with income tax policy toward saving and toward income from investments the underlying economic question is what is the optimal way to tax assets transferred at death current law the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 title v of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 enacted june 7 2001 gradually phased out the estate tax by raising the applicable exclusion amount or exemption under the estate tax in large increments the exclusion increased from 675000 in 2001 before egtrra to 1 million for decedents who died in 2002 or 2003 15 million for 2004 or 2005 and 2 million for 20062008 the exclusion is scheduled to rise one last time to 35 million in 2009 then the estate tax and generationskipping transfer gst tax are repealed for 2010 only because the provisions of egtrra sunset on december 31 2010 the gift tax is to remain in place in 2010 with cumulative lifetime exclusion amount of 1 million and with maximum marginal tax rate of 35 this is equal to the highest rate for the individual income tax in 2006 and thereafter under egtrra in addition when the estate tax is repealed in 2010 there is scheduled to be significant change in the method used to determine the basis of capital assets 4 for further discussion of these arguments see crs report rl30600 estate and gift taxes economic issues by donald j marples and jane g gravelle 5 see pages 45 for an explanation of stepup and carryover basis crs4 transferred at death from stepup in basis to modified carryover basis the basis is the cost of capital asset that is subtracted from the sales proceeds in order to calculate the capital gain that is subject to income tax after an asset is sold6 under the law in place through 2009 and scheduled to resume in 2011 step up in basis rule applies to assets transferred at death7 under this rule the cost basis of an asset is set at the value of the asset on the decedents date of death8 if the heir sells the asset his or her capital gain is calculated as the difference between the sales price and the steppedup basis not the decedents original purchase price which is called the carryover basis the effect of this practice is to permanently forgive the income tax liability on the increase in value of the asset the capital gain during the decedents period of ownership9 the estate tax is sometimes defended as substitute for the capital gains tax at death10 consistent with this argument an important tradeoff that egtrra made for the repeal of the estate tax in 2010 was the return to carryover basis for assets transferred at death11 however two important exceptions were made in what is called modified carryover basis an aggregate stepup in basis of 13 million per decedent12 is permitted in the original adjusted basis of assets transferred at death 60000 for nonresident aliens an additional stepup of up to 3 million is permitted for assets transferred to surviving spouse these dollar amounts are indexed for inflation13 the executor of the estate is left with the task of allocating the stepup allowance to specific assets 6 for detailed explanation written before egtrra was enacted see crs report rl30875 stepup vs carryover basis for capital gains implications for estate tax repeal by nonna noto april 20 2001 7 irc section 1014 relating to the basis of property acquired from decedent 8 or the value may be determined as of the alternate valuation date six months after the date of death if that value is lower 9 for an asset that has decreased in value since the decedent purchased it such as an automobile or stocks or real estate after decline in the market the steppedup basis can be lower than the original cost as consequence of the stepup in basis rule the loss in value during the decedents period of ownership cannot be claimed as capital loss when an inherited asset is sold 10 for discussion of this tradeoff written prior to the enactment of egtrra see crs report rl30875 stepup vs carryover basis for capital gains implications for estate tax repeal by nonna noto april 20 2001 11 for property acquired from someone dying after december 31 2009 the basis for the person acquiring the property is to be the lesser of 1 the adjusted basis of the decedent or 2 the fair market value of the property at the date of the decedents death under both prior law and egtrra property transferred by gift during the donors life has carryover basis 12 this limit may be increased by the amount of unused builtin losses and loss carryovers that the decedent may have had 13 the minimum increments are 100000 for the 13 million amount 6000 for the 60000 amount and 250000 for the 3 million amount crs5 these basis offsets apply to the net increase in value of the assets not the gross value of the assets thus the 13 million stepup might cover all the gains in gross estate valued at 2 million or 3 million or more the spousal stepup of 3 million alone could cover the gains in an estate with gross value of 4 million or 5 million or more the practical effect of these two exceptions to carryover basis is to maintain stepup in basis for smaller estates note that whatever basisvaluation rule is in effect for the year of death applies to all capital assets transferred after any persons death whether or not their estate is large enough to be liable for the estate tax as mentioned above the estate tax repeal and all other provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset at the end of 201014 if congress does not change the law beforehand on january 1 2011 estate and gift tax law will return to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted the unified estate and gift tax will be reinstated with combined exemption of 1 million15 the special deduction for qualified familyowned business interests qfobi will be restored with value of 13 million in combination with the applicable exclusion amount the maximum tax rate will revert from 45 in 2007 through 2009 to 55 with 5 surtax on taxable estate values over 100 million and up to 17184 million stepup in basis will again be the rule main differences among the bills in the 110th congress variety of bills to either repeal or modify the estate tax have been introduced in the 110th congress in addition six amendments offered to the senate budget resolution for fy2009 sconres 70 proposed to modify the estate tax brief summary of each of these bills and proposed amendments is presented in later sections of this report this section discusses the bills and proposed amendments grouped according to their major distinguishing characteristics 14 title ix or section 901 of egtrra states that the provisions of the act do not apply after december 31 2010 the text of the sunset clause is as follows title ix compliance with congressional budget act sec 901 sunset of provisions of act in general all provisions of and amendments made by this act shall not apply 1 to taxable plan or limitation years beginning after december 31 2010 or 2 in the case of title v to estates of decedents dying gifts made or generation skipping transfers after december 31 2010 b application of certain laws the internal revenue code of 1986 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 shall be applied and administered to years estates gifts and transfers described in subsection as if the provisions and amendments described in subsection had never been enacted 15 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 provided for an applicable exclusion amount or exemption of 1 million for 2006 and beyond crs6 bills to permanently repeal the estate tax the bills to permanently repeal the estate tax differ in four main ways one is whether or not they would preserve the other changes made by egtrra to the taxation of gifts and inherited assets second is whether the extension of estate tax repeal is part of broader effort to extend the income tax cuts enacted by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 and the jobs and growth tax relief and reconciliation act of 2003 pl 10827 third is whether the repeal of the estate tax is part of fundamental tax reform effort to replace the income tax and possibly the payroll tax with some form of consumption based tax fourth is when permanent repeal would take effect preserving other changes made by egtrra the taxation of gifts and the use of modified carryover basis for inherited assets some bills to permanently repeal the estate and generationskipping transfer gst taxes take the approach of repealing the sunset provision of egtrra with respect to title v these bills would thereby also preserve the other changes to the taxation of gifts and bequests made by egtrra among these changes are the modified gift tax and the modified carryover basis instead of stepup in basis for assets transferred at death hr 411 mario diazbalart and hr 2380 hulshof would remove the sunset provision of egtrra other bills to permanently repeal the estate and gst taxes take the approach of repealing subtitle b of the internal revenue code of 1986 estate and gift taxes these bills would allow egtrra to sunset this would have the effect of repealing other changes made by egtrra to parts of the internal revenue code other than subtitle b such as the modified carryover basis treatment of assets transferred at death repealing subtitle b would repeal the gift tax in addition to repealing the estate tax and the generationskipping transfer tax the stepup in basis treatment for assets acquired from decedent would remain as provided in subtitle income taxes of the internal revenue code hr 25 linder hr 1040 burgess hr 1586 thornberry hr 5105 dreier hr 6110 ryan s 1025 chambliss s 1040 shelby s 1081 specter and s 2547 bond would all repeal subtitle b still another approach to permanently repealing the estate tax is to amend the us constitution hjres 23 paul proposes an amendment that would prohibit congress from levying taxes on personal incomes estates and gifts this would repeal not only the estate and gift taxes but also the individual income tax modified gift tax under the provisions of egtrra gift tax is retained even when the estate tax and generationskipping transfer tax are repealed in 2010 the main reason given for maintaining the gift tax when the estate tax is repealed is to protect income tax revenues the gift tax is intended to discourage people from giving incomegenerating or appreciated assets to someone in lower income tax bracket andor with offsetting losses who face lower income taxes in the case of appreciated property the donee could sell the assets and pay lower capital gains tax rate than the donor and then gift or bequeath the sales proceeds back to the original donor crs7 if subtitle b of the internal revenue code irc were repealed the gift tax would be repealed along with the estate tax and gst tax hr 25 linder hr 1040 burgess hr 1586 thornberry hr 5105 dreier s 1025 chambliss s 1040 shelby s 1081 specter and s 2547 bond would all repeal subtitle b the gift tax would also be repealed under the constitutional amendment proposed in hjres 23 paul if instead the sunset clause of egtrra were repealed the gift tax as modified by egtrra would remain in effect after 2010 the cumulative lifetime exclusion amount for any one donor would be 1 million16 this amount is not indexed for inflation the top gift tax rate is scheduled to fall from 45 to 35 in 201017 the modified gift tax would continue after 2010 under hr 411 mario diazbalart and hr 2380 hulshof if the provisions of egtrra are permitted to sunset and we return to prior law the unified estate and gift tax exclusion would be 1 million the maximum estate and gift tax rate would return to 55 for taxable gifts and bequests combined with 5 surtax over the 100 million to 17184 million range modified carryover basis at death for capital gains purposes if the sunset provision were repealed with respect to title v of egtrra then the modified carryover basis rules introduced by egtrra would continue in effect after 2010 when the estate tax is permanently repealed hr 411 mario diazbalart and hr 2380 hulshof would remove the sunset provision of egtrra if egtrra is permitted to sunset then the tax law would revert to the stepup in basis rules found in subtitle section 1012 of the internal revenue code the return to stepup in basis would also hold if the estate tax were permanently repealed by repealing subtitle b of the internal revenue code with accompanying changes in the basis rules hr 25 linder hr 1040 burgess hr 1586 thornberry hr 5105 dreier s 1025 chambliss s 1040 shelby s 1081 specter and s 2547 bond would all repeal subtitle b part of fundamental tax reform several of the bills to implement fundamental tax reform would repeal the estate and gift taxes proponents generally indicate that the intent of these proposals is to favor savings and investment relative 16 this lifetime exclusion is in addition to the annual exclusion available for gifts of up to 12000 in 2008 indexed for inflation per donor per donee irc section 2503b there is also an exclusion from the gift tax for qualified transfers of payments for tuition or medical expenses on behalf of another individual section 2503e or transfers to political organizations as defined in section 527e1 for use by those organizations section 2501a4 17 the 35 maximum rate on gifts is equal to the maximum tax rate on individual income scheduled by egtrra for tax year 2006 and subsequent years for fuller explanation of the gift tax provisions of egtrra see crs report rl31061 estate and gift tax law changes under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by nonna noto january 29 2002 crs8 to consumption18 repealing estate and gift taxes is theoretically consistent with consumptionbased tax system under such system bequests and gifts would be taxed not when transferred or received but only when the proceeds are spent by recipients companion bills hr 25 linder and s 1025 chambliss would repeal the estate and gift taxes along with the income selfemployment and payroll taxes these taxes would be replaced with national sales tax five bills would restructure the income tax in addition to repealing the estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes these include hr 1040 burgess hr 6110 ryan s1040 shelby s 1081 specter and companion bills hr 5105 dreier and s2547 bond hjres 23 paul proposes an amendment to the constitution that would repeal the sixteenth amendment to the constitution and thereby deny congress the power to levy personal income taxes along with estate and gift taxes extending other tax cuts made in 2001 and 2003 permanent repeal of the estate tax could be part of broader bill to make other tax cuts permanent the bush administrations budget for fy2009 once again proposes to make permanent the tax cuts enacted in 2001 pl 10716 and 2003 pl 10827 repealing the estate tax was just one of those tax cuts in addition to permanently repealing the estate tax and generationskipping transfer tax hr 411 mario diazbalart would make permanent five individual income tax provisions which are currently scheduled to expire19 companion bills hr 5105 dreiers 2547 bond would make all of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax acts permanent by repealing the sunset provisions of those acts when permanent repeal would take effect in the bills that remove the sunset provision with respect to title v of egtrra the repeal of the estate and generationskipping transfer taxes would first take effect in 2010 as scheduled by egtrra the bills would simply extend the repeal into the years 2011 and beyond these bills include hr 411 mario diazbalart and hr 2380 hulshof the bills to repeal subtitle b of the internal revenue code estate and gift taxes would typically take effect earlier hr 1586 thornberry would take effect upon enactment hr 1040 burgess s 1040 shelby and s 1081 specter would take effect in 2008 companion bills hr 25 linders 1025 chambliss and hr 5105 dreiers 2547 bond and hr 6110 ryan all would take effect in 2009 18 for more information on these proposals see crs report rl34343 tax reform an overview of proposals in the 110th congress and crs report 98529 flat tax an overview of the hallrabushka proposal both by james m bickley 19 these are the deduction for state and local sales taxes the modifications to the child credit marriage penalty relief the deduction for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers and the deduction for tuition and related expenses crs9 the abolition of personal income estate and gift taxes under hjres 23 paul would not take effect until possibly 2018 the resolution allows seven years for ratification of the proposed constitutional amendment plus three years for the ensuing changes in tax law to take effect bills to retain modified version of the tax number of bills as well as six amendments proposed to the senate budget resolution for fy2009 would retain the estate tax but would modify the tax in diverse ways the following discussion highlights the major differences among these bills and proposed amendments in the design of future estate tax fewer details are available about the amendments compared to the bills repeal of elements of egtrra most of the bills to modify and retain the estate tax would repeal the provisions of egtrra that repeal the estate and generationskipping transfer taxes in 2010 and that replace the stepup in basis with carryover basis at that time these include hr 3170 mitchell hr 3475 capuano hr 4235 lowey hr 4172 moore and s 3049 alexander several of the bills would reunify the estate and gift taxes thereby subjecting estates and lifetime gifts to the same unified tax credit exemption and the same tax rates these bills would repeal the separate provisions of egtrra regarding the gift tax these include hr 3170 mitchell hr 3475 capuano hr 4235 lowey and s 3049 alexander but some of the bills would leave in place the separate gift tax created by egtrra and prevent the sunset provision from applying to it such as hr 4172 moore in addition under hr 3170 mitchell the december 31 2010 sunset date would continue to apply to the three subtitles of egtrra regarding conservation easements modifications to the generationskipping transfer tax and the extension of time for payment of the estate tax hr 3170 also would repeal egtrras deduction for state death taxes exclusion amount the bills differ on the level of the applicable exclusion amount per decedent what year it would take effect whether or not it would be indexed for inflation and whether any unused exclusion could be carried over to the estate of the surviving spouse hr 4235 lowey would raise the estate tax exclusion to 3 million upon enactment after 2007 the 3 million amount would be indexed for inflation hr 4042 mcnerney expects that the estate tax will be repealed in 2010 in the meantime it would accelerate the phaseout of the estate tax by raising the exclusion to 35 million in 2008 instead of 2009 as currently scheduled the 35 million figure would be indexed for inflation in 2009 the repeal of the gst tax would be accelerated to 2008 hr 4242 pomeroy would raise the estate tax exclusion to 3 million for 2007 and 2008 and set it at 35 million for 2009 and beyond the exclusion amount is not indexed for inflation crs10 hr 4172 moore would increase the estate tax exclusion to 35 million effective in 2008 and index it for inflation each year thereafter s 3049 alexander would set the exclusion at 35 million indexed for inflation after 2009 hr 3475 capuano would increase the unified estate and gift tax credit to an exclusionequivalent of 5 million per decedent effective in 2010 and index it for inflation each year thereafter hr 3170 mitchell would raise the unified estate and gift tax exclusion amount in annual increments of 250000 over six years the exclusion would be 375 million for people dying in 2010 and would reach 5 million for 2015 the 5 million amount would be indexed for inflation each year after 2015 hr 3170 is the only bill to provide that the deceased spouse unused exclusion amount could be carried over to the estate of the surviving spouse among the six estate tax amendments offered to sconres 70 only the baucus amendment samdt 4160 the one that was adopted endorsed an exemption of 35 million per decedent the other five proposed amendments all endorsed an exemption of 5 million per decedent tax rates s 3049 alexander would levy single rate of 15 on gifts and estates under hr 3170 mitchell the rate of tax on the first 25 million of taxable estate would be equal to the maximum capital gains tax rate in effect on the decedents date of death the amount in excess of 25 million would be taxed at twice that rate the 25 million figure separating the two tax brackets would be indexed for inflation gifts would be subject to the same tax rates hr 4235 lowey would reduce each of the marginal estate tax rates by 20 by onefifth not 20 percentage points hr 4242 pomeroy would freeze the maximum estate tax rate at its 2005 level of 47 for taxable amounts over 2 million the bill would restore the 5 surtax on taxable amounts over 10 million up to the estate value sufficient to phase out the savings from the unified credit exclusion amount as well as the graduated tax rates hr 4042 mcnerney would establish 45 as the maximum tax rate for 2008 and 2009 and would remove the references to the 49 and 50 marginal rates in the internal revenue code hr 3475 capuano and hr 4172 moore would not adjust the tax rates set by egtrra the adopted baucus amendment samdt 4160 to sconres 70 endorsed top tax rate of 45 the other five proposed estate tax amendments endorsed top tax rate of 35 crs11 special treatment for familyowned businesses and farms two bills target benefits to familyowned farms and ranches both hr 1929 salazar and s 1994 salazar would exclude from the gross estate the adjusted value of qualified farmland that continues in farmland use by qualified heir subject to requirements that gross income from farming contributed over half of the decedents gross income in his last taxable years andor in the case of s 1994 that the qualified farmland accounted for over half the value of the gross estate effective in 2008 hr 4042 mcnerney would reinstate the qualified family owned

revenue proposals in its fy2009 budget the bush administration has once again proposed to make permanent most of the tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003 this includes making the repeal of the estate tax permanent beyond calendar year 2010 the administrations proposal to remove the sunset provision of egtrra would make permanent both the repeal of the estate tax and the generationskipping transfer tax as well as the modifications to the gift tax currently scheduled to be in effect for 2010 only table 2 presents estimates of the changes in federal receipts expected each year through fy2018 if legislation to repeal the sunset provision of egtrra with respect to the estate and gift taxes were enacted in 2008 to take effect in 2010 these estimates were issued by the us treasury department in february 2008 and by the joint committee on taxation jct in march 2008 the treasurys estimates of revenue loss begin in fy2008 the jcts estimates begin in fy2009 these estimates do not include the reduction in revenue expected as result of impending changes made by egttra namely the increase in the estate tax exemption to 35 million for 2009 according to treasury department analysts the estimated revenue losses for fy2008 through fy2010 which are modest in size stem primarily from projected decline in gift tax revenues they are based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax would be permanently repealed in 2010 crs12 table 2 treasury department and jct

the estimates include the projected accompanying loss of individual income tax revenue in addition to estate and gift tax revenue as explained in the text according to treasury department analysts treasurys estimates of revenue loss are lower than jcts for fy2011 and beyond primarily because treasury starts from lower baseline the projection of what revenues from the estate tax would otherwise be than the congressional budget office baseline used by jct crs13 in addition it is expected that enactment in 2008 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 2010 would modestly affect revenues from the individual income tax in two opposing ways starting right away first lifetime charitable donations and accompanying tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenue second and larger in effect capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall as they waited to pass on their assets taxfree after death thereby decreasing current income tax revenue for fy2009 and fy2010 treasury projected that net reductions in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenue from gift taxes for fy2011 and beyond the loss in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenue from estate taxes as well as gift taxes for the fiscal years when the effects of estate tax repeal would be fully reflected20 the treasury department projected that the annual revenue loss would rise by about 5 billion per year from 58 billion in fy2012 up to 85 billion in fy2018 the jct estimates annual revenue losses rising by about 7 billion per year from 69 billion in fy2012 to 112 billion in

the most costly component of the package extending the reductions in marginal individual income tax rates 522 billion compared to 1008 billion or 5221 according to the joint committee on taxation the estate tax accounts for just over onequarter 278 of the projected revenue cost of making the set of 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent 670 billion out of 2414 billion for the 10year period fy2009fy2018 jct estimates that permanent estate tax repeal would cost nearly twothirds as much as making the individual income tax rate cuts permanent 670 billion compared to 1401 billion or 6422 20 the estimators expect that fy2012 would be the first full fiscal year in which revenues are likely to reflect the repeal of the estate tax beginning in calendar 2010 the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the date of death filing extension of six months is not uncommon and longer extensions may be granted for complex returns the fiscal year runs from october 1 of the previous calendar

from an expatriate the tax is levied at the highest estate tax rate in effect on the date of receipt or if greater the highest gift tax rate in effect on that date the tax is based on the value of the covered gift or bequest the tax is to be paid by the recipient of the gift or bequest the annual gift tax exclusion per donee 12000 in 2008 indexed for inflation would apply as would the deductions permitted for gifts or bequests to spouses or charities the tax does not apply to transfers that were otherwise subject to the us estate or gift tax the tax due may be reduced by the amount of any gift or estate tax paid to foreign government with respect to the gift or bequest this new tax differs from the regular gift and estate taxes in taxing the recipient of the gift or bequest instead of the giver or the givers estate it thus resembles an inheritance tax this approach was needed because the united states cannot directly tax an expatriate giver of gift or the estate of an expatriate
