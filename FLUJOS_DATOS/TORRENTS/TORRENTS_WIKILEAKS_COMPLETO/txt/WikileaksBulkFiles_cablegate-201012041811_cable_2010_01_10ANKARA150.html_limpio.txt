ankara 130 c ankara 107 d 09 ankara 1582 09 ankara 834 f 09 ankara 1839 classified by ambassador james f jeffrey reasons 14 bd summary 1 c reports of coup plots against pm erdogans islamistleaning government have been staple of the turkish media since 2007 despite protests by turkeys top brass that there is substance to the allegations growing percentage of the population believes that at least some elements within the military have been plotting to undermine or even overthrow the akpled government the coup allegations have served as fodder for the ergenekon prosecution team and some of the plots have been included in the formal indictments against senior retired military officers the net result of these allegations has been gradual erosion of the public trust toward the military the latest reports related to the sledgehammer plan ref come at time when the government is preparing the process of amending the constitution to allow military personnel to be tried in civilian courts ref b with the proislamist media fanning the flames and the turkish general staffs consistently inadequate responses to each allegation public opinion is becoming less unquestioning vis vis the military this could help strengthen akps position as it mulls steps to amend the turkish constitution in order to affect shift in the civilmilitary balance in its favor although akps own support has eroded considerably over the past year end summary coup chronicles review 2 c over the course of the last twoandahalf years the turkish military has faced number of allegations of coup plotting having occurred within its ranks especially in the 2003 to 2004 period these allegations have increased in tempo over the last year with the liberal daily taraf side whose tagline is to think is to take sides leading the charge in breaking many of the oftensensational stories that draw on leaked information from unnamed military or judicial sources comment taraf owner basar arslan has publicly dismissed claims that taraf is secretly funded by the fetullah gulen movement end comment paras 814 outline the key allegations that have surfaced in the turkish media since 2007 common threads 3 c one of the common threads in this review is that the alleged plans are all variations on theme they all involve efforts to sow chaos or foment public opposition to the akp and to create the conditions for military intervention none of the alleged plots involve direct military takeover comment the militarys problem in such scenario is that it knows its interventions and coup plots are not popular among the population the last successful coup in 1980 occurred in response to massive breakdown of public order as armed political ethnic and criminal gangs engaged in violent attacks the core accusation in these current scenarios is the allegation that the military this time would foment the violence themselves blaming radical islamic and other groups and then step in to restore order after the government fails to do so end comment 4 c another common theme is that all the allegations put the military in an almost impossible position of having to prove negative that it did not engage in the planning actions alleged by the media reports to public some parts of whom are increasingly suspicious of the military with each new claim while we may never know the extent to which each of these allegations are true it is clear from statements by former turkish general staff chief gen ozkok that at the very least there was serious consideration given within the military in 2003 to 2004 to overthrow the ankara 00000150 002 of 004 akpled government polling data and net effect thus far 5 c the series of allegations has been eroding the publics confidence in the military while the military still enjoys strong support among the public one poll by genar polling in november 2009 indicated that 806 percent of those surveyed viewed the military as the institution that inspires most confidence 15 points above the presidency which came in second this support has slipped poll conducted by ag polling in january indicated that while public support for the military was around 90 percent before the ergenekon investigations began public support has dropped to 634 percent ipsos kmg also published poll in early january indicating the trust in the military had declined from 85 to 90 percent before the ergenekon allegations to 73 percent in late 2009 another poll conducted in early january by turkish polling firm metropoll before the sledgehammer story broke found that 30 percent of respondents in the january poll indicated that their trust in the military has decreased 55 percent of respondents also believed that there is group within the military which is preparing to stage coup rise of 7 percent from july 2009 figures despite the decreasing confidence in the military indicated by one of three respondents 62 percent of respondents did not believe that the military would stage another coup 6 c secularists who question the motives of the akp and the timing of each new coup plot allegation are convinced that most of the claims are combination of fabrication and manipulation of actual military documents and that there is systematic campaign to erode the trust of the military tgs chief basbug has led this charge calling the series of media stories an asymmetric attack targeting the turkish armed forces even as he denounced the media reports however basbug has also clearly committed the military to supporting democracy and the rule of law and has stated that the era of coups in turkey is over ref b comment stage is set for constitutional reform 7 c with the constitutional courts unanimous decision to overturn law extending civilian jurisdiction over military personnel for crimes including coup plotting ref c the government has announced that it plans to seek referendum to change turkeys constitution to affect this change many of the other possible constitutional reforms being considered by the government such as changing the structure of the constitutional court and limiting clauses often used to justify the prosecution of nationalist kurds and islamist politicians would attract the opposition of the military and its political supporters the apparent rise in distrust among the turkish populace toward the military particularly after sledgehammer which allegedly would have targeted average turks in an arbitrary manner could work to the akps advantage as it looks to further shift the balance of power in civmil relations through constitutional reforms although akps own standing is greatly diminished from only one year ago coup diaries and alleged plots 8 sbu excerpts of diary entries dating back to 2003 and 2004 allegedly belonging to thennaval forces commander admiral ozden ornek were first published by the weekly nokta in 2007 comment the magazine was closed shortly after it published these documents

justice and development party which came to power in 2002 sarikiz blondie was the initial coup plan developed by thenjandarma commander general eruygur which involved coordinated effort among the military and other elements of turkeys secular elite to effect the removal of the akp from power the plot allegedly had the support of all the other force commanders at the time land forces commander general aytac yalman air forces commander general ibrahim firtina ankara 00000150 003 of 004 and naval forces commander admiral ornek thenturkish general staff tgs chief general hilmi ozkok reportedly

operational details of coup that would involve the removal of general ozkok and the restructuring of the military other related plans related to the plot with code names eldiven glove and demiryumruk iron fist reportedly provided more details about steps to be taken in the aftermath of successful coup 9 sbu these plots were included in the ergenekon prosecutors second indictment in march 2009 and provided the legal basis for the detention of retired generals eruygur and tolon who were initially arrested in july 2008 and were detained without formal charges until the release of the indictment eruygur has been identified as the alleged head of ergenekon while tolon is considered leading member retired force commanders firtina ornek and yalman were interviewed by ergenekon prosecutors in early december 2009 but have not been charged firtina publicly denied involvement in any coup plots according to press accounts general ozkok acknowledged during testimony to ergenekon prosecutors in april 2009 that most of the contents of the coup diaries were true and that he was aware of plans to overthrow the government among elements within the military but did not have hard evidence to move

including lt col halil ozsarac and colonels levent gulmen and mucahit erakyol thus far neither ogutcu or sardic has been questioned about this plot 11 sbu taraf reporter mehmet baransu who broke the news about kafes received an award from the turkish journalists association for his kafes reporting but was also investigated for violating the confidentiality of an ongoing criminal investigation while those charges have been dropped there is an ongoing case against baransu and taraf manager adnan demir for openly insulting the military institution of the state in violation of section 301 of the turkish penal code action plan against fundamentalism refs d and 12 sbu photocopies of the alleged action plan against fundamentalism were published by taraf as frontpage story in june 2009 the

existence of such plan with general basbug dismissing the photocopied documents as piece of paper the allegation came roaring back to life in november 2009 when taraf claimed that it had received from an anonymous military officer the original copy of the plan with ciceks wet signature cicek was detained in july 2009 for his role in drafting the plan but was released due to lack of evidence he was
