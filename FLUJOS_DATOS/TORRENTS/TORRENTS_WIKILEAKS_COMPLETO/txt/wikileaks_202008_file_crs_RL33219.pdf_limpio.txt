strains currently spreading throughout the world although it is bird flu it has infected some people and killed more than half of those infected since 1997 when the first human contracted h5n1 in hong kong the virus has resurfaced and spread to more than 50 countries across asia europe the middle east and africainfecting more than 260 people and killing more than 150 of those infected in february 2006 the virus spread from asia and central europe to western europe by march 2006 health experts had confirmed new bird flu cases in more than 20 countries across europe asia and africa the first human h5n1 fatalities outside of asia occurred in that year with turkey and iraq reporting h5n1related human deaths for the first time in january and february followed by azerbaijan and egypt in march congress has provided funds for us international avian flu efforts through three appropriations pl 10913 fy2005 emergency supplemental approp riations provided 25 million to combat the spread of avian influenza the act also permitted the secretary of state to transfer up to 656 million for us avian flu initiatives ultimately 63 million was transferred to usaid for those purposes providing total of 313 million for us global avian flu activities from those appropriations pl 109148 fy2006 defense depa rtment appropriations included 38 billion to address pandemic influenza pl 109234 fy2006 emergency supplemental appropriations provided 23 billion for avian and pandemic flu efforts of which 30 million was appropriated to usaid for international avian flu efforts and 200 million was appropriated to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for global and domestic disease surveillance laboratory capacity research and other activities relevant fy2007 us department and agency budget justifications included some 205 million for global h5n1 initiatives as in previous fiscal years us agencies and departments might commit additional resources to global avian flu efforts

many strains of avian influenza that can cause illness in poultry bird or avian flu outbreaks have occurred at various times around the world1 until 1997 there were known human h5n1 cases that year 18 people in hong kong contracted the virus of whom 6 died to contain the virus 15 million birds were killed since 2003 when the virus resurfaced and killed 4 people scientists have closely monitored resurgent h5n1 outbreaks when analyzing the viral spread and severity of h5n1 some health experts prefer to consider the average h5n1 human fatality rate since the virus emerged in 2003 more than 50 the world health organization who however considers the annual change of human fatality rates 2 the overall human fatality rate was highest in 2004 73 followed by 63 to date in 2006 and 43 in 2005 table 1 there has been some debate about whether h5n1 will cause global pandemic who ranks the current global h5n1 outbreak in pandemic alert phase three which means virus new to humans is causing infections but not spreading easily from one person to another table a1 some predict that if h5n1 were to become transmissible among humans the virus could cause an influenza pandemic worldwide disease outbreak3 skeptics argue that such predictions are exaggerated because if the virus were able to transform into strain that is efficiently transmissible among people it would have alr eady done so who warns that the virus is continuing to spread and that the threat has not been eliminated thus in the latter view governments should continue to prepare for some sort of pandemic and not become complacent even though h5n1 has not yet become transmissible between people at last count h5n1 has infected birds in more than 50 countries4 and infected 261 people of whom 157 have died5 more than 200 million birds in europe the middle east and africa have either died from h5n1 or have been culled in containment exercises6 from december 2003 to august 2004 nine asian countries reported h5n1 outbreaks in poultry in late july 2005 russia identified h5n1 in its poultry for the first time by october 2005 birds in croatia kazakhstan mongolia romania and turkey had contracted h5n1 in 2006

200 million and 1 billion were infected around the world if flu pandemic were to occur on the same scale as the spanish flu estimates of human deaths have ranged between 30 million and 384 million people 4 the world organization for animal health oie has confirmed h5n1 among birds in the following countries and territories afghanistan albania austria azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina brita in

transmission some experts contend that wild migratory birds infected with h5n1 notably water fowl are the main vectors or media of transmission h5n1 has been detected in migratory birds in multiple countries and in some instances its spread has correlated with seasonal migrations of certain wild species in some countries h5n1 has only been found in wild birds some veterinarians point out that detecting h5n1 in wild birds can be difficult because some of the infected birds are asymptomatic harboring but not exhibiting disease symptoms or ill effects from the virus7 other experts however maintain that other important modes of transmission should not be underestimated such as crossborder trade of infected poultry and transmission through poor agricultural practices indications that may support such assertions include the detection of h5n1 on commercial farms among caged poultry that are unable to mingle with wild fowl the detection of h5n1 on farms located far from wetlands where migratory birds seasonally dwell and the detection of h5n1 in regions where h5n1linked wild fowl dieoffs have not been reported in some countries such as in nigeria there are some indications that wild fowl may not be implicated in the transmission of h5n1 8 7 see fao wild birds and avian influenza sept 2005 among other sources 8 see ellen paul exec dir ornithological council what we dont know

transmission of h5n1 and other avian influenza viruses that have occurred should also be closely monitored who asserts that the limited cases should not cause alarm because the virus had not spread beyond first generation of close contacts or caused illness in the general community who adds that it has not elevated the pandemic risk of h5n1 because data from the incidents suggest that transmission requires very close contact with an ill person g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g561 pl 10913 fy2005 emergency supplemental appropri

states are bound to them except those that have objected to them who and number of countries including the united states have already taken steps towards implementing the revised ihr and improving countries capacities to respond to international health risks and emergencies one of the first steps taken was to develop the global outbreak alert and response network goarn system that manages critical inform ation about outbreaks and ensures accurate and timely communications among key international public health professionals another critical step was to establish global stockpile of

others contend that the united states could help to contain the spread of h5n1 by exporting generic antivirals to non producing countries that can not afford to purchase the drugs see hr 3369 s 969 and hr 4392 some epidemiologists have expressed similar concerns related to h5n1 vaccine availability if h5n1 vaccines are developed they would be primary mechanism for controlling the spread of the virus and reducing associated mortality and morbidity due to number of uncertainties including unpredictable market demand and pricing liability and intellectual property considerations and regulatory and tax issues global and domestic vaccine research and manufacturing capacity is limited global health experts contend that some of the most affected countries do not have the capacity to produce vaccines nor will they have the ability to purchase sufficient quantities of the vaccine in the event of pandemic one article in the journal of public health policy pointed out that almost 40 of the worlds supply of interpandemic influenza vaccines is used in countries that do not produce their own vaccines 64 some health experts would like congress to increase funding for hhs activities related

number of health experts advocate greater us investment in the strengthening of foreign health systems overall proponents argue that the spread of h5n1 and the inability of countries like indonesia to contain the virus demonstrates the need to increase support for public health systems supporters also argue that increased spending might encourage state openness and responsibility and enhance global cooperation and containment efforts due to the poor state of health infrastructures in number of countries key sectors that are critical in identifying and containing the spread of h5n1such as disease surveillance and veterinary servicesare illequipped many health experts are concerned that pandemic might progress before it is discovered in country where h5n1 is endemic supporters of this idea

kills between 02 million and 15 million people annually the world bank estimated global output would decline by less than 1 more moderate pandemic killing 142 million people could cause global gdp to fall more than 2 representing about 200 billion in one quarter or 800 billion over year severe pandemic modeled after the 1918 spanish flu could cut global gdp by almost 5 constituting major global recession the world bank predicts that developing countries would be hardest hit 65 many economists assert that health and nonhealth related sectors could be severely affected by global influenza pandemic though it would be difficult to predict the costs of those effects66 for example canadian and asian hospitality and tourism sectors were considerably impacted during the sars outbreak in 2002
