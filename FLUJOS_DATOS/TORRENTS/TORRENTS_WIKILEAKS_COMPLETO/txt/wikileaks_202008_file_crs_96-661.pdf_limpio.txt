consideration of the worker rightsandtrade policy issue linking the arguments for and against next it looks at economic reasons why the worker rights issue is surfacing now after that it surveys existing vehicles that link worker rights and trade policy and possible actions congress might take to try to resolve the current worker rightsandtrade dilemma current congressional issues as mentioned congress is wrestling with two worker rights issues one is the use of child labor to produce goods for importation into the united states the other is attaching worker rights provisions to legislation that would renew presidential authority to renegotiate trade agreements on fasttrack basis recent event that raised congressional concern with the child labor issue began after publicity that television celebrity kathie lee gifford had lent her name to line of clothing allegedly produced by child labor under sweatshop conditions3 congressional response to the child labor issue has included both hearings and legislation oversight hearings have been held by the house international relations subcommittee on international operations and human rights in addition bills have been introduced that would prohibit the importation of goods produced abroad with child labor s 706 harkin and hr 2065 frank require the secretary of state to establish set of voluntary guidelines to promote socially responsib business practices for us businesses operating in foreign countries hr 910 evans amend the foreign assistance act of 1961 to withhold us assistance from countries determined to be violating the human rights of working children hr 3294 moran and impose certain sanctions on countries that do not prohibit child labor hr 3812 christopher smith the worker rightsandfasttrack issue surfaced during consideration of the 1995 fasttrack renewal bill reported by the house ways and means committee hr 2371 hrept 104285 this bill as reported would have prohibited the inclusion of worker rights provisions in trade agreements negotiated and implement ed under fasttrack procedures specifically it would have done this by limiting trade agreements negotiated under fast track procedures until at least december 15 1999 to subjects covered by five stated negotiating objectives these objectives did not include worker rights or environmental issues that were the subject of separate side agreements to nafta4 the senate bill s 577 contained such limitation on subjects that could be included in trade agreementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs3 at the heart of the worker rightsfasttrack debate in congress are divergent views on whether or not worker rights should be linked to trade p policy one side argues for broader worldwide adherence to worker rights provisions this side argues that the failure of developing countries to adhere to worker rights standards places some importcompeting american industries at competitive disadvantage in trade and shifts employment opportunities to developing countries the other side argues for free trade and against any requirement that trading partners impose labor standards worker rights translated into law or practice they argue that mandating international adherence to labor standards is form of protectionism that can actually dampen worldwide economic growth for all nations table 1 characterizes arguments of each the congressional debate on linking labor rights provisions to trade policy is also echoed with equal fervor in the international arena among more than 120 members of the new world trade organization wto established by the uruguay round of agreements under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt representatives from the united states and other developed countries have been urging the formation of working group in the wto to discuss the relationship between trade policy and worker rights conversely representatives of developing countries argue strongly that such discussion could lead to the imposition of basic worker rights requirements which could increase their labor costs and impair their ability to compete in the international marketplace why are worker rights an issue now labor standards worldwide have become an issue now for two reasons one is the expansion of trade in recent years one is humanitarian to some labor standards issues reflect genuine concern for workers as human beings in the same way that environmental issues reflect genuine concern for the wellbeing of the planet hum anitarians see labor standards as counterforce to an increasingly competitive world economy in which the rights of workers are being overrun by the greed of multinational corporationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs4 table 1 arguments for and against linking labor standards to trade policy against for 1 the main purpose of trade agreements is to promote trade and economic growth trade agreements are probably not the best mechanism for resolving non trade issues such as labor rights nontrade issues tend to detract from the main purpose of the trade agreements while not resolving the nontrade issues 2 the best way to improve labor standards is to perm it private capital to flow unimped ed and to allow economies to export freely as developing countries grow they will be more likely to adopt higher labor standards workers do not earn high wages just because minimum wage is ordered real growth in income is the resul t of growth in productivity 3 from the perspective of the international investor strong worker protections create disincentives to invest because they reduce comparative advantage and inhibit the most efficient use of labor thereby restraining economic growth 4 from the perspective of some economists in the long run economies unencumbere d by trade restrictions are able to achieve and maintain higher level of efficiency and higher level of growth because their natural comparative advantage is forceful engine driving productivity growth 5 from the perspective of the developing country labor standards1 there is fine line between competing on the basis of comparative advantage and socia l dumping competing by denying workers basic rights labor standards help to define the boundary 2 labor standards for all trading partners help fend off race to the bottom that comes when businesses are forced to roll back minimum wages and standard s so that they can remain internationally competitive against businesses in countries where lack of standard s makes the cost of doing business considerably lower 3 many workers and unions see multinational corporations as predators if labor standards are uniformly enforced companies would be prevented from engaging in exploitative labor practices 4 global growth is balancing act supported by broad base of consumer demand in developing countries for workers to be consumers they must receive rising share of the gains from increasing productivity and economic expansion labor standards help promote these gains 5 labor standards could discourage runaway plants because they lessen the labor cost differences between countries 6 labor standards would not interfere with natural comparative advantage in various countries because minimum wages and labor standards are only one basis for comparative advantage others include infrastructure b available workforce size c workforce education d level of technological development and natural resource basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs5 against for 5 hourly total compensation figures from the bureau of labor statistics contained in unpublished data for 31 countries were adjusted by the consumer price index for all urban consumers contained in table b56 p 343 of the economic report of the president february 1996 6 worsening american income inequality is world trade to blame by gary burtless the brookings review spring 1996 pp 2631could cut off employment opportunities and delay the emergence of these countri as developed countries 6 requiring international labor standard s is inconsistent with the goal of reducing tariff and nontari ff barriers requiring international labor standards can be disguised protectionism 7 the issue of international labor standards raises issues of sovereignty does one country have the right to force its domestic policy goals on another country7 trade sanctions in some environmental treaties are already used why should the rights of workers be given lower level of protection 8 developed nations have through democratic evolution made social contract assurin g citizens healthful environment safe working condit ions decent retire ment and health insurance and safety net for the disabled one way or another the nations products must bear the cost of this contract they cannot compete in price with those of countries using comparable technology but having such contract for its citizens the other reason labor standards have become an issue now is growing concern among some groups who have observed parallel trends in the us economy us plants have been relocating to lowwage countries abroad and worker earnings have been stagnating while imports have been increasing over the past decade or two such groups suspect that trade and especially imports may be at least partly responsible for the wage changes and appear drawn toward protectionist policies what do the trade data and earnings data show imports as percent of us gross domestic product gdp have risen from about 4 to nearly 10 of gdp between 1970 and 1994 over an overlapping period between 1975 earliest year for which comparable data are available and 1994 real total hourly compensation for manufacturing workers declined about 25 in addition wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers has increased workers in the top quintile of earnings have seen their adjusted personal income rise 15 between 1969 and 1993 while those in the bottom quintile have seen theirs decline by 226 evidence from the research community on the contribution of trade to this wage behavior is still being debated findings from number of studies so far vary widely and suggest that trade may account for as little as near zero or as much as 3050 of the wage inequalityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs6 7 other identified core labor standards are 1 prohibition of child labor 2 prohibition of forced labor and 3 freedom from discrimination this discussion of the oecd study is mostly taken from pages 5 and 6 of trade employment and labour standards report of the education employment labour and social affairs committee and the trade committee to the council at ministerial level organization for economic cooperation and development may 21 1996 10 p summary of longer report due out september 1996 8 ibidregardless of trades actual contribution to the wage inequality some workers and labor representatives in the united states are looking for ways to protect us workers some see linking worker rights to trade policy as way of doing this economic effects of linking worker rights and trade policy findings of an oecd study freedom of association and collective bargaining standards nevertheless the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd which includes mostly developed countries has recently released study actually nontechnical summary that precedes publication of book anticipated for fall 1996 that looks at the economic effects on output and trade flows of linking to trade policy the only two core labor standards for which data are available freedom of association and freedom to bargain collectively7 the oecd was not able to find data on the economic relationship between trade policy and the core labor standard prohibiting child labor the oecd study finds that the effects of greater freedomofassoci ation and collective bargaining rights on output are likely to be negligible compared to the effects of other factors such as shifts in technology raw material prices and terms of trade the volume of exports that can be traded for given volume of imports more generally the study concludes the actual economic effects of core labor standards are likely to be small8 the oecd study finds that the effect of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights on trade flows is also expected to be small specifically it finds that empirical research suggests that there is correlation at the aggregate level between the degree of observance of freedomof association rights and realwage growth in countries with which the united states trades therefore adoption of these labor standards would not necessarily increase the price of import s and therefore help wages of us workers making competing products there is evidence that lowstandards countries enjoy better global export performance than highstandards countries therefore adoption of freedom of association and collectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs7 bargaining rights would not necessarily reduce the volume of imports and thus remove pressure on us companies to keep production costs on importcompeting products low through various means including pressure on wages minimum wage and child labor standards questions remain about how or whether minimum wage standard not included in most listings of core labor standards as discussed below and child labor standard adopted around the world would affect us wages through slowing imports from developing countries the oecd study does not address the effect of either of these requirements but additional analysis may offer

note this table was made by juxtaposing two separate bls tables instead of calculating othercountry compensation as proportion of us compensation therefore the numbers on the two sides of the table do not always coordinate bls in its notes on these tables emphasizes that because compensation is partly estimated the statistics should not be consider ed as precise measures of comparative compensation costs daily exchange rates were used to convert hourly compensation costs to us dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs9 9 some observers may be interested in relative wage levels in various countries as an indicator of potential attractiveness of those countries as site for laborintensive manufacturing operations of course wages do not tell the whole story imports and exports are affected importantly by the interaction between wages and productivity which together determine unit labor costs of production this report does not include separate table on either productivity levels for the respective countries or unit labor costs productivity levels for the whole country may be somewhat irrelevant to the issue of whether or not corporation will set up plant there the reason is that productivity in specific manufacturing facilities abroad which are producing for export with us technology may be considerably higher than productivity for the country as whole 10 opening statement of representative sanders committee on banking finance and urban affairs subcommittee on international development finance trade and monetary policy hearing on labor and environmental standards wednesday march 23 1994 103d congress 2d session serial 103129 p 34 regarding minimum wage requirements table 2 lists manufacturing compensation levels by country for number of years since 19759 because minimum wages would all be proportionately related to the average wages for given country minimum wage requirements would appear to have little effect on overall cost structure and therefore little economic effect on wages in the united states regarding child labor requirements it can be argued that banning child labor would merely shift employment to older family members to the extent that child labor is not replaced by adult workers the supply of goods made with child labor could decline which could raise their prices somewhat this could reduce pressure on prices of competitive us goods and possibly help to marginally raise wages of workers who produce them if there is linkage between worker rights and trade policy should it be mandatory or voluntary many argue that ultimately worker rights will be linked to trade policy for them the question in the debate is through what mechanism should they be linked should the linkage be voluntary with penalties or mandatory with penalties for noncompliance since worker rights and trade policy are already linked through number of vehicles some mandatory and some volunta ry congressional options include further enforcement of these vehicles as well as adding onto them adopting new laws to extend or tighten the worker rightstrade policy link or revisiting and possibly revising the existing linkages these are summarized in table 3 those in favor of mandated worker rightstrade policy link argue that outside intervention is needed to level the international playing field the reasoning is that recognition of workers right to organize bargain collectively and strike creates positive pressure on wages as wages rise workers have more income to spend on imported goods simultaneously as foreign wage rates rise us corporations will have less incentive to relocate in an attempt to reduce labor costs10httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96661crs10 11 19 usc 2461 et seq title v of the trade act of 1974 as amended sections 502a4 and b7 12 19 usc 2701 et seq caribbean basin economic recovery act subtitle section 212 b7those in favor of voluntary linkage and against intervention often concur with the theory that rising tide lifts all boats they argue that free trade without additional mandatory encumbrances allows each countrys natural comparative advantage to serve as an engine for economic growth as country grows it naturally shifts its

of international labor affairs reports that were not asking wto to take over for the ilo wto should not be global enforcer of labor standards the wto may have the role to the extent there is trade relationship however nobody has said we look to wto to be to labor standards what it is to tariffs the us position on trade policy and labor according to spokesperson at the dol bureau of international labor affairs the administrations position is that it would like the singapore ministerial to issue declaration 1 recognizing the importance of labor standards and their relationship to trade 2 establishing working group to study the tradelabor issue and 3 making recommendations as to how the wto will proceed on this issue secretary of labor robert b reich has indicated that the united states at this point is pushing for recognition of only five core labor standards 1 freedom of association 2 the right to organize and bargain collectively 3 prohibition of forced labor 4 nondiscrimination in employment and 5 the prevention of exploitation of young children17 the united states is not pushing at this time for minimum wage standard or for standards governing minimum age of workers limiting work hours or mandating occupational safety and health protection nor is it seeking sanctions against countries not adhering to these or their own labor standards secretary reich has also spoken out against using core labor standards to pursue an agenda of protectionism or as method to counter legitimate comparative advantage based on lower wages such an agenda would be wrong and would be selfdefeating we do not advocate it nor would we accept it18 those for and against the trade policylabor rights link organizations and interests in the united states according to the dol bureau of international labor affairs organized labor is strongly in favor of forging some link between labor standards and trade moreover labor interests are also trying to motivate union organizations in other countries one such organization is the international confederation of free trade unions icftu this is an umbrella organization europeanbased multilateral organization that has

approach to worker rights if any congress might consider both in promoting standards prohibiting child labor and in debating the renewal of presidential fasttrack negotiating authority in the area of child labor congress might as suggested by pending bills take number of actions including the following prohibit importation of goods produced with child labor s 706 harkin and s 2065 frank direct the

worker rights included in table 423 second labor standards could be considered an element of value in consumer goods as is already happening thus congress could pass law stipulating that goods for import into the united states be clearly labeled as to the conditions under which they were manufactured and let consumers adjust their demand for imported products made under various labor conditions problems with the rugmark label in india suggest that some external organization would need to assure the accuracy of labels24 labor standards would be paid for by one or more of the following consumers willing to spend extra for goods made under certain conditions workers and employers to the extent that decreased demand might stem from higher prices25 spokespersons for foreign manufacturers have characterized enforcement of this option as an impossible task citing the hundreds of thousands of very small manufacturers in the developing world third congress could focus on encouraging the tradelabor standards debate in the ilo and the wto there appears to be general consensus among ilo members on the six ilo conventions that constitute the basic human rights labor standards at the june 1996 international labor conference the ilo members adopted resolution to develop child labor convention that will address abusive labor practices affecting children for the most part the conventions agree with wording in us legislation that congress has added since the 1970s the ilo directorgeneral has indicated his willingness to attend the singapore ministerial meeting of the wto and also expressed his opinion that the ilo should play role in addressing labor standards in trade policy
