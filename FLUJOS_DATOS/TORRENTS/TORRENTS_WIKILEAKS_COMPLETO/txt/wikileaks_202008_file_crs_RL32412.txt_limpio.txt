september 9 2005 michael simpson specialist in life sciences resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress arsenictreated wood background and overview summary arsenic is known human carcinogen preservative using chromated copper arsenate cca has been the principal way to protect most commercially harvested wood from decay such wood has been used to build play structures picnic tables decks gazebos fences and walkways arsenic and chromium can be released from the preserved wood since december 12 2001 the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra scientific advisory panel sap group designed to provide balanced expert assessment of pesticiderelated issues to the administrator of the us environmental protection agency epa has recommended inter alia that ccatreated wood be coated and recoated annually to reduce release of and exposure to arsenic and that biomonitoring study of children normally exposed to ccatreated wood should be conducted however epa does not believe there is any reason to remove or replace ccatreated structures on february 13 2004 the sap released its final report on epas draft preliminary probabilistic risk assessment of the potential risks to children associating with ccatreated playsets and decks the agency says it will carefully consider the sap recommendations and revise the draft risk assessment as appropriate on march 19 2004 epa announced in the federal register the availability of the preliminary risk assessment for the reregistration eligibility decision this notice covered both occupational and environmental assessments on may 27 2005 epa released preliminary results from studies that showed that all of the 12 commercially available sealants tested reduced dislodgeable arsenic from ccatreated wood for up to 12 months of natural weathering while sealing can reduce the amount of arsenic getting into childrens skin the epa study results do not reveal the magnitude of that reduction epa has announced timeline of major pending actions including making available the final report of the sealant study end of 2005 the cca probabilistic risk assessment end of june 2006 and the cca reregistration eligibility decision end of september 2006 the wood treating industry by january 1 2004 voluntarily converted to nonarsenical preservatives for residential uses including copper boron azole cba and ammonia copper quaternary ammonia acq whose availabilities and costs are approximately those of cca in the past labeling had been on all cca products stating that use of cca would be allowed for the affected residential uses after december 31 2003 wood treated prior to that date can still be used in residential settings and ccatreated wood in extant built structures is not affected disposal of extant ccatreated wood export and possible import of cca treated wood and wood products determination of the best ways to reduce arsenic exposure from extant wood and possible adverse effects from nonarsenic wood preservatives are continuing concerns three bills s 337 hr 688 and hr 3629 were introduced in the 108th congress prohibiting other uses of or studying alternatives to ccatreated wood there are bills on arsenictreated wood in the 109th congress this report will be updated as events warrant contents background 1 health effects of cca 1 wood preservatives overview 2 recommendations of an independent panel 4 scientific peer review of draft risk assessment 6 disposal issues 7 legislative proposals 7 arsenictreated wood background and overview background beginning on january 1 2004 the epa longer allowed use of chromated copper arsenate cca to preserve wood intended for most residential uses play structures decks picnic tables landscaping timbers residential fencing gazebos patios and walkways wood treated prior to that date may still be used in residential settings and ccatreated wood in extant built structures is not affected meanwhile the wood preservative industry has voluntarily converted to preservatives for residential wood uses that do not contain arsenic while the epa does not believe there is any reason to remove or replace ccatreated structures1 arsenic is known carcinogen in humans and any reduction in the levels of potential exposure to arsenic is desirable the agency is continuing study of the entire range of cca uses disposal of extant ccatreated wood export and possible import of cca treated wood and wood products determination of the best ways to reduce arsenic exposure from extant wood and possible adverse effects from nonarsenic wood preservatives are continuing concerns health effects of cca high pressure was used to inject cca into wood while some people such as construction workers wood treaters or firefighters might touch inhale or ingest cca itself or ccatreated sawdust or smoke from fires the largest concern was possible exposure of children to cca which slowly leaches from ccatreated wood2 copper an essential nutrient of relatively low toxicity is the component in cca causing the lowest level of concerns about safety or health as such epa did not conduct an exposure or risk assessment for copper chromium leaches from ccatreated wood mostly as chromium iii criii one of few forms of the element there may be trace amounts of chromium vi 1 draft preliminary probabilistic risk assessment for children who contact chromated copper arsenate cca treated playsets and decks which can be found at httpwww epagovpesticidesfactsheetschemicalsdraft_cca_qahtm 2 the amount and rate of leaching varies greatly depending on many factors such as local climate acidity of precipitation and soil age of the wood concentration of cca amount of contact with skin and degree of protective coating crs2 crvi more toxic form of the element the rarity of crvi in cca leachate led epa to conclude that the toxicity of criii was the most appropriate toxicity endpoint the low toxicity of criii led epa to conclude that it was unnecessary to present shortterm intermediateterm or lifetime risks of exposure to criii arsenic is known human carcinogen and is acutely toxic the degree of carcinogenicity and toxicity depends highly on degree and route of exposure epa has over several years been trying to assess the risk of exposure to arsenic from cca treated wood wood preservatives overview untreated lumber cut from most commercially harvested tree species is subject to attack by insects and marine organisms or decay caused by fungi and bacteria decay or insect hazard generally is greatest where the wood is subjected to moisture especially in hot and humid climates or aquatic environments to protect untreated wood the lumber is placed in cylinders filled with the preservative solution and the preservative is pressurized until it penetrates the wood most commonly copper usually derived from recycled sources from the preservative deposited in the wood renders it useless as food source for termites and fungi the american wood preservers institute estimates that cca increases the life of wood products exposed to the environment from 7 to 12 times which is about 20 to 50 years representing significant reduction in need for replacement wood by enabling wood to last longer ccatreated wood is better positioned to compete with stone concrete brick or other longlived building materials expanding the market for wood the most common pressuretreated wood preservative has been cca more recently copper boron azole cba has been used cba was introduced in 1982 and does not contain arsenic introduced very recently ammonia copper quaternary ammonia acq like cba provides arsenicfree protection to wood3 in the past cca was prevalent and lowcost with the voluntary industry transition to nonarsenical wood preservatives cba and acq have become more widely available at cost approaching that of cca in the past the industry saw decline during 2002 in production of cca products for residential uses of 25 with corresponding shift to alternatives labeling was required on all cca products stating that use of cca would be allowed for the affected residential uses after december 31 2003 cedar redwood plastics metals and concrete continue to be available as construction materials that do not require the use of wood preservatives these wood and nonwood alternatives generally cost more than pressuretreated woods up to twice the cost of pressuretreated woods 3 azole also is used as an antifungal drug in humans eg fluconazole diflucan is brand name for this compound and ketoconazole nizoral is brand name concern has been raised by some about the potential for azole compounds losing antifungal potency in humans because of its use in the environment crs3 as way of recognizing the presence of cca while new and bare ie unpainted or uncoated cca wood tended to have green tint caused by chemical reactions that took place between the wood and the preservatives ingredients as practical matter virtually all pressuretreated wood before 2004 was treated with cca there has been some interest in requiring labeling or banning of cca wood already in use beyond pesticides national environmental group petitioned epa in december 2001 to ban all residential uses of cca cpsc was petitioned in may 2001 by the environmental working group and the healthy building network to ban cca wood for play structures4 on november 4 2003 cpsc announced that it had denied the petition noting that cca manufacturers and epa had previously agreed to phase out cca treatment of wood for most consumer uses by the end of 20035 for regulatory purposes wood preservatives are considered pesticides and are regulated under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra establishing maximum levels of pesticides in or on food and regulating the sale distribution and use of pesticides in the united states are the responsibilities of epa under fifra the agency also is responsible for ensuring that older pesticides continue to meet current science and regulatory standards to this end epa reassesses the science and uses of older pesticides in reregistration program and determines whether changes are needed to ensure the safety of continued use of older pesticides those initially registered before november 1 1984 the agency presently is reassessing cca under the reregistration program in preparation epa is conducting two risk assessments one focuses on workers an occupational risk assessment and the other focuses on children draft probabilistic risk assessment for children was released in november 2003 for scientific peer review on february 12 2002 epa announced voluntary decision by industry to move away from cca as preservative of wood for consumer use with the regulatory requirement of having only noncca pressuretreated wood manufactured for consumer use after december 31 2003 the agency describes its reregistration review process as having three major parts reliance on sound science epa reports that it is conducting review of ccarelated public health and environmental studies is consulting with other federal entities and will use external peer review in its ongoing risk assessment 4 epa the wood preservative industry various consumer groups and others agree that consumers should be informed of the presence of cca wood preservative especially so that steps are taken to limit exposure to cca such steps include coating the wood not burning the wood not using the wood for kitchen countertops or where it may become component of food and properly disposing of sawdust and scraps some others hold that an outright ban is needed 5 cpsc denies petition to ban cca pressuretreated wood playground equipment news from cpsc november 4 2003 this notice can be found at cpscs website httpwww cpscgovcpscpubprerelprhtml0404026html crs4 involvement of stakeholders the agency reports working closely with wood treaters cca product registrants retailers other federal entities trade associations and public interest groups and consulting with foreign and state governments6 that have taken regulatory actions on cca to understand their scientific assessments and reasons for their regulatory standards participation by the public epa reports that by making its assessments public opening comment periods and conducting public meetings it seeks to maintain open dialogue with the public toward the goal of comprehensive and balanced regulatory decisions the agency reports that it was especially concerned about two major issues relating to ccatreated wood making cca safety and health information readily available to consumers and determining the potential risks to children from play structures treated with cca epa started an assessment early in 2001 focused on the potential exposure of children to ccatreated wood play structures by early 2001 the agency was concerned that its consumer awareness program which was started in 1986 was not informing the public as well as intended epa therefore met in summer 2001 with representatives of the wood preservative industry registrants makers or users of cca registered with epa major retailers and public interest groups to expand the cca consumer awareness program which included labeling on all pieces of ccatreated lumber instore displays and additional information packets available to the public by may 30 2001 epas office of pesticide programs opp had developed an internal draft assessment of risks associated with ccatreated wood the scientific advisory panel met in october 2001 to discuss issues related to childrens exposure to cca from wood and on february 12 2002 the agency announced the voluntary action by industry to move away from cca preservatives recommendations of an independent panel fifra as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 provides for the establishment of the fifra scientific advisory panel sap to provide advice information and recommendations to epas administrator regarding the impact on health and the environment of pesticiderelated regulatory actions the sap provides scientific peer review of the epa office of pesticide programs and is designed to provide balanced expert assessment of pesticiderelated issues sap 6 differences exist among some state and foreign governments in the ways they regulate use and disposal of cca wood california for example requires that all ccatreated public play structures be coated and while most states allow ccatreated wood to be handled similarly to other discarded wood products minnesota does not switzerland vietnam and indonesia have banned arsenictreated wood while japan denmark sweden germany australia and new zealand have either restricted it or proposed restrictions differences also exist as to what types of products may be made of ccatreated wood crs5 members were chosen because of their expertise following an open meeting in october 2001 the sap reported recommendations in memorandum in december 2001 to the director of epas office of pesticide programs the saps report was not reviewed for approval by epa and does not necessarily represent the views of the agency or of any other agencies in the federal government epa received the recommendations and has reported that it has considered them the panel offered several conclusions and recommendations including the following7 while the sap noted the need for additional studies especially of performance of different types and brands of coatings the panel found the evidence already sufficiently strong to recommend that epa should inform the public that certain coatings can substantially reduce the amount of cca that can be leached or dislodged from wood reductions of 70 to 95 in dislodgeable arsenic were seen in cca wood with coatings such as polyurethane and subjected to natural weathering the sap found evidence that water repellents added directly to the cca treatment solution reduced the amount of leachable or dislodgeable cca while the panel to that point found evidence that any particular coating was clearly superior or inferior to any other confidence was highest for polyurethane as it resulted in 70 to 95 reduction in dislodgeable arsenic in wellcontrolled field study realworld application allowing for effects of use and shortterm controlled laboratory study the sap recommended reapplication of coating every year although polyurethane still provided up to 95 reduction after two years of exposure biomonitoring study of children normally exposed to ccatreated play structures should be conducted with the goals of clarifying the magnitude of exposure of children to arsenic and possibly chromium from play structures and to help support development of probabilistic exposure assessment 7 fifra scientific advisory panel meeting october 2325 2001 held at the sheraton crystal city hotel arlington virginia preliminary evaluation of the nondietary hazard and exposure to children from contact with chromated copper arsenate ccatreated wood playground structures and ccacontaminated soil sap report 200112 available at httpwwwepagovoscpmontsapmeetingindexhtm crs6 scientific peer review of draft risk assessment on november 13 2003 epa released its draft preliminary probabilistic risk assessment for children exposed to ccatreated wood the agency released the draft for scientific peer review epa convened its sap on december 35 2003 to seek expert independent scientific advice on the data and methodology used in the draft risk assessment public comments were made during the sap meeting8 the agency on february 12 2004 announced the availability of the saps report on the draft preliminary probabilistic risk assessment epa said it will carefully consider the sap recommendations9 and revise the draft risk assessment as appropriate10 on march 19 2004 epa announced in the federal register the availability for comments of the preliminary risk assessment for the reregistration eligibility decision this notice covered both the occupational and environmental assessments on may 27 2005 epa released preliminary results from studies which showed that all of the 12 commercially available sealants tested reduced dislodgeable arsenic from ccatreated wood for up to 12 months of natural weathering11 michael shannon md chair of the american academy of pediatrics committee on environmental health agreed that sealant can cut down on the arsenic that gets into childrens skin but one knows by how much12 epa announced on its website the following timeline of major pending cca actions13 december 31 2005 announce availability of sealant study final report june 30 2006 announce

announce availability of the cca reregistration eligibility decision disposal issues the resource conservation and recovery act rcra inter alia requires certain solid wastes hazardous wastes to be managed more stringently owing to potential risks to human and environmental health according to the group beyond pesticides some cca wood fails epas toxicity characteristic leaching procedure which simulates conditions in landfill14 further some cca wood leaches arsenic many times above the us primary drinking water standard under epas synthetic precipitation leaching procedure which simulates leaching by rainwater15 while research is ongoing to more fully characterize leaching under more conditions beyond pesticides petitioned epa on july 22 2002 to require that cca wood be considered hazardous and disposed only in landfills with hazardous waste management permits hazardous waste landfill has double liner leachate and gas collection systems and piping of leachate to wastewater treatment plant in 1980 epa exempted cca wood from hazardous waste status as such unless state says otherwise16 cca wood may be disposed like other wood waste for example it may be put into construction and demolition landfills or burned in wastetoenergy facilities or made into mulch if the wood were now to be reclassified as hazardous especially with the projected growth in disposal of cca wood concerns would exist regarding increased costs availability of sufficient hazardous waste management facilities and illegal dumping while epa continues to exempt cca wood from hazardous waste status the agency says that treated wood should never be burned in open fires fireplaces or stoves food should not come into direct contact with the wood hands should be thoroughly washed after contact with wood wood should be coated on regular basis nonarsenical alternatives be considered and epas consumer safety information sheet precautions should be followed17 legislative proposals the following bills relating to arsenic in wood were introduced in the 108th congress 14 see httpwwwbeyondpesticidesorgwoodmediarcra_petition_7_22_02htm 15 good wood gone bad waste age august 2001 p 42 at
