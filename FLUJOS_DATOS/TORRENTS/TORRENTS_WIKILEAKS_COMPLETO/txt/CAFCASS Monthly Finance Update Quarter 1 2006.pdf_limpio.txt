cafcasss latest financial position including details of the expenditure and balance sheet to july 06 the results of the quarter 1 forecasts submitted by budget holders and further action being taken to balance the budget action for the board 21 to note the latest financial position and the results of the quarter 1 forecasting exercise overview in 2006107 cafcass has baseline resource budget of f101025m 1008m grant in aid from dfes plus cafcass income of f0225m in addition dfes have allocated cafcass one off funding of f47m to support it improvements and the change programme in 2006107 based on 05106 expenditure levels all other things being equal cafcass was facing budget pressures of between f 35m and f45m in 2006107 based on the quarter 1 forecasts submitted by budget holders cafcass is forecasting an overspend of e0785m further risks of f07m have been identified giving worst case position of f 15m overspend cafcass are working closely with all budget holders to bring spend in line with the budget and deliver balanced budget in 2006107 page l of 6 33 at this stage breakeven is being forecast against the one off f47m change budget 34 there have been significant movements in the balance sheet from may 06 to july 06 35 the cash draw down and spend to date is in line with projections provided to dfes in july cafcass submitted revised cash profile to dfes including the additional one off funding this revised budget continued to identify cash shortfall formal response has been received by dfes in relation to this revised budget we continue to monitor this on monthly basis the management accounts 41 table 1 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by expense category table 2 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by budget holder reg ionidepartment 42 the tables show expenditure in july of f82m against budget of f83m1 an underspend in the month of 1 the cumulative expenditure to date is f332m against budget of f333m1 an under spend of folm 04 against budget 43 historically due to budget profiling issues and less than 100 accruals coverage the to date financial position has been understated 44 during august all budget holders undertook reprofile exercise to reprofile their budgets to more accurately reflect resource usage and expenditure patterns the results of this exercise are reflected in the july position reported 45 the reprofile exercise has improved the quality of the to date position resulting in more accurate budget profiles the to date position has been brought closer in line with the quarter 1 forecast there is still further work to do in some budget areas on profiling and accruals this will be followed up through the routine quarterly performance reporting and financial self evaluations 5 quarter 1 forecasts 51 based on the forecasts submitted by budget holders cafcass is forecasting an overspend of f0785m 08 against budget of f 101025m 52 the regions are forecasting net overspend of f125m offset by an unallocated f 05m central contingency budget six regions are forecasting significant overspend ie l of their allocated budget and four regions forecasting an underspend or small overspend the largest page 2 of 6 forecast overspend in monetary terms is north west at f374k 275 and south east in terms at 346 198k whilst number of regions are forecasting overspends many of them are containing spend at levels below the 05106 outturn in terms of expenditure areas the f0785m overspend results from f 15m overspend in the following areas f 09m net overspend on workforce costs e02m overspend on running costs f 01 7m overspend on accommodation f 02m shortfall on income the overspend is offset by f07m contingency reserve the largest area of budget pressure is self employed contractors showing f l l m 1 3 overspend the underspend on staff costs relates to vacancies and is offset by the spend on temporary staff largely administrative posts and secs 55 as part of the 2006107 budget setting we assumed receipt of f200k from vat refunds relating to secs in general secs have been reluctant to pursue this due to the work involved and the conflicting advice received from inland revenue to date the income from this has been minimal worstcase position has been assumed this will be kept under review and cafcass will continue to look at ways to maximise income in relation to this area finance has reviewed all the forecasts produced based on the forecasts explanatory notes and spend to date overall the forecasts appear robust in general regions have produced forecasts on bestcase basis flagging and in some cases quantifying the risks both financially and in terms of service delivery based on this we estimate additional risks of approximately f 07m resulting in forecast overspend of between f 07m and f 15m cafcass continues to work with all budget holders to bring spend in line with budgets to eliminate the overspend reported there are significant number of risks associated with the forecasts the main areas are outlined below secs significant progress has been contract management has been improved and strengthened by and large regions have reduced allocations to the secs to level that is affordable within their existing budget the level of allocations however is only affordable if secs work the average workload hours under the current hourly rate contact there is guarantee that this will happen if secs continue to work their previous level of hours regardless of the reduced allocations cafcass will not achieve the savings required to live within budget page 3 of 6 demand the reduced level of referrals to secs and reduced banklovertime usage can only be maintained if activity remain at current levelslor reduce significant increases in activity levels locally will directly impact on costs and or service delivery there is constant balancing act between financial and service delivery considerations interrelationship between one off and base line spending breakeven has been assumed with respect to the one off funding there are number of risks in relation to this and uncertainty regarding any yearend flexibility as outlined below pay negotiations the trade union pay claim for 2006107 is significantly higher than the treasury remit guidance and the budget available negotiations are at very early stage the forecast assumes that the pay settlement is containable within the budget available timescales whilst the forecasts are consistent with spend to date they are based on three months spend and activity only we are still at very early stage in the financial year and the impact of the change programme is just beginning to be realised 58 every effort will be made to bring spend in line with budget the budget task force will continue to work with colleagues in areas such as procurement to identify additional areas of savings corporate directors will be working with all regions to look at ways in which spend can be further reduced whilst maintaining service delivery levels 59 where regions are forecasting an overspend corporate directors will work with the regional director to develop recovery plan where spend cannot be contained within allocated budgets without unacceptable reductions in service delivery regions will be required to submit business case for additional funding to the budget task forceicdg bids for additional budget can be made against the contingency budget or the change budget whichever is most appropriate budget allocations from the recurring budgets will be capped at f 05m ie f 07m contingency less f 02m sec vat shortfall oneoff funding 61 the one off money from dfes relates to eight broad funding streams dfes have advised that cafcass have flexibility within this total sum as long as the capitallrevenue split is maintained and the broad aims and objectives are met any significant changes to the programmes will be discussed with dfes in advance of commitments being made page 4 of 6 62 andrew guymer assumed the post of national change manager in early july whilst work is still ongoing to finalise some budget areas the majority of the oneoff funding has been allocated and committed in june cafcass asked dfes for clarification with regard to any yearend flexibilities dfes have advised that this is not straightforward and there are guarantees that slippage can be carried forward the main areas of risk relate to the ict budgets the ict project is significant capital investment that is subject to the gateway review process this process may affect the timing of the project and as this is sequential project any small delay could have significant knock on effect similarly the ict project includes number of pilots the outcome of these will determine the exact nature value and timing of spend the balance sheet there have been fixed asset additions to date the reduction in fixed assets from f4742m in may to f4429m in july is due to accumulated depreciation and cost of capital charges to date the increase in current assets from f 1400m in may to f2279m in july is due to the month end bank balance and small increase in the level of prepayments largely accommodation related the newly introduced debt recovery process is working well to july 40 of the cases referred 27 in value have been recovered revised procedures are in place for salary overpayments this has resulted in significant improvements in the identification and resolution of overpayments creditors increased from f5681m in may to f6659m in july this is primarily the result of increased accruals coverage by budget holders as monthly accruals procedures are now becoming embedded within the total accruals just under f15m relates to 0506 accruals these are primarily accommodation related costs provisions are reviewed on monthly basis there was small reduction in july the reduction related to provisions being released against costs incurred and the release of 2 provisions which are longer required cash table 4 summarises the cafcass cash budget actual drawn down and actual spend for 0607 page 5 of 6 the revised cashlgrant in aid allocation for 0607 is f 1046m this is made up of f994m base cash allocation plus one off funding and cash of f469m and f05m funding in relation to commissioning for contact activity the contact funding relates to the implementation of the children adoption act 2006 due to delayed implementation this funding may now be withdrawn further clarification is required from dfes in july cafcass submitted revised cash profile to dfes including the one off funding the revised cash budget is f 1067m shortfall of f2lm against cash allocation the shortfall represents the savings target in 0607 in cash terms exactly how this will be achieved and the timing is dependent on number of factors including the progress of the budget task force sec negotiations timing of the change program etc the budget submitted represented the most realistic estimate of cash spend in 0607 at the time the one off spend is particularly difficult to predict with we continue to review the overall 0607 cash requirement as part of the monthly draw down process the actual draw down to august is in line with the revised budget submitted compliance bugetary delegation purchase ordersipayment performance all primary and secondary delegation letters have been signed and returned to for all national office and regional budgets po compliance in july rose to 66 in invoice numbers and 60 in terms of invoice value within this overall figure number of regions are achieving significantly higher coverage this continues to be monitored on monthly basis 93 in line with all government departments cafcass must pay bills in timely manner in 0506 cafcass achieved performance of 815 against the 100 target this area has been targeted for improvement in 0607 monthly statistics are issued to budget holders which can be drilled down to look at team or supplier level in july performance increased to 85 the year to date figure stands at 821 we continue to work on this and are confident that further improvements can be made in the year to move towards 9095 which would be in line with other government departments sharon reed head of strategic finance audit 3oth uust 2006
