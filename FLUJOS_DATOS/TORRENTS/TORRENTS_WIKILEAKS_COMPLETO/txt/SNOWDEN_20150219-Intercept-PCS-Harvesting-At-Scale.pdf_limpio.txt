collecting ki values in transit between mobile network operators and sim card personalisation centres provisioning information is often sent between these organisations by email or ftp with simple encryption methods that can be broken out by opccap or occasionally with encryption at all1 with targeting in place large volume of imsi and associated ki values can be harvested from udaq gchqs corporate c2c data repository with known individuals and operators targeted items of interest can often be returned from bulk c2c data using simple search for the terms ki and imsi in close proximity results will often contain large number of unrelated items however an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of kis work has already been carried out to automate this sifting of bulk data reference 1 describes techniques successfully trialled so far this work builds upon these techniques introducing system to bulk query udaq itself perform the sifting operation on data to identify items of interest packaging these up in form that can usefully be interpreted by researchers in opc cap summary information is also produced for the use of analysts in tdsd the main desired outcomes from this work are to improve tdsds effectiveness at finding kis in c2c content repositories by automating the approach it should be possible to perform more thorough search than tdsd has had the manpower to do at present this is likely to bring higher volumes of kis and imsis to light in addition to spotting interesting items that would not have come to the attention of analysts previously improve tdsds target knowledge more complete picture of imsiki data in c2c repositories will allow tdsd to view the effectiveness of current targeting spot trends as target behaviour changes and also spot any obvious gaps in coverage for example providers for whom this type of harvesting is ineffective develop and enhance tdsds harvesting methodology this methodology is based around knowledge of how network operators sim suppliers and hardware providers cooperate to share cryptographic data by looking at the types of organisations associated with traffic seen in the wild we can test assumptions about communication patterns we expect to take place improving our knowledge of relationships between these companies 1 it should also be noted that tdsd have observed the use of strong encryption products being used eg pgp products these have become increasingly common and used as standard for large sim supplierspersonalisation centres to exchange sim output and input data with mobile network operators 4 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and

opportunities exist to introduce this type of automation to other analyst tasks this work will help develop requirements for such services and bring more automation opportunities to light 5 of 24 this

further data manipulation forward on to system owners figure 1 manual ki harvesting process analysts in the team regularly perform queries on targeted c2c intercept using udaq number of queries exist designed to return results likely to contain imsi and ki values queries often return results with high noise threshold of several thousand results perhaps few hundred will contain items of value the next stage is to trawl these results for items of value if list of imsi and ki values is found this can be copied from the tool and sent on to opccap for further processing in the best case lists of several hundred thousand kis associated with imsi values can be found however large number of messages each contain only few associated ki values the responsibility of converting imsiki lists into storable form lies with opccap tdsd analysts can only spend limited time manipulating the layout of data before forwarding 6 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of

technique figure 2 describes 3 stages of the automated method developed automated pulling of data from bulk repositories analytics identify interesting content data made available to other systems figure 2 automated ki harvesting process details of each stage is provided below 211 bulk data retrieval ictr provide bulk data download capability using the research server llandarcypark this was used to automate the querying of c2c content in udaq given standard sql query wrapped in an xml form this will return package containing all matching c2c intercept base query proximity search for the strings imsf and ki was used for this experiment this can be seen in appendix 1 date fields are marked with placeholders so these can be automatically filled out using regular expressions at run time results are returned as compressed file containing ccdf2 mesh routine was then written to unpack this mesh allowing results to be treated from then on as set of plain text files scripts were developed to perform all steps of the operation automatically retrieving packaged data to be interpreted by the user reference 6 this operates as follows the script jrunremotequerysh is used to launch the process this requests date range to query rewrites the query xml file with required dates cryptologic common data format details are described in reference 4 7 of 24 this information is exempt from

secret strap 1 transfers all required files onto the llandarcypark server including pulludaqsh pulludaqsh is then executed on llandarcypark this executes the bulk iib query can take 510 mins retrieves query results as compressed ccdf files unpacks the ccdf contents into directory as plain text for processing the next stage is to identify content of interest in the processed files 212 identifying content once plain text is retrieved from iib this is parsed to identify items containing imsi and ki values previously proven rule based approach is used to identify content of interest the routine scrapes the plain text identifying lines containing imsi and ki values which may appear in intercept in any conceivable format the technique also attempts to identify header information describing the contents as well as associating results with udaq identifier that can be later researched further technical discussion on this technique is available in reference 1 tdsd technical note 11 what makes good pcs key harvester final stage generates statistics and additional information linked to the results developed in consultation with tdsd analysts this includes list of unique udaq item identifiers resulting in valid ki imsi data this allows analysts to conduct further research into these traffic sources these are ranked according to the number of sections of imsi data seen in each udaq item list of network and country codes identified these are derived from the first 6 characters of an imsi and used to provide an overview of countries and networks identified list of associated email addresses this is generated by scraping all email addresses from results found to contain valid ki data these are then ranked by the number of occurrences of each address care should be taken when interpreting ranking positions in the case of email addresses higher score does not necessarily indicate association with more kis however they can provide an indication of how active an address is an example set of statistics produced is shown in appendix 2 213 processing i storing output files generated by the previous step typically take the form shown in appendix 3 section markers separate the udaq item reference potential header information and imsiki content this format was developed alongside opccap it should be noted that although the content will contain imsi and ki data it could take any conceivable form it is presented as found in raw intercept it is the task of opccap to interpret any additional data in any recognised header section decoding as necessary ki values may still be encrypted at this stage 8 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 opccap have developed and successfully trialled techniques to speed up the task of importing these scripts indentifying expected column header names and mapping these to data fields and even automating the final decryption stage once properly interpreted these ki values can be stored encrypted or clear in relevant databases and shared with partners as necessary 22 possible improvements number of improvements have been identified for the above technique these are described below improved access rights for bulk data retrieval access to ictrs bulk access capability runs on research prototype hardware and is supported only on best endeavours basis making use of processing user to obtain data the maximum classification that can be returned is top secret strap2 uk eyes only this means that some data currently retrieved using the manual method such as passwordrecovered items is not available to the automated system an improved system would allow bulk access to more intercept data processing performance performance of queries on llandarcypark is comparable to that of udaq however when large numbers of items are retrieved the generation of statistics can take some time sometimes hours for large sets some simple code optimisations could significantly improve this performance improvements to summary information scores and ranking the value of using rani to assess the usefulness of an email or udaq item identified is limited since the score used relates to the number of sections of ki data in given file this means where very large number of imsis are identified but they appear in single block low score is awarded value relating to the number of imsi items would be more useful to identify the most important results 9 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 3 running trials the automated harvesting technique was used to extract imsi and ki values from bulk data

kis was recovered in midmarch using this automated process somali providers are not on gchqs list of interest hence it is likely this item would have been missed by manual collection however this was usefully shared with nsa number of other unexpected providers were brought to light including babilonmobile in tajikistan and icelandic provider nova 3g this has demonstrated that an automated ki recovery method can effectively identify imsi and ki pairs from bulk c2c sources for key targets with the added benefit of identifying content that would not normally come to analyst attention the chart presented provides an overview of networks accessible in c2c repositories 32 target discovery 11 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 an experiment was carried out to make use of results from this technique for target discovery statistics produced alongside imsiki results include email addresses appearing in communications alongside this content these email addresses are scored by the number of times they are seen it was proposed that analysis of these addresses should bring to light common communication patterns between operators as well as help identify actors most involved in the sharing of ki data udaq c2c collection is targeted hence any traffic found will originate from an identifier in gchqs corporate systems however it was surmised that additional useful contact addresses could be found associated with traffic all email addresses associated with traffic in each of the 6 periods were compiled together this resulted in list of 154 unique email addresses each associated with score from this it was possible to identify number of candidate targets for further research that scored highly targets email handle suggests an ericsson employee using webmail account shuaweicom this was the highest scoring overall address previously unknown target on the huawei network bgmailcom highest scoring webmail address indicating lots of activity associated with imsis and kis was previously unknown target mtn icsmc number of users associated with this previously unknown domain jedi research shows international gateway for south african provider mtn ill i mil an msn address found to be associated with imsis and kis this has demonstrated number of opportunities to apply this harvesting technique to target discovery efforts 33 measuring targeting effectiveness an experiment was carried out to discover the effectiveness of tdsds current targeting methods email addresses identified in the previous section were converted into list of domains again scored by the number of associations with imsiki data the complete list can be seen in appendix 5 it was then possible to group domains into 5 categories hardware companies organisations such as huawei ericsson who manufacture pcs hardware network operators operators of mobile networks such as mtn irancell belgacom sim suppliers sim suppliers or sim personalisation centres for example bluefish mail providers users of general email providers gmail yahoo etc these may be in use by employees of any of the above 12 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 other unknown most of tdsds targeting effort is focussed on sim suppliers and network operators hence it was expected that most associated addresses would fall into these categories category associations hardware companies 743 mail providers 298 sim suppliers 38 network operators 603 other unknown 37 table 2 types of organisations associated with imsiki traffic table 2 shows how often each type of organisation was associated with ki traffic contrary to expectation the vast majority of addresses seen belonged either to network operators or hardware companies this could indicate increased use of strong encryption products amongst sim suppliers leaving only the other groups open to this method of exploitation tdsd may wish to ensure that targeting for sim suppliers is up to date as well as investigating the possibility of targeting hardware companies and network operators to improve results 34 comparison with present efforts 341 manually collected kis manual trawl of udaq data was performed against awcc for the period between 28th march and 10th april 2010 this was compared direcdy against results from an automated run over the same period not targeted against any particular provider 13 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 in the manual trawl 14 udaq items were identified all containing 1 or more imsiki pair for awcc the automated run found 12 udaq items 3

the manual search resulted in total of 27 imsi values for awcc the automated search resulted in 320 values 26 of which were from the awcc network the automated methods also identified 10 unique imsis from roshan and 83 from mtn yemen results 3 and 23 it can be seen that the automated search missed the majority of manually recovered items reasons for this are noted in the comments column in all cases the string imsi did not appear in the results file hence these items were not returned in the initial bulk query the majority of these items also had imsi and ki data split across multiple unes meaning they would not have been identified by the detection techniques employed in this work in any case both techniques found comparable quantities of imsis for awcc with the result sets being mosdy complimentary this has demonstrated that although the automated method is able to return representative set of items from bulk data and oftenlarger volumes of kis it tended to miss items found manually more work is required both at the initial bulk query stage as well as with processing and detection techniques 14 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of

harvesting efforts tdsd and opccap collect overall stats for kis harvested from networks of interest reference 5 overall rates of kis received over 3month period january march 2010 were compared against those from the automated technique figure 4 shows this comparison for range of networks new kis identified 10000000 1000000 100000 10000 1000 100 10 3 month total automated collection c u 2 ai 0 ä n in lg 5 i i 5 ä ü ä sr h 8 s c 3 1 co 0 cl cd jb 01 h q figure 4 comparing data from the trial to historical data priority targets marked the overall data set contains values gained from range of sources including ki generation techniques and information sharing with partners it can be seen that for the first three providers awcc irancell and roshan the number of keys collected by automated harvesting is comparatively small many of the larger batches of kis received in this period were provided by partners on request and it is difficult to estimate the real time period they were collected over additionally the value of small number of kis should not be underestimated as these can often be used as seeds to generate much larger batches it is clear that the automated technique is able to identify kis for greater range of networks successfully identifying large batch of kis for particular somali provider this comparison did bring to light number of networks where the c2c harvesting method is not bringing results notably the pakistani networks mobilink and telenor for whom we do have store of kis there could be number of explanations it is possible that these 15 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 networks now use more secure methods to transfer kis or targeting for those networks might be ineffective in summary the automated technique is unlikely to bring in very large batches of ki data of the size produced with ki generation schemes or received from partner repositories however it can bring in steady stream of data over period of time these smaller volumes can fill gaps where other data is available and also provide essential seed points from which ki generation can be applied 16 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the

conclusions this work has demonstrated that an automated method of ki recoveiy once in place can deliver significant results with little manual effort compared to current harvesting methods in addition to ki harvesting number of further applications have been demonstrated the monitoring of mobile network activity where views have been provided over 3month period discovery of new target identifiers associated with detected traffic and methods of measuring the effectiveness of current techniques picture of types of organisations associated with ki traffic has been constructed providing new view of mobile network operations to tdsd it has also been shown that although the automated method is able to return representative set of items from bulk data it often fails to detect all items that would be found manually more work is required at the initial bulk query stage and also with detection techniques to ensure accurate and full coverage of ki data whilst problems have been identified such as limits on coverage due to access restrictions this work makes strong case that such harvesting efforts will continue to deliver results in tdsd and areas such as the cp sd team it is the authors view that increased levels of corporate support for such bulk data processing activities would allow tdsd as well as many other business areas to benefit from more applications of these techniques 41 future work number of items of followup work have been identified improving initial query effectiveness it has been shown that the initial base proximity query is not effective enough to return all results currently found using manual harvesting work should be carried out to identify more effective queries to process data on an alternative option is to run the technique repeatedly against number of result sets improved detection techniques detection techniques are unable to identify ki and imsi data where the fields of interest appear on separate lines see section 342 an improved technique would ensure these results are also detected and included improved summary information summary information currendy consists of list of email addresses udaq item identifiers and network codes associated with simple scores analysts would like to be able to find the udaq item associated with particular imsi or email address more easily an improved scoring system would also help analysts more accurately 17 of 24 this information is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other uk information legislation refer disclosure requests to gchq on nonsec or email top secret strap 1 top secret strap 1 prioritise items found additionally the accuracy of results could be improved by detecting only imsis with valid country and network codes bulk access limitations the maximum classification that can be returned from llandarcypark is top secret strap2 uk eyes only this limits access to some data likely to contain imsi and ki values such as passwordrecovered items an improved system would allow bulk access to the full range of data adapting technique to be used for other key types this technique currently identifies only imsi and ki values in time it should be extended to also support efforts against ota keys umts and more data mining opportunities opportunities exist to mine bulk data produced during this process potentially detecting further items of interest and developing knowledge of targets involved proposed ideas include detecting requests for batches of data by identifying messages containing maximum and minimum sim values corporate support for bulk c2c processing access to ictrs bulk access capability is restricted to small number of users however number of business units have expressed an interest this work should continue to be used to develop requirements for corporate solution allowing more business units to benefit from these types of techniques 18 of 24 this
