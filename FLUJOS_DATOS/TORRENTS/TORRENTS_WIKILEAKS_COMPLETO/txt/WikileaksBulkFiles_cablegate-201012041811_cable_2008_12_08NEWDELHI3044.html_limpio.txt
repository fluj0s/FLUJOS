summary diplomatic missions in delhi have agreed to offer more sympathetic message to the indians rather than pound on the government for its massive intelligence failure evidence that pakistanibased extremist group lashkaretayyiba let was the culprit is still not out in the open although the question being asked now is whether pakistans intelligence agency the interservices intelligence isi was directly involved in the attack dipomatic missions in delhi are praising delhi for its restraint while advising pakistan that now is the time to collaborate end summary offering only sympathy and support 2 c at 2 december meeting with counterparts from the australian british canadian and new zealand high commissions these diplomats communicated details of the controlled approach their respective missions in delhi have taken in their responses to indias reaction to the mumbai attacks they concluded that any offers of assistance should be made carefully to avoid being interpreted by the indians as politically motivated or attempts to monitor their actions delhibased missions are taking extra care at this stage to not get sucked into the blame game pakistan and india are currently playing 3 c the eu diplomatic mission heads are scheduled for strategic dialogue with india on 5 december to discuss what type of support india would feel comfortable receiving in addition the eu plans to send to delhi counterterrorism coordinator in january 4 c the french ambassador according to the british high commission called the french german and italian ambassadors unbeknownst to other eu partners to discuss assistance to the indians president sarkozy is expected to call prime minister singh to express his sympathy and to offer cooperation at suitable level 5 sbu the australian prime minister in his speech to his parliament said australia stands with india at this time and offered any assistance that their friends in new delhi may require he stressed the importance of tracking down those responsible for the planning and execution of the mumbai attacks singling out let as an separatist militant group which has been threat to india for long time but saying it is too early to speculate on who the perpetrators were the million dollar question 6 c while indian press continues to pin blame on pakistan observers and diplomats in delhi are asking the same question was the isi behind the mumbai attacks while there are clear links between the attacks perpetrators and the extremist group let and likewise there are links between let and the isi there is clear evidence yet to suggest that isi directed or facilitated the attacks according to the british high commission demarching the indians and pakistanis 7 c british diplomat told us that uk foreign secretary miliband urged restraint to external affairs minister new delhi 00003044 002 of 002 mukherjee when they spoke on 1 december the call took place only after many delays on the gois part mukherjee apparently disavowed any interest in raising tensions further but insisted that pakistan must take action in response to indias demands our contact stressed that the uk had been very direct in presenting india and pakistan with specific information regarding those responsible for the attacks she also noted that the list of names the indians had put on the most wanted criminals list that had been passed to islamabad included figures such as fugitive crime lord dawood ibrahim and jaishemohammed chief maulana azhar who had been on prior lists the indians had submitted in her view this took away from the focus on let members implicated in the mumbai attacks 8 c narayanan according to british diplomats delivered the message that he understands pakistans civilian government has control over the isi or the army he said india is not blaming the pakistani government the indian ministry of foreign affairs is still waiting on the pakistanis to provide the name of the isi director they plan to send as well as date 9 c the australian high commission delivered the message to the pakistanis that this is watershed and cooperation with the indians now is crucial the australians have praised the indians for the past restraint they have shown toward pakistan and offered assistance which was politely denied according to an australian diplomat zardari cornered 10 c an official in the pakistani high commission in delhi told poloff that he held the indian press responsible for any deterioration in the indopak relationship following the indian press coverage which misrepresented the potential visit of the isi chief and complicated potential cooperation between the two governments this diplomat said zardaris options became more limited and the gop felt it had other choice than to backpedal on its initial offer made before the mumbai attacks to send its isi chief to india mulford
