6202c27 shspec116 auditors code the auditors code is to make auditing possible it is practical tool like most of scientology the auditors code was compiled in 1951 in wichita all of the points of the auditors code are empirical points the first theoretical code in dmsmh had greater appeal but was not the practical code lrh still favors it because it includes the idea that an auditor is courageous see dmsmh p 178 the first dianetic axioms were written in 1951 they are quite practical as auditing axioms and should be given more attention similarly with the prelogics the logics are interesting as synthesis of all education but there you are on theoretical material the mind as discussed in dmsmh is still what you are working with there is also some data in the original thesis that is very applicable to auditing the auditor as thetan plus the pc as thetan is greater than the pcs reactive mind etc the auditor cannot condemn the pc and expect the pc to overcome the reactive mind that set of formulas is what the auditors code was set up to put into effect the rules help the auditor avoid invalidating the pc as thetan and thereby beefing up his reactive mind the reactive mind is made up of machinery circuits and valences where machinery fits in is unclear unless it is the valence of machine circuit is specialized function of an identity or valence it is balledup automatic nothetan valence the thetan gave the identitywhichnowisacircuit orders for so long that now the circuit is giving the pc orders its the stuck flow mechanism the backflow the pc thetan has been resident in this body the identity giving it orders say to eat all of the mechanical actions of eating etc this has gone on for so long that the pc gets as backflow the idea that the identity should feed him so it becomes circuit this is all pertinent to 3dxx since all the things that make this life difficult went on in the lifetime of the earlier identity in an even more arduous and sincere way doubt that life has been lived and it is now neatly packaged as engrams ridges circuits etc all floating free longer located on the track package is the accumulated life experience of past identity just as this present lifetime can get grouped the black v case in the same way you can have valence going into grouper and becoming round black ball circuit which gives orders does various things etc as we pull this apart we will find all the picture manifestations and mechanisms you have in engrams chains etc all present in that circuit that circuit belongs somewhere on the time track in relation to the other circuits but if it is part of the gpm it has floated free from its position on the time track and every moment of time is now time it is instant time hence your instant read on the emeter instant read occurs because there is need to look or think and key anything in to get the read that which reads with an instant read is already there and keyed in in an eternal present time the following data is pertinent the above plus the phenomena of matter energy space and time the association of incidents the confusions and the early axiom that life is composed of differences similarities and identities the mind resolves problems related to survival utilizing its ability to conceive similarities and observe differences dianetics the original thesis p 59 the analytical mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experience data to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics it thinks in differences and similarities the reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files and retains physical pain and painful emotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on stimulusresponse basis it thinks only in identities dmsmh pp 589 all time is identified with this time and we get all these identities giving pcs all these orders dictating all these reflexes and that is really all you are handling all the counterpoints of morality that do exist and have existed give us so many confusions and conflicts on rightness of conduct that we can then get people seeking right conduct until they go nuts most laws are passed to prevent earlier laws from being applied if you are an egyptian then persian then greek then roman if you set up rightnessofconduct circuit for one culture you will be nutty in your next culture your circuit will have points of conflict with current mores if you set up new circuit you have more new automatic impulses which have to cancel the previous ones etc etc overlaid and confused by the builtin stops after few lifetimes we may feel less than free unable to decide etc this wouldnt be so bad if rightness of conduct was light matter but we get into cultures where it is life and death matter then the solution may be to forget it all to notis it to say that we have only lived once to shove it under the rug but now having hidden the source of the nowimsupposedtos its even worse we go around getting strange ideas which we cant even stop feeling peculiar if it were just rightness of conduct that we were concerned about it wouldnt be too bad but the moral codes are usually enforced with somatics the somatic is most intimately connected in mental phenomena with rightness and wrongness of conduct punishment just the physical universe enforces punishment for wrong estimation of direction and effort for instance if one makes mistake in ones footwork one may fall downstairs rightness of conduct enforced with pain inevitably becomes an enforced conduct so these valences and circuits enforce rightness of conduct on the pc with pain as the enforcer the somatic we try to run them out and get somatics the somatics appear so formidable that it seems we had better not touch the valence this protects it and allows it to keep up its flow of orders to the pc if you want to see how much command value the valence has over the pc note what he is saying doing and thinking in the few minutes just before you nail the item at that time it is in its highest level of restimulation its command value is extreme when it is found and identified its command value drops off but if it is also very unsafe thing that has tremendous withholds in its own lifetime if it is valence that keeps dropping out of the pcs sight and is unsafe to reveal the pc will dramatize it more when it has been brought to view he wont dramatize it much but he will still feel its impulses and feel upset about having the impulses that makes him feel very odd pc who is running his 3dxx terminal can find himself equating all his normal activities as being those of the terminal it can make him feel that he is on the verge of being found out all the time he is being it not being it and deciding he doesnt have to be it these are identities the person has been residual training patterns and facsimiles from those lifetimes every facsimile from that lifetime is in that bundle the pictures are there but smudgy and out of focus then as you try to run them you find that they have been laid in with tremendous cold this makes winter bad time to run 3dxx these black masses are drained of heat energy mostly however like cinders they contain occasional hot spots so you can get fevers off of them after death between lives people often go off into the ionosphere or into space where it is very cold here the track collapses and they get all their stuff keyed in because cold motion time every one of these bundles contains pictures in greater or lesser degree of decay the pictures are already burnt out and deteriorated to some degree and dont show up too well the pc may be disappointed not to have better pictures of those lifetimes this could be the way it goes the item itself was scarce so he made picture of it then because he didnt have the item but did have the picture the picture itself became scarce and therefore very valuable it could become so scarce and so valuable that the pc couldnt have it at all that is the condition of most of these circuits and valences at the same time the pc wants these pictures and has to have them he wont have anything to do with them and cant have them so you have nohavingness of the pictures so he uses the picture he depends on it to orient himself and to tell you what he is doing so he remains in state of godhelpus as you remedy his havingness and bring these things back prepcheck them get his overts off etc this state of affairs will improve persons havingness deteriorates to the degree he commits overts per the overtmotivator sequence only when an individual has done something to another can he receive the same action as an inflow fortunately it is not oneforone mechanism it is the sensibility of having done something that counts when you have done something to something you have cut down your havingness you get individuated to the point where it is their havingness and my havingness and therefore i can protect my havingness by destroying their havingness this totally overlooks the point that it is all your havingness if you destroy someone elses havingness you destroy your own because you have what others have havingness as personal ownership is misconception you actually own that which you can perceive this has degraded down to the idea that you can only own that which you can personally use freedom of use is the final idea of havingness to lot of people but it isnt really the final idea of havingness at all that is why the communist and the socialist etc can make such an effect on society because he is talking on harmonic that is mockery of what is basically true all ideas of ownership are postulated ownerships nobody really owns anything except those things that one owns by the right of having created them therefore some people fall back on creativeness as the only way of life because it is the only possible way of declared ownership what they neglect to point out is that what the other guy made is theirs too community property is lower mockery of this fact i dont even know that you own everything you create you can continue responsibility for the things you create without owning them in auditing the problem is to understand what fundamentals are important and what are not fundamentals dont think all data are equally important the things mentioned in this lecture are the basic important things the importance of datum in relation to other data is the sole criterion of the value of the datum in all study one must evaluate the importances of your data relative to the purpose and activity you are going to do it is not enough to be learned and to know data to be wise you have to be able to relate data to actions people tend to make data of monotone value not all this data in dianetics and scientology is equally important but if you know the basic and fundamental data you can easily decide what to handle and how in session
