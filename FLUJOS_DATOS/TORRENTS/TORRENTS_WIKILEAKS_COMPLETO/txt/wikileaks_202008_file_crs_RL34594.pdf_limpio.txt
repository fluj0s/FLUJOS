farm commodity price and income support provisions in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill include three primary types of payments direct payments unrelated to production or prices countercyclical payments for commodity that are triggered when prices are below statutorilydetermined target prices or b revenue falls below historical guaranteed level and marketing assistance loans that offer interim financing and if prices fall below loan prices set in statute additional income support the farm commodity programs are the most visible part of the farm bill in recent years five crops corn wheat cotton rice and soybeans ac count for over 90 of government commodity payments to farmers the 2008 farm bill generally continues the farm commodity price and income support framework of the 2002 farm bill with modifications it continues the direct payment countercyclical payment and marketing loan programs for the 20082012 crop years but adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities the law also creates pilot revenuebased countercyclical program acre beginning with the 2009 crop year the new law also has pilot program for planting flexibility new restrictions on base acres developed for residential use and elimination of benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops for the 2008 crop year the programs are essentially unchanged from the 2002 farm bill payment limits both determine eligibility and set maximum amount of commodity payments per person the 2008 farm bill revises payment limita tions for the commodity programs by tightening some limits and relaxing others limits are tightened by 1 reducing the adjusted gross income agi limit to 500000 of nonfarm agi and 750000 of farm agi 2 eliminating the threeentity rule which allowed individuals to double their payments by having multiple ownership interests doubling by having spouse continues and 3 requiring direct attribution of payments to living person limits are relaxed by eliminating any limit on the marketing loan program the new rules do not take effect until the 2009 crop year implementation has been problematic in two ways first the administration did not allow farmers to combine land before enforcing the 10acre restriction an allowance congress mentioned only in report language consequently congress passed hr 6849 to suspend enforcement of the 10acre provision for one year and offset the cost with reductions in computer technology outlays and changes to the new permanent disaster program the bill awaits the presidents signature the second implementation issue is that usda is considering using prices from crop years 2006 and 2007 for setting the 2009 acre revenue guarante rather than the immediate past two years of 2007 and 2008 as congress intended the regulations however have not yet been released

for the farm commodity price and income support programs is that markets do not efficiently balance commodity supply with demand imbalances develop because consumers do not respond to price changes by buying proportionally smaller or larger quantities food demand is price inelastic similarly farmers do not respond to price changes by proportionally reducing or increasing production supply is price inelastic these imbalances may contribute to volatile farm income which can result in inadequate or exaggerated resource adjustments by farmers moreover the long time lag between planting and harvest may magnify imbalances because economic and yield conditions may change the economic argument against the farm commodity programs is that like any subsidy the farm programs distort production capitalize benefits to the owners of the resources encourage concentration of production and comparatively harm smaller domestic producers and farmers in lowerincome foreign nations the objectives of federal commodity programs are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks to the federal government these risks include shortterm market price instability and longerterm capacity adjustments the goals are to maintain the economic health of the nations farm sector so that it can utilize its comparative advantages to be globally competitive in producing food and fiber 1 the conference agreement on the 2008 farm bill was originally approved by the house and the senate as hr 2419 and vetoed by the president in may 2008 both chambers overrode the veto making the bill law pl 110234 however the trade title was inadvertently excluded from the enrolled bill to remedy the situation both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure in june 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124law as pl 110246 and superseded pl 110234

support for specific list of farm commodities for most of these commodities support began during 1930s depressionera efforts to raise farm household income when commodity prices were low because of prolonged weak consumer demand while initially intended to be temporary effort the commodity support programs survived but have been modified away from supply control and management of commodity stocks into direct income support payments critics of commodity programs usually acknowledge the underlying economic conditions that make stability more difficult to achieve for agriculture than for some other sectors however they argue that 1 current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade 2 the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of production and make the united states less competitive in global markets2 and 3 the benefits are concentrated among comparatively small number of commodities produced on small number of large farms3 when farm programs were first authorized in the 1930s most of the 6 million farms in the united states were small and diversified policymakers reasoned that stabilizing farm incomes using price supports and supply controls would help large part of the economy 25 of the population lived on farms and assure abundant food supplies in recent decades the face of farming has changed farmers now comprise less than 2 of the population most agricultural production is concentrated in fewer larger and more specialized operations about 8 of farms account for 75 of farm sales these 175000 farms had average sales over 1 million most of the countrys 2 million farms are parttime and many operators rely on offfarm jobs for most of their income supporters of commodity subsidy programs may not contradict the critics but do point out that other nations have distorting subsidy programs andor trade barriers that should be eliminated if the united states is to make reforms landowners are concerned about loss of rents and wealth if land prices drop in response to reduction in the subsidies similarly rural communities are concerned about any large decline in the real estate tax base that supports local schools roads and other community services while large farms receive most of the productionlinked subsidy payments recipients argue that lower input costs and marketing efficiencies make large farms efficient and small farms uneconomic in the production of bulk commodities therefore targeting subsidies to small farms recipients say would encourage inefficient production g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g163g146g151g144g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 the authority for usda to operate farm commod ity programs comes from three permanent laws as amended the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 pl 75430 the agricultural act of 1949 pl 81439 and the commodity credit corporation ccc charter act of 1948 pl 80806 congress typically alters these laws through multiyear omnibus farm bills to address current market conditions budget constraints or other concerns 2 predictable government payments are capitalized into land

enacted when an old one expires we would revert to the permanent laws mentioned above for the commodities programs under permanent law eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible since reverting to permanent law is incompatible with current national economic objectives global trading rules and federal budgetary policies pressure builds at the end of one farm bill to enact another4 the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 contains the most recent version of the commodity price and income support programs it supersedes the commodity programs of previous farm bills and suspends the relevant price support provisions of permanent law

mustard seed crambe and sesame seed peanuts are supported similarly farmers receive constant direct payments tied to historical production except pulse crops do not receive direct payments despite being covered commodity farmers may also receive countercyclical and marketing loan payments that increase when market prices or in some cases revenue are low loan commodities include all of the covered commodities plus extra long staple cotton wool mohair and honey these commodities are eligible for the marketing loan program only dairy prices are indirectly supported through federal

share of the crop produced on the farm in addition an individual must comply with certain conservation and planting flexibility rules term commonly used in federal regulations is actively engaged in farming which generally means providing significant contributions of capital land or equipment and labor andor management and receiving share of the crop as compensation conservation rules include protecting wetlands preventing erosion and controlling weeds planting flexibility rules allo w crops other than the program crop to be grown but generally prohibit planting fruits or vegetables on subsidized acreage modern farming enterprises usually involve some combination of owned and rented land two types of rental arrangements are common cash rent and share rent under cash rental contracts the tenant pays fixed cash rent to the landlord the landlord receives the same rent bears risk in production and thus is not eligible to receive program payments the tenant bears all of the risk takes all of the harvest and receives all of the government subsidy under share rental contracts the tenant usually supplies most of the labor and machinery while the landlord supplies land and perhaps some machinery or management both the landlord and tenant bear risk in producing crop and receive portion of the harvest 5 both are eligible to share in the government subsidy even though tenants might receive all of the government payments under cash rent arrangements they might not keep all of the benefits if landlords demand higher rent economists widely agree that large portion of government farm payments passes through to landlords and that government payments raise the price of land about 60 of acres enrolled in the government commodity programs are rented6

types of commodity payments in relation to market prices of the countercyclical payments only traditional pricetriggered countercyclical payments are included in the figure using corn as an example if market prices are above 235bushel neither counter cyclical nor marketing loan benefits eg ldp would apply if market prices are between 195 and 235bushel countercyclical payment would accrue but ldp would be available if market prices are below the loan rate of 195bushel the maximum countercyclical payment of 040bushel is made and an ldp would be avai lable equal to the difference between the 195 loan rate and the market price regardless of market prices however the direct payment of 028bushel is paid figur 1 relationship of commodity p yments to mark et prices source crs an important consideration for the farm commodity programs is how they are classified for trade purposes as member of the world trade organization wto the united states made agricultural policy commitments under the wtos agreement on agriculture all wto members agree to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the wto and these outlays are subject to specific limits for the united st ates its total spending limit for programs that are considered to be trade distorting is 191 billion per year other types of payments are not subject to limits if they are decoupled or not considered to be

some to justify the annual outlays for direct payments which amount to 5 billion per year eligible commodities include wheat corn grain sorghum barley oats upland cotton rice peanuts soybeans and other oilseeds including sunflower seed rapeseed canola safflower flaxseed mustard seed crambe and sesame seed farm is eligible for direct payments in proportion to its base acres which are constant historical average of its planting history of particular commodity for many farms base acres date to the 1980s but for some farms base acres were updated in 2002 in addition to its base acreage each farm has direct payment yield for each commodity which is also an unchanging historical average based on the farms actual yields over the 19811985 period farmer is not obligated to grow the covered commodity to receive direct payment for that commodity eg farm may plant soybeans on corn base acres and receive the direct payment for corn the rationale for this planting flexibility is to allow farmers to respond to market signals when choosing crops because direct payments are constant and allow planting flexibility they are arguably less distorting of production than prior farm programs that had greater government intervention 7 direct payments thus are thus known as decoupled payments and the united states has classified them as green box when reporting agricultural subsidies to the wto green box payments help countries comply with international trade agreements because they do not count against subsidy ceilings 8 however because the planting flexibility rules still have restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables discussed later in this report the direct payment program may be subject to challenge as to whether it qualifies as green box payment9 this challenge was raised during the 2008 farm bill debate as reason to revise the direct payment program or allow complete planting flexibility but the program was not changed in the 2008 farm bill the direct payment rates per commodity remain the same as in the 2002 farm bill table 1 but the overall formula to compute the payment contains 2 reduction in direct payments for crop years 20092011 conferees accomplished this by changing the ratio of base acres on which direct payments are made from 85 to 833 10 the 85 ratio is restored for the 2012 crop year to maintain higher baseline for the next farm bill 7 before planting flexibility was introduced in the early 199 0s farmers were required to grow the commodity for which they had base acres in order to participate in the government program to control production when surpluses existed the government often required farmers to set aside or not plant part of their base acreage 8 for brief discussion about wto procedures for classifying government support programs see crs report rs20840 agriculture in the wto li mits on domestic support by randy schnepf 9 in 2007 canada and brazil initiated wto cases against the us farm programs charging that direct payments are inappropriately classified in the green box see crs report rl34351 brazils and canadas wto cases against us agricultural support by randy schnepf 10 the reduction in payment acres to 833 does not affect the countercyclical payment formula but the lower percentage is used for planted acreage in the acre program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34594

below target prices set in statute12 historically the farm commodity programs have focused on price but producers have cited insuff icient government support during years with natural disasters when yields are low and prices are high in those years they have little to sell and thus do not benefit from high market prices but do not receive countercyclical support either in response to this criticism the 2008 farm bill creates revenuebased countercyclical program called the average crop revenue election acre the acre program is an alternative to the traditional price countercyclical program and is based on statewide crop specific revenue data acre makes payments when actual revenues from commodity are less than marketbased moving average revenue guarantee eligible commodities for

actual revenue for supported crop must be less than the farms benchmark revenue the second trigger keeps farms from receiving payments when they did not have sufficient loss even if the state as whole

production than larger area because the revenue guarantee is moving average and yeartoyear changes are limited the guarantee will lag changes in the market if the market price declines over several

impacts of the legislation does not reflect the magnitude of this possibility because market prices in the baseline are expected to remain high21 in light of these concerns over the level of outlays the administration has indicated that it may not use the immediately preceding two crop years to set the revenue guarantee level for acre as instructed in statute this has caused debate between congress and the administration over congressional intent the administration wants to use prices from 2006 and 2007 when implementing acre for the 2009 crop year this w ould set lower revenue

nonrecourse loans22 that farmers can obtain by pledging their harvested commodities as collateral traditionally the loans provide interim financing by allowing farmers to receive some revenue for their crop when the loan is requested while at the same time storing the commodity for later disposition when prices may be higher23 as an alternative to taking out loan the loan deficiency payment ldp is ca sh payment option that allows farmers to sell grain in response to market signals without putting their commodity under loan while receiving the price benefits of the loan program marketing

program allows farmers to pay cr editors with money from the usda loan and not make marketing decisions based on the immediate need to pay creditors without the loan program farmers sometimes would need to sell their crop at low harvest prices to pay operating expenses and not be able to benefit from cyclical rise in market prices market prices of covered commod ities within marketing year usually follow predictable pattern they are often lowest at harvest when surge of new supply floods the market and grain not stored on the farm is delivered to elevators as the marketing year progresses prices gradually rise to compensate for storing the commodity and to draw the commodity out of storage in response to new demand

generally refers to owning the commodity or having stake in its disposition beneficial interest is lost when the commodity is sold the administration had recommended that the farm bill change the beneficial interest rule25 but congress did not change it the rule allows farmers to lock in their ldp when market prices are low usually at harvest continue to own the commodity and sell it at future and pos sibly higher market price than when the ldp was determined policy makers said they wanted farmers to continue to have the flexibility to market their commodities in response to market signals and benefit from the program advocates for change pointed out that if farmers can sell their crop for more than the support price then government support should be unnecessary more generally if farmers can sell their crop for more than the market price at the time that the ldp was determined the ldp would not need to be as large these advocates for change wa nted the determination of the ldp to be tied to when farmer loses beneficial interest although the beneficial interest rules remain the same the loan repayment rate also known as the posted county price or pcp used to determine the ldp is to be computed using 30day average of market prices rather than the daily repayment rate of the 2002 and prior farm bills using 30day average for the repayment rates will lessen but not eliminate the market timing strategies that some farmers have used to maximize ldps 24 local loan prices are available at httpwwwfsa usdagovfsawebappareahomesubjectprsutopiclor 25 usda 2007 farm bill

special import quotas and limited global import quotas the 2008 farm bill also creates new payment for domestic users of upland cotton the payment is termed economic adjustment assistance and is only to be used to acquire construct modernize develop convert or expand operations unlike the step 2 cotton payment that was eliminated following wto ruling against the us cotton program26 the new cotton users payment is for upland cotton of domestic or foreign origin the payment is 4 cents per pound from august 1 2008 to july 31 2012 thereafter the payment rate is 3 cents per pound

receive per year the other sets the maximum amount of income that an individual can earn and still remain eligible for program benefits means test the farm commodity programs have had the first type of limit since 1970 the means test was added starting with the 2002 farm bill and also is known as the adjusted gross income agi limit the 2008 farm bill makes several changes to payment limits some by tightening the limits and others by relaxing them limits are tightened by reducing the agi limit b eliminating the threeentity rule which allowed individuals to double their payments by having multiple ownership interests and c requiring direct attribution of payments to living person instead of to corporation general partnership etc limits are relaxed by eliminating any limit on marketing loans the new payment limit rules do not take effect until the 2009 crop year

questions about what size farms should be supported whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual and who should receive payments the effect of payment limits varies across regions the south and west have more large farms than the upper midwest or northeast and are more affected by payment limits cotton and rice farms are affected more often than corn soybean or wheat farms since the former groups subsidies per acre are higher 26 for more information about the step 2 program and the wto ruling see crs report rl32571 brazils wto case against the us cotton

limits use both economic and political arguments to justify tighter limits economically they contend that large payments facilitate consolidation of farms into larger units raise the price of land and put smaller familysized farming operations at disadvantage even though tighter limits would not redistribute benefits to smaller farms they say that tighter limits could help indirectly by reducing incentives to expand and could help small and beginning farmers buy and rent land politically they believe that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly newspapers have published stories critical of farm payments and how they are distributed to large farms nonfarmers or landowners 27 limits are increasingly appealing to urban lawmakers and have advocates among smaller farms and social interest groups critics of payment limits and thus supporters of higher limits or limits counter that all farms are in need of support especially when market prices decline and that larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved they say that farm payments help us agriculture compete in global markets and that income testing is at odds with federal farm policies directed toward improving us agriculture and its competitiveness

attributed to person is 105000 for direct and countercyclical payments combined the payment limit has two parts 40000 for direct payments and 65000 for countercyclical payments these amounts effectively can be doubled to combined 210000 for sole proprietors farm by having spouse table 2 these amounts are the same as in the 2002 farm bill corporations partnerships and trusts are eligible for payments but the payments must be attributed to living person by the fourth level of ownership payments for most commodities are combined toward single limit but separate and equal payment limit applies to peanuts marketing loan gains and ldps are unlimited in the 2008 farm bill change from prior law that had imposed 75000 limit but that could be avoided legally by using commodity certificates to repay marketing loans28 both the house and senatepassed bills chose to eliminate limits on marketing loans altogether in the 2008 farm bill rather than apply payment limits to the use of commodity certificates this was in response to concerns from cotton and rice growers who did not want tighter limits and who were already opposing reductions in the agi limit since commodity certificates now are viewed by many as unnecessary the farm bill terminates authority to use certificates to repay marketing loans after the 2009 crop year 27 for example see the washington post series harvesting cash published in 2006 at httpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpsrvnationinteractivesfarmaid 28 marketing loan benefits in the 2002 farm bill were essentially unlimited because pr oducers could use commodity certificates without limit when other marketing loan options were limited cotton and to lesser extent rice farms were the primary users of certificates corn soybeans and wheat used certificates minimally the prior law allowed certificates 7 usc 7286 and farmers essentially bought certificates at discount and used them to repay their loans but technically certificate exchange was momentary forfeiture followed by inkind receipt of commodities in exchange for certificate bought at discounted price and only available to marketing loan participants usda report of the commission on

payment limits to farm organization which sometimes promoted the creation of entities for the purpose of doubling payment limits the 2008 farm bill allows payments to various types of entities but it now requires that the payments be attributed to living person based on ownership shares in the entities if payment to business entity cannot be allocated to living person after four levels of ownership the payment to the overall entity is reduced proportionately thus individual people may receive payments on any number or ownership arrangement of farms not limited to three entities but the total amount of payments attributed to each living person may not exceed the statutory limits

farm bill for the agi limit formerly the agi limit had an exception if 75 of agi was earned from farming sources the 2008 farm bill eliminates the exception and creates two new measures of agi adjusted gross nonfarm income and adjusted gross farm income first if threeyear average of nonfarm agi exceeds 500000 then program benefits are allowed direct countercyclical and marketing loan second if threeyear average of farm agi exceeds 750000 then direct payments are allowed but countercyclical and marketing loan benefits are allowed for these higherincome farmers table 2 shows that program participants can have income from both sources but the caps for each type are hard caps that is there are exceptions to the cap as with soft caps except that the cap on farm agi applies only to direct payments for example if fulltime farmer has nonfarm agi over 500000 hisher program payments are eliminated regardless of hisher farm income another example is that taxpayer may have agi between 750000 and 125 million and still receive program benefits if the income is split in such way as to remain below the caps on farm and nonfarm income moreover the 2008 farm bill adopts senate provision that allows the agi of married couple to be divided as if separate tax returns were filed while this provision theoretically allows doubling of the agi limits to 25 million for married couple the income needs to be legitimately allocated both between the spouses and by the types of income likely by social security numbers or equivalent identifiers such doubling to 25 million would be more difficult than the 25 million agi test of the 2002 farm bill g10g152g160g561g15g138g151g162g561g8g138g155g150g142g155g156g561g3g155g142g561g3g143g143g142g140g157g142g141g501g561 reliable national data on the

the report of the payment limits commission mandated by the 2002 farm bill29 about 1 of producers receiving payments in 2000 were affected by the 40000 limit on what now are called direct payments this amounted to 12300 producers across 42 states the reduction was 83 million or 16 of the value of payments with california and texas accounting for 36 of the reduction under the 2002 farm bills agi limit of 25 million annual data suggest that only about 3100 015 farmers had agi over 25 million since not all of these farm taxpayers receive commodity subsidy payments and some likely w ould have qualified for the 75 farm income exception usda estimated that the 2002 farm bills agi cap affected only few hundred farmers30 masked by these data is the fact that limits could be avoided usually legally by reorganizing farm31 in fact one study in 2007 suggests that about 20 of rice farmers reorganized their business because of limits despite only 12 appearing to be subject to the limit32 the 2008 farm bills elimination of the threeentity rule and application of direct attribution to living persons should lessen reorganization of farm businesses solely for purposes of avoiding payment limits in terms of the 2008 farm bill data are not yet available that are specific to the farm bill limits of 500000 nonfarm agi and 750000 farm agi during the debate over tighter limits usda data suggested that about 15 of farm operator households have agi over 200000 and received some farm program payments 11 of farm sole proprietorships 25 of farm partnerships and 97 of farm households involved in farming through corporation about 85 of rice farms and 93 of cotton farms have agi over 200000 and receive program payments this compares to 55 for corn farms and only 13 for soybean farms 33 the farms potentially affected by the agi limit are not necessarily large farms nor necessarily above the agi limit because of high farm income supporters of the agi proposal say farmers are skilled at managing income taxes and can keep taxable farm income lower using tax incentives and rules34 the portion of farmers affected by the relatively higher limits in the farm bill would be smaller than the percentages in the preceding paragraph 29 usda payment limit commission report pp 6575 30 ron durst effects of reducing the income cap on eligibility for farm program payments usdaers

direct and countercyclical payments to farms with fewer than 10 base acres combined across all crops the exclusion however does not apply to farms owned by socially disadvantaged 36 or limitedresource farmers and ranchers moreover congress intended for farmers to be able to aggregate land across multiple farms they operate before usda enforces the restriction37 the justification for the prohibition on small payments andor small farms is desire by some to stop payments to nonfarmers some landowners with small holdings receive payments but are not fulltime farmers they receive most of their income from nonfarm jobs and are sometimes called hobby farmers supporters of the 10acre rest riction do not want to include these farmers as program beneficiaries however the restriction does not address payments to the nonfarm landowners of larger farms who may still qualify for payments moreover implementing the new provision may reduce the number of recipients and the constituency of the farm programs and increase the size of the average payment which may have negative connotations policy differences have arisen over congressional intent to allow farmers to combine parcels of land they farm before the 10acre rule is enforced and the administrations more restrictive interpretation of statute the statute says producer on farm may not receive payments if the sum of the base acres of the farm is 10 acres or less but this provision shall not apply to farm owned by socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher or limited resource farmer or rancher pl 110246 sec 1101d strictly speaking the statute does not mention aggregating or combining acreage usda chose to apply direct interpretation of statute and does not give any weight to the conference report language that states the managers intend for the department to allow for aggregation of farms for purposes of determining the suspension of payments on farms with 10 base acres or less the managers expect for the department to review farms in this category on an annual basis rather than 36 socially disadvantaged farmers are defined for other farm programs as women african americans american indians alaskan natives hispanics asian americans and pacific islanders 37 the 2008 farm bill also requires usda to track the use of land affected by the 10acre requirement and issue report on the impact on specialty crop producers some believe that more acres may go into production of fruits and vegetables if small acreages are disqualified from direct payments existing fruit and vegetable growers are wary of more

payments to these farms for the life of the farm bill hrept 110627 for hr 2419 pp 674675 the administrations regulation to implement this provision for the 2008 crop year has caused some farmers or landowners to be denied participation in the commodity programs usda adopted strict interpretation of the statute and its regulations prohibited reconstitutions of farms under 10 acres unless the tracts were under the same ownership to be assured that producers on farms with base acres of 10 acres or less are prohibited from receiving payments fsa will not approve requests for farm combination reconstitutions of farms having base acres of 10 acres or less however as an exception to the above rule farm with total of 10 base acres or less may combine with another farm if one of the farms undergoes change in land ownership and the ownership of the two farms is identical 38 constituents have complained to congress and members have written to usda to say that usda is not following congressional intent as explained in report language because of this implementation issue both the house and senate passed bill hr 6849 to suspend enforcement of the 10acre requirement for the 2008 crop year longerterm fix is being left to the 111 th congress hr 6849 passed both the senate and the house by unanimous consent on september 29 2008 the bill now awaits the presidents signature specifically the bill suspends the 10acre requirement for the 2008 crop year farms with less than 10 acres would be able to receive payments as they have in prior years extends the enrollment period for the commodity program for the 2008 crop year beyond the original deadline of september 30 2008 extending the signup period for farms under 10 acres allows those who were denied participation during the summer of 2008 by usda regulations to still enroll and receive benefits the extension will go until the later of november 14 2008 or 45 days after enactment offsets the 9 million cost to suspend the provision for one year by reducing mandatory funds provided in the 2008 farm bill for information technology upgrades that support the crop insurance program originally 15 million per year was to be available for fy2008fy2011 60 million in total hr 6849 reduces the amount for fy2011 by 6 million making changes to the new permanent disaster program regarding 1 treating minor acreages and grazing land and 2 establishing minimum loss threshold that requires physical loss of at least 10 percent of one crop on the farm to qualify for payments the later change prevents payments due solely to price reductions the changes are scored to save 3 million given the higher offsets required to make more permanent correction to the 10acre provision possibly as much as 90 million over 10 years as described in the next section both chambers 38 federal register vol 73 126 june 30 2008 p 36840 at httpwwwfsausdagovinternet fsa_federal_noticesdcppdf

19 2008 similar bill s 3538 was introduced in the senate on september 23 2008 these versions were nearly identical in suspending the 10acre provision for two years but differed primarily in their source of budgetary offsets the house offset the 20 million cost of the twoyear suspension entirely with reductions to the in formation technology account for crop insurance 39 the senate bill did not have any offsets the version of hr 6849 as introduced would have put congressional intent for aggregating farms into the statute it would have added third exception to the 10acre requirement in addition to exceptions for socially disadvantaged and limitedresource farmers farms that add up to more than 10 acres when combined with other farms operated by the same person when the 2008 farm bill was enacted cbo estimated that the 10acre restriction would save about 88 million over 10 years fy2008fy2017 this estimate was based on statutory language and not on report language because the approach in hr 6849 as introduced would greatly reduce the number of farms excluded by the 10acre requirement the savings would be much lessmost likely nearly eliminating the 88 million 10year savings

the effect of the 10acre minimum requirement depends greatly on the definition of farm in usda regulation and implementation practices farmers can reconstitute their farms into larger or smaller units based on various actions congress refers to aggregation in the report language for the 10acre provision how does the use of these terms affect the provision the definition of farm to administer the commodity programs is different from other statistical or perceived definitions of farms this may im pact the policy differences between congressional intent and usdas interpretation of statute under farm service agency fsa regulations farm is one or more tracts of land considered to be separate operation land in farm does not need to be contiguous however tracta smaller unitis parcel of contiguous land under the same ownership 40 when multiple tracts are treated as one farm the tracts must have the same operator and owner except that tracts with different owners may be combined into one farm if all owners agree41 thus one producer may be operating several farms if heshe is renting land from several landlords or has purchased land in several tracts it may be more common to combine farms that are under cash rental arrangements where the operator receives all of the government payments and less common to combine farms that are under share rental 39 cbo cost estimate of hr 6849 as

the landlord has management role and receives some of the government payment reconstitution is the process of combining or dividing tracts or farms for purposes of the commodity programs in general fsa requires reconstitution when farmer buys land and operates it in this way the number if farms per operator is minimized when farmer adds land to an operation by rental arrangements fsa may allowbut does not necessarily encouragevoluntary reconstitutions 42 aggregation is term not used by usda aggregation seems only to have been used by congress in the report language for the 2008 farm bill the intent of congress seems to be that aggregation is either synonym for reconstitution or another means of combining acreage without triggering formal reconstitution that is it basically means the same thing as reconstitution but by not using the term reconstitute perhaps congress is allowing usda to create another means of combining farms for the single purpose of the 10acre requirement

base acres affected by the provision are expected to be comparatively small the cbo budget estimate for this provision based on the statute only shows savings up to 9 million per year for about 37 million in savings over five years and 88 million over 10 years this is less than 01 of the expected outlays for the commodity title 43 the following data illustrate differences in the number of farms based on two definitions the number of farms as defined by fsa for the 2002 farm bill included 19 million farms with base acres some of these farms must have been combined into single operations because the same database revealed only 13 million producers on those farms 44 given the similarity of the 2002 and 2008 farm bills regarding base acreage these numbers are unlikely to change very much under the more commonly known definition of farm used for the agriculture census 1000 of agricultural sales there are 21 million farms not all of these farms have base acres or receive government payments only 531000 farms in the census statistic received nonconservation farm payments in 2002 the 19 million farms with base acres in fsas definition is much greater than the 531000 farms in the census receiving government payments this indicates aggregation of farms within fsas database into actual operating farms of the 21 million census farms 78000 had harvested crop land of fewer than 10 acres45 some of these farms may be unsubsidized farms growing fruits and 42 cfr 1412403 fsa handbook farm reconstitutions 2cm paragraph 89 updated 81408 at httpwwwfsausd agovinternetfsa_file2cmpdf 43 in addition using the cbo estimate of 9 million savings in fy2009 and conservative assumption that only direct payments are affected rough calculation using an average payment of 20acre would imply

as described previously under the direct payment program farmers may plant crops other than the program crop and still receive direct paymentsthis is known as planting flexibility they are prohibited however from planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on program crop base acres limited exceptions have allowed growers with history of planting fruits and vegetables to continue to do so but direct and countercyclical payments were reduced acreforacre of fruits and vegetables the restriction on planting fruits and vegetables is seemingly reasonable response to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables who do not want competition from subsidized growers of program crops the planting restriction on fruits and vegetables however jeopardizes the ability of the united states to classify direct payments as nondistorting decoupled or green box for wto accounting the wto has determined that the restrictions are inconsistent with the rules of minimally distorting subsidy 46 another complication with the restriction on planting fruits and vegetables surfaced when soybeans became eligible for direct payments in the 2002 farm bill this created shortage of acres in some parts of the midwest for growing fruits and vegetables for processing canning and freezing some landlords stopped allowing fruits and vegetables to be grown in rotation in place of soybeans many growers and processors asked fo r flexibility to grow fruits and vegetables for processing on base acres without other penalties in return for giving up payments on those acres while growing fruits and vegetables such proposals became known as farm flex the 2008 farm bill creates pilot planting flexibility program for fruits and vegetables for processing while continuing the overall restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on base acreage the pilot program begins in 2009 and allows farmers in seven midwestern states to plant base acres in cucumbers green peas lima beans pumpkins snap beans sweet corn and tomatoes grown for processing their base acres are temporarily reduced for the year resulting in lower direct and countercyclical payments but restored for the next crop year the states include minnesota 34000 acres wisconsin 9000 acres michigan 9000 acres illinois 9000 acres indiana 9000 acres ohio 4000 acres and iowa 1000 acres the 2008 farm bill continues the exceptions of prior law that allowed farms with history of growing fruits and vegetables to plant them but with oneyear reduction in direct and counter cyclical payment acres the pilot program is simila r in that it reduces payments acres but in the aggregate is in addition to the acreage allowed under the continuation of the exceptions the additional planting flexibility of the pilot program addresses the subset of concerns in the midwest but it does not address concerns over wto compliance restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables remain on acreage outside the pilot program and for all fresh

farm bill adopts senate provision that eliminates base acres on land that has been subdivided into multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses prior farm bills have eliminated base acres only for land developed for nonagricultural commercial or industrial use this provision addresses the issue raised in media stories about the farm programs making payments to nonfarmers or for land that is not in production washington post article in 2006 identified the practice of nonfarm homeowners receiving farm commodity payments on what had become known as cowboy starter kits which were residential developments in texas on land with rice base acres developments of houses had been built on several acres each and the few acres that were not directly in the yard of the house retained their rice base acreage and still qualified for direct payments even though there was intention by the homeowners to farm or maintain the land for agriculture 47

includes the program crop commodities dairy and sugar the 5 and 10year savings that are scored for all of title i are the net result of various provisions that both score savings or cost more than

shifts about 11 billion of payments into later fiscal year which achieves savings in the budget window but does not reduce the total amount eventually paid to farmers other savings are scored by

some countercyclical payments with acre payments eliminating advance countercyclical payments beginning in crop year 2011 and by tightening payment limits table 3 some of these savings are offset with
