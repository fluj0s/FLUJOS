top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 draft spin 15 vpn story vpn has two thrusts one has high mission impacts and the other has high performance and functionality impacts for program b mission impact start generating sigint from vpns at smk smk is vpn rich environment with targets of high value mission impact is high consumers of the sigint reporting based on sources from smk are at high levels of government nsa leadership has tasked ces to deploy decryption capabilities to smk security concerns have been addressed spfs have been signed to deploy tssi equities to the ssi site vpn transformation tests have passed and capabilities ready for deployment to the t16 development server at smk to achieve successful deployment to smk on the t16s first and lpts the following are high level steps task owner date load spin 13 on t16 dev first and then t16 live system turmoil march configure blade 14 for piq services spin 13 ces march configure amfislandhideaway for piq blade and vao messaging traffic amf march add ip tasking to keycard for vpns of interest ces march evaluate decrypted data in xkeyscore for strong selectors ces marchapril update keycard with strong selectors ces marchapril verify decrypted data which hits on strong selector is forwarded from turmoil to pressurewave ces april verify analysts can retrieve the data from pressurewave for reporting ces april

upgrade and site store deployment at smk will impact the vpn decryption deployment march 1631 is the schedule for the upgrade and site store deployment vpn decryption deployment may slip due to availability risk reduction activity for program b program b capabilities document has provided key performance paramerters kpps for vpn in order to achieve the kpp identified for sep 30 2009 risk reduction activity has been initiated this activity will gather performance benchmarks early in spin 15 on the current architecture running on two 25g platforms the t16 heavy and the dell lpt information from the performance benchmarks will indicate the level of redesign if any needed to meet the kpps the following are the performance requirements in program b 1 ncc ca service requests
