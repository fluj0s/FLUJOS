useuropean union banana dispute charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the united states and the european union eu reached an agreement in april 2001 that resolved longstanding dispute over the eus rules for importing bananas objections to the agreement by other banana exporting countries such as ecuador and caribbean banana exporters have been withdrawn the useu banana agreement provides for transition to tariffonly system of imports in 2006 in the meantime the eu will establish quotas and licensing system based on historical trade shares that should increase the prospects for latin american banana imports in the eu market especially bananas marketed by us firms like chiquita brands international in november 2001 the wto granted waivers of wto rules allowing the eu to continue preferen tial treatment for banana exports of developing countries that are former eu member country colonies these waivers paved the way for full implementation of the agreement by january 2002 trade policy officials on both sides of the atlantic expressed hopes that the banana agreement would contribute to climate for resolving other thorny trade disputes and for bilateral and multilateral cooperation members and committees of the 107th congress will be monitoring implementation of the agreement and its effects on useu trade relations background and history the banana regime and wto rulings in 1993 the eu implemented single euwide regime to regulate banana imports the regime gave preferential entry to bananas from the overseas territories and former colonies of eu member countries and restricted entry from other countries includin g several in latin america where us companies predominate and ecuador the banana regime was part of the eus move toward single unified market which was inaugurate d in 1992 before the single market individual eu member countries imported bananas under an assortment of national practices for example france imported bananas from its overseas departments of guadeloupe and martinique and from former colonies cote divoire and cameroon spain was supplied exclusively by domestic production in the canary islands other eu countries imposed 20 tariff while germany allowed tarifffree entry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20130crs2 1 the retaliation list can be found at

implications of tariff only system brussels com2000 october 4 2000the eu regime which entered into force on july 1 1993 established multilayered system of quotas for banana imports imports from eu or overseas territories producers were unrestricted imports from traditional suppliers in the african caribbean and pacific acp countries former colonies of eu countries were tarifffree up to 857000 tons imports from nontraditional acp suppliers were assessed tariff of 150 ad valorem imports from third countries including latin american countries were assigned tariff rate quota trq of 22 million tons with inquota tariffs of about 20 ad valorem for countries that had signed framework agreement with the eu colombia costa rica nicaragua and venezuela and 30 ad valorem for nonframework countries above the quotas there was 250 ad valorem tariff in addition to the quotas and tariffs under the regime the eu issued licenses which allocated the quotas among banana distributors import licenses were distributed to traditional importers from third countries approximately twothirds of the trq and to european and acp importers and new importers in the market since 1992 about onethird of the trq the banana import regime was challenged in world trade organization wto dispute settlement by the united states ecuador guatemala honduras and mexico the wto found the import regime illegal in 1997 on grounds that its system of allocating licenses discriminated against growers and marketing companies in the complaining countries revised import regime was established on january 1 1999 the revised system consisted of 2553 million metric ton trq with an additional quantity 850000 mmt assigned to acp countries the new system was also ruled illegal by wto dispute settlement panel because it set aside quantity of banana imports reserved exclusively for acp imports and because the licensing system continued to discriminate against suppliers of latin american bananas subsequently wto arbitration panel ruled that compensation of about 192 million was due the united states for lost banana sales the eu foregoing its right to appeal indicated that it would abide by the decision and bring its banana import regime into compliance with wto rules the united states imposed tariffs of 100 on 192 million worth of eu imports into the united states none of which were agricultural products1 the united states and eu continued discussions over what would constitute wtocompatible banana import regime during much of 2000 in october 2000 the eu floated new proposal for bringing its banana import regime into compliance with wto rules2 the proposal called for three quotas for bananas comparable to the trqs proposed earlier850 thousand tons for acp countries 22 million tons for latin american bananas and an additional 353000 tons for latin american bananas the inquota duty on latin american bananas would be 75 euro around 66 per ton while acp bananas would enjoy 300 euro 255 per ton tariff preference effectively acp bananas would enter the eu duty free the quotas would be administered on firstcome firstserved fcfs basis that would establish pre allocation procedure companies would declare their intention to import specifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20130crs3 3 office of the us trade represen tative united states position on european commission proposal for first come first served licensing system for importation of bananas october 5 2000quantity of bananas when vessels were sailing distance from europe to avoid discrimination against countries that are farther away the preallocation procedure would be managed on fortnightly or weekly basis this transitional trq system would be changed to tariff only system in 6 years the united states also rejected the october 2000 proposal3 the basis of the us opposition was that maintain ing separate quota for acp bananas virtually guarantees that those countries would be able to export their entire production while latin american countries would be severely restricted the proposal according to the office of the us trade representative ustr also would have continued the discrimination between companies that supply the eu with latin american bananas and companies primarily european that supply the eu with acp bananas the us statement noted also the opposition of nearly all latin american countries with the exception of ecuador to the fcfs system and the opposition of caribbean countries together with the lack of support from the african countries for the eu proposal rather than fcfs the united states insisted on the allocation of banana import licenses based on an historical reference period which would maintain or enhance market share for us companies despite lack of agreement the united states did not reenter wto dispute settlement on the banana dispute but continued discussions with the eu recent developments the useu agreement in april 2001 the united states and the eu reached an agreeme nt on their long standing dispute over banana imports under the agreement the eu will establish tariff only regime for imports of bananas by january 1 2006 as of july 1 2001 the eu will implement an import regime for bananas on the basis of historical licensing although quota with tariff preferences would be maintained for developing country exporters of bananas to the eu licenses mainly would be allocated to traditional exporters ie those who held licenses during the reference period 19941996 with smaller proportion of licenses allocated to newcomers ie those not operating in the historical reference period once the new regime is in place the united states will terminate its imposition of increased duties on 192 million of imports from the eu these duties were suspended as of july 1 2001 and will be terminated on january 1 2002 the agreement calls for the establishment of bound tariffrate quota quota of 22 million metric tons and an additional quota of 350000 mts quota b which will be managed as one with tariff of e75 per ton about 66 trq designated as quota c will be set at 850000 mts although within each trq licenses may be used to import bananas from any source the and b quotas are essentially for latin american bananas while the c quota is for acp bananas within each trq licenses may be used to import bananas from any source however licenses to import bananas into trq c cannot be used to import bananas into trqs or b and vice versa import licenses for 83 of the and b quotas will be distributed to traditional operators based on their 19941996

bananas of acp origin compatibility of the agreement with world trade organization wto rules was an issue ecuador or other banana exporting countries in central and south america or the caribbean could have requested review of compliance of the new regime with wto requirements or these same countries could have challenged the new regime under wto dispute settlement as discriminatory because the new regime does not treat all wto members equally the wto has ruled in the past against discriminatory licensing systems for bananas but has not spelled out what would be nondiscriminatory licensing system waivers of articles i 4 and xiii5 which the eu sought could defuse arguments about the wto compatibility of the new regime as part of the agreement the united states pledged to support the eus bid for waiver of article 1 of the gatt 1994 that the eu had requested for the preferential access it accords goods originating in former eu member country colonies the acp countries under the acpeu partnership agreement which governs trade relations between the eu and former colonies the united states agreed also to promote the acceptance in the wto of the eus request for waiver of article xiii of the gatt 1994 needed for managing the quota extended to acp country banana exports the approval of both these waivers during the wtos fourth ministerial conference in doha qatar november 914 removed the final obstacles to full implementation of the banana agreement6 implications of the agreement useu trade relations the banana agreement removed significant dispute from the useu bilateral trade agenda the agreement contributes some say to more favorable climate for resolving other contentious trade disputes and for cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally in the wto others do not think however that it gets at fundamental differences that complicate for example the useu meat hormone dispute or disagreement on the agenda of new round of multilateral trade negotiations7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20130crs5 7 continued negotiations see agriculture in wto negotiations crs report rs20185 december 7 2001banana marketing companies according to analysts the us banana marketing companies chiquita brands international and the dole food company will be the primary beneficiaries of the banana agreement estimates are that these two will share about 44 of the licenses issued under the agreement that share would be virtually guaranteed until 2006 when the transition to tariffonly regime would occur chiquita and dole benefit from the definition of primary operators ie those that either grew or bought green bananas to sell them in europe during the 199496 reference period according to analysts twothirds of the 44 would go to chiquita and the remaining third to dole although dole is expected to experience net loss of licenses under the new regime the ustr calculates that it and other us firms will obtain substantial increase in the volume of bananas they are able to import into the eu market dole nevertheless expressed its opposition to the agreement us businesses and consumers overlooked to some extent are the effects of the agreement on us businesses that import products on the retaliation list and on consumers of those products lifting sanctions means that the 100 duties will be eliminated as of july 1 2001 thus importers and consumers of products like handbags bed linens or folding cartons and boxes will be economically better off legislation to exempt small businesses from inclusion in such retaliation was introduced in the 106th congress ecuador and other latin american exporters the 100000 addition to the b quota is intended to benefit ecuador and other latin american exporters ecuador however initially announced its opposition to the useu agreement but at the same time began negotiations with the eu according to sources on ways to get additional market share through the newcomer category rules for administering the newcomer category appear to give ecuador substantial share especially of organic bananas of that category ecuador also withdrew its request for consultation with the eu which could have led to compliance review or to formation of panel to hear arguments in formal dispute while consultation is the first step in wto dispute settlement consultation under article 215 of the dispute settlement understanding to determine compliance with wto panel decision according to some legal analysts does not necessarily lead to formal dispute settlement developing country exporters among the major beneficiaries of the eus 1993 banana import regime have been the caribbean countries especially those of the windward islands in the eastern caribbean while the windward islands account for only 3 of world banana trade they supply 20 of eu imports they and other acp producers fear that they would be driven out of business if preferences were eliminated since it would force them to compete with more efficient suppliers ecuador the worlds largest producer and exporter of bananas for example produces bananas at cost of about 162 per metric ton while acp costs can be as high as 515 per ton on balance the acp countries appear to benefit from the agreement although the agreement reduces the size of the quota for bananas initially provided to acp countries they nevertheless will benefit from an assured market of 750000 tons in addition thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20130crs6 8 see trade retaliation the carousel approach by lenore sek rs20715 october 27 2000 9 see the european unions ban on

producers need financial and technical assistance to diversify their agriculture away from highcost banana production instead of or in addition to preferences role of congress in the 107th congress members and committees that deal with trade issues will be monitoring implementation of the useu banana agreement partly in response to eu slowness in implementing wto banana rulings the 106th congress enacted legislation section 407 of the africa growth and opportunity act pl106200 that requires the president periodically to rotate or change the types of products targeted for trade retaliation8 this socalled carousel provision was aimed partly at maintaining pressure on the eu to come to speedy resolution of the banana dispute and also the meat hormone dispute9 by penalizing wider range of foreign industries and regions supporters of the carousel provision urged the ustr to rotate its retaliation lists for bananas and meat hormones the ustr on the other hand appeared reluctant to invoke the carousel provision because of its potential to aggravate another euus dispute over the tax treatment of foreign sales corporations fsc10 with banana agreement some of the pressure to use the carousel provision has been mitigated legislation was also introduced in the 106th congress to prevent the united states from retaliating altogether against the eu for its banana preference system hr 1361 the support of the acp countries for the agreement and especially its continuation of preferential treatment for acp bananas makes the introduction of similar legislation in the 107th congress less likely similarly there may be less pressure in the wake of the agreement on banana imports for legislation like hr 4478 introduced in the 106th congress which would have exempted small businesses from increased tariffs imposed against products of the eu in response to the banana import regime
