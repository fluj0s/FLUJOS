has raised concerns especially as the market for ethanol has the potential for dramatic expansion under pl 10958 and pl 110140 in the united states fuel ethanol is rgely domestically produced valueadded product of agricultural commodities mainly co rn it is used as gasoline additive and as an alternative to gasoline to promote its use ethanolblended gasoline is granted significant tax incentive however this incentive does not recognize point of origin and there is duty on most imported fuel etha nol to offset the ex emption but limited amount of ethanol may be im ported under the caribbean basin initiative cbi dutyfree even if most of the steps in the production process were completed in other countries this dutyfree import of ethanol has raised concerns especially as us

background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci 2 it should be noted that between 1999 and 2003 saudi arabia was the largest xporter to the united states of ethanol however this ethanol is synthetic produced from fossil fuels and does not qualify for the tax incentives for ethanolble nded fuel therefore ethanol from saudi arabia is used as an industrial feedstock and is subject to different tariff treat ment than fuel ethanol 3 for more information on the mtbe phaseout see crs report rl31361 boutique fuels and reformulated gasoline rmonization of fuel standards by brent d yacobuccicosta rica and salvador have played ro in the development of the uscentral america free trade agreement cafta fuel ethanol ethanol is an alcohol fuel produced fro m the fermentation of simple sugars1 most ethanol in the united states is produced from co rn in other countries sugarcane or other plants are common feedstocks in the united states the increased demand for corn leads to higher revenues for us corn farmers ethanol is usually blended in gasoline mixture called gasohol to increase octa ne improve combustion and extend gasoline stocks currently about 3 to 5 of to tal us gasoline demand is actually met by ethanol and roughly half of us gasoline contains some ethanol us ethanol is generally produced and cons umed in the midwest close to where the corn feedstock is produced the main st eps to ethanol production are as follows the feedstock eg corn is processe d to separate fermentable sugars yeast is added to ferment the sugars the resulting alcohol is distilled finally the distilled alcohol is dehy drated to remove any remaining water this final step dehydration is at the h eart of the issue over ethanol imports from the cbi as discussed below ethanol imports according to the united states internati onal trade commission the majority of all fuel ethanol imports to the united states came through cbi countries between 1999 and 2003 see figure 1 2 in 2004 imports from brazil to the united states grew dramatically but in 2005 cbi imports again represented more than half of all us ethanol imports with an increase in ethanol demand in 2006 due to voluntary elimination of mtbe competitor for ethanol in gasoline blending imports grew dramatically roughly quadrupling imports in any previous year3 most of this increase was in direct imports from brazil historically imports have played relatively small role in the us ethanol market total ethanol consumption in 2005 was approximately 39 billion gallons whereas imports totale d 135 million gallons or about 4 imports from the cbi totaled approxima tely 26 in 2006 total im ports represented roughly 13 of the 50 billion gallons consumed in 2006 ethanol from cbi countries

costs for ethanol in foreign countries are significantly lower than in the united states is most favorednation tariff of 25 and an added duty of 54 cents per gallon4 in many cases this tariff negates lower production costs in other countries for example by some estimates brazilian production co sts have been roughly 50 lower than in the united states5 key motivation for the establishment of the tariff was to offset tax incentive for ethanolblended gasoline gasohol6 this incentive is currently valued at 51 cents per gallon of pure ethanol used in blending unless imports enter the united states duty free the tariff effectively negates the incentive for those imports with us wholesale ethanol prices ranging from roughly 150 to 250 per gallon for most of the time between january 2006 to

wholesale prices between april 2006 and september 2006 with wholesale prices nearing 600 per gallon in some markets during the summer of 20068 this runup in prices significantly improved the profitability of importing ethanol regardless of the duty ethanol and the cbi as congress noted in the customs and trade act of 1990 the caribbean basin initiative cbi was established in 1983 to promote stable political and economic climate in the caribbean region9 as part of the initiative dutyfree status is granted to large array of products from beneficiary c ountries including fuel ethanol under certain conditions if produced from at least 50 cal feedstocks eg ethanol produced from sugarcane grown in the cbi beneficiary c ountries ethanol may be imported dutyfree10 if the local feedstock content is lower limitations apply on the quantity of dutyfree ethanol nevertheless up to 7 of the us market may be supplied dutyfree by cbi ethanol containing local feedstock11 in this case hydrous wet ethanol produced in other countries historically brazil or european countries can be shipped to dehydration plant in cbi country for reprocessing12 after the ethanol is dehydrated it is imported dutyfree into the united states currently imports of dehydrated ethanol under the cbi are far below the 7 cap pproximately 3 in 2006 for 2006 the cap was about 270 million gallons13 whereas about 170 million ga llons were imported under the cbi in that year14 dehydration plants are currently operating in jamaica costa rica salvador trinidad and tobago and the us virgin islands15 jamaica and costa rica were the two largest exporters of fuel ethanol to th united states from 1999 to 2003 in 2004 and 2006 direct imports from brazil exceeded impor ts from all other countries

administration and the pa rticipating countries specific allocations of the 7 duty free cap for cbi ethanol are set aside for costa rica and salvador these allocations effectively limit the amount of fuel that othe r cbi countries can import dutyfree costa ricas allocation is 31 million gallons per year while salvador was granted an initial allocation of approx imately 66 million gallons per year increasing by roughly 13 million gallons in each subsequent year however salvadors allocation may not exceed 10 of the total cbi allocation or 07 of the u s market the agreement was signed on may 28 2004 congress approved the agreemen t in 2005 and impleme nting legislation was signed by president bush on august 2 2005 pl 10953 as both countries exceeded their allocations in 2005 2006 and 2007 the ultimate effects of the allocations are unclear growing us ethanol market the us ethanol market has grown dram atically over the past several years between 1990 and 2007 us ethanol consumption increased from about 900 million gallons per year to 68 billion gallons per year much of this growth has resulted from clean air act requirements that gasoline in areas with the worst ozone pollution contain an oxygenate such as ethanol and the estab lishment of renewable fuel standard rfs in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the rfs required that gasoline sold in the united states contain renewable fuel such as ethanol the mandate required 40 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006 increasing to 75 billion gallons in 2012 the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 expanded the rfs to 90 billion gallons in 2008 increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022 in addition the expanded rfs specifically requires the use of an in creasing amount of advanced biofuels biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch including sugar cane ethanol while domestic producers anticipate greater demand for their product under the rfs they are also concerned that dutyfree ethanol imports through the cbi could dramatically increase to their detriment duty drawback in addition to the concerns over imports of dutyfree ethanol from cbi countries there is growing concern that large portion of ethanol otherwise subject to the duties is being imported dutyfree throug h manufacturing drawback19 if manufacturer imports an intermediate product then expor ts the finished product or similar producthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21930crs6 20 19 usc 1313p 21 peter rhode senate finance may take up drawback loophole as part of energy bill energywashington week april 18 2007that manufacturer may be eligib for refund drawback of up to 99 of the duties paid there are special provisi ons for the production of petroleum derivatives20 in the case of fuel ethanol the imported ethanol is used as blending component in gasoline and jet fuel considered like commodity is exported to qualify for the drawback21 some critics estimate that as much as 75 or more of the duties were eligible for the drawback in 2006 therefore critics question the effectiveness of the ethanol duties and the cbi exemption congressional action some members of congre ss have expressed concer n over dutyfree imports of dehydrated ethanol that originates in braz il or other countries therefore there is growing interest from some members of congress to eliminate the cbi exemption andor modify the manufacturing drawback for petroleum products although some stakeholders are concerned over increased ethanol imports and their effect on the us industry others believe that tariffs on imported ethanol should be eliminated entirely they argue that increased use of ethanol regardless of its origin would further displace gasoline consumption they also argu that inexpensive imported ethanol would help mitigate any fuel price increases from the renewable fuels standard conclusion with growing demand for ethanol there is increased interest in foreign imports because ethanol from cbi c ountries is granted duty free status there is the possibility that imports of dehydrated ethanol will grow because of this avenue provided in the law while cbi countries have not yet reached their quota for ethanol refined in other countries and dehydrated in the caribbean cb i imports have increased over the past few years and may exceed the quota in future years cbi imports have the potential to increase significantly over the next few years especially as the domestic market grows under the renewable fu els standard in addition the manufacturing drawback could provide another avenue for dutyfree ethanol imports directly from brazil and other countries lowcost ethanol imports could have an advantage over domestically produced ethanol which could affect the us etha nol industry and american corn growers however the us ethanol industry has grown si gnificantly in the past several years and will likely continue to grow regardless of the level of imports
