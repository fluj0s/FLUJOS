purposes include addressing specific concerns such as national defens health safety the environment and energy security advancing knowledge gene rally developing th scientific and engineering

facilities c onstruction this advance appropriation acc ounts for more than half of the net increase in rd funding in the presidents fy2009 budget request analysis of federal rd funding is co mplicated by several factors including the administrations omission of congressi onally directed spending from its current year budget request inconsistency among ag encies in the reporting of rd and the apparent miscategorization of some funding in the presid ents request as result of these and other factors the rd agen cy figures reported by omb and shown in table 1 may differ somewhat from

defense health program supports th delivery of health care to dod personnel and their families pr ogram funds are requested through the operations and maintena nce appropriation the prog rams rdte funds support congressionally directed resear ch in such areas as breast prostate and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions the chemi cal agents and munitions destruction program supports activities to destroy the us inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and cost s associated with storage funds for this program are requested through the army procurement appropriation the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund so contains additional rdte monies however the fund does not contain an rdte line item as do the two programs mentioned above the joint improvised ex plosive device defeat office which now administers the fund tracks but does not re port the amount of funding allocated to rdte typically congress has funded all of these

administration also made fy2009 gwot bridge request in march this additional request included 379 million in classified rdte by requesting bridge funding the administration hopes to have ready emergency funds at the beginning of the fiscal year in october rather than await passage of the entir defense appropriations since fy2001 funding for rdte in title iv has increased from 42 billion to 77 billion in fy2008 in constant fy2008 dollars the increase is roughly 58 historically rdte funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars dating back to 194819 congress has appropriated mo re for rdte than has been requested every year since fy1996 rdte funding can be broken out in couple of ways each of the military services request and receive their ow n rdte funding so too do various dod agencies eg the missile defense agen cy and the defense advanced research projects agency collectivel aggregated within the defensewide account rdte funding also can be characterized by budget activity ie the type of rdte supportedthose budget activities designat ed as 61 62 and 63 basic research applied research and adva nced development constitu what is called dods science and technology program st and represents the more researchoriented part of the rdte program budget activities 64 and 65 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components g the joint strike fighter or missile defense systems for which an operati onal need has been determined and an acquisition program established budget activity 67 supports system improvements in existing operational systems budget activity 66 provides management support including support for test and evaluation facilities st funding is of particul ar interest to congress since these funds support the development of new technolog ies and the underlying science assuring adequate support for st activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining us military superiority this was of particular concern at time when defense budgets and rdte funding we re falling at the end of the cold war as part of its 2001 quadrennial review dod established goal of stabilizing its base st funding ie title iv at 3 of dods overall funding congress has embraced this goal the fy2009 st funding request in title iv is 115 billion about 13 billion less than what congress appropriated for s t in title

eg the office of water many of the programs implemented by other offices within epa have research component but the research is not necessarily the primary focus of the program the operation and administration of the agencys laboratories and facilities necessitate significant expenditures for re nt utilities and security prior to fy2007 significant portion of the funding for these expenses had been requested and appropriated within epa s environmental programs and management epm appropriations account in fy2007 and fy2008 increasing portions of funding for these expenses were requested and ppropriated within the st account this change affects comparisons of the st appropriations over time funding for these latter expenses represents approximately 10 of the total st account in the fy2009 request and the fy2008 appropriations compared to less than 5 in the fy2007 appropriations49 some members of congress and an arra of stakeholders have continually raised concerns about the adequacy of fundi ng for scientific research at epa the adequacy of funding for epas scientific research activities has been part of broader question about the adequacy of ove rall federal funding for broad range of scientific research activities administered by multiple federal agencies some members of congress scien tists and environmental orga nizations have expressed concern about the downward trend in federa l resources for scientific research over time the debate continues to center around the question of whether the regulatory actions of federal agencies are based on sound science and
