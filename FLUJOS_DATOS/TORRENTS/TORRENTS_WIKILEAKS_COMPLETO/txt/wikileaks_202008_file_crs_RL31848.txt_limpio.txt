of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc background and issues for congress april 8 2003 andrew feickert analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress missile technology control regime mtcr and international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc background and issues for congress summary on november 25 2002 ninetytwo countries including the united states signed draft international code of conduct icoc intended to control the proliferation of ballistic missiles this code of conduct joins the 1987 missile technology control regime mtcr as the primary means by which the international community attempts to regulate missile proliferation both are arrangements not treaties requiring voluntary application of standards and measures by participating countries while the mtcr has been credited with number of successes over the years critics point out that it lacks treaty status and only addresses the supply side of the missile proliferation equation the icoc was developed primarily to focus on the demand aspect of proliferation but great deal of work may lie ahead for the drafters and signatories of the icoc in order to craft the code into useful nonproliferation tool the mtcr has been credited by many analysts with slowing or impeding missile proliferation and preventing many countries from advancing beyond scud based missile technology the icoc created by mtcr members is intended to employ confidence building measures cbms as means to promote transparency and hopefully decrease the demand for ballistic missiles among developing nations the existence of two multilateral missile nonproliferation arrangements leads to the possibility of potential synergies but also could result in conflicts that could reduce the overall effectiveness of the arrangements the bush administration cites both the mtcr and icoc in the 2002 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction while us commitment to the mtcr is acknowledged by the international community many countries feel there is less us commitment to the icoc the united states sees useful roles for both arrangements in dealing with missile proliferation but appears to place great deal more emphasis on the mtcr than the icoc both arrangements are administered through the interagency process with the us state department assuming lead agency responsibilities in both cases while laws related to the us involvement in the icoc currently exist there are number of key pieces of legislation dealing with the mtcr there are several proposals that might be put before congress which proponents believe could potentially improve the efficacy of both the mtcr and icoc and increase their usefulness as means of addressing the global issue of missile proliferation this report will be updated as significant events occur contents background 1 provisions of the arrangements

of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc background and issues for congress background this report provides information and analysis on the mtcr and the icoc which are components of the united states governments missile nonproliferation policy this report also provides historical background and focus on potential issues for congress regarding these two arrangements in addition information on the us administration of the mtcr and icoc as well as related us laws is included in this report provisions of the arrangements missile technology control regime1 the mtcr is not treaty or an international agreement but instead voluntary arrangement among likeminded countries wishing to slow the spread of missile proliferation the regime consists of guidelines and an associated annex and each member country honors their commitment to the regime by the application of their nations export control laws and regulations the mtcr guidelines call on each of the member countries to exercise restraint when considering transfers of equipment or technology that would provide or help recipient country build missile capable of delivering 500 kilogram kg 1100 pound warhead to range of 300 kilometers km 186 miles or more the 500 kg weight threshold was intended to limit transfers of missiles that could carry relatively crude nuclear warhead 1993 addition to the guidelines calls for particular restraint in the export of any missiles or related technology if the nation controlling the export judges that the missiles are intended to be used for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction wmd with the 1993 addition some missiles with warheads weighing less than 500 kg now fall under mtcr guidelines the mtcr annex divides equipment and technologies into two categories category i items include complete missile and rocket systems and complete subsystems category ii items consist of other components equipment material and technology that could be used in the development production or 1 guidelines and annexes at httpwwwstategovtactrty5073htm crs2 testing of missile according to the guidelines the export of category i items is subject to presumption of denial2 category i items include complete rocket systems including ballistic missile systems space launch vehicles slvs and sounding rockets unmanned aerial vehicles uavs such as cruise missiles and target and reconnaissance drones speciallydesigned production facilities for the aforementioned systems and certain complete subsystems such as rocket engines or stages re entry vehicles rvs guidance mechanisms thrustvector controls warhead safing devices and missile arming fuzing and firing devices category ii items include an extensive collection of parts components and subsystems such as propellants missile structural materials test equipment and flight instrumentation category ii items can be exported at the discretion of mtcr member governments for acceptable enduses on casebycase basis category ii items can also be exported with governmenttogovernment assurances that the items will not be used for proscribed purposes mtcr guidelines specifically state that the regime is not designed to impede national space programs or international cooperation in such programs as long as such programs could not contribute to delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction3 the mtcr has secretariat to administer the regime the publication and distribution of relevant working papers is carried out through point of contact in the french ministry of foreign affairs schematic views of mtcr annex items used in ballistic missiles and cruise missiles are contained in figures 1 and 2 respectively current listing of mtcr members is at table 1 international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation the icoc like the mtcr is not treaty but instead set of fundamental behavioral norms and framework for cooperation to address missile proliferation the draft code signed on november 25 2002 consists of approximately 3 pages of written text and provides fairly basic statement of the codes principles general measures and organizational aspects the icoc urges countries to exercise maximum possible restraint in the testing and deployment of wmdcapable ballistic 2 presumption of denial means that permission to export the item in question is assumed to be denied unless compelling case is made for export of the item 3 arms control and disarmament agency fact sheet on the missile technology control regime november 15 1996 crs3 missiles and also to reduce their holdings of these systems if possible the code also calls for vigilance in assisting countries with their space launch vehicle slv programs recognizing that such programs can serve as surrogate ballistic missile programs the icoc encourages cooperation between subscribing states that choose to eliminate their ballistic missile and or slv programs the code aspires to achieve its goals by means of confidence building measures cbms specifically designed to promote transparency in this regard the code calls upon subscribers to make annual declarations on their national ballistic missile policies including relevant information on systems and test and launch sites furthermore the icoc requests that subscribers provide annual information on the types and numbers of ballistic missiles launched during the preceding year space launch vehicles are also addressed in similar manner with the exception that the code asks that subscribers voluntarily invite international observers to their slv landbased launch and test sites finally under cbms the icoc encourages bilateral or regional transparency measures from an organizational perspective the draft code calls for regular meetings annual or as required to review define and further develop the code the development of mechanism to exchange notifications and other information and to resolve questions is also encouraged like the mtcr the icoc does not call for the formation of standing international body to administer the code because the hague the netherlands was the scene for much of the codes developmental work and also the location of its initial signing the icoc is also sometimes referred to as the hague code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation hcc current listing of icoc members is at table 2 and the draft icoc is at table 3 histories of the arrangements missile technology control regime the origins of mtcr can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the soviet union transferred several scudbs 280 km range to number of arab countries during its later stages the carter administration began to publically acknowledge the threat posed by the regional proliferation of nuclearcapable missiles and also began to realize that the problem extended far beyond the soviet unions provision of scudbs to arab states industrialized countries such as france italy west germany the united kingdom and the us were providing dual use technology to include components manufacturing technology and scientific and engineering expertise to number of potential proliferants4 the reagan administration took steps to address the problem in its november 1982 national security decision directive 70 nsdd70 which instructed us agencies to initiate appropriate measures to develop both domestic and international controls aimed at halting the spread of ballistic and cruise missiles5 between 1983 and 1987 the us 4 us policy on ballistic missile proliferation the mtcrs first decade 19871997 wyn q bowen the nonproliferation review winter 1994 p 66 5 ibid crs4 negotiated the mtcr with its g7 partners6 and on april 16 1987 member states announced the regimes formation one of the first challenges to the mtcr was the revelation in late 1987 that several western european mtcr members were supplying technology and scientific and engineering expertise to argentinas7 condor ii slv program8 during this period the soviet union also continued to supply missiles including scudb and ss21 missiles to arab countries which served to further heighten regional tensions between 1989 and 1993 number of other revelations about proliferation involving china pakistan israel south africa north korea iran syria and india led the first bush administration and congress to push for reforms to the mtcr designed to bring more countries into the mtcr as well as to enhance relevant export controls in january 1993 the regimes technical working group revised the guidelines and annex to include export controls for any systems capable of delivering any payload to range of 300 kms or any system of any range or payload intended to deliver wmds9 in the early 1990s the united states began to reform its export control system to better address the new strategic situation indicative of the need to reform was the commerce departments doc legal inability to restrict the export of dualuse items not included in the mtcr annex but which still had missile proliferation applications dr gary milhollin director of the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control testified to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs that over 40 us companies had obtained more than 100 export licenses to export sensitive dualuse nuclear and missile related technologies to iraq10 to resolve this and other export issues the first bush administration enacted the enhanced proliferation control initiative epci in december 1990 the epci required us companies to obtain licenses for any export destined for publicallylisted company ministry project or other entity engaged in missile or wmd proliferation activities11 the administration also assisted italy and germany in improving their export control systems after both countries were rebuked for exporting prohibited items to iraq and argentina 12 significant improvement was made to the regime in 1994 when the mtcr partners agreed to undercut policy on license denials 6 canada france germany italy japan and the united kingdom 7 formally acceded to the mtcr in 1993 8 bowen p 24 9 the mtcr and missile proliferation moving toward the next phase jingdong yuan canadian department of foreign affairs and international trade may 2000 p 7 10 us items found by inspectors in iraq or reported as licensed by the commerce department included electron beam welders for work on missiles highspeed computers compasses gyroscopes and accelerometers used in missile guidance systems and timedelay relays used to separate the stages of ballistic missiles 11 bowen p 27 12 ibid crs5 whereby if one partner denies the export of missile technology then the other partners must also deny the export of the item in question13 in 1990 the soviet union pledged adherence to the guidelines and russia re affirmed this commitment after the demise of the soviet union14 in 1992 the us gained chinas written pledge that it would observe the mtcrs guidelines largely attributed to the lifting of sanctions imposed on chinese firms accused of transferring m11 missile technology to pakistan15 in 1998 three new countries the czech republic poland and ukraine were approved for mtcr membership in march 2001 after five years of consultations with the united states south korea became the 33rd member of the mtcr with us support south korea was permitted to build missiles with range in excess of 300 kms for research purposes and were also permitted to develop rocket boosters of unlimited range for civilian purposes16 this unprecedented arrangement while viewed by some as necessary to counter north koreas missile threat and to enhance regional security has been criticized as double standard by many mtcr members and nonmembers alike in september 2002 mtcr members modified the definitions of cruise missilerange and payload to close perceived loophole in the mtcr the range definition was revised to reflect the missiles range maximizing range and not the shorter range at lower altitudes for stealth purposes this shorter range often third less than the range maximizing range can fall under the mtcrs 300 km range guidelines for export control the payload definition was revised to include onboard countermeasures which are common features of some advanced cruise missiles international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation the icocs origins date back to 1999 when number of mtcr members began to discuss methods to address the demand side of the missile proliferation equation draft code was circulated among mtcr members during the regimes october 2000 plenary meeting and the draft code was finished in september 2001 the european union eu took over the draft code in early 2002 and convened series of meetings designed to involve nonmtcr members in the code all member states with the exception of iraq were invited to join and on november 25 2002 ninety three countries including the united states signed the code of conduct notable nonsignatories included syria north korea iraq china pakistan india and israel libya country with ballistic missile program did sign the code at the hague meeting the netherlands was appointed the first chair of the code for one year and austria will initially serve as the administrative central contact for the code and will be responsible for collecting and disseminating information relevant 13 bans on missile technology the last fifteen minutes lora lumpe federation of america scientists june 2002 p 4 14 the russian federation was subsequently admitted to the mtcr in 1995 15 bowen p 29 16 south korea us agree on missile guidelines mtcr membership alex wagner arms control today march 2001 crs6 to proposed confidence building measures and receiving petitions for new membership spring 2003 meeting for icoc members was anticipated at the close of novembers proceedings us state department official speculated that the likely next step would be to develop the details for the codes implementation which would initially focus on the requirements for prelaunch notification for ballistic missile and slv launches and test flights17 number of issues that were introduced in november 2002 will likely be on the upcoming meetings agenda selection of chairman the creation of financial arrangements establishing point of contact and information exchange procedures as well as scheduling date for the next annual meeting are possible topics18 one issue that will likely dominate initial deliberations is that of what institutional form the icoc will take there are basically three options available to members uncontrolled organization an independent organization like the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw or central point of contact as is the case with the mtcr run out of participating members foreign ministry19 several countries including germany and ireland are strongly in favor of bringing the code under auspices but it remains to be seen if the icocs 93 members will choose this or some other option issues for congress mtcrs and icocs role in us national security many experts believe that the united states confronts not only very perilous but also an extremely complex security environment characterized by global terrorism and the proliferation of wmds potential issues exist concerning the role of both the mtcr and icoc in the overall national security scheme and the appropriate us level of support and involvement for both arrangements relation to the national security strategy the mtcr and icoc are elements of the bush administrations 2002 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction specifically president bush is committed to strengthening the missile technology control regime mtcr including support for universal adherence to the international code of conduct against ballistic missile 17 code of conduct aims to stop ballistic missile proliferation paul kerr arms control today januaryfebruary 2003 18 missile code of conduct launches in the hague mike nartker global security newswire november 26 2002 19 during the november 2002 session austria proposed that the codes central point of contact be in vienna some analysts believe that this proposal will be accepted because there were other volunteers and also because vienna would be attractive for cost reasons due to the uns presence in vienna major organizations in vienna include the international atomic energy agency iea the wassenaar arrangement and the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt organization crs7 proliferation20 this proclamation renews us support for the mtcr and implies an active and continued us role in strengthening the regime and support for adherence to the icoc the proclamation does not however call for strengthening the icoc or the eventual creation of missile nonproliferation treaty this would seem to indicate that the administration does not intend to play leading or active role in further developing the icoc if this is indeed the intent of the administration then the mtcr emerges as the preferred means for promoting missile nonproliferation with the icoc playing lesser or supporting role us support for the icoc while us support for the mtcr has been relatively unquestioned over the course of its 16 year history the same can not be said for the icoc much of the developmental work on the code was done by the eu and us undersecretary of state john boltons presence at the codes signing ceremony at the hague surprised many experts who perceived that the bush administration did not consider the code to be of major significance21 us participation in the icocs negotiations has been inconsistent during the codes february 2002 round of negotiations the united states did not provide any input during the proceedings22many experts have also characterized secretary boltons remarks at the hague as less than supportive secretary bolton called the code an important addition to the wide range of tools available to countries to impede and rollback the proliferation threat23 also included in this range of tools were the mtcr and the us missile defense program which is consistent with the current us national security strategy for combating wmd proliferation the reference to the controversial us missile defense program may have contributed to the less than supportive perception held by some countries the mtcr and icoc in us policy discussions with various us state department officials about the mtcr and icoc provides additional insight on the role that each plays in us policy in order for country to become an mtcr member it must be approved for membership by all current members the us criteria for membership is fairly extensive be significant supplier of missile technology be member in good standing of international nonproliferation norms such as the chemical weapons convention and biological weapons convention demonstrate unilateral adherence to the mtcr guidelines and annex demonstrate effective enforcement of legallybased export controls consistent with mtcr standards 20 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction us government december 2002 p 4 21 nartker p 1 22 international responsecountries agree to ballistic missile code of conduct global security newswire february 1 2002 23 low key launch of hague code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation ian davis british american security information council december 3 2002 p 10 crs8 possess proven track record on export control enforcement and forgo mtcr category 1 offensive military missiles24 given these criteria not every country that applies for mtcr membership qualifies under us standards and there may also be instances when country that meets these standards might not be desirable member even though mtcr membership does not guarantee access to missile technologies of other members countries could potentially get access to missile equipment and technology by virtue of their association with other mtcr members in both of these circumstances the us views icoc membership as viable alternative to mtcr membership for those countries that cannot meet us entrance criteria or for those countries who meet the criteria but might use mtcr membership as means of obtaining equipment and technology for ballistic missile development the us will likely be an active participant in future icoc deliberations if only to protect national security interests the department of defense dod takes an active role in supporting the us state department on icoc and mtcr issues proposed icoc cbms and transparency measures could have implications for us military missile programs and ultimately national security these proposals are reviewed by dod for security and policy implications and recommendations are then made to the state department on how to address these concerns25 the intelligence community views the icoc and mtcr as both means to learn more about countrys missile and slv programs and vehicle by which signatory states can gain similar insights to us missile and slv programs26 adequacy of the mtcr and icoc given the developments in many regional and national missile programs some critics have suggested that the mtcr has done little to stop missile proliferation since its inception in 1987 the icoc has been characterized by some observers as weak and ineffective offering little in terms of membership incentives for proliferating countries such as china iran india pakistan and north korea one of the central questions posed is the degree to which these arrangements have controlled missile proliferation in the past and their potential to do so in the future slowing proliferation many analysts credit the mtcr with dramatically slowing missile proliferation by making missile development both an economically and politically costly venture for many developing countries bent on acquiring missiles and their associated production technology while some analysts claim this is generalization that is not supported by comparative cost data there appears to be degree of validity to this position in an unregulated market unhindered by 24 introduction to the missile technology control regime unclassified briefing given by the us state department bureau of nonproliferation at the central intelligence agencys missile technology and proliferation issues course february 3 2003 25 discussions with officials during the cias missile technology and proliferation issues course february 3 7 2003 26 ibid crs9 export controls and sanctions competition from missile technology suppliers could possibly lead to not only lower costs but also multiple vendors for the same or similar system or component this could enable proliferators to get more for their money which could lead to shorter development to deployment timelines and larger missile inventories mark smith from the mountbatten centre for international studies suggests that the mtcr is responsible for keeping at least for the time being icbms in the hands of the permanent 5 p5 nuclear weapons states us uk france russia and china and forcing most other countries to rely on second world war v2 technology the basis of the scud missile for their missile programs27 aaron karp in his new politics of missile proliferation suggests that only the countries of brazil israel and india were able to progress beyond the scud barrier because their missile programs predated the mtcr and also benefitted from extensive western assistance for number of years before assistance was terminated28 in more general sense some analysts believe that the mtcr provides both form and structure to missile nonproliferation by29 assisting states in identifying issues of common concern facilitating information sharing drawing up lists of key components and technologies to be placed under control coordinating national policies delaying certain proliferation projects and making illicit acquisition projects more expensive and buying time for more effective strategies to be formulated the mtcr is also credited by some experts with curbing missile proliferation in specific instances such as30 argentina it abandoned the condor ii project in 1990 to large degree because of the embargo placed on technology transfers by the mtcr member states supported with diplomatic pressure from the us brazil the mtcr embargo on brazils missile and space launch vehicle program severely restricted that countrys access to critical technologies needed to complete their space launch vehicle and further develop their mbee and ssseries of short range ballistic missiles israel the suspension of israeli assistance to south africas missile program and 27 efficiency and inefficiency of the mtcr in preventing ballistic missile proliferation mark smith mountbatten centre for international studies 2001 28 the new politics of missile proliferation aaron karp arms control today 26 october 1996 p 11 29 jingdong yuan p 8 30 bowen p 30 crs10 the cessation of the export of complete ballistic missile systems by both russia and china even though both countries have reportedly provided missile technology and assistance to number of countries some analysts credit the mtcrs export denials with slowing progress in number of other missile programs because of the mtcrs role in terminating the argentinian missile program egypt was denied the acquisition of 200 condor ii missiles promised them by the argentinian government31 the mtcr was also credited in delaying indias program by several years and also in delaying chinese sales of m9 and m11 missiles to pakistan32 missile apartheid another criticism of the mtcr is that it is discriminatory in nature some critics have gone so far as to label the mtcr as missile apartheid33 many countries view the mtcr as cartel formed by developed nations designed to monopolize lucrative missile and space launch technology34 this view is further articulated in pakistans 1997 paper to the where they state the mtcr is not negotiated multilateral treaty it is cartel formed by some industrialized countries for the purpose of placing controls on the transfer of technology which could contribute to the manufacture of ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons delivery systems there is commitment on the part of the originators of the mtcr to engage in good faith efforts to eliminate ballistic missiles globally it is therefore essentially an arrangement for promoting their own security interests only35 this inequity between missile haves and have nots has long been contentious issue amongst current mtcr members and prospective members according to senior us state department official unlike the chemical weapons convention cwc for example where all states parties undertake never under any circumstances to develop produce otherwise acquire stockpile or retain chemical weapons or transfer directly or indirectly chemical weapons to anyone selected mtcr members with missiles that exceed the regimes guidelines are permitted to keep them while most other countries are required to abandon them to gain entry to the mtcr another example of this inequity was south koreas admission to the mtcr with us support south korea was permitted to continue development of missiles and space launch vehicles with ranges greater than 300 km and with payloads in excess of 500 kg due to their unique security requirements regarding north korea this special dispensation could easily serve as precedent for other 31 ibid p 25 32 chronology of the missile technology control regime deborah ozga the nonproliferation review winter 1994 p 69 33 multilateral approach to ballistic missiles david grahame british american security information council april 2 2002 p 2 34 ibid 35 missile technology control regime its destabilizing impact on south asia presented by the permanent representative of pakistan to the at the conference on new agenda for disarmament and regional security july 23 1997 crs11 countries with their own unique security requirements should they apply for mtcr membership given these normative inequities amongst members it follows that factions within the mtcr membership could develop between states aspiring to missile or space launch program and those states with well established and financed programs because the mtcr is consensusbased such factions could conceivably undermine the regimes effectiveness an unverifiable regime another criticism of the mtcr is that it is inherently unverifiable due to the dual use nature of much of its regulated technology in terms of the mtcr some critics have pointed out that it is almost impossible to develop space launch vehicle program that does not have latent convertibility to ballistic missile program so purportedly peaceful slv programs can be swiftly weaponized36 this criticism is also applicable to cruise missiles and uavs both covered under mtcr guidelines turbo jet and turbo fan engines guidance and navigation systems and composite materials which are key components for cruise missiles and uavs are the mainstays of civilian aircraft technology while small fuelefficient turbojet and turbofan engines that could be used in cruise missiles are category ii items under the mtcr they may be exported as part of manned aircraft or in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for manned aircraft37 under these circumstances turbojet or turbofan engines for cruise missiles could be purchased under the guise of purchasing manned aircraft or replacement parts compounding the dual use dilemma is the lack of means of verification other than nations application of their export control laws countries outside the regime the mtcr is also criticized because many proliferating countries remain outside of the regime and because some members of the regime continue to violate its guidelines for countries outside of the regime such as china and north korea the mtcr offers little in terms of membership incentives for members such as russia which has been repeatedly challenged on variety of missile technology transfers not permitted under the mtcr serious questions have been raised on how best to deal with these violations these circumstances are not exclusive to the mtcr both the chemical weapons convention cwc and biological weapons convention bwc are criticized in similar fashion and some states parties maintain clandestine cw or bw programs in clear violation of their respective treaties the codes role in nonproliferation the code of conduct is too new to credit achievements there are however number of potential areas where the icoc may have positive influence on nonproliferation activities the code seeks to reduce mistrust among subscribing states by promoting transparency through the use of confidence building measures cbms38 current cbms require subscribing 36 verifiable control of ballistic missile proliferation mark smith vertic trust and verify januaryfebruary 2001 37 see note to paragraph 3a1of category ii item 3 propulsion components and equipment of the mtcr annex 38 low key launch of hague code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation ian davis british american security information council december 3 2002 p 2 crs12 states to make annual declarations of their ballistic missile policies and launches as well as slv policy inventories and launches states may also voluntarily host international observers at slv launches and seek bilateral or regional transparency measures while these cbms in and of themselves will probably not eliminate the schism between missile haves have nots and aspirants they have the potential to remove layer of secrecy from programs particularly those of major missile powers and perceptually level the playing field perhaps fostering greater cooperation amongst subscribing states another proposed cbm is that of universal launch notifications similar in nature to the prelaunch notification system currently being negotiated on bilateral basis by the united states and russia one proposed incentive for joining the code providing space technology assistance to countries that give up their ballistic missiles has received mixed reviews because of the dual use nature of space launch technology countries with older scudbased programs for example could trade up and gain access to more advanced technology by forfeiting their ballistic missile programs this proposal could be modified so that countries that eliminate their ballistic missile programs could receive preferential treatment in the launching of peaceful payloads such as communication satellites or research experiments all of these proposed initiatives designed to target the demand for ballistic missiles and their associated technology could serve as the basis for future efforts by the subscribing states to further develop the code criticisms of the code while there are criticisms to date on how well the code has performed there are number of criticisms of the draft code itself number of analysts characterize the code as weak or cautious noticeably absent in this regard is the mtcr criticism that the code is not treaty this is perhaps realization that the code is only in its infancy or possibly that treaty to halt ballistic missile proliferation is an unrealistic aspiration in an attempt to avoid the membership conflicts the in mtcr some analysts suggest that the code appears to be written so as not to offend states with substantial missile inventories39 another criticism is that the code does not set specific norms to address the demand aspect of missile proliferation the code simply implores subscribers to exercise maximum possible restraint in all ballistic missile matters this may attest to the inherent difficulty in devising mutually acceptable demandside norms or this could be deliberate tactic to get the maximum number of states to subscribe to the code before undertaking the contentious work of devising real workable norms even in its relatively benign form the code was not signed by countries of concern such as china north korea iran iraq syria india and pakistan israel also opted not to subscribe to the code possibly out of concern for the sanctity of their missile programs the code is also widely criticized because it lacks of tangible incentives the code vaguely addresses cooperative measures outreach programs and bilateral initiatives as means to get countries such as china and north korea to join and this 39 on thin ice first steps for the ballistic missile code of conduct mark smith arms control today julyaugust 2002 p 4 crs13 lack of substance may be more of negative incentive than positive one40 acceding to what is perceived by many as thinly worded agreement could be considered signing blank check where country may have to abide by future provisions that turn out to be contrary to their national security interests or be compelled to withdraw from the arrangement due to their national security needs and run the risk of being branded rogue nation in this regard many countries may be taking wait and see attitude about subscribing to the code both the mtcr and icoc have the potential to make positive contribution to the cause of missile nonproliferation despite criticisms both arrangements provide variety of means ranging from confidence building measures cbms to export denials to address missile proliferation in both flexible and relatively non confrontational manner the mtcr and icoc also provide countries with an important forum to discuss missile proliferation issues and approaches to deal with countries who choose to proliferate controlled missile and uav technologies such forum could offer benefits and as such congress may review how the us can best work with likeminded countries on both unilateral and multilateral basis to further develop and strengthen both arrangements benefits and liabilities of two missile nonproliferation arrangements congress may wish to consider the overall benefits of supporting both the mtcr and icoc as well as the possible liabilities proponents claim that the mtcr and icoc will complement one another and critics view the icoc as only reinforcing past failures in missile nonproliferation synergies the most widely cited synergy between the mtcr and the icoc is that of the supply and demand relationship canadian deputy defense minister margret bloodworth suggested that the code of conduct would work in tandem with the mtcr while the regime is supplyside arrangement the code works to address the demand side of missile proliferation41 from theoretical perspective the addition of demand side component to the missile nonproliferation equation should have positive influence on curbing missile proliferation in order to achieve this synergy countries must subscribe and abide by both agreements while some countries will undoubtedly choose this path other countries will likely remain outside of both arrangements increased participation the fact that there are now two multilateral missile proliferation arrangements may also serve to heighten international participation as more countries become members of one or both arrangements in this regard as the number of countries who subscribe to the arrangements potentially grows over time countries on the outside may begin to feel political and perhaps economic pressure to join another aspect of this synergy is that increased membership might also lead 40 ibid p 5 41 nartker p 1 crs14 to regional or bilateral missile nonproliferation agreements which could also further the cause of nonproliferation regime and code interactions there are also potential conflicts associated with both arrangements some analysts believe that the icoc drains resources and dilutes the purpose of the regime mtcr 42 richard speier former pentagon official involved in establishing the mtcr cautions that with range of agreements or measures to offer states might be tempted to go venue shopping to see which arrangement best kept open the possibility of developing ballistic missiles while assuming veneer of multilateral respectability43 with the icoc still in its formative phase it follows that country wishing to be viewed as nonproliferator could sign the icoc and then make case that they are not pursuing ballistic missiles but instead slv program for peaceful commercial purposes by participating in cbms and by virtue of the fact that such country is associating with other countries with missile and slv programs country could conceivably acquire information and technology to be used in missile program this tactic may possibly explain why libya country of concern with both active missile and wmd programs acceded to the icoc in november 2002 in order to achieve synergy between these two arrangements that have standing governing bodies the international community may consider establishing some form of organization or place the agreements under the auspices of an existing organization under current conditions it is unlikely that these arrangements will independently generate the intended synergy or complementary effect without some higher entity to mediate conflicts or provide direction when necessary to date there has been little discussion about the establishment of such an organization which in and of itself would likely take number of years to bring into being cruise missiles and uavs with over 70 countries currently in possession of cruise missiles44 and the demonstrated role of uavs in the global war on terror and the current war with iraq many analysts feel that the proliferation of cruise missiles and uavs poses greater threat than ballistic missile proliferation if cruise missile and uav proliferation indeed are the greater threat that some analysts suggest what are the mtcr and icoc cruise missile and uav related issues that congress may consider when assessing the effectiveness and future role of the arrangements uavs and the regime some analysts foresee major difficulties with the mtcr as it relates to uavs in 1987 when the regime was drafted longrange 42 progress reported towards ballistic missile code of conduct disarmament diplomacy marchapril 2002 p 2 43 ibid 44 cruise missiles potential delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction us government publication april 2000 p4 crs15 multirole uavs were not available45 in addition to their military role uavs have the potential for wide range of commercial applications including large cargo carriers pipeline surveillance domestic law enforcement and border surveillance and civilian communications to name few46 with the expanding military and commercial utility of uavs and their potential positive economic impact for the international and domestic aerospace industry pressure may begin to grow for relaxing mtcr restrictions47 with advances in uav technology which could make them virtually indistinguishable from manned aircraft aside from their lack of an onboard pilot congress may wish to examine the option of completely removing uavs from the mtcr and treating them as ordinary aircraft while this could be viewed as contentious and selfserving it might have the effect of simplifying and streamlining the mtcr which would then regulate only ballistic and cruise missiles systems which have commercial applicability while critics may accuse supporters of this proposal as promoting proliferation it should be noted that there are agreements or treaties restricting the development of manned military aircraft the aerospace industry may also benefit from such proposal which would likely be well received by both us and international firms given their current economic situations new technologies advances in cruise missile technology such as stealth hypersonic propulsion reprograming and loitering technologies and improved warheads and guidance present the question whether they should be included in the mtcrs annex including these technologies in the regimes annex could regulate their export but could also hinder any efforts by the united states and its allies to jointly develop future generations of these weapons systems uavs and cruise missiles absent from the code noticeably absent from the code are any provisions for cruise missiles and uavs this absence has number of possible ramifications without provisions for cruise missiles and uavs the icoc may well be viewed as the weaker of the two arrangements and thus attract countries with less than honorable intentions48 the lack of both cruise missile and uav provisions in the icoc will invariably place the burden of regulating cruise missiles and uavs exclusively on the mtcr some analysts feel that the icoc in its current form will offer very little value added to international efforts to control and regulate missile proliferation without including cruise missiles and uavs and could have decidedly nonsynergistic effect on overall international nonproliferation efforts49 the exclusion of cruise missiles and uavs from the icoc may be deliberate attempt by technologically advanced nations to keep their cruise missiles and uavs which have become the workhorses of some modern militaries unencumbered by the 45 state may allow global hawk predator exports to allies under existing mtcr vargo muradian defense daily january 14 2002 p 1 46 how effective is the

advantage to those nations who possess them and code which could potentially restrict their usage might not be well received by many governments given the national security implications of both cruise missiles and uavs congress may weigh the effect of having provisions governing these systems incorporated into the code missile nonproliferation treaty there have been number of formal and informal calls to create universal legally binding treaty since the mtcrs creation in 1987 suggestions have run the gamut from zero ballistic missile treaty that would ban all ballistic missiles to expanding the bilateral ussoviet intermediate range nuclear forces treaty inf into global pact50 there have been renewed calls for missile treaty most recently at the icoc signing ceremony in november 2002 and congress at some point may be called on to examine the feasibility of the creation of missile nonproliferation treaty perhaps based solely on the mtcr and icoc or based on other nonproliferation initiatives calls for treaty at the icocs signing ceremony number of countries including russia and canada called for the code to be first step in creation of legally binding treaty on ballistic missiles51 jingdong yuan writing for canadas department of foreign affairs and trade suggests that the ultimate goal in restricting missile proliferation would be fullfledged legally binding international treaty52 one of the most frequent criticisms of the mtcr is that it is not treaty as such the regime has international or domestic legal status and many critics cite this as the fundamental reason why the mtcr is ineffective in the prevention of missile proliferation critics such as mark smith from the mountbatten centre cite the regimes lack of legal mechanism formal status and enforcement and compliance mechanisms fundamental components of multilateral treaties as reasons why the mtcr is inefficient53 while missile technology control treaty may promote greater efficiency through various norms and legal mechanisms some treaty opponents argue that empirical evidence exists that suggests that treaty would be any more effective than the current regime has been in limiting missile proliferation basis of treaty should international consensus for treaty coalesce the mtcr and the icoc could form the basis of draft treaty the established relationships amongst mtcr and icoc member and subscribing countries could greatly facilitate treaty negotiations much of the preliminary provisions of 50 response to questions from senator daniel akaka by mr dennis gormley senior fellow international institute for strategic studies from the february 12 2002 international security proliferation and federal services subcommittee of the us senate committee on governmental affairs 51 kerr p 3 52 jingdong yuan p 24 53 efficiency and inefficiency of the mtcr in preventing ballistic missile proliferation mark smith mountbatten centre for international studies 2001 crs17 nonproliferation treaty would likely be embodied in the current arrangements and contentious aspects of the treaty such as verification regime or subsidizing space launch programs would have already had degree of discussion this synergy could potentially expedite the development of draft treaty transform the inf one option that has been discussed is to transform the inf treaty which banned soviet and us land based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5500 kms into global regime while many analysts cite the treatys simplicity and clarity of purpose as formula for success other analysts disagree54 opponents argue that the infs lower limit of 500 km is too high to capture many types of wmdcapable cruise missiles and shortrange ballistic missiles55 another criticism of the inf approach is that it would not cover sealaunched ballistic missiles and uavs and would turn the mtcr into supplemental tool to combat missile proliferation56 treatys impact on the mtcr and icoc efforts to develop missile nonproliferation treaty could also incite degree of conflict between the mtcr and icoc in 1995 mtcr member states reportedly reached consensus that they would not entertain proposals to establish global treaty to ban ballistic missiles with specific ranges57 many analysts believe that this decision was due to lack of support from the declared nuclear powers whose support would be essential for the treaty to have any hope of success58 even with the advent of the icoc and renewed calls for treaty from number of countries this lack of support from the declared nuclear powers probably still exists in this regard efforts to draft treaty would likely be contentious at best and could possibly impact on the dayto day efficacy of the mtcr and icoc missile nonproliferation and export control officials and diplomats from countries involved in the mtcr and icoc would likely be asked to play role in developing and negotiating treaty due to their expertise and familiarity with missile nonproliferation issues given these possible circumstances officials involved in drafting the treaty may not be able to devote as much attention to mtcr and icoc issues which could have detrimental impact on these two arrangements particularly the icoc which still is in the early phases of development would treaty be more effective perhaps very critical consideration is whether treaty would be any more effective than the mtcr and icoc in curbing missile proliferation in order to have an appreciable and lasting impact on missile proliferation countries such as china north korea iran iraq syria india and pakistan would need to subscribe to treaty agreement or arrangement and then abide in good faith with its provisions it is somewhat unlikely that this will ever occur because like the us russia france and the united kingdom missiles are seen as crucial part of their countrys national security if this situation is as good 54 gromley p2 55 ibid 56 ibid 57 canada calls for ballistic missile ban international defense review june 1995 p 5 58 bowen p 32 crs18 as it will ever get as some analysts suggest it might be better to continue to strengthen and develop the mtcr and icoc attempting to find some common ground with these countries which will facilitate their accession to either or both arrangements once they become members it may possible to help them redefine their national security needs as well as their economic policy for exporting missile technology in order to bring them more in line with the norms promoted by the mtcr and icoc some analysts believe that the pursuit of global treaty could take decades and consume resources better applied to the mtcr and icoc and in the end be more or perhaps less effective than the mtcr and icoc in preventing missile proliferation us administration of the missile technology control regime and international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation number of us government organizations are involved in the administration of both arrangements primarily through the interagency process the us state departments bureau of nonproliferation has the primary responsibility for leadership of the interagency process for both the mtcr and icoc the bureau is also responsible for related negotiations and discussions as well as developing and conducting diplomatic efforts designed to discourage countries from pursuing missile development and to develop and strengthen missilerelated export controls the department of defense dod also plays prominent role in the interagency administration of the arrangements the office of the assistant secretary of defense for international security policy in addition to representing dod in mtcr and icocrelated interagency meetings develops and coordinates dod policy and positions for international negotiations on arms control implementation compliance issues59 the cias center for weapons intelligence nonproliferation and arms control winpac also plays an active role in the interagency primarily by providing information gained through their monitoring of the various arms agreements and countryspecific programs the department of commerces doc bureau of industry and security in the office of nonproliferation controls and treaty compliance in addition to being key member of the mtcr interagency group is responsible for regulating the export of sensitive goods and technologies in an effective and efficient manner enforcing export control laws cooperating with and

items to countries that are not members of the regime us sanctions must be imposed on the offending party for category i items the act bars the foreign entity cited from all contracts with the us government for at least two years and denies sales of any items on the usml for at least two years for category ii items the act bars the foreign entity from all us missilerelated technologies and equipment contracts for at least two years and also forbids the transfer of missile related technologies and equipment from us firms for at least two years the export administration act eaa of 1979 sections 61 and 11b 50 usc app 2405 and app 2410b65 the eaa governs us export of dualuse items and civilian technologies and items that have potential for military application banning the export of these items to foreign entities involved in missile proliferation if an entity is charged with proliferating category i items exports of all dual use items controlled by the eaa to the entity are banned for up to two years if category ii items are proliferated only dualuse items covered by the mtcr are banned for up to two years category i violations are deemed more severe in nature because the eaas list of dualuse items is far more extensive than the mtcrs the fiscal year 1991 national defense authorization act pl 10151066 this act defines many key terms contained in us missile sanction laws and provides guidelines on the applicability of laws as they pertain to the sanctions process and when presidential waiver of sanctions is authorized this act also contains provisions from the helms amendment which strengthens missile sanctions for countries with nonmarket economies such as china and north korea former warsaw pact members who may still have nonmarket economies would not be subject to these strengthened sanctions if foreign entity from one of the countries subject to the helms amendment engaged in missile proliferation then the country of that entity would also be subject to sanctions on all mtcrrelated technologies as well as any aircraft electronic or space system technologies the amendment prohibits us government contracts and exports to those countrys proliferating agencies and also bans imports from those agencies for at least two years 64 ibid 65 ibid 66 ibid p 2 crs21 the iran nonproliferation act of 2000 pl 10617867 this act requires that sanctions be imposed on countries whose companies provide assistance to iran in its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems the sanctions ban the us government from providing assistance to the offending entity for at least two years prohibits the us government acquisition of goods and services from the offending entity for at least two years forbids the sale of any usml or dualuse controlled item to the entity terminates any preexisting sales of military items between both us entities and the us government and the offending entity and blocks procurement of new export licenses for the offending entity presidential waivers the president has the authority to waive sanctions if he feels that it is essential to the national security of the united states except in the case of the iran nonproliferation act which has much more extensive presidential waiver criteria68 presidential waivers have been used by recent administrations on number of occasions president clinton authorized the lifting of sanctions against chinese missile entities in november 1992 in exchange for chinas promise that it would abide by mtcr guidelines china failed to live up to their promise and sanctions were reimposed on chinese entities in 1993 for their sale of m11 missile technology to pakistan69 on november 21 2001 china promised not to export missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and further pledged to develop and implement an export control system to complement mtcr guidelines in response the us lifted sanctions against chinese entities that were involved in proliferating missile technologies to both pakistan and iran70 the bush administration partially waived missile sanctions against pakistani entities particularly the ministry of defense

conduct against ballistic missile proliferation 1 the subscribing states reaffirming their commitment to the united nations charter stressing the role and responsibility of the united nations in the field of international peace and security recalling the widespread concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery recognizing the increasing regional and global security challenges caused inter alia by the ongoing proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction seeking to promote the security of all states by fostering mutual trust through the implementation of political and diplomatic measures having taken into account regional and national security considerations believing that an international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation will contribute to the process of strengthening existing national and international security arrangements and disarmament and nonproliferation objectives and mechanisms recognizing that subscribing states may wish to consider engaging in co operative measures among themselves to this end 1 adopt this international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation hereinafter referred to as the code 2 resolve to respect the following principles recognition of the need comprehensively to prevent and curb the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction and the need to continue pursuing appropriate international endeavours including through the code b recognition of the importance of strengthening and gaining wider adherence to multilateral disarmament and nonproliferation regimes c recognition that adherence to and full compliance with international arms control disarmament and nonproliferation norms help build confidence as to the peaceful intentions of states d recognition that participation in this code is voluntary and open to all states confirmation of their commitment to the united nations declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for the benefit and in the interest of all states taking into particular account the needs crs29 of developing countries adopted by the united nations general assembly resolution 51122 of 13 december 1996 f recognition that states should not be excluded from utilizing the benefits of space for peaceful purposes but that in reaping such benefits and in conducting related cooperation they must not contribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction g recognition that space launch vehicle programs should not be used to conceal ballistic missile programs h recognition of the necessity of appropriate transparency measures on ballistic missile programs and space launch vehicle programs in order to increase confidence and to promote nonproliferation of ballistic missiles and ballistic missile technology 3 resolve to implement the following general measures to ratify accede to or otherwise abide by the treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies the convention on international liability for damage caused by space objects and the convention on registration of objects launched into outer space b to curb and prevent the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction both at global and regional level through multilateral bilateral and national endeavors c to exercise maximum possible restraint in the development testing and deployment of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction including where possible to reduce national holdings of such missiles in the interest of global and regional peace and security d to exercise the necessary vigilance in the consideration of assistance to space launch vehicle programs in any other country so as to prevent contributing to delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction considering that such programs may be used to conceal ballistic missile programs not to contribute to support or assist any ballistic missile program in countries which might be developing or acquiring weapons of mass destruction in contravention of norms established by and of those countries obligations under the disarmament and nonproliferation treaties 4 resolve to implement the following transparency measures as follows with an appropriate and sufficient degree of detail to increase confidence and to promote nonproliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction i with respect to ballistic missile programs to crs30 make an annual
