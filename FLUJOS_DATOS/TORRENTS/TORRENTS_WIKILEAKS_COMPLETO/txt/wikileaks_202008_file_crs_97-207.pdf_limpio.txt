wate r management the administration has asked for an appropriation of 906 million in fy1998 current budget authority 131 million more than enacted for fy1997 the increase is largely due to 1433 million request for the california baydelta ecosystem restoration progra m calfed when this is subtracted the request results in decrease of 118 million fo r ongoing programs although funding for the baydelta program has been requested within the bureaus budget the appropriation will be allocated among several federal agencies it is expected that the majority of funding will go to the bureau and

requesting 695 billion for civilian and defense rd activities within the committees jurisdiction compared to 600 billion appropriated for fy1997 158 increase for civilian rd progr ams the request is 324 billion compared to 309 billion appropriated for fy1997 and for defense rd nuclear weapons programs th request is 366 billion compared to 292 billion appropriated for fy1997 the larg increase most of which occurs in defe nse is mostly result of the switch to full construc tion cost funding without that change the fy1998 budget request would have been about 250 million or 42 above the fy1997 appropriation applied energy rd for applied energy rd programs doe is requesting n increase of 277 for in solar and renewable energy photovoltaics biofuels wind an d electric energy systems and storage would receive most of the additional funds there may be debate over this increase however as result of different views about the role of th federal government in supporting research with potential commercial application th conference bill approved substantial increas over fy1997 but still well below the fy1998 request doe is also requesting 227 increase in nuclear energy rd in addition th program is shifting its goals from development of the next generation of light water reactors to support the nations xisting power plants doe will establish an outside review panel to recommend strategic changes for the program the proposed change may generate debat ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97207crs7 about does relationship with the nations nuclear power industry large share of th request about 32 is for termination costs of various doe reactor facilities the conference bill f unding level is well below the request primarily because it did not approve does nuclear security initiative request basic research progr ams for basic research doe is requesting small increase of 18 the basic research programs include general science and research basic energ sciences computational and technology research biological and environmental research and fusion energy science each of these progra ms is asking for small increase or decrease major issues appear although two items may receive attention in general sciences an d research the highenergy physics hep program is requesting 394 million in advanc appropri ation for fy1999 to fy2004 for united states participation in the large hadro n collider project at the center for european nuclear research c ern this action could have significant implications for the rest of the hep program if future year funding is greater than level with this year which seems likely in fusion energy sciences doe is asking for 55 million for the last year of the collaborative engineering design of the internationa l thermonuclear experimental r eactor iter decision on construction will be made during fy1998 and debate about whether the united states should participate may take place this year the conference approved nearly all does request in these areas it expressed strong support for does basic science research activities it did not however approve advanc appropriation for the hep program defens rd programs by far most of the increase in the doe rd reques t resulting from the change to full construction cost funding takes place in the stockpil stewardship program for fy1998 doe is asking for 876 million for remaining fund s needed to construct the national ignition facility nif prior to the change the projecte d request for fy1998 f or the nif was about 200 million in addition the request shows that the total construction cost of the proj ect has increased by about 200 million to 105 billion the total project cost is now esti mated at 12 billion up from 11 billion the request for the core stockpile stewardship program is about 05 below the fy1997 appropriation debate over this funding request may involve broader issues about the overall objectives of the doe efforts to maintain the nuclear weapon stockpile and whether these objectives can be met the conference provided substantial increase above the doe request for the cor stockpile stewardship program it pro vided funding for fy1998 construction of nif but did not provide the requested full construction cost funding full construction cost funding for fy1998 the ffice of management and budget has instructed doe to request the full construction cost for any multiyear project which is currently under construction previously doe only asked for budget authority for the funds incrementally each year at level approximating the amount it intended to obligate that year doe argues that this change will allow the congress and administration to make decisions about projects with clearer view of their fu ll costs in addition doe believes the new system will make it easier t ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97207crs8 ensure projects are completed on time and within budget outlays for these projects will still occur over their life as originally scheduled for fy1998 this change adds about 16 billion to the total doe budget request that would not have be there under the previous system of incremental requests about half of this additi on occurs in the rd programs primarily in stockpile stewardship and the other half in nonrd programs primarily defense environmental restoration and wast management the conference declined to fund construction projects beyond the fy1998 period environmental cleanup and waste management cleaning up environmental contamination at doe nuclear facilities and disposing f radioactiv waste continue to be the departments most expensive activities the fy199 8 appropriations request for does environmental manage ment program which manages those activities totals 72 billion up 12 billion from fy1997 the conference cut the total to just over 6 billion and trans ferred one of does cleanup programs formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap to the army corps of engineers most of the additional funding requested by doe would not have been spent in fy1998 but instead was to be held for gradual payout in futu re years about 1 billion in the fy1998 request would provide dvance appropriations for privatized waste management contracts and 650 million would provide full funding for propo sed construction projects if the future year funding in the requ est were subtracted the environmental management program would rise from 57 million in fy1997 to 576 million in fy1998 according to doe priva tization doe requested 1006 billion in fy1998 to greatly expand th privatization of waste management and cleanup projects throughout the department congress provided 330 million for doe pri vatization in fy1997 conferees provided 200 million for privatization in fy1998 the doe privatization initiative is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting portion of project risks from the federal government t contractors profits to contractors would depend on th eir success in meeting project schedules and holdin g down costs potentially profits could be substantially higher than unde r traditional doe contracting arrangements in typical nonprivatized doe project contractor would be hired to build an d operate facility with government funds doe would approve and pay all the contractors costs and then award the contractor profit based on performance under the privatization initiative contractor would be expected to raise almost all funding for necessary facilities and equipment for pr oject the contractor would recover that investment and earn profit by charging previously negotiated fees to doe for p roviding services under the contract such as solidification of radioactive waste the contractor could earn higher profits by reducing costs but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were not deliveredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97207crs9 according does fy1998 budget request the privatization concept requires congress to provide sufficient budget authority in advance to cover contractors costs if project is canceled by the government without such advance appropriations according to doe contractors cannot raise money for privatized projects for example private financial backers of waste treatment plant would need assurance that if the plant were built and the federal governme nt decided not to use it then doe would have funding available to pay all th projects costs to that point plus cancellation fee if project operated as planned th advance appropriations then would be gradually drawn down to help pay for the service s specifie d by the contract in either case outlays from the advance appropriations fo r privatization would not occur until future years nearly half of the fy1 998 privatization request 427 million would be devoted to the design and construction of two demonstration plan ts for treating highly radioactive waste now stored in underground tanks at does hanford site in washington state total costs f building and operating the demonstration plants are estimated at 46 billion with th majority of budget outlays expected from fy2002 through fy2007 doe estimates tha t privatizing the project will reduce costs by 1030 the conferees placed high priority on the hanford waste project the remaining 579 million of the fy1998 pri vatization request would provide advance appropriations for 11 other environmental proj ects throughout the doe complex among the larger projects are radioactive solid waste treatment facility at oak ridge tennessee spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at the savannah river site in south carolina and lowlevel liquid wa ste treatment facility at idaho falls idaho estimated cost savings range from 10 40 controversy over the doe privatization initiative has centered primarily on the future budget outlays that will be genera ted by the large advance appropriations being requested for the program in addition to the 13 billion s ought or already provided doe plans to request about 500 million per year for privatization during the subsequent five fiscal years according to recen t doe testimony concerns have been raised that large future outlays for privatized projects could have unpredictable effects on other programs in the energy an d water appropriations bill other privatization issues include the accuracy of does pr ojections of cost savings and the degree of risk to be borne by privatized contractors recent report by the genera l accounting office found some of does costred uction projections to be overstated although the agency agreed that substantial savings could be expected from the new contractin g approach much of the success of the program may depend on the amount of real risk that contractors agree to accept and how much risk remains with doe because few privatized contracts have yet been signed that factor remains subject to uncertainty other environme ntal management funding excluding advance appropriations for privatized contracts and construction projects funding for doe environmental cleanup and waste management programs is to rise only slightly in fy1998 one exception is th formerly utilized sites remedial ction program fusrap which would get boost from 75 million to 182 million fusrap cleans up nonfederal sites that were radioactivel contaminated by us nuclear weapons work and other activities according to doe th accelerated funding would advance the completion of the program from fy2006 to fy2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97207crs10 conferees transferred the fusrap program to the army co rps of engineers an idea that has been proposed for all doe cleanup activities 37 million reduction is proposed f or development of cleanup and waste management technology to 258 million the largest reduction is in the subsurface contaminants category which would be cut by twothirds and receive new projects in fy1998 in addition to the funding cut 50 million of technology development spe nding would be shifted to technology deployment initiative to help ensure that the most promising new technologies are actuall used by cleanup contractors the senate cut funds to the technology further 25 million to 233 million th committee report declared that changes need to be made in the management execution and oversight of the program to improve the results of the technology investment the house energy and water subcommittee with similar negative comments cut the program 7 5 million to 183 million the conference agreement provides 220 million nuclear energy science and technology an increase of more tha n 80 million is being sought for the office of nuclear energy science and technology whose activities include development of nuclear energy systems international nuclear safety assistance termination of unused facilities and development of spent nuclear fuel treatment processes the fy1998 funding request for the office totals 415 million major iss ue in the nuclear energy budget in previous years involved funding fo r advanced versions of light water reactors the type of nuclear power plant currently i n commercial operation throughout most of the world opponents called the funding n example of corporate welfare contending that the nuclear industry which shared th programs costs should develop new reactors entirely on its own according to doe th program will be successfully co mpleted in fy1997 and only 55 million in closeout costs are being sought for fy1998 with the end of the advanced light water reactor program d oe is proposing followon program that would develop technology to support continued operation of existing us nuclear power plants however the conference agreement provided funding for th initiative the proposed nuclear energy security progra m funded at 39 million in fy1998 would have helped assure the diversity of the nations energy supply and help reduce emissions from fossil fuels according to the doe budget request the program is intended to develop technologies to mitigate the aging of nuclear plant components develop advanced reacto r control systems overcome obstacles to longer lasting nuclear fuel and study other nuclea r plant operational problems as with the light water reactor program opponents contend that such research should be the responsibility of the nuclear industry another controversial element in the nuclear energy budget request is 25 million fo r nuclea r technology research and development which involves the electrometallurgica l treatmen t of doe spent nuclear fuel conferees provided 12 million in that treatmen t process spent fuel is melted and highly radioactive isotopes are electrically separated from uranium and plutonium according to t he doe fy1998 budget request electrometallurgicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97207crs11 treatmen t could be used to transform unstable spent fuel into safer forms for storage an d disposal opponents contend that such treatment is unnecessary and tha t the process could be used for separating plutonium to m ake nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed f or the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly
