6305c23 shspec268 state of ot there isnt government on earth that has the right to permit our survival as an organization cognition the only reason you have present time problem is that you dont have enough time the helatrobus implants you can call them the heaven implants had big effect on thetans with their cold energy or frozen energy the helatrobus government had gold crosses on their aircraft one could find out who they were they couldnt find out who was behind and actually doing the implanting the implants were based on cold energy with significance placed in it the implants tended to talk the helatrobites had figured out something that looked to everyone else like natural phenomenon the magellanic radioactive clouds with which they surrounded planetary systems the stars in galaxy tend to be collected towards the center of the galactic wheel when you look at the milky way you are looking towards the center of this galaxy in the opposite direction you see other galaxies we are awfully far out from the center of this galaxy our sun is rim star galaxies are condensations of radioactive clouds into suns and planets planets sometimes shatter to become belt of asteroids suns range from dead suns to red yellow white and blue suns as they get hotter and brighter bodies could exist that are suited for conditions on other planets some science fiction writers have very good memories but have fallen victim to the implants that reverse time such that the past equals the future the boogie man is standard mechanism for keeping people from going places and looking at things confronting for instance the phoenicians spread seamonster rumors to prevent competition with england in the tin trade scare stories about terrible beings are quite standard they are used to keep people out of things that others want to keep hidden most planets run by animal forms have classifiable types of forms similar from system to system depending on the environment someone built for jupitertype conditions would look perhaps eskimoish you could become very disheartened and caved in about this universe and see it as trap until you recognize that the thetan is helped all the time by mest it gives him location consecutive scenery and persistent structure of matter this universe has solved lot of problems for the thetan when he gets too far down on the tone scale therefore he gets on stuck oneway help flow with respect to the physical universe the thetan doesnt help the universe you could run him on how could you help the physical universe and he would feel better about it degraded beings come to the conclusion because of the above situation that the trouble with this universe is that it has free beings in it they feel that the universe is too good for free beings so every now and then someone decides to make it evil if thetan is that degraded what he sees as wrong with the physical universe is that it has free beings in it so he tries to make them unfree the origin of the physical universe in the first place is probably collision of home universes the problem of why everybody stays in single present time was one of the more fantastic problems the why is response to vibration there is one underlying vibration that the universe your bank and you are vibrating at the only variation in that vibration relates to the progression of time therefore you can move someone on the time track one overwhelmed others with vibration very minute vibration the size of the vibration of light particle the time track is formed by an involuntary intention in studying the power of an operating thetan lrh has had pauses in thinking although intellectually such power is conceivable recently lrh has been exploring the actual potentialities of an ot the problem of an ot may be analogous to the problem that one encounters if one tries to pick up the cellophane wrapper from pack of cigarettes without denting it at all you could only do this if you could estimate or measure the exact force necessary to pick it up without denting it this is probably the basic problem of an ot and it may give him his time track the power of thetan is such that if he were to pick up steel cylinder capable of resisting pressure of several thousand pounds per square inch it would be like you with the cellophane wrapper the problem is how to touch something without crushing it the thetan is being careful in handling mest he seeks another method of handling he feels that he is quite destructive people who have lost their ot abilities and strength will try and did try on the time track to convince free thetans that they were dangerous people who havent that level of action would believe that free thetan was destructive and would trap him with the idea by causing him to use new trick doing things by intention instead of directly we have always thought of intention as primary but it is secondary the postulate and action through postulates is secondary to action through energy you should be able to do both but it is more natural for thetan to just pick something up than to pick it up by an intention or postulate that it be up it is great downgrade intention is unnatural it would be natural to just move things however this is hard to do if the thetan is afraid that he will destroy the thing in the process instead he develops the safer method of operation by intention alone he can do this but it enforces great restraint on him it is like putting yourself on terrific withhold of self the thetan trains intention to become involuntary it is not imaginary it is like involuntary nerves or muscles that work automatically mest is fragile recently in new york or melbourne when they started running the goal to forget in coaudit the emeter got fused the pc melted the lines some involuntary intention was triggered in him and zap unless you understand this as too great power within the ethical limits of the individual you wont understand the problems of an ot thetan is stronger than the fragility with which he is surrounded and he compensates by reducing his power this was the wrong solution he developed an automatic action eg the phone rings he doesnt touch it it springs into the air and he talks the postulate does things without his having to intend them there is difference between an involuntary intention to act and an involuntary intention to duplicate and an involuntary intention to create and thats where the time track comes from this is an hypothesis to account for the time track then someone gives the thetan things for the automatic machinery to mock up which would be bad for the thetan or someone jams the machinery and makes the thetan fight his own automatic intention the next thing you know he has messedup time track he goes solid he picks up meat body the withhold begins with the steel cellophane rational solution would have been not to make everything so damned fragile withholding all the time has all sorts of ill effects including putting engrams on your track these matters have lot to do with scientology organizations seeing the character of an ot we see that these matters could be upsetting in various directions we have some responsibilities to start things out right if we are going to make ots early on conceiving that free thetans were very dangerous and should be shot down people like the helatrobites started laying in implants and weakening people working with great industry before these implants planets were suddenly surrounded with radioactive cloud masses from the center of the galaxy waves of black and grey clouds would sweep over the planet engulfing it in radioactivity the dark horse nebula in orion is one huge radioactive cloud like this this could go on for million years universes have lines of force vectors like spokes which were used by the helatrobus group to move magellanic clouds they just set them loose one found out that it was being done by someone it was all explained as natural phenomenon because of these theories one thought to look for anyone doing it at least hundred years after system had been engulfed helatrobus would send capturing troops in ships with little orangecolored electronic bombs that would talk speech was frozen into electronic capsules the clouds would talk hark hark look out etc it sounded like fun house its unbelievability made detection of its origin all but impossible it confused the thetans all to hell for some reason the symbol of airplanes goes through this this symbol goes earlier to implants at 80 trillion years ago where aircraft symbolized needing machine to get you off planet so for some years after years of radioactivity the clouds were there with speech in them containing contradictory commands like come here cant come go mustnt go it was doubletalk the helatrobites put traction beams on thetans eventually after many incidents of resisting it the thetan got sucked up into small capsules via bubbles and thence into spaceships all of this assaulted his credulity he couldnt understand what was going on this had never happened before then in one to six months the helatrobites would get him into an implant area fix him on post wobbled him around ran him through an implant of goals on little monowheel pole trap with the effigy of body on it he had body at that time eventually he would get home then he would get picked up again and put through more series of implants probably the helatrobites knew who had been implanted already because we find implants in pairs of two and four never three or one once this started the planet would be in turmoil and revolt and things got very insane the heaven implants then were preceded by tremendous periods of unrest with radioactive clouds orange bombs warfare wild anarchy etc it was chaos rather like twentieth century earth it was hitlerlike stuff it got more and more crazy and out of control they were very worried thetans before the clouds came there would be occasional thetatrapping etc but things were generally pretty peaceful it was only when the free thetans were threatened that they became restive and ungovernable free thetans in themselves are easy to put up with in pi radioactive fallout is key restimulator of this whole scene but how does partlyfreed thetan feel when he sees the old situation seeming to repeat itself with all the symbols from the track it makes him mad at fallout government wars etc earth is in for period of chaos which scientology can render less extreme than it would otherwise be but we cant entirely eliminate the chaos since some earlier chaos will be restimulated but the planet is doomed if we dont operate lrhs attention is therefore on organizational concerns how do we move through such period the scientology organization is set up to handle this period of chaos as long as thetans have rage in their hearts about the situation their power is curtailed this is safety factor if we just let chaos happen we will slow our forward progress sooner or later there will be the rest of the galaxy to deal with earth has already blasted off into meatbody space opera which may not be appreciated by someone out there earth people get hysterical when they think that there is an invasion from space so it represents real threat not something people think is unreal or impossible orson wells radio broadcast of the war of the worlds resulted in ecuador in the radio station that broadcast it being torn down by enraged ecuadorians they knew about space opera even though they didnt have science fiction to educate them with things as they are several factors confront us if we handle things as they are we may be able to have things as we would like to have them
