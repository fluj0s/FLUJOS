congress review of issues summary the 106th congress considered number of trade policy developments against backdrop of weak foreign demand and large world supplies of agricultural products the us department of agriculture reports that the value of us agricultural exports fell between fy1996 record year and fy1999 by almost 11 billion to 492 billion agricultural exports did climb back to 509 billion in fy2000 and are projected at 53 billion in fy2001 however the pace of recovery has been of concern to many agricultural groups and their supporters in congress although they recognize that many world economic and other factors influence exports many of these groups believe the sectors future prosperity also depends on such us trade policies as 1 encouraging chinas entry into the wto with its binding rules and responsibilities 2 exempting agricultural exports from us unilateral economic sanctions 3 fully using export and food aid programs and 4 challenging foreignimposed barriers to the movement of us farm products few us farm groups are wary of such approaches they point out that by maintaining barriers to us imports and their own high export subsidies and internal farm supports not all countries have fully honored existing trade agreements in fact some of these us groups pressed for more restrictions on foreign farm and food imports agricultural trade issues of interest in the 106th congress included china permanent normal trade relations ntr status which the united states had been renewing on an annual basis 1999 bilateral trade agreement between the united states and china tied to wto accession provides for tariff reductions and increased access to the chinese market for many us agricultural products to help ensure that the united states can take advantage of these potential benefits the clinton administration gained passage of legislation in 2000 granting china permanent ntr status effective upon its accession to the wto new round of wto

agricultural trade trends exports export markets are extremely important to us producers the worlds leading agricultural exporters although agriculture is one of the few us sectors that records surplus trade balance it declined to 116 billion in fy1999 and was 12 billion in fy2000 well below fy1998s 166 billion surplus and the lowest since 1987 see chart on page 2 crs2 leading markets the leading us farm export markets value fy199799 were japan the european union eu canada mexico taiwan and south korea asia in general and china in particular are viewed as critical longterm growth markets see chart on page 3 high value products worldwide us exports of bulk commodities eg oilseeds and grains remained significant but highvalue exports such as meats fruits vegetables and processed foods have increased now representing more than 60 of the value of total us farm exports dependence on exports some products depend more heavily on exports for total sales than others for example exports of almonds hidesskins wheat walnuts and rice have accounted for 50 or more of their total sales other products where exports constituted 25 or more of sales included cotton prunes grapefruit raisins soybeans salmon pulses tobacco animal fats lemons grapes broccoli pears oranges coarse grains and canned corn state export rankings nearly every state exports agricultural products led by california with agricultural exports valued by usda in 1999 at 69 billion more than twice the level of number two iowa with 32 billion other states in the top ten by rank 1999 were nebraska kansas

agricultural trade trends composition direction and policy crs5 us agriculture and chinas accession to the wto the prospect of future growth in demand for agricultural products made chinas accession to the wto likely in 2001 an important issue for us agriculture most us agricultural interest groups looked to chinas eventual membership in the wto as way to enhance us agricultural exports and increase farm incomes us agricultural exports to china were valued at nearly 15 billion in fy2000 making it the eighth largest market for us farm products another 13 billion of us farm products were shipped to hong kong in fy2000 in the long run if economic growth is strong as many economists expect chinas 12 billion population and its growing middle class suggest its significant potential as market for us agricultural products the uschina negotiations on terms for the latters accession to the wto were concluded in november 1999 the agricultural components of this agreement appear identical to those of an earlier agreement negotiated in april 1999 but not finalized due to us problems with it and subsequently to diplomatic fallout from the accidental us bombing of chinas embassy in yugoslavia on may 8 1999 negotiations resumed in september 1999 the november 15 1999 agreement provides that china if it becomes member of the wto will make substantial reductions in agricultural tariffs and establish market access quotas that should expand trade for several important us agricultural products including soybean products wheat corn rice and cotton virtually all other wto members have concluded bilateral agreements with china ultimately chinas application for membership must be agreed to by other members of the wto uschina wto negotiations in april 1999 were accompanied by bilateral agreements to end chinas sanitary and phytosanitary sps barriers to us wheat meat and citrus exports when accession negotiations were suspended however chinas implementation of the bilateral agreements came to standstill since the november 1999 agreement china has begun to implement the bilateral agreements with reported purchases of wheat citrus and meats including beef and pork occurring in 2000 the wto requires that members extend mostfavorednation mfn treatment also known as normal trading relations ntr to all other members such status means that products enter the united states at the same low tariff rates that apply to virtually all other nations to help ensure that the united states can take better advantage of the full range of concessions congress was asked to grant china permanent ntr status the clinton administration submitted permanent ntr legislation to congress on march 8 2000 on may 17 the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee each approved bills s 2277 hr 4444 to accord permanent ntr the full house approved its bill on may 24 by vote of 237197 the full senate approved the house bill on september 19 by vote of 8315 and the president signed it pl 106286 on october 10 2000 crs6 previously the united states could extend ntr treatment to china on an annual basis only if china complied with freedom of emigration conditions in the jackson vanik amendment to the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 section 401 providing ntr for china depended on the extension of an annual waiver of jacksonvanik by the president subject to resolution of disapproval by either congressional chamber because permanent ntr authority would not take effect until china accedes to the wto the president in june 2000 recommended this waiver for an additional year resolution of disapproval hjres 103 was introduced but defeated 147 to 281 by the house on july 18 2000 thereby upholding the presidents waiver for more information see crs report rs20169 agriculture and chinas accession to the world trade organization and china and us agriculture in the crs electronic briefing book on trade agriculture in world trade negotiations multilateral wto negotiations new round of multilateral trade negotiations including but not limited to agriculture was to be launched formally when trade ministers of wto countries met november 30december 2 1999 in seattle while the uruguay round ur provided new and strengthened rules for the conduct of agricultural trade new round is intended to expand markets for agricultural products and further ease trade barriers export subsidies and tradedistorting domestic support the operations of state trading enterprises stes like the canadian wheat board and trade in genetically engineered food products also are at issue trade ministers at the seattle meeting were unable to agree on an agenda for comprehensive new round which would have included not only agriculture but services intellectual property industrial tariffs and perhaps broader issues of competition investment and the relationship of trade agreements to labor and environmental considerations however article 20 of the ur agreement on agriculture mandates negotiations in agriculture to begin in early 2000 these negotiations were launched march 2324 2000 at special session of the wtos committee on agriculture various countries have since submitted more detailed negotiating proposals during this process on june 29 2000 the administration announced its negotiating proposal to the wto it includes elimination of agricultural export subsidies by fixed date substantial reductions in current tariffs and increases in tariffrate quotas on agricultural imports discipline of state trading enterprises and new reductions in domestic farm supports based on the same fixed percentage of each countrys total agricultural production value with the objective of eventually making all countries domestic support levels comparable the negotiations have been proceeding slowly many agricultural interests support us participation in comprehensive round rather than sectoral negotiation because they believe the tradeoffs possible in larger negotiation would result in improved market prospects for us agricultural crs7 exports some agricultural groups who feel that they have been disadvantaged by previous trade agreements oppose us participation in new round in congress the senate agriculture committee held hearings on wto issues on june 24 and september 30 1999 the house agriculture committee held its own hearing on june 23 1999 in early 2000 several other committees held hearings on the wto seattle meeting and its implications for future talks including those on agricultural trade relatedly the african growth and opportunity act pl 106200 see below contains us negotiating objectives for agriculture in these talks joint resolution hjres 90 requiring the united states to withdraw from the wto was introduced on march 2 2000 but the house on june 21 defeated the measure by vote of 56353 see the wto seattle ministerial in the crs electronic briefing book on trade crs report 98254 agricultural negotiations in the world trade organization and crs report rs20422 united states withdrawal from the world trade organization legislative procedure african growth and opportunity act the president on may 18 2000 signed into law the african growth and opportunity act pl 106200 hr 434 which includes number of amendments of direct interest to agriculture the primary purpose of the measure is to increase trade opportunities with africa and the caribbean basin among the agricultural provisions added by the senate in november 1999 and retained by conferees is the socalled carousel retaliation provision that requires the administration periodically to rotate or change the types of products targeted for trade retaliation against foreign country its immediate objective was to seek to intensify pressure on the eu to permit imports of beef produced with hormones and to resolve long running dispute over banana imports see below by penalizing wider range of foreign industries and regions as the 106th congress adjourned the administration had not yet released revised lists of imports subject to retaliation other agriculturerelated provisions in this measure include the creation of chief agricultural negotiator in the office of the us trade representative and the detailing of explicit us objectives for agriculture in wto negotiations the latter include calls for an end to export subsidies and reduction of foreign trade barriers senate provision permitting farmers to apply for trade adjustment assistance benefits was dropped from the final conference version hrept 106606 economic sanctions and agricultural exports falling agricultural exports and declining commodity prices led farm groups and agribusiness firms to urge the 106th congress to pass legislation exempting the export of food and agricultural commodities from us unilateral economic sanctions policy against certain countries in the course of debate on pl 106387 the fy2001 appropriations bill for the us department of agriculture usda congress adopted provision to lift sanctions on commercial sales of food agricultural commodities and medical products to iran libya north korea and sudan and to allow such sales to cuba subject to financing and other restrictions crs8 with the exception of the cubaspecific provisions title ix of pl 106387 largely codifies rules that the clinton administration formalized in july 1999 allowing licensed commercial sales of food and medical products to three countries currently subject to us unilateral economic sanctions iran libya and sudan title ix also codifies june 2000 administration decision to allow unlicensed agricultural sales to north korea agricultural sales to cuba under separate policy announced in may 1999 have been restricted only to private and nongovernmental entities the inclusion of cuba in the proposal generated considerable controversy and delayed enactment of the usda spending bill until late in the session supporters of the proposed changes argued that sanctions were rarely effective and that maintaining them against cuba which many see as sizable potential market for us agricultural sales harms the us agricultural sector they argued that opening up trade with cuba which has been subject to comprehensive us embargo since 1962 would be way to pursue constructive engagement policy with that country opponents countered that an exemption would undercut us policy designed to keep maximum pressure on the castro government until political and economic reforms were attained strong differences of opinion on this issue twice delayed house movement of its measure until both sides reached compromise in late september the house compromise differed from senate language passed without change on july 20 in specifically prohibiting private financing of us agricultural sales to cuba placing more restrictions on sales on that country compared to the other sanctioned countries and codifying rules on travel to cuba in conference action members adopted the house position after some debate the clinton administration in principle has favored exempting food and medicine for humanitarian reasons from broad sanctions measures it did express concern though that the final language unduly limits the presidents flexibility in conducting future foreign policy reduces the prospect of food sales to cuba and constrains peopletopeople travel to cuba for more information see crs issue brief ib10061 exempting food and agriculture products from us economic sanctions current issues and proposals and economic sanctions and agricultural exports in the crs electronic briefing book on trade useu issues biotechnology issues disputes over genetically engineered crops and foods which contain them threaten to disrupt useuropean agricultural trade generally referred to as genetically modified organisms or gmos in trade discussions such crops and products are focus of disputes over differences in approval procedures and on whether there is need to label gmo products underlying the disputes are pronounced useu disagreements over the environmental effects of gmos and the safety of gm foods crs9 crops produced from gmos are rapidly being introduced into us agriculture especially crops for export such as corn soybeans and cotton acceptance of gmos in the eu and other markets for us agricultural products is thus critical for us producers and exporters us consumers generally have not questioned the health or safety of gm foods although some us consumer groups have called for labeling the us national academy of sciences environmentalists and others have called for paying more attention to the environmental effects of gm crops conversely in the eu broad coalition of environmentalists consumer groups and some scientists argue that the longterm effects of gmos on health and the environment are unknown and not scientifically established these interest groups argue that caution should be exercised in approving and regulating gm crops and foods until their effects are known with certainty the us approval process for gmos has facilitated their introduction into the us food system the us position has been that gm foods are different from nongm foods thus existing regulations for approving them are appropriate and adequate the eu however maintains separate and longer regulatory system for approving gmos and also requires mandatory labels for products containing gmos labeling is not required in the united states except when there is significant difference between the conventional and the gm product or if the gm product poses health risk in may 2000 the president announced that fda would be developing guidelines for voluntary labeling of gm products the eu council of ministers instituted on june 2425 1999 facto moratorium on any new approvals of gmo crops while new approval and regulatory framework is established this new process will become effective in 2001 in 2000 the eu commission proposed to accelerate the implementation of new approval procedures but met resistance from some eu member countries the prospect of an effective approval process is attractive to many proponents of gmo crops because under the present system new gmo crops are being approved however some harbor doubts about the ability of the eu to overcome apparent strong consumer and environmental resistance to gmos even with more effective and scientifically based system such doubts may have contributed to recent decisions by major us agribusiness firms to ask suppliers to begin separating gmo and nongmo corn and soybean products the 106th congress played major role in the domestic debate on regulation and labeling of gm foods as constituencies for competing viewpoints sought legislative support s 2080 and hr 3377 were introduced to require that food that contains genetically engineered material or that is produced with genetically engineered material be labeled accordingly also introduced were hr 3883 and s 2315 to levy user fees on firms seeking approval for gm foods to pay for food and drug administration fda safety reviews and ban gm foods likely to cause allergic reactions hr 4627 and s 2838 each would have required the development of program to tell consumers about the scientific basis of the safety of foods produced with biotechnology and fund research to address economic and environmental impacts of biotechnology on the food supply another bill hr 5095 would have required usda acting through the national academy of sciences to study and report what type of tests are needed to assess human health risks what type of monitoring system is needed to assess the long term effects of consumption of gm crs10 foods and what federal structure is needed to ensure that these foods are safe s 3184 was proposed to require developers of gm foods to consult with fda increase fdas authority to review these foods and monitor more closely imported foods it also calls for registry of gm foods that have been approved and for information about restrictions if any applied to their use several bills introduced in the 106th congress reflected the views of opponents of stricter regulation and labeling and of those concerned that regulations in other countries may become trade barriers hr 817 s 19 s 101 and s 566 would have required us trade negotiators to address any unjustified restrictions or commercial requirements affecting new technologies including biotechnologies in the next round of trade negotiations for more information see crs report 98861 useuropean agricultural trade food safety and biotechnology issues and biotechnology and agricultural trade in the crs electronic briefing book on trade banana dispute wto dispute arbitration panel has ruled that the eus preferential regime for importing bananas violates wto rules and that the united states has the right to retaliate against the eu by imposing prohibitive duties on almost 200 million in eu imports the eu indicated its acceptance of the wto ruling but the united states and other complainant countries have rejected eu proposals for altering the banana import regime the united states criticized eu proposals for continuing to discriminate against latin american bananas regarding license allocations and tariff preferences but has not reinstituted wto dispute settlement proceedings attention in both the united states and the eu has focused on finding solution to this longrunning dispute and the effects of the ruling on banana exporters in developing countries is factor complicating matters has been internal disagreement among eu members themselves on how to resolve the issue while many in the 106th congress supported the us approach to the banana issue in the wto because of its implications for dispute settlement some members indicated that the banana decision would harm developing countries that depend on bananas for export earnings legislation reflecting this point of view hr 1361 was introduced but not passed in the 106th congress it would have barred the united states from retaliating against the eu because of its failure to comply with the wtos decision on the other hand the african growth and opportunity act pl 106200 see above requires the administration to increase pressure on the eu to comply with the wto decisions on bananas and beef see below by rotating the lists of products subject to retaliatory tariffs the administration had not yet announced the new lists when the 106th congress adjourned for more information see crs report rs20130 the useuropean banana dispute and useu banana dispute in the crs electronic briefing book on trade crs11 meat hormone dispute wto dispute settlement panels have ruled that an eu ban in place since 1989 on imports of meat derived from animals treated with growth hormones is inconsistent with the uruguay round agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures the sps agreement the wto panels agreed with the us argument that the ban lacks scientific justification left open the option for the eu to conduct risk assessment of hormonetreated meat and gave the eu until may 13 1999 to bring its hormone measure into compliance with sps rules the eu did not meet this deadline citing studies that it contends raise human health questions about the use of such hormones the eu said it would maintain the ban while continuing risk assessment in response the united states in may 1999 stated that it would seek to impose economic sanctions on eu products valued at 202 million wto panel agreed that sanctions were warranted but in july 1999 set the value subject to sanctions at 1168 million the united states then announced the list of agricultural goods on which the 100 tariffs would be imposed effective july 29 1999 the commission of the european union has proposed continuing the eu ban on imports of beef produced with hormones the commission made its proposal following recommendation by an eu scientific committee that concluded that one of the growth hormones in use 17 betaoestrodiaol is carcinogenic and should be banned completely while five others were determined to have possible but unproven health risks and should be provisionally banned some expect that the eu will use these scientific conclusions to reintroduce the issue in wto dispute settlement us officials claim however that much of the evidence in the eu study has already been considered and rejected by the wto the eu did lift threat to ban the import of all us meats as result of inadequate residue testing and standards for ensuring that meat is hormone free the eu has indicated that this decision which clears the way for hormonefree meat exports would facilitate negotiations to reduce the 117 million retaliation list imposed for the eus refusal to accept imports of hormonetreated meat the eu would presumably offer increased market access for hormonefree meat as compensation for not importing hormonetreated meat some in the us meat industry have been cool to the idea arguing that imports of hormonefree meat would not be adequate to compensate for losses incurred due to the eus ban on hormone treated meat as 2000 was coming to close discussions were ongoing between the united states and the eu over possible resolutions to this dispute see crs report rs20142 the european unions ban on hormonetreated meat and useu meat hormone dispute in the crs electronic briefing book on trade agricultural export and food aid programs the 1996 federal agricultural improvement and reform fair act pl104 127 authorized several usda programs that 1 subsidize agricultural exports 2 develop foreign markets for us farm products 3 guarantee commercial financing crs12 of exports and 4 finance concessional sales or donate commodities to lowincome developing countries export subsidies are the export enhancement program eep used mainly to subsidize wheat oilseeds and other bulk commodities and the dairy export incentive program deip usda export promotion programs are the market access program map and the foreign market development fmdp cooperator program map which can fund brand name product promotion is often target of budget cutters who consider it corporate welfare export credit guarantees are authorized at 55 billion the value of exports financed under the program not the outlays incurred credit guarantees have been used extensively to finance us agricultural exports to asian countries that experienced financial and economic difficulties food aid programs include pl 480 concessional credit and donations food for progress mainly donations and section 416 donations food aid programs have also been used to finance or donate us agricultural exports to russia some financially stressed asian countries such as indonesia and several foodshort countries such as north korea many lawmakers support these programs especially when demand for us agricultural exports is weak as in the current international economic environment they view the programs as helping maintain agricultural exports in markets which are experiencing slow economic growth others contend that some programs are corporate welfare that should be eliminated unsuccessful legislation reflecting this latter point of view hr 1470 would have repealed both eep and map some us trading partners have criticized recent large us food aid shipments alleging that they are used to reduce surpluses and increase domestic us prices rather than meet international food needs us food aid shipments have not yet however been challenged as trade distorting in multilateral trade dispute settlement proceedings the programs and their operation have been reviewed at congressional hearings including those held by the house and senate agriculture committees on june 21 and july 18 2000 respectively although funding for most export and food aid programs is determined by their authorizing statutes annual spending is provided through appropriations the presidents fy2001 budget plan released february 7 2000 proposed program level of 58 billion for these activities usdas fy2001 appropriation pl 106 387 hr 4461 signed october 28 2000 generally supports this program level also see crs report rl30501 appropriations for fy2001 us department of agriculture and related agencies and crs issue brief ib98006 agricultural export and food aid programs countryoforigin labeling federal law requires most imports including many food items to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin various bills were introduced into the 106th congress to impose expanded countryoforigin labeling crs13 requirements on meats and on several other agricultural products however none were passed such proposals have attracted attention for number of reasons one is that they are viewed by some advocates as way to help us producers dealing with low farm prices also some perceive that food products from certain countries might pose greater risks than those from the united states proponents of the bills contended that additional country labeling requirements would enable consumers to know the source of retail food offerings and employ that knowledge in selecting their purchases opponents countered that countryoforigin labeling bears relation to food safety and would not raise us commodity prices they argued that it would impose excessive and costly regulatory burdens on retailers and others in the marketing system and on consumers be difficult to enforce and by imposing new nontariff trade barriers undermine ongoing us efforts to reduce other countries trade barriers and expand international markets for us products for more information see crs report 97508 enr countryoforigin labeling for foods current law and proposed changes updated december 1 2000 for other versions of this document
