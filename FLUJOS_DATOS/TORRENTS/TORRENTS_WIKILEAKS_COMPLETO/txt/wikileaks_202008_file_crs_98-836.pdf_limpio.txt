longstanding customs thereby giving it flexibility in setting its floor agenda this report first treats those processes or customs most often used by the senate and then discusses some procedures less often used to call up measures this report will be revised as events warrant see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml for more information on legislative process

senator may offer the necessary agendasetting motions to proceed to the consideration of bill or resolution or item of executive business however by longestablished custom only the majority leader or designee offer agendasetting motions items called up are generally those on the senates legislative or executive calendars either reported by committee or placed on the calendar directly under rule xiv see crs report rs22309 senate rule xiv procedures for placing measures directly on the senate calendar by michael l koempel

from senators to their party floor leaders that they intend to object to any unanimous consent request to bring matter up for consideration on the senate floor holds also serve to identify controversial bills or controversial items within bill see crs report 98712 holds in the senate by walter j oleszek leaders also invite senators to file requests to be consulted with the staff of the respective party secretaries through these requests senators join in talks about compromise versions of bills and potential amendments about the senates floor schedule and conditions of floor action when consulted senators longer report any concerns bill is said to have cleared both sides of the aisle such bills are generally called up by unanimous consent considered and agreed to by voice vote this informal process has virtually ended calendar calls provided for in rules vii and viii through negotiations inherent in the hold and consultation process floor leaders can often get senators to agree to take up bill despite the reservations some have about key provisions in it thus usually the majority leader or his designee will ask unanimous consent to proceed to the consideration of measure pending on the senate calendar alternatively the majority leader may move to proceed to the consideration of the measure or matter normally this motion is debatable debate on the motion can be ended only by unanimous consent or by invoking cloture if the motion to proceed is agreed to consideration of the bill begins without debate limits unless also imposed by unanimous consent or cloture there are limited circumstances in which motion to proceed is not debatable motions to take up certain privileged items of business discussed in the next section are not debatable debate is also prohibited on motions to proceed offered on the beginning of new legislative day during the morning hour after the completion of morning business rule viii under that procedure the motion to proceed is not debatable if agreed to the measure becomes the pending business before the senate at the end of the morning hour any unfinished legislative business pending on the previous day when the senate adjourned will displace the measure just taken up the non debatable motion to proceed under rule vii poses many parliamentary difficulties and is t

new legislative day and the morning hour with stipulation that nondebatable motion to proceed will be in order g17g157g145g142g155g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561

among the items of privileged business are general appropriations bills budget resolutions reconciliation bills conference reports measures to resolve election contests and measures to impose disciplinary sanctions against senators motions to go into executive session to consider executive business items on the senate executive calendar typically nominations and treaties are also privileged and nondebatable g21g153g142g140g146g138g149g561g17g155g141g142g155g156g561 on the motion of any senator measure or matter can be made special order of business at some future specified date such motions are rare ly used because they are debatable without limit and need twothirds vote for approval

considering resolution immediately when offered the resolution goes over until the start of the next legislative day such resolutions are automatically laid before the senate during morning business on the next legislative day unless unanimous consent request provides otherwise items pending at the end of morning business return to the calendar and can be called up later by motion or unanimous consent g6g146g156g140g145g138g155g144g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151g561 motions to discharge committees from the further consideration of any measure or matter for example nomination or treaty must lie over for one day and debate on the motion is not limited g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 christopher m davis analyst on the
