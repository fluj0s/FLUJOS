individual income tax rates also referred to as statutory marginal tax rates are the rates of tax applicable to the last marginal increment of taxable income statutory rates play an important role in determining the effective or real depending on the naming convention marginal tax rates which affect taxpayers economic behavior developments since enactment of the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 are the most relevant to the current state of affairs since then the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 pl 101508 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 and the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 and its extensions all changed the marginal income tax rate structure under current law upon expiration of tax cuts enacted in 2001 through 2008 the rate structure will revert in 2011 to the one set by obra93 the six marginal income tax rates for 2009 are 10 15 25 28 33 and 35 specific types of income such as capital gains may be subject to different sets of marginal tax rates the alternative minimum tax system amt parallel tax system which has recently garnered considerable attention also has different set of parameters since 1981 congress established and expanded with slight modifications the policy of tax indexation tax indexation helps prevent automatic tax increases and unintended changes in the distribution of the tax burden due to inflation under current law many key components of the tax structure are indexed for inflation such components include the tax rate brackets the personal exemptions and their phaseout thresholds standard deductions the itemized deduction limitation threshold and others not all elements of the tax system however are currently adjusted for inflation one of the examples is the amt this report summarizes information about the tax brackets and other key elements of the tax system that determine taxpayers statutory marginal tax rates such elements

tax rates and other elements of the tax system 1988 through 2009 various concepts of tax rates and distinctions among them statutory individual income tax rates also referred to as statutory marginal tax rates are the rates of tax prescribed by law that are applicable to the last marginal increment of taxable income for many policymakers and taxpayers the level of statutory marginal tax rates is one of the most conspicuous features of the tax system it is important to distinguish between real or effective and statutory rates while they sound confusingly similar each designates very different economic concept statutory rates are simply the tax rates written into law for specified tiers of taxable income real marginal tax rates are the rates that actually apply to the last marginal increment of income real and statutory marginal tax rates may diverge considerably for some taxpayers but in many cases they do coincide and in many others they are interconnected1 for example some taxpayers facing 10 statutory rate were subject to real marginal rate in excess of 31 at the same time most taxpayers face effective marginal rates of 15 percent or less2 often coinciding or nearly coinciding with the statutory rate some of the elements of the tax system that give rise to the difference between the real and statutory rates include the earned income tax credit eitc phaseins and phaseouts3 the alternative minimum tax amt4 the phaseouts of personal exemptions and deductions5 and other provisions 1 for more information see us congressional budget office effective marginal tax

the federal individual income tax by gregg esenwein crs2 economists believe that taxpayers change their behavior in response to effective real not statutory marginal tax rates it means that when deciding say whether to work more taxpayers consider by how much their real aftertax income would actually change as result of this decision the concept may be extended beyond individual income tax to an overall tax or even overall fiscal system which includes other federal and subfederal taxes and payments6 this broader analysis however goes beyond the scope of this report in contrast average tax rates describe the total tax burden but do not directly affect individuals economic decisionmaking average tax rates express total tax liability as percentage of income unlikemarginal variables they do not reflect how taxpayers economic position change in response to his or her actions major legislation affecting the statutory rates over the past decades there have been several major changes in federal individual statutory marginal income tax rates the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 is starting point from which the modern tax structure evolved tra86 among other things created tax rate structure that consisted of just two statutory individual income tax rates 15 and 28 however tra86 also legislated 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households which effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 pl 101508 eliminated the 5percent surcharge and created marginal tax rate structure consisting of three statutory marginal tax rates of 15 28 and 31 however obra90 also contained provision limiting the amount of itemized deductions that upperincome households could claim and provision modifying the phaseout of the tax benefits of personal exemptions for upperincome households these provisions increased effective marginal tax rates over the statutory marginal tax rates for affected taxpayers the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 added two new marginal income tax brackets at 36 and 396 rates at the upper end of the income scale it also delayed indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year in addition obra93 made permanent the limitation on itemized deductions and the phaseout of the personal exemption the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 created new 10 marginal income tax bracket it also reduced the top four marginal tax rates to 25 28 33 and 35 with the changes phasedin over the period 2001 through 2006 additional provisions of the act affected tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher income taxpayers the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 6 for an example of such analysis see s d holt and j l romich 2007 marginal tax rates facing low and moderateincome workers who participate in meanstested transfer programs national tax journal vol 60 2 june 2007 p 253 crs3 10827 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 wftra pl 108311 accelerated and extended the tax rate reductions originally enacted under egtrra7 under current law however most of these changes are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 the following sections of this report describe each of these major acts in more detail tax reform act of 1986 among its many changes the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 instituted rather simple marginal tax rate structure for tax years after 1987 it consisted of two statutory tax rates 15 and 28 table 3 shows the elements of the 1988 tax structure these rates applied to capital income as well as to labor income by comparison in 1986 there had been 14 nonzero marginal tax brackets and the top statutory marginal tax rate reached 508 although the tra86 specified that there were only two statutory individual marginal income tax rates it also adopted 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households this surcharge effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 28 statutory marginal tax rate plus 5 surcharge because the surcharge was first phased in and then phased out as incomes increased marginal tax rates rose to 33 but then fell back to 28 producing what came to be known as the tax rate bubble the surcharge was adopted so that the tra86 would not change the distribution of the income tax burden relative to its distribution under pre1986 tax law and would meet the revenue targets the surcharge allowed for characterization of the tra86 as having only two statutory marginal tax rates while meeting these other goals the surcharge was designed to eliminate the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket and the tax benefits of the personal exemptions for upperincome households for joint returns in 1988 the phaseout of the 15 tax rate started when taxable income exceeded 71900 and ended when taxable income reached 149250 and the phase out of the exemptions followed from that point on for single returns the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket occurred over the taxable income range of 47050 to 97620 for heads of households the phaseout occurred over the taxable income range of 67200 to 134930 the phaseout of the exemptions followed the phase out of the 15 tax bracket for all filing statuses but the range of income over which it occurred depended on the number of exemptions claimed by taxpayer to demonstrate how the 5 surcharge worked to phase out the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket consider the following example based on joint returns for 7 for more details see crs report rl34425 expiration and extension of the individual income tax cuts enacted in 2001 through 2007 by maxim shvedov 8 for historical rates and brackets in 1986 and other years see tax policy center tax facts individual income tax brackets 19452008 excel file at httptaxpolicycenterorgtaxfactscontentexcelindividual_ratesxls crs4 1988 the difference between taxing the first 29750 of taxable income at 28 instead of 15 was 386750 obtained as 29750 multiplied by 13 the difference between 28 and 15 five percent of the difference between the upper and lower phaseout limits was also 386750 149250 less 71900 multiplied by 5 hence assessing the 5 surcharge on taxable income between 78400 and 162770 was equivalent to having taxed the first 32450 of taxable income at 28 rather than 15 5 surcharge was also used to phase out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upperincome households in 1988 each personal exemption was worth 1950 and produced tax savings for household in the 28 marginal tax rate bracket of 546 1950 times 28 to recapture this tax savings 5 surcharge was assessed against 10920 of taxable income for each personal exemption claimed 5 surcharge against this amount of taxable income increased tax liability by 546 10920 times 5 which exactly offset the tax savings from the personal exemption the phaseout of personal exemptions started immediately after the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket and the phaseout of each exemption occurred sequentially this meant that the taxable income range over which the 5 surcharge offset personal exemptions depended on the number of personal exemptions claimed on the tax return for example on joint return claiming two personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxable income between 149250 and 171090 149250 plus two times 10920 on joint return with four personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxable income between 149250 and 192930 149250 plus four times 10920 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 pl 101508 created threetiered statutory marginal income tax rate structure with rates of 15 28 and 31 effective in tax years beginning in 1991 as shown in table 5 obra90 eliminated the tax bubble created under tra86 but replaced it with limitation on itemized deductions and new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upperincome households obra90 reintroduced taxrate differential on capital gains income obra90 contained provision which limited the tax on capital gains income to maximum of 28 this provision was effective starting in tax year 1991 under tra86 capital gains had been treated as ordinary income and taxed at regular rates of up to 33 the obra90 limitation on itemized deductions worked as follows for tax years starting in 1991 otherwise allowable deductions were reduced by 3 of the amount by which taxpayers adjusted gross income agi exceeded 100000 or 50000 in the case of married couples filing separate returns for example in 1991 if taxpayers agi was 110000 then his otherwise allowable itemized deductions would be reduced by 300 110000 less 100000 times 3 this provision effectively raised the marginal income tax rate of those taxpayers affected by approximately one percentage point dollar of income in excess of 100000 was crs5 taxed as if it were 103 since in addition to the tax on an extra dollar of income the taxpayer lost tax deductions by giving up 003 of itemized deductions this limitation was scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 under obra90 but was later extended allowable deductions for medical expenses casualty and theft losses and investment interest were not subject to this limitation for tax years after 1991 the 100000 threshold was indexed for inflation the phaseout of the tax benefits of the personal exemption worked as follows each personal exemption was phased out by factor of 2 for each 2500 or fraction thereof by which taxpayers agi exceeded given threshold amount in 1991 the threshold amount for joint return was 150000 for single return the threshold was 100000 and for heads of households the threshold was 125000 for example in 1991 joint household whose agi was 183000 would lose 28 of their total personal exemptions claimed the agi amount in excess of the threshold in this instance would be 33000 183000 agi less 150000 threshold limit the 33000 excess divided by 2500 would produce factor of 132 which when rounded up would equal 14 this figure is multiplied by 2 to arrive at the final disallowance amount of 28 hence if the family had claimed two personal exemptions which at 2150 each would total 4300 they would only be allowed to deduct 3096 4300 total personal exemptions less the 1204 disallowance which is 28 of the total for tax years after 1991 these income threshold amounts were indexed for inflation the personal exemptions phaseout provision was also scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 made several changes in the individual marginal income tax rate structure first it added two new marginal tax rates 36 and 396 at the upper end of the income spectrum the 396 marginal tax rate bracket was created by imposing 10 surtax on highincome taxpayers 39636 36 which is 10 of 36 although obra93 was enacted in august of 1993 the increase in the top marginal tax rates was made effective retroactively to january 1 1993 affected taxpayers however were not assessed penalties for underpayment of 1993 taxes resulting from the tax rate increase taxpayers were also allowed to pay any additional 1993 taxes in three equal installments over twoyear period second obra93 delayed indexation of the new top marginal income tax brackets for one year hence the nominal dollar tax brackets for the 36 and 396 marginal tax rates remained at the same level for both tax years 1993 and 1994 finally obra93 made permanent both the itemized deduction limitation and the phaseout of the tax benefits from personal exemptions crs6 economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 made several major changes to the marginal tax rate structure many of the acts provisions were set to phasein over period of time but subsequent 2003 and 2004 legislation described in the next section overrode the schedule originally set by egtrra table 1 shows the time line of changes related to the marginal tax rate structure enacted under egtrra and subsequent bills discussed below first the 2001 act created new 10 bracket it applied beginning in tax year 2002 to the first 12000 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly the first 10000 of taxable income for heads of households and the first 6000 of taxable income for single individuals for tax year 2001 the act created rate reduction tax credit mimicking the effects of the 10 tax rate bracket for most taxpayers9 in tax years 20032007 these provisions of egtrra were superseded by subsequent legislation in 2008 egtrra set the 10 marginal tax rate bracket at 7000 and 14000 for single and married taxpayers respectively starting with tax year 2009 these bracket amounts are scheduled to be indexed for inflation second the 2001 act gradually reduced the top four marginal income tax rates under prior income tax law the top four marginal tax rates were 28 31 36 and 396 when fully phased in the 2001 act reduced the top four marginal income tax rates to 25 28 33 and 35 under egtrra the reductions were scheduled to take place in 2001 through 2006 but subsequent legislation accelerated the egtrra phasein schedule third egtrra also repealed the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for highincome taxpayers the repeal was scheduled to be phased in between 2006 and 2009 the limitation was completely repealed for 2010 but it would reappear again in 2011 once the egtrras tax cuts expire fourth some of the acts measures designed to reduce the marriage penalty affected the rate bracket structure the act increased the width of the 15 tax bracket for married couples filing joint returns to twice the width of the 15 tax bracket for single returns under egtrra this provision was scheduled for phase in over fouryear time period starting in 2005 but subsequent legislation accelerated this time line under egtrra the end point of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns was scheduled to be 180 of the end point of the 15 tax bracket for single returns in 2005 187 in 2006 193 in 2007 and 200 in 2008 and subsequent years10 9 for more information see crs report rs21171 the rate reduction tax credit the tax rebate in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 brief explanation by steven maguire 10 for more information on these changes see crs report rl34425 expiration and continued crs7 finally the 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the size of the standard deduction for single returns the change was scheduled to be phased in over fiveyear period 2005 to 2009 but it was accelerated by the subsequent bills as well this had an effect as far as tax rate brackets were concerned of raising the lower threshold of the lowest tax bracket for married taxpayers filing joint returns jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 among the several acts extending provisions in egtrra the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 wftra pl 108311 directly affected statutory income tax rates jgtrra accelerated several changes to the individual income tax rate structure first enacted under egtrra it moved forward to 2003 the tax rate reductions expansion in the 10 tax bracket and widening of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns to twice the width of the 15 tax bracket for single returns under egtrra some of these changes would not have been fully phased in until 2009 wftra extended several tax provisions of the jgtrra that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2004 among other things the wftra extended the increase in the 10 income tax bracket through 2007 at which point egtrras relevant provisions were fully phased in maintaining constant level of the tax relief the 2004 act also extended marriage penalty relief through 2008 the standard deduction and 15 tax bracket for joint returns were set at twice their level for single returns in 2009 and 2010 egtrra provisions apply maintaining the same level of tax relief both acts also established more preferential treatment of longterm capital gains and dividends they reduced the tax rates applicable to these kinds of income to 15 or even 0 for certain taxpayers 10 continued extension of the

nominal dollar basis produces automatic tax increases and unintended changes in the distribution of the tax burden it occurs because nominal incomes rise faster than the real incomes leading to heavier tax burden imposed on taxpayers compared to what lawmakers intended at the time of their policy considerations the federal individual income tax system in the united states is progressive that is as incomes rise income tax liabilities as share of income also rise in addition the income tax is calculated on the basis of current dollar amounts absent periodic indexation of the tax system elements larger share of taxpayers would be subject to higher tax liabilities simply because their nominal income increased regardless of how their real income had changed the effects of inflation on income tax liabilities could be substantial even in periods of low inflation such as the last two decades still according to the bureau of labor statistics 1000 in 1989 is worth about 1707 or almost 71 more in 200811 yeartoyear changes might appear negligible but over period of several years it compounds to make substantial difference consider hypothetical example of what lack of indexation would have implied for taxpayer if the 1989 tax structure applied without indexation in 2008 for illustration consider fourperson family with adjusted gross income agi of 35000 in 1989 rounded up 1989 family median income of 34213 according to the census12 if we assume that the family used the standard deduction then its taxable income would have been 21800 35000 less standard deduction of 5200 and four personal exemptions at 2000 apiece and the tax liability 3270 this translates into an aftertax income of 31730 35000 less 3270 or an average tax rate of 93 3270 divided by 35000 income now consider what would have happened in 2008 if this familys nominal income just kept up with inflation the agi would have been approximately 60000 if the tax structure were not indexed for inflation the familys taxable income would have been 46800 the tax liability would have increased to approximately 9081 in current 2008 dollars or 5319 in constant 1989 dollars 9081 adjusted for cumulative inflation of about 71 this would represent tax liability increase of 63 in real terms the familys aftertax income would be 50919 in current 2008 dollars or 29826 in constant 1989 dollars 50919 adjusted for the cumulative inflation of about 71 decrease of 6 its average tax rate would have increased from 93 to 151 11 bls cpi inflation calculator web page at httpdatablsgovcgibincpicalcpl 12 us census historical income tables families table f5 race and hispanic origin of householder families by median and mean income 1947 to 2005 web page at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwincomehistincf05html crs10 this example illustrates how this familys real aftertax income declined by 6 because of the socalled bracket creep its income tax burden increased by 63 in real terms between 1989 and 2008 this effect would be even more pronounced in the periods of high inflation under an indexed tax system the family would have experienced change in their real aftertax income for instance under an indexed system the value of the standard deduction for joint return would have increased from 5200 in 1989 to 8877 in 2008 the personal exemption would have increased from 2000 to 3414 under these circumstances the familys 2008 taxable income would have been 37465 60000 income less standard deduction and personal exemptions tax brackets would have adjusted as well based on this taxable income and the adjusted brackets their income tax liability would have been 5620 in current 2008 dollars or 3291 in constant 1989 dollars about the same as in 1989 the difference is due to rounding in short the nominal amounts might be different but real values would have stayed the same for this family congress enacted income tax indexation as part of an overall package of statutory marginal tax rate reductions contained in the economic recovery tax act of l981 the congress believed that automatic tax increases resulting from the effects of inflation were unfair to taxpayers since their tax burden as percentage of income could increase during intervals between tax reduction legislation with an adverse effect on incentives to work and invest in addition the federal government was provided with an automatic increase in its aggregate revenue which in turn created pressure for further spending13 there was very little debate about this aspect of the bill the act specified which elements of the tax system were subject to indexation over the years as the tax system changed additional elements entered the list the list of the indexed elements of the tax system has been gradually expanding over the years for example one of the most notable changes occurred with the passage of the tra86 which extended indexation to some of the newly created elements of the tax system such as the additional standard deductions for the elderly and the blind the eitc and others more recently egtrra applied indexing to the eitc phaseout amounts in 2008 table 2 lists major indexed tax items and provides the year of the first adjustment14 for some provisions the technicalities are too complex to be listed in table format for example as mentioned above indexing of some elements of the eitc started in 2008 while others have been indexed since the late 1980s 13 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 jcs7181 dec 31 1981 as redistributed by cch

impacting individuals indexing might make the tax system somewhat more technically complex but this is minor complication the yeartoyear changes in dollar amounts are usually small so taxpayers hardly ever face unexpected changes that might materially affect them on the revenue side indexing results in lower government receipts some elements of the tax system are not adjusted for inflation or are only partially adjusted for example most of the amounts related to the child tax credit are not adjusted for inflation including the amount of the credit itself or phaseout thresholds for higherincome taxpayers the earned income floor used in calculating the credits refundable amount is adjusted for inflation however15 in recent years problem caused by the lack of indexation of the alternative minimum tax amt parameters has garnered considerable attention of the policymakers and the public because of the fastgrowing number of taxpayers that could be affected by the amt the amt is an alternative income tax system originally intended to affect only highincome taxpayers amts parameters are not 15 in 2008 the amount of the threshold was set by special provision of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 but this provision is effective only for single year crs12 adjusted for inflation with the passage of time as nominal incomes of taxpayers rose across the board the amt affected larger number of taxpayers at broader range of income levels it is estimated that absent congressional action the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase from over 1 million in 2001 to about 26 million in 2008 and almost 36 million in 201716 in recent years congress has adjusted amt parameters to avoid this in series of oneyear adjustments but at this point it is not clear how this ongoing issue will be resolved in the long term17 while the amt is currently the most notable problem caused by the lack of indexation the amt exemptions are not the only parameters in the tax system not adjusted for inflation therefore it is conceivable that lack of indexation may pose new complications in other areas of the tax system in the future the mechanics of indexation most provisions are indexed using the technical calculation described below the methodology is the same although specific parameters may vary by provision in some instances the calculation methodology differs somewhat in one way or another such examples include the eitc or transportation benefits the variations are insignificant from an economic standpoint as long as they do not result in systematic deviations from the rate of inflation the adjustment for any given tax year is based on the percentage amount by which the average consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu for the 12 month period ending on august 31 of the preceding year exceeds the average cpiu during specified twelve month base period the base period differs depending upon the tax component under consideration as listed in table 2 with the exception of the eitc and some other instances inflation adjustments are currently rounded down to the nearest multiple of 50 although rounding down affects the accuracy of any given years inflation adjustment the effect is not cumulative since each years adjustment is calculated to reflect the entire amount of inflation that has occurred between the adjustment year and the base period for example the adjustment factor for the standard deductions in 2008 was calculated as follows the average cpiu for the base period september 1987 through august 1988 was 11662 the average cpiu for the period september 2006 through august 2007 was 20487 given these amounts the inflation adjustment factor for 2008 was 176 2048711662 16 us congress joint
