jurisdiction of the lhhsed bill see appendix b scope of the lhhsed bill page 50 for separate descri ption of terrorism funding see appendix c terrorism funding in the lhhsed bill page 53 the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the 13 regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion and stem cell research this bill provides most of th discretionary funds for th ree federal departments and several related agencies including the social security administration ssa of the 13 annual appropriations bills the lhhsed bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs for fy2002 the lhhsed bill accounted for 1246 billion 179 and the defense

appropriations bills has become topic of contention between the adminis tration and the congress and the issue extends to lhhsed projects in some instances lhhsed appropriations are earmarked for specific recipients or locati ons either in the public law or in the conference report for the most part the authorizing statute gives the general purpose for such earmarks such as pro jects for the improvement of postsecondary education but subsequently an appropriations act or conference report designates specific recipients by means of earmarks such designations usually bypass standard administrative procedures for an agencys competitive distribution of awards for fy2002 pl 107116 conference report h rept 107342 included an estimated 1600 earmarks for specific projects fo r which an estimated 10 billion was appropriated as shown in table 2 the fy2002 lhhsed appropriation was 4118 billion in aggregate and represented 1276 billion for current year discretionary funds these earmarks theref ore represent 02 of the lhhsed total and 08 of the discretionary lhhs ed total in fy 2002 the pr esident proposed the elimination of c ongressional earmarks in appr opriations for each of the past 2 years but the congress has conti nued this practice the president again proposed the abolition of earmark s in the fy2003 budget requesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31303crs12 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annua l lhhsed appropriations is usually determined through twostag congressional budget process in the first stage the congress agrees to overall spending totals in the annual concurre nt resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among committees usually through the statement of managers for th conference report on the budget resolution these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include the discretionary totals available to the house and senate appropriations committees for enactment in annual appropriations th house and the senate c onsidered budget resolutions for fy2003 hconres 353 and sconres 100 but they have not yet reached an agreement for legislative details see related legislation page 44 for procedural information see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process and for discussion of possible alternative actions if the congress fails to agree to budget resolution see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 annual appropriations bills thes amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allocations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment despite the lack of housesenate agreement on the fy2003 budget resolution the initial 302b allocations for the fy2003 lhhsed appropriations bills were announced by the appr opriations committees during the 107th congress as shown in table 3 comparable amounts for fy2002 and the presidents fy2003 budget are also shown subject to scor ekeeping

advance appropriations occur when fundi ng enacted in one fiscal year cannot be spent until subsequent fi scal year see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding for example pl 107 116 which enacted fy2002 lhhsed ppropriations provided 380 million for the corporation for public broadcastin g cpb for use in fy2004 the enactment of advance appropriations can be undertak to meet several objectives these include the provision of longterm budget information to agencies and other recipients such as state and local educati onal systems to enable better planning of future program activities nd personnel levels the mo re contentious aspect of advance appropriations however is that they avoid the 302a and 302b allocation ceilings for the current year however such funding must be counted in the year in which it first becomes available thereby using up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in futu re years for an example of the impact of advance appropriations on program administration see the discussion below in the section on ed page 34 the fy1999 and fy2000 annual lhhsed appropriations bills provided significant increases in advance appropria tions for discretionary programs from fy2000 to fy2002 these amounts stabilized at approximately 19 billion or about 15 of lhhsed discretionary appropria tions for fy2002 the presidents budget proposed the elimination of advance ppropriations for federal discretionary programs including those for lhhsed programs the congress rejected that proposal and continued the funding of advance appropriations for fy2003 the presidents request would slightly re duce advance appropriations for lhhsed programs hr 246 would maintain the fy2002 level the senate bill as passed would increase the amount to 230 billion and the final bill increases advance appropriations to 215 billion from fy1998 to the present the annual amounts of advance appropriations in lhhsed

from spending at rate that would have impinged on the final fy2003 funding decisions1 what were the implications of continuing resolutions for lhhsed programs some agencies may have experienced complications in program operations and grants administration for programs with high spendout rates early in the fiscal year for example the impact aid program lower rates may have been required until final funding was enacted discretionary grants programs may have had the entire grants process put on hold until regular funding became available programs for which large increases were anticipated in fy2003 ch as those at nih delayed grants for new projects while continuing resolution was in effect for the large increases proposed for hhs bioterrori sm research and developm ent programs to support homeland security funding was not ava ilable to pport such fforts under continuing resolution most education fo rmula grants and some job training funds would not have been affected until july 1 2003

gran ts has been continuing issue the program provides assistance to undergra duate students based on financial need aggregate program costs depend largely on the maximum award and the number ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31303crs33 student recipients the maximum award is currently set when appropriations are enacted usually well before the start of the program year the number of student awards however cannot be determined until the final award is claimed this final accounting takes place after most decisions have been made on the following years appropriations funding shortfalls for pell grants are not new the senate appropriations committee states that shortfa lls have occurred in 6 of the past 12 years srept 107156 p 75 may 29 2002 appropriations for pell gran ts make funds available for 2 full fiscal years to provide administrative flexibility regarding potential shortfalls and surpluses under this provision shortfall in one fiscal ear can be reimbursed with funds obtained from the following fiscal year similarly surplus can be carried forward and used in the following year currently some fy2002 funds are needed to make up projected fy2001 shortfall for which final accounting should occur sometime in fy2003 fy2002 funds used for the fy2001 shor tfall will not be available to make awards for the 20022003 academic year as the congress considered the amount needed for fy2003 appropriations for pell gr ants it had to consider not only the projected size and number of awards fo r the 20034004 academic year but also the sufficiency of fy2002 appropriations n eeded for the 20022003 academic year and the estimated fy2001 shortfall as well for fy2003 the president requests 109 billion for pell grants with 4000 maximum award as introduced the h ouse bill

appendix fiscal year 2003 pages 11951197 an fy2002 supplemental of 10 billion was enacted as part of pl 107206 which brought the fy2002 appropriations total to 113 billion the fy2002 maximum award was

support admi nistrative activities for the ffel program and 4 other ed personnel and opera tional funds related to studen t aid program administration these funds are currently provided th rough disparate set of mandatory discretionary and subsidy accounts th proposal would switch the dl program administrative funds which are currently mandatory appropriati ons to discretionaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31303crs34 appropriations similarly account maintenance fees wh ich partially support ffel program guaranty agencies would cease to be mandatory appropriations and would become discretionary appropriations mu ch of the financing of ffel program administrative costs however would continue to be done through mandatory subsidy payments to lenders the higher educa tion act hea provisions that provide the underlying statutory authority for these funds would have to be changed to accommodate this proposal for additional information on the cost financing and design of the ffel and dl programs see crs report rl30048 federal student loans program data and default statistics and crs report rl30656 the administration of federal student l oan programs background and provisions idea part b grants to states the idea is the major federal program providing assistance to states and school districts to help them fulfill their constitutional obligation to pr ovide free appropriate pub lic education to children with disabilities in 1975 the congress aut horized state payments up to maximum amount of 40 of the national averag perpupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities ages 3 and above that each state serves the rationale for this formula was the assumption that the education of children with disabilities cost twice the national appe 100 more than the average child and the maximum federal share of the extr cost would be 40 appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40 level some view this deficiency as promise made that has not yet been kept achi eving the 40 funding level for fy2002 for part b grants would take an estimated 182 billion whereas the fy2002 appropriation was 75 billion the equivalent of 165 of the current appe times the number of children served an dditional appropriation of 107 billion would have been necessary to provide the 40 authorized maximum for fy2002 in addition funding requirements for maximum grants are likely to grow in the future as increases are anticipated for both the appe and the number of children with disabilities served the latter may increase in part as result of medical advances that have resulted in more medically fragile children surviving to school age and receiving public education for add itional information see crs report 97433 individuals with disabilities education act full funding of state formula forward funding and advance appropriations many of the larger ed programs have either aut horization or appropr iations provisions that allow funding flexibility for school program years that di ffer from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and s econdary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the appropriations and remain available through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2003 appropriations for some programs became available for obligation to the states on july 1 2003 and will remain available for 15month period until september 30 2004 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiyear fundi ng and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow dditional time for school offi cials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ah ead of time appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31303crs35 from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2003 appropriations w ill be used primarily to support the 2003 2004 academic year unlike forward funded programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for 2 full fiscal years thus if cost estimates turn out to be too low funds may be borrowed from the following years appropriations or conversely if the timates are too high the surplus may be obligated during the following year an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2003 appr opriations funds normally would have become available october 1 2002 under regular funding provisi ons but did not become available until july 1 2003 under the forward funding provisi ons discussed above however if the july 1 2003 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by 3 months until october 1 2003 the appropriation w ould be classified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2004 for example the fy2003 conf erence report includes an appropriation of 118 billion prior to the reduction see page 10 for title i part grants to leas for the education of the disadvantaged this amount includes not only forward funding of 29 billion available july 1 2003 but also an advance appropriation of 88 billion available october 1 2003 like forward funding advance appropriations are accomplished through provisions in the annual appropriations b ill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the 3month delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for standa rd school year occur after october 1 at the appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence 3month change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for additi
