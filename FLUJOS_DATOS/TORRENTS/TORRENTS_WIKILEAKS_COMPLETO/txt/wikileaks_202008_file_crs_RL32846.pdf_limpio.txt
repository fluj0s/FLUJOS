and authorized it to promulgate sentencing guidelines 28 usc 991998 in order to eliminate and prevent unwarranted sentencing disparity2 the statutes that define federal crimes still identify the

either the defendants commission of th same crime on more than occasion or his commission of series of crimes at the same time or series of crimes that have little other than the defendant in common ussg 3d11 to 3d1 the guidelines in this part reflect compromise between concurrent and consecutive punishment for crimes by the sa defendant they generally call for more severe punishment than pure concurrent sentencing and more lenient than pure consecutive sentencing as long there are statutory pr ovisions that require consecutive sentencing eg 18 usc 924c1dii the first step in the process is to group similar offenses ussg 3d 11 offenses are grouped together which have the same vi ctim and the act or transaction b have the same victim and two or more acts or transactions involving th same

statute requires the application of the guidelines shall impose sentence pursuant to the guidelines the guidelines application might be considered mandatory in safety valve cases booker notwithstanding admittedly booker makes mention of the safety valve provision the difficu lty is that the same logic under which booker rendered 18 usc 3553a inoperable w ould seem to apply without the booker fix the mandatory guidelines w ith their judicial factfinding under preponderance standard offend both the sixt h amendment jury right clause and the fifth amendment due process clause as described by the court in booker blakely v washington 124 sct 2531 2004 and apprendi v new jersey 530 us 466 2000 the same may be said of the government driven substantial assistance departure even though the statute there also declares that sentences that fall within is realm shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines62 pulling the guidelines back from the booker command that they not be considered mandatory dooms them to the proscriptions recognized elsewhere in booker as well as in blakely and apprendi of course the substantial assistance guideline is still feature of the advisory guidelines when applicable it directs the court to assess the reduction with an eye to the utility of the assistance supplied and the risk to the defendant in providing it63 the government apparently did not petition for departure under ussg 5k11 for korakis he did qualify for the safety valve depart ure and although hishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32846crs25 64 1 standard for upward departure if re liable information indicates that the defendants criminal history category substantially under represents the seriousness of the defendants criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes an upward departure may be warranted 2 types of information forming the basis for upward departure the information described in subsection may include info rmation concerning the following prior sentences not used in computing the criminal history category eg sentences for foreign and tribal offenses b prior sentences of substantially more than one year imposed as result of independent crimes committed on different occasions c prior similar misconduct established by civil adjudicati on or by failure to comply with an administrative order d whether the

factors that might support such departure64 it also points out however that prior arrest record itself may not be considered u ssg 4a13a3 on the other hand inadequacies may warrant bumping the defendant with category vi criminal history to higher offense level ussg 4a13 section 4a13 is equally candid with its observation that the guidelines otherwise applicable criminal history cat egory

case of school teacher who possess controlled substances for display in drug education program reduced sentence might be warranted ussg 5k211 another section explains that the court may not depart

any harm caused by the offense the resources expended should not be viewed as punishment but rather as means of making victims whole for the harm caused second if the organiza tion operated primarily for criminal purpose or primarily by criminal means the fine should be set sufficiently high to divest the organization of all its asse ts third the fine range for any other organization should be based on the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the organization the seri ousness of the offense generally will be reflected by the highest of the pecuniary gain the pecuniary loss or the amount in guideline offense level fine table culpability generally will be determined by the steps taken by the organization pr ior to the offense to prevent and detect criminal c onduct the level
