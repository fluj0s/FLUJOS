reserve the right to withdraw modify or reduce their offers depending on how much other participants are willing to open their markets these discussions are slated to conclude january 1 2005 limited success in the thorny agriculture negotiations however is spurring some negotiators to question the prospects of reaching an agreement by this deadline us negotiators have voiced their continued support for the agricultural talks and argue that they remain committed to meeting the january 1 2005 deadline at the same time they argue that the limited success experienced so far in agriculture negotiations should not impede progress in the area of services trade and in other areas where negotiations are progressing2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21492 service industries account for 81 percent of

paper 490 december 16 2002 crs3 process of estimating the benefits of the negotiations is in identifying barriers to trade in services and then assigning monetary values to those barriers the general agreement on trade in services the general agreement on trade in services or gats7 was created as part of the uruguay round of trade negotiations and entered into effect in january 1995 the agreement consists of 29 articles eight annexes eight ministerial decisions and an understanding article xix is considered by many to be one of the most important because it commits the wto members to successive rounds of negotiations with view to achieving progressively higher level of liberalization such commitment was felt necessary because the agreement does not rely on set of rules similar to those applied for goods but relies instead on list of specific commitments supplied by each member country and details what that country is willing to undertake under the gats member countries agreed to abide by set of general obligations which were applied directly and automatically to all members and services sectors and number of specific commitments concerning market access and national treatment in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21492 certain designated sectors the scope of these sectoral commitments is laid down in individual country schedules and therefore varies widely between members under the agreement the general obligations are comprised of two specific issues most favored nation treatment and transparency or openness regarding laws and regulations specific commitments relate to market access national treatment and the movement of natural persons other annexes concern four areas in which the members agreed to continue negotiations air transport financial services telecommunications and maritime transport services the agreement also distinguishes between four different modes of delivery of services 1 crossborder trade in services which represents the most common type of services trade 2 consumption abroad primarily activities associated with tourism 3 commercial presence in which firm from one country establishes presence in another country in order to provide service and 4 the presence of natural persons such as medical doctors accountants or teachers from one country entering another country in order to supply service in principle the agreement applies to all services with two exceptions services supplied to governments and air traffic rights and services the agreement also provides that in certain circumstances member countries can introduce or maintain domestic measures that are contrary to their obligations under the agreement these circumstances include measures that nation determines are necessary to protect public morals or maintain public order protect human animal or plant life or health or secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not consistent with the agreement such as laws to prevent deceptive or fraudulent practices exemptions are also allowed in the area of financial services that allow member countries to take measures to protect investors depositors policy holders or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system finally member countries are allowed to temporarily restrict trade on non discriminatory basis in the event of serious balance of payments problem 7
