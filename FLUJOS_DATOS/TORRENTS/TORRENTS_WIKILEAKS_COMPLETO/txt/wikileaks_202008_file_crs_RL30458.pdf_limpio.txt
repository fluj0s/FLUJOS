divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30458the budget reconciliation process timing of legislative action summary the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure under the congressional budget act of 1974 that opera tes as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution process the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue and spending levels into confor mity with the policies of the budget resolution accordingly reconciliation probably is the most poten t budget enforcement tool available to congress for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process in which reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directin g the appropriate co mmittees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetar outcomes and the resultant legislation usually incorporated into an omnibus b ill is considered unde r expedited procedures in the house and senate reconciliation was first used by the hous and senate in calendar year 1980 for fy1981 as an optional procedure it has not been used every year during the period from 1980 to the present 19 reconcilia tion measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed under revised timetable in effect since fy1987 the annual budget resolution is scheduled for final adoption by the h ouse and senate by april 15 the current timetable prescribes june 15 as the deadline for completing action on any required reconciliation legisla tion but there is explicit re quirement to that effect the record of experience with reconciliation legislation over the period covering 1980 to the present indicates considerable variation in the time needed to process such measures from the date the reconcilia tion instructions take effect upon final adoption of the budget resoluti on until the resultant reconc iliation legislation is approved or vetoed by the president the interval for the 22 reconciliation measures ranged from low of 27 days for the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 to high of 384 days for the tax in crease prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 on average the process was comple ted in nearly five months 142 days more than twice the amount of time c ontemplated by the congressional budget process timetable with regard to the use of reconciliati on by congressional session action on 11 such measures was completed during the first session and on 11 such measures during the second session congress and the president have shown the ability to initiate the reconciliation process and conclude it reasonably early in the same session in the case of eight bills for seven different years reconciliation measures were enacted or vetoed before the end of august on the other hand the

reconciliation measures overview of the budget reconciliation process under the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended the house and senate are required to adopt at least one budget resolution each year1 the budget resolution which ta kes the form of concurrent resolution and is not sent to the presiden t for his approval or veto serves as congressional statement in br oad terms regarding the appr opriate revenue spending and debt policies as well as guide to th subsequent consider ation of legislation implementing such policies at agency and programmatic levels budget resolution policies are enforced through variety of mechanisms including points of order2 the house and senate budget committees which were created by the 1974 act exercise exclusive jurisdiction over budget resolutions and are responsible for monitoring their enforcement in developing budget resolution th house and senate budget committees rely on baseline budget projections prepar ed by the congressional budget office cbo budget resolution typically refl ects many different assumptions regarding legislative action expected to occur during session that would

probably is the most potent budget enforcement tool available to cong ress for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process first reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directin g the appropriate co mmittees to develop legislation achieving the desired budget ary outcomes the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget reso lution the budget committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliati on bill without making any substantive revisions the second step involves consideration of the resultant reconc iliation legislation by the house and senate unde r expedited procedures among other things debate in the senate on any r econciliation measure is limite d to 20 hours and 10 hours on conference report and amendments must be germane the house rules committee typically sets limitations on debate and the offering of amendments during consideration of reconciliation measures in the house in cases where only one committee has been instructed the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber thus bypassing the budget committee in some years budget resolutions included reconciliation instructions that afforded the house and senate the option of considering two or more different reconciliation bills once the reconciliation legislation called for in the budget resolution has been approved or vetoed by the president the process is concluded c ongress cannot develop another reconciliation bill in the wake of veto without first adopting another budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions reconciliation was first used by the house and

and reconciliation pr ocedures were not used that year from 1980 into the 1990s reconciliation was used to reduce the deficit through reductions in mandatory spe nding revenue increases or combination of the two in recent years however reconciliation was used to reduce revenues and in few instances to increase spending levels in particular areas6 in 2006 reconciliation was used to reduce mandatory spending and re venues yielding net increase in the deficit7 in the first session of the 110th congress the house and senate both adopted rules prohibiting the use of reconciliation in manner that

spending reductions the reconciliation process for the most part has applied to mandatory spending programs and not discretionary spending programs which are subject to ot her budget enforcement procedures8 in some years the reconciliation process has been used to increase the statutory debt limit which usually is addressed through differe nt procedures in 2000 efforts were made in the reconciliation process to re duce the debt held by the public9 timing of legislative action time of year that reconcilia tion is scheduled to occur s originally framed the 1974 c ongressional budget act requi red the adoption of two budget resolutions each year by may 15 of each year the house and senate were scheduled to complete action on budget resolution setting advisory targets by september 15 just before the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 the two chambers were scheduled to adopt budget resolution setting binding limits it was contemplated that reconciliation would be used in conjunction with the second budget resolu tion as device to make any last minute changes in pending legislation or current law necessary to br ing the budget resolution policies to fruition the 1974 act prescribed 10day period to accomplish reconciliation requiring that the process be concl uded by september 25 after several years experience wi th the congressional budget process congressional leaders realized that reconciliation could not be used to make major changes in revenue and direct spending laws and still fit within such compressed time frame and occur so late in the session therefore when the house and senate first employed reconciliation in 1980 it was initiated in the first budget resolution adopted in the late spring the followi ng year reconciliation again was used in connection with the first budget resolution shortly thereafter the house and senate abandoned altogether the practice of adopting second budget resolution these changes in congressional practice were formally incorporated into the 1974 congressional budget act several year s later under amendments made by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99 177 the changes which first took eff ect for fy1987 and still remain in effect require the annual adoption of only one budget resolution and authorize the inclusion of reconciliation inst ructions in it the deadline for the adoption of the budget resolution was advanced by one month to april 15 under the re vised timetable two months are allowed for reconciliation deadline of june 15 was established for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30458crs6 10 an explicit requirement that congress co mplete action on any necessary reconciliation measure was established in section 310f of the 1974 congressional budget act by section 201b at 99 stat 1040 of the 1985 balanced b udget act section 132102 of the budget enforcement act of 1990 title x iii of pl 101508 deleted this requirement from section 310f but left unchanged the reference to the deadline in the general timetable set forth in section 300completion of action on any required reconciliation legislation10 to enforce this deadline in the house prohibition against the consideration of july adjournment resolution if reconc iliation is not completed was placed in section 310f of the 1974 act the senate has comparable provision overall record of experience the record of experience with reconciliation legisla tion over the period covering 1980 to the present indicates considerable variation in the time needed to process such measures from the date the reconciliation instructions ta ke effect upon final adopti on of the budget resolution until the resultant reconciliation legislation is approved or vetoed by the president as figure 1 shows the processing interval for the 19 enacted and 3 vetoed reconciliation measures ranged from low of 27 days for the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 to high of 384 days for the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2006 on aver age completing the process took nearly five months 142 days well beyond the tw months contemplated by the timetable in the 1974 congressional budget act with regard to the use of reconcilia tion by congressional session congress has not ostensibly favored one session over the other as table 2 shows action on 11 such measures was completed during th first session and on 11 such measures during the second session it should be not ed however that four of the measures the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1983 the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 th deficit reduction act of 2005 and the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 enacted between february and may of the second session were carryover busine ss from the prior session consequently congressional action on 15 of the 22 reconciliation measures was concentrated in the first session congress and the president have shown the ability to initiate the reconciliation process and conclude it reasonably early in the same session in the case of eight bills for seven different years reconciliation measures were enacted or vetoed before the end of august on the other hand the r econciliation process can be lengthy and drawn out in four instances reconciliation m easures were not enacted or vetoed until december and in four other instances carried over until the following year adoption of reconc iliation instructions during the period covering from 1980 to the present congress adopt ed 19 budget resolutions containing reconciliation instructions see table 3 the house and senate adopted four of these budget resolutions for fy1994 fy2000 fy2001 and fy2004 on time but the others were adopted behind schedule as table 3 shows most of the budget resolutions that contained r econciliation instructi ons were adopted in april may or june but one was adopted as late as august and another in october during years when

reconciliation measures in 2000 by robert keith out of print and available from the author ibidtimely adoption of the budget resolu tion can facilitate timely enactment of reconciliation legislation just as tardy adoption of the budget resolution can delay completion of the reconciliation process for example the fy 2002 budget resolution was adopted only 25 days after the deadlin and the reconciliation process for that year was completed in another 28 days compared to the average of 142 days conversely the fy1986 budget resolution wa s adopted 108 days after the deadline and the reconciliation pr ocess took another 249 days to complete nonetheless timely or tardy adoption of budget resolution does not n ecessarily ensure that the reconciliati on process will proceed quickly or slowly for example in two of the years that the budget resolution was adopted on time fy1994 and fy2000 131 days and 161 days respectively were needed to complete action on reconciliation legisl ation in 2005 the fy2006 budget resolution was adopted only 13 days behind schedule but the second of two reconciliation m easures generated thereunder was not enacted in to law until 384 days later another factor that can affect how quick ly or slowly reconciliation legislation is processed is the amount of time given to committees to prepare their reconciliation recommendations as table 3 indicates the initial deadline for committee submissions included in the budget resolu tion ranged from about one week to five months after adoption of the budget reso lution the longer deadlines were used largely to accommodate the august recess in some cases the submission deadline was extended one or more times over the whole pe riod committees generally have complied with submission deadlines house and senate action on omni bus reconciliation legislation as indicated previously the house and senate together completed action on 22 different budget reconciliati on bills during the period covering from 1980 to the present 19 of them were enacted into law and three were vetoe d the text of one or more other measures considered separately sometimes was incorporated later into an omnibus budget rec onciliation bill on ccasion one chamber has considered reconciliation legislation that was not considered by the other chamber during the second session of the 106th congress for example the house and senate passed the marriage tax relief reconc iliation act of 2000 but it wa s vetoed by president clinton the house passed five other r econciliation measures during the session but the senate did not act on any of them11 table 4 provides information on the dates of initial consideration by the house and senate of these 22 measures as well as the dates that the two chambers acted on the relevant conference reports as the ta ble shows the senate devoted more than twice as many days 75 days to initial consideration of these measures than did the house 31 days initial senate consideration of these measures ranged from two to eight days while house consideration t ook one or two days except in 1989 when the house considered the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 for
