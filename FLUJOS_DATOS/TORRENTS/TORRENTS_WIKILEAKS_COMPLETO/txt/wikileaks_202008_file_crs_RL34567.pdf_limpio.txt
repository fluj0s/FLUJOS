resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567publicprivate partnerships in highway and transit infrastructure provision summary growing demands on the transportati on system and constraints on public resources have led to calls for more priv ate sector involvement in the provision of highway and transit infrastructure thr ough what are known as publicprivate partnerships ppps ppp broadly defined is any arrangement whereby the private sector assumes more responsibility than is traditional for infrastructure planning financing desig n construction operation and maintenance this report describes the wide variety of publicprivate partnerships in highways and transit but focuses on the two types of highway ppps that are generating the most debate the leasing by the public sector to the private sector of existing infrastructure and the building leasing and owning of new infrastructure by private entities ppp proponents argue that in addition to being the best hope for injecting additional resources into the surface freight and passenger transportation systems for upkeep and expansion private sector invol vement potentially reduces costs project delivery time and public sector risk and may also impr ove project selection and project quality detractors on the other nd argue that the potential for ppps is limited and that unless carefully regulated ppps will disrupt the operation of the surface transportation network increase driving and other costs for the traveling public and subvert the public planning pro cess some of the specific issues raised in highway operation and costs include the effects of ppps on trucking lowincome households and traffic diversion issues raised in transportation planning include noncompete provisions in ppp agreements unsolicited proposals lease duration and foreign control of transportation assets on the question of new resources the evidence suggests that there is significant private funding available for investment in surface transportation infrastructure but that it is unlikely to amount to more than 10 of the ongoing needs of highways over the next 20 years or so if that and proba bly much smaller share of transit needs with competing demands for public funds there is also concern that private funding will substitute for public resources w ith net gain in transportation infrastructure the effect of ppps on the planning and operation of the transportation system is more open question because of the numerous forms they can take and because they are dependent on the detaile d agreements negotiated between the public and private partners for this reason so have suggested that the federal government needs to more systematically identify and evaluate the public interest particularly the national public interest in projects that employ ppp three broad policy options congress might consider in how to deal with ppps in federal transportati on programs and regulations are di scussed in this report the first option is to continue with the current policy of incremental changes and experimentation in progra m incentives and regulati on second is to actively encourage

httpwwwfhwadotgovpppdefinedhtmpublicprivate partnerships in highway and transit infr astructure provision introduction growing demands on the transportati on system and constraints on public resources have led to calls for more priv ate sector involvement in the provision of highway and transit infrastructure thr ough what are known as publicprivate partnerships ppps the opportunity to own or lease assets that have the potential for generating stable mediuml evel revenues over the long term has attracted private sector interest according to the us department of tran sportation the term publicprivate partnership is used for any scenario under which the private sector assumes greater role in the planning fi nancing design cons truction operation and maintenance of transportation facility compared to traditional procurement methods1 typically the public in publicpriva partnerships refers to state government local government or tran sit agency the federal government nevertheless exerts influence over the prevalence and structure of ppps through its transportation programs funding and regulatory oversight proponents of ppps argue that they are the best hope for injecting additional resources into the surface freight and pa ssenger transportation systems for upkeep and expansion furthermore ppp proponents argue private sector involvement often reduces costs project delivery time and pub lic sector risk and may improve project selection and project quality detractors on the other hand argue the potential for ppps is limited and that unless carefully regulated ppps will disrupt the operation of the national surface trans portation network increase cost s for the traveling public and subvert the public planning process with competing demands for public funds there is also concern that private fundi ng will substitute for public resources with net gain in transportation infrastructure wide variety of publicpri vate partnerships in high ways and transit exist but this report focuses on the two types of highway ppps that are generating the most debate 1 the leasing by the public sector to the private sector of existing infrastructure sometimes referred to as brownfield facilities and 2 the building leasing and owning of new infrastructure by private entities sometimes known as greenfield facilities common though not essential element to greater private sector participation in highway infrastructure provision is the use of tolling vehicle tolls provide revenue str eam to retire bonds issued to finance project and to provide return on investment high way tolling can be implemented by public authorities but it is widely believed th at the privatization of transportationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs2 2 problems associated with estimating future infrastructure needs include defining need and predicting future conditions especially consumer demand which can vary depending on economic conditions and public policy choices such as how service is funded and priced 3 see for example transportation research board national cooperative highway research program future financing options to meet highway and

spread of tolling and may raise toll rates consequently discussion of ppps must include as this report does the issue of vehicle tolling and other direct pricing mechanisms this report begins with brief discussion of the surface transportation system and its financing needs as background to the debate on ppps that is followed by sections describing the different types of ppps with details of few prominent examples and the development of federal legislation with respect to ppps the report then discusses the main issues of contention with the construction and long term leasing of highways by the private sector particularly as they relate to the funding planning and operation of th surface transportation system before providing some policy options c ongress may wish to consider background the appropriate role of the private sect or in the provision of ostensibly public surface transportation infrastructure has been discussed for decades but this debate has recently taken on new urgency because of the magnitude of estimated future needs of the surface transportation system coupled with problems funding existing highway and transit programs at the federal state and cal levels number of high profile ppp agreements including the leasing of the indiana toll road and the chicago skyway described below have also contributed to this heightened interest although estimating future infrastructur needs is fraught with difficulty2 number of recent reports have concluded that the nations surface transportation infrastructure will require s ubstantially more funding over the next few decades to deal with physical deterioration conges tion and future demand for both passenger and freight travel3 capital cost estimates prepared by the department of transportation dot for example suggest that the nation as whole including all levels of government and the private sector needs to increase highway capital spending by 12 and transit capital spending by 25 from 2005 through 2024 in order to maintain the current cond ition and performance of the system4 investment to improve conditions and performance would be higher than these estimates the national surface

268 for highways and 78 to 162 for transit 7 the federal tax on gasoline is currently 184 cents per gallon of which 1544 cents is deposited in the highway account of the highway trust fund 286 cents in the mass transit account and 01 cents in the leaking underground storage tank trust fund 8 estimates provided to crs by the c ongressional budget office february 29 2008transportation equity act legacy for users pl 10959 safetea estimated significantly greater needs than dot in its report to congress5 nstprscs middle range capital spending estimate for highways by all levels ofgovernment and the private sector over the next 30 years 2006 through 2035 for instance suggests an increase of between 96 and 176 over currently sustainable expenditures and for transit the equi valent range is between 31 and 92 6 at the same time that many argue for greater surface transportation infrastructure funding there is concern th at the main revenue mechanism at the federal level the fuels tax is faltering the federal contribution to highway and transit infrastructure approximately 40 of capital spending on these modes since the 1990s is largely derived from the high way trust fund which relies primarily on the federal fuels tax and less so on other vehicl erelated taxes7 almost all federal highway funds and approximate ly 80 of federal transit funds are derived from the trust fund in its most recent estimates the congressional budget office cbo suggests that on its current path the highway account of the highway trust fund will go into deficit sometime in fy2009 before the end of the current authorization period and that the mass transit acc ount will go into deficit in fy20128 funding shortfalls in the highway trust fund are related to few key underlying factors particularly the erosion of the real per gallon value of the fuels tax the federal tax on gaso line was last raised in the early 1990s by 5 cents in 1990 pl 101508 and then by 43 cents in 1993 pl 10366 of the 5 cent increase in 1990 25 cents was directed to the high way trust fund and 25 cents was directed to the general fund of the us treasur for deficit reduction whereas in 1993 the entire 43 cents was directed to the gene ral fund for deficit reduction the 25 cents increase in 1990 for deficit reduction was redirected to the highway trust fund beginning october 1 1995 with 2 cents go ing to the highway account and 05 cents to the mass transit account pl 10366 the 43 cents raised in 1993 was redirected to the trust fund beginning october 1 1997 with 344 cents going to the highway account and 086 cents to the mass transit account pl 10534 pl 105178 consequently the gasoline tax flowing to the highway trust fund went from 9 cents to 115 cents per gallon in 1990 to 14 cents per gallon in 1995 and to 183 cents per gallon in 1997 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs4 9 us department of labor bureau of labor statistic s consumer price index 10 us department of transporta tion federal

on gasoline in 2006 was worth about 72 percent of its value in 19939 adjusted for changes in the price of materials used in highway constr uction as estimated by fhwa however the federal gasoline tax was worth only 49 in 2006 compared with 199310 although the federal fuels tax in ab solute terms has lost good deal of its purchasing power since 1993 revenues to the trust fund in inflationadjusted terms have not suffered as much because the amount of driving and therefore fuel consumption has until recently continued to grow see figure 1 indeed through the 1990s revenues continued to grow in r eal inflationadjusted terms however revenues have been flat in real terms si nce at least 2001 and when adjusted for the price of highway constructi on materials fell sharply in both 2005 and 2006 for

between revenues from traditional funding mechanisms particular ly the federal fuels tax and future infrastructure investment needs is majo r underlying issue in the debate about the role of ppps the two main sides of the debate were evident in the nstprsc report that contained both majority and minority views the majority view supported by nine of the twelve commissioners conte nded that severe unde rinvestment is the main problem facing transportation infrastru cture in the years ahead expressing the desire for maintaining strong federal role in financing the capital needs of the transportation system at the aforementi oned 40 level they recommended 25 to 40 centpergallon increase in the federal fuel s tax to be phased in over the next five years and indexing the tax to inflation beginning in year 6 although they argued these increases need to be accompanied by major reforms of the federal program to make it more focused and efficient the majority also argued that ppps private capital and tolling including congestion pricing would need to be employed to greater extent but under set of rules and regulations designed to protect the public interest an opposing viewpoint expressed by th ree commissioners including the us secretary of transportation mary peters proposed that there is some need for additional resources in transportation infrastructure but not to the extent estimated in the majority report they argued th at failure to properly align supply and demand not failure to generate sufficien t tax revenues is the essential policy failure in transportati on infrastructure provision11 key ingredient of change in their view should be market based reforms of highway systems allowing for much greater reliance on tolling particularly congestion pricing private sector participation and thus ppps moreover they argue that the federal role ought to be reduced and refocused in order to allow innovation at the state and local level types of transportation publicprivate partnerships publicprivate partnerships are typica lly conceived of as distinct from the traditional method of planning building operating and mainta ining highway and transit infrastructure in the traditiona l method known as design bid build the public sector decides there is need for building new facility plans its development with wide variety of community input organizes the financing from tax revenue either on payasyougo basis or throug h government bonds backed by tax revenue tolls or fares lets out contracts to design and build the facility and takes final ownership to operate and maintain the facility in contrast publicprivate partnership involves more private sector participation in any or all phases of infrastructure development and operation in many ppps private sector involvement is predicated on revenue stream from the operation of facility such as vehicle toll or container fee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs6 12 us department of tran sportation federal highway administration public private partnerships website ppp options httpwwwfhwadotgovppppcfshtmaccording to the us department of transportation ppps in highway and transit infrastructure provision can be categorized into six basic types although the exact arrangements vary from project to project many other types of ppps are possible and there is some overlap among types12 from least to most private responsibility these six basic types of ppp are private contract fee services these types of ppps turn over to the private sector more responsibility for providing services than is traditional this may include contracting for operations and maintenance om services and program and financial management services an example of this type of ppp is the partial outsourcing of street maintenan ce in the district of columbia including snow and ice removal designbuild db this type of partnership arrangement combines two services that are traditionally separate design and construction into one fixedfee contract the public sector neve rtheless retains ownership of the facility as we ll as responsibility for planning preliminary engineering financing and om an example of this type of ppp is the 12mile light rail system in minneapolis minnesota opened in 2004 that was mostly constructed using two designbuild contracts one to construct the rail track and signal equipment and one for the trains designbuildoperatemaintain dbom these partnerships go even further than designbuild ppps by adding private sector responsibility for om once facility goes into service the public sector is still responsible for financing and retains the risks and rewards associated with the opera ting costs and revenues the 21 mile hudsonbergen light rail system in new jersey is good example of dbom the original fixedprice contract awarded to the 21st century rail corporation in 1996 was for design and construction of the initial 10 miles by guaranteed date and then 15 years of operation and ma intenance the cont ract was subsequently renegotiated for extensions to the system and to lengthen the om contract long term lease agreement this type of partnership typically involves the leasing of an existing facility to private company for specified amount of time the private company usually pays an initial concession fee and must operate and maintain the facility to prescribed standards the private company typically collects tolls on users and keeps the revenue to pa bond holders and to generate return on its investment prominent examples of this type of ppp are the chicago skyway and the indiana toll road see descriptions belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs7 designbuildfinan ceoperate dbfo in addition to the designing building and operation of an infrastructure project these types of ppps also transfer to the private sector most of the financing responsibility debt financing leve raged with revenue stream such as tolls is the most common mechanism in this type of ppp however financing may be supplem ented with public sector grants andor inkind contributions such as rightofway the 14mile dulles greenway toll road in northern virginia is an example of this type of ppp buildownoperate boo in this type of ppp the public sector grants to the private sector the right to design build operate maintain and own facility in perpetuity consequently conception of the project and subsequent planni ng is more likely to lay with the private sector an example of this type of ppp is the 6 mile foley beach express near gulf shores alabama that incorporates toll bridge over the intracoastal waterway prominent examples of publicprivate partnerships to illustrate the way in which ppps can be structured this section describes few prominent examples four dealing with highways and one dealing with transit two of the examples the chicago skyway and indiana toll road both involve long term leases of existing fac ilities and have received good deal of attention over the past few years both leasing deals have raised questions among other things about the loss of control of major public asset for several generations increases in toll rates and the effects on the surrounding transportation network another example the addition of high occupancy toll hot lanes to the capital beltway i495 in northern virginia involves private investme nt in new highway capacity that is seen by some as boon to state with limited public funding for major infrastructure projects however it too raises seve ral public policy questions including those about the public planning process for tran sportation infrastructure and the ability of lowerincome travelers to pay tolls that may be high during the weekday morning and evening peak periods the developmen t of the vegas monorail provides an example of the potential and the difficulties of private investment in public transit and the final example the missouri safe and sound program details plan for private involvement in repa iring and maintaining sign ificant number of highway bridges while innovative the missour i plan may commit substantial amount of the states federal bridge funding for 25 ears potentially tying the hands of future decision makers and reducing the flexibility of the state to react to other transportation challenges the issues raised by these questions nd several others are discussed in more depth in the issues fo r congress section later in this report chicago skyway the chicago skyway

publicprivate partnerships in the period from the mid1950s through the 1970s highway and transit infrastructure provision were both marked by large infusion of public funding particularly from the federal government26 highway spending grew from the mid 1950s in large part to finance the constr uction of the interstate highway system whereas transit spending grew from the mid1960s with the public sector takeover of struggling private transit companies nd an investment in new vehicles and infrastructure during this period the pr ivate sectors role was largely limited to bidding on and building what the public sect or had planned desi gned and financed process known as designbidbuild with the effective completion of the interstates by the early 1980s however public capital spending on highways had already declined in real terms and the federal share of total public capital spending that had reached highs in the late 1970s and early 1980s began to decline27 transit spending by all levels of government that had grown rapidly in the 1970s slowed dramatically in the 1980s and the federal share declined28 according to some analysts these trends spurred interest in the use of public private partnerships as states and localities particularly those in fast growing parts of the country searched for new wa ys to fund and build transportation infrastructure29 in highway transportation durin g the 1980s there was some renewed focus on vehicle tolling potential revenue stream that was of interest to private investors as well as public authorities consequently by the late 1980s spurred on by experience in other parts of the wo rld and developments in automated toll collection technology seven states had approved legislation to allow private investment in highway projects30 two of the earliest pr ojects developed under these new rules were the dulles greenway in virginia and sr91 in california toll roads that both opened in 1995 according to dot 23 states

of 1991 istea pl 102240 it has generally been permissible to use tolling to finance the construction or reconstruction of fede rally supported roads tunnels and bridges except on the inters tate system even when the facility is privately owned 23 usc 129a34 moreover over the ears and particularly since the late 1980s congress has created number of exceptions to tolling restrictions on interstates that permit the development of ppps in the surface transportation and unifor m relocation assistance act of 1987 pl 10017 congress established pilot program allowing federal f unds to be

also created two new programs the express lane demonstr ation program section 1604b and the interstate system construc tion toll pilot program section 1604c the express lane demonstration program authorizes up to 15 new tolled facilities from the conversion of existing hov facilities or wh ere new lanes are constructed the program explicitly provides for private investment the interstate system construction toll pilot program authorizes tolling on the construction of three new interstate highways to date one of the three slots has b een reserved for construction of i73 in south carolina although the slot applies to i73 in other states as well if they want to construct their portion of it under this program safetea also extended and modified the value pricing pilot program by setting aside portion of the authorized funding for congestion pr icing pilot projects that do not involve highway tolls such as parking pricing strategies and payasyou drive pricing involving innovative forms of car ownership and insurance36 although it is not entirely clear what eff ect the changes in federal law have had on the development of toll roads substantial number of projects have been initiated since the passage of istea and this activity appears to have accelerated recent survey sponsored by the federal highway administration found that since the passage of istea total of 168 toll road projects were initiated in 27 states and one us territory37 these projects totaled 3770 cen terline miles nd 14560 lane miles of highway although not all the projects involved new

particularly in the use of user f ees this led to the creation in 1994 of the innovative finance test and evaluation 045 program that sought to implement and evaluate some new fina ncing tools in the federal aid highway program some of the ideas developed in this experiment program were subsequently enacted in the national highway system designati on act of 1995 pl 10459 including the state infrastructure bank sib pilot program that permitted certain states to set up revolving funds with federal money with the intent of leveraging other public and private resources for infra structure projects another major development came in the form of the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act tif ia of 1998 part of tea21 that created program for federal credit assistance on major transportation projects tifia funding is designed to leverage nonfederal funding including investment from the private sector and as originally ceived was for projects costing at least 100 million or at least 30 million in the case of intelligent transportation systems its projects tifia financing authoriz ed under tea21 was extended by safetea and modified by permitting all publicpriva partnerships to apply directly expanding eligibility to freight rail and intermodal facilities and by lowering the eligibility threshold to 50 million in gene ral and to 15 million in the case of its projects39 safetea also added to th federal tax code severa l private transportation activities as eligible for federally taxexempt state and local bond financing according to federal tax law state an d local bonds are classified as either governmental bonds or private activity bonds government bonds are those issued to finance public activities such as build ing school and private activity bonds are those issued to finance activities that are less public in nature such as an investor owned water utility in general the inte rest on government bonds is exempt from federal tax whereas interest on private ac tivity bonds is taxable taxexempt bond can be issued at lower interest rate nd therefore provides cheaper financing for project than taxable bond over the year s some types of private activities for which state and local bonds are issued ve been afforded taxexempt status40 these private activities are known as qualified private activitie s prior to safetea number of transportation

innovative contracting another area in which th federal government has increasingly encouraged private participation in highway infrastructure is in contracting and project delivery fh wa began

by section 1307 of tea21 albeit with certain conditions these conditions included limiting designbuild contrac ting to projects over 50 million or over 5 million on its projects and restricting the

private sector firms before nepa approval this allows private sect or involvement at an earlier stage than previously allowed in 2005 congress also enacted 180day limitation on the time for

projects are revenue negative that is they require some ki nd of ongoing financial support in addition to passenger fares and other syst emrelated revenues nevert heless there have been number of federal legislative and regulatory initiatives encouraging private sector involvement in transit particularly in fina ncing and contracting innovative financing one of the earliest legislative initiatives in the realm of innovative financing with implications for private sector involvement in transit can be found in certain provisions of the national urban mass tr ansportation act of 1974 pl 93503 the act permitted fede ral assistance for joint development projects projects that typically involved the commercial or resi dential development of land on or near transit stations44 these types of projects however were discouraged by an administrative decision by the urban mass transportation administration now know as the federal transit administration or fta in the 1980s that federal subsidies could only be used to defra project costs after taking into account contributions from private pa rtners effectively substituting private dollars for federal dollars but ftas po licy on joint developmen t was revised again in 1997 as directed by congress in istea to allow land acqui red with federal funding to be used in joint developm ent projects and income derived from such projects to be used for transit operation45 tea21 then made joint development eligible for reimbursement in federal transit grant programs by incorporating such activities into the definition of transit capital project46 the law pertaining to joint development was last modified by saf etea with regulations promulgated in 2007 among other things safetea added interc ity bus and rail ter minals

pilot program and has selected two rail projects in denver co and tw brt projects in houston tx issues for congress the two main issues for congress with regard to publicprivate partnerships in surface transportation are 1 the extent to which ppps can be relied upon to meet the future resource needs of the surface transportation system and 2 the effects of longterm highway concessions on the operation and planning of the surface transportation system some of the specific issues raised in transportation operations include the effects of ppps on national uniformity in highway operation interstate commerce the mobility of lowincome hous eholds and traffic diversion issues raised in transportation planning in clude noncompete provisions in ppp lease agreements unsolicited proposals l ease duration and foreign control of transportation assets each of these is disc ussed below as is the issue of identifying and protecting the public interest in general this section begins with an evaluation of the place of ppps in the funding of surface transportation infrastructure additional resources for tran sportation infrastructure one of the main attractions of ppps accord ing to advocates is that they provide additional resources for the provision of transportation infrastructure some advocates of ppps argue that without additional sources of investment the nation risks undermining the transportation system as result of physical deterioration and congestion primarily these dditional resources are associ ated with projectrelated revenue stream such as vehicle tolls container fees or in the case of transit station development building rents private sector resources may come from an initial payment to lease an existing asset in exchan ge for future revenue as with the indiana toll road and chicago skyway or it may i nvolve developing an asset along with new revenue stream either way facility user fee is often the key to unlocking private sector partic ipation and resources of course the public sector can build toll roads raise tolls on existing facilities or in some cases even institute tolls on existing free roads bridges and tunnels when reconstructing or replacing the f acility proponents of ppps argue however that for two primary reasons the private sector can attract more capital to highway infrastructure than the public sector48 first privately operated toll road can be financed with both debt bond and equ ity financing and that because equity investors have an opportunity to share in th profits they tend to be less conservative than traditional municipal bond investors in addition private concessions are often for terms longer than traditional muni cipal bond maturities of 25 30 or 40 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs18 49

longer period the concessionaire can raise extra capital based on these principles one estimate suggests that the 183 billion raised in the 99year concession of the chi cago skyway would only have raised 800 billion in traditional bond financing49 second ppp proponents argue that toll facilities are less ccessful when operated by the public sector because politi cal forces typically make it difficult to raise tolls in line with costs not only does this create potential further drag on public coffers in the future it also affects the ability of government to borrow money to initiate construction by contrast it is sometimes argued the private sector can generate the necessary funds because lenders are more sure that toll revenues will be stable when decisions are made primarily on business rationale50 an exception to the difference between the public and private sector in setting toll rates is the use of dynamic tolling in congestion pricing schemes in which the toll is adjusted up and down to maintain freeflowing traffic in such cases traffic demand determines the price moreover in leasing agreements the toll rate is often regulated thus the private operator does not have complete freedom to choose when and by how much to raise the toll neverthe less proponents of private sect or involvement argue long term toll road concessionsare not simply privatesector vers ion of publicsector toll agency they are new and importa nt innovation in us highway finance51 the secretary of transportation mary peters has repeatedly stated that there is at least 400 billion of private sector capita l available for infrast ructure investment52 one independent review of the evidence has suggested that this is credible number even taking into account the current probl ems in global credit markets with funds available ranging from 340 billion to 600 billion53 however this 400 billion of private capital is available to be invested anywhere in the world and in any type of infrastructure54 casting some doubt on how much rea listically might be available to be invested in highways and transit in the united states55 it is also unclear over what period of time the 400 billion is available for investment and how much more might be available once that amount is committed nevertheless supporters say even portion of this potential investment capital would provide

10being spent in transit spending n eeds are estimated to be 158 billion annually 32 billion more than is currently being spent56 while most agree that ppps will likely attract new private capital to transportation infrastructure provision some argue that the scale of this capital is likely to be relatively modest when viewed in the context of total highway and transit infrastructure spending57 the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto notes for example that highway tolling either public or private currently accounts for pproximately 5 of highway revenues and optimistically will meet 7 to 9 of future national investment needs58 because transit is revenue negative it is likely that transit ppps could never generate anywhere near this share of investment this suggests that when considering the future needs of both highway and transit infrastructure nationally ppps are likely to generate somewhat less than this estimated level of 7 to 9 related point and one not fully considered in these estimates however is that the institution of toll not only pr ovides revenue to improve the supply of infrastructure but also tends to suppress andor divert travel demand with limited toll road mileage this effect may be relatively minor and may be more likely to result in traffic diversion see below widesp read tolling on the other hand may result not in route diversion but in travelers sw itching to other modes changing the time of trip to avoid charge or forego ing travel altogether dot has made preliminary ttempt to estimate theoretically the effects of universal congestion pricing on infrastructure dema nd and suggests they would be substantial as noted earlier dots current estimate of the annua l cost to maintain highway and bridges over

nevertheless the research does indicate that direct user fees such as congestion pricing may reduce the mand for new highway infrastructure diversion of resources from the transportation sector another concern in the transportation sector is that the resources generated from transportation ppps will not be used to finance transportation infrastructure needs state and local governments have signifi cant demands for funding in many different areas asset leases in particular provide mechanism to generate large sums of money that could be used to fund wide ra nge of social services that is why some have argued that unlike concessions in th provision of new toll roads that are added value the leasing of existing roads mig ht be considered revenue extraction60 this concern has been realized in the case of the chicago skyway discussed earlier as some of the lease payment has been used for nontransportation purposes the city of chicago however has noted that am ong other things it has created reserve fund that generates in intere st revenue what the road did in toll revenue and that excess toll revenues from the skyway were previously directed to the citys general fund61 the gao has stated that the citys credit rating improved when it reduced its general obligation debt thereby reduc ing the future cost of borrowing62 t h possibility remains nevertheless that the money generated by asset leases may end up being used for current transportation nd nontransportation needs and that future facility users in some cases three or four generations from now may end up paying higher tolls as result63 diversion of resources may also be of mo re general concern in that new private resources attracted to transportation infrastructure may substitute for public resources in the sector not add to them with competing demands for public funds it is possible that with increases in private funding state and local governments will divert public resources to other deserv ing public

litigation for example the california dot has had num ber of costly disputes with its private partners66 furthermore gao argues that most state governments do not have the necessary capacity to manage these contracts67 second through ppps the private sector may bear many of the financial risks that exist with building maintaining and operating infrastructure risks abound in the development and operation of infrastructure including the risk that construction and maintenance will cost more andor take longer than foreseen another risk with toll facilities is that once built there will be less demand than estimated transferring these risks to the private sector accordin g to proponents will save public agencies significant amounts of money particularly as cost and schedule overruns are common with transportation infrastructure projects detractors argue that in some cases this transfer of risk may prove illusory as major miscalculations may force the public sector to assume project ownership consequently this line of reasoning goes ppps may in fact be false partnerships in that profits will be retained in the private sector while major losses will be bor ne by the public sector68 moreover as the gao points out not all the risks can or should be shifte d to the private sector for instance major risk associated with transportation infrastructure projects that the

that may be of interest to congress is the effects of ppps on the planning and operation of surface transportation system particularly the highway network this has been expressed by some as identifying and protecting the public interest in transportation infrastructure70 operation of the highway network one of the main concerns of the critics of publicprivate partnerships in highways is that it will create patchwork of tolled and nontolled ro ads undermining national uniformity in highway operation increasing travel costs see be low and ultimately impeding passenger travel and interstate commerce71 conceivably this perceived patchwork will add good deal of complexity to everyday routing decisions and possibly longer term location decisions that may mean the cheapest route is longer the shortest quickest route the american trucking ssociations ata has also expressed the concern that tolling and privatization w ill place an extra administrative burden on national and regional trucking companies b ecause of having to do business with multitude of public and private tolling entities72 others are concerned that the first facilities to be candidates for leasing will be those that serve high pr oportion of users from other states or local jurisdictions73 in response proponents of ppps argue that the national highway system is already complex network of tolled nd nontolled facilities ow ned and operated by multitude of different public authorities and private comp anies and that private highway operators have financial incentive to ensure efficient operations

users of the highway system is that greater private s ector involvement will lead to substantial increases in travel costs through the pro liferation of tolled roads and toll rates that will rise more quickly than has typically been the case under public control this is of particular concern where new service is provided such as new facility or the addition of new lanes on an existing facility and where th ere is viable nontolled alternative proponents of ppps agree that private sector participation will most likely lead to an increase in direct highway user costs but note that this is the price to be paid for not providing highway infrastructure through taxation morever proponents agree that tolls on privately opera ted toll roads are likely to increase more than those on publicly operated roads s upporters of ppps argue that is not because private operators charge too much but that public operators tend to charge too little because increasing tolls in line with infla tion and other costs is politically difficult of particular concern to critics of privately operated toll roads is any situation where there is viable travel alternative or to put it another way where the private road operator has significant monopoly power in such situation these critics argue that unless carefully regulated toll rates can be set very high nd the rate of return on investment will be unreasona bly large ata has expressed such concerns about toll rates on the indiana toll road part of the country where alternative travel route exists ppp proponents argue that concession agreements typically cap toll rates in line with growth factors in the broader economy moreover they argue that concessionaire is unlikely to set rates at level that reduces traffic to level that will cause its revenue to drop75 traffic diversion another concern with the network effects of ppps and tolling in general is that it has the potential for diverting traffic on to other routes possibly increasing congestion contributing to possible roadway deterioration and reducing safety private control it is argued will lead to higher toll rates and therefore more diversion76 diversion of truck traffi c is seen as particularly problematic although diversi on of all types of vehicles may occur recent study suggests that the safety impacts and infrastructure damage resulting from diversion may be substantial although th scale of effects will vary by route and the size of the toll77 for example it has been noted that because there is viable alternative increased tolls on the indiana toll road associated with its leasing are not likely to impose costs on the surrounding routes and jurisdictions proponents of ppps argue that although some diversion may occur it is in the private toll operators interest to provide service that will attract vehicles equity critics of ppps argue that new or higher highway tolls discriminate against low income drivers who will be forced to use

providing high quality of service for those able and willing to pay and another segment of the highwa network with poor quality of service for those unable or unwilling to pay proponents of ppps argue that many income groups stand to benefit from highways with better level of service and point to surveys of users on toll roads such as sr91 that show significant level of usage by people from low income households78 tolls nevertheless still place greater burden on lowerincome than higherincom households but some argue that tolls may be less of burden on lowerincome households than extra fuel sales and property taxes79 infrastructure planning the network effects of some highway ppps as discussed above are conseque nces that might ensue in the short to medium term however these same type of ppps may also have longer term effect on the network as result of their influence on decisions about what to build and where that is the infrastructure planning process propone nts of ppps argue that private sector investment not only will gene rate more resources for tr ansportation but will result in resources being committed to the most effective projects it is frequently argued that because of the political process government f unding of transportation infrastructure is spread too widely or wors is spent on costineffective projects number of studies have shown for example that geographic equity is often basis for distributing transportation funding and selecting projects80 private sector investments on the other hand it is argue d would focus on projects that have the greatest potential economic returns foremost among these are congestion relief projects in places where demand is significantly greater than supply skeptics on the other hand point out that one possible problem with relying on private investment to fund infrastructure development mainte nance and operation is that large parts of the highway netw ork carry relatively few vehicles and are unlikely to attract much interest from the private sector these types of ppps therefore are unlikely to address transportation issues in rural areas issues that are often focused on connectivity maintenance and safety the hope among proponents is that relieved of responsibility by the pr ivate sector for some parts of the heavily traveled network the public sector can concentrate on other parts of the network conceivably however relying much more heavily on ppps may eventually disrupt the transportation network by directing too few resources to links that carry relatively little traffic but provide impor tant connections between the more heavily traveled segmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs25 81 testimony of john foote in us congress house subcommittee on highways transit and pipelines

financing vol 205 may 2006 p 411unsolicited proposals one of the ways in which concerns about the planning effects of ppps have surfaced is over whether or not state will accept unsolicited proposals it is generally ssumed that projects for which proposals are solicited from the private sector will have come through the public planning process unsolicited project proposals on the other hand are those initiated by the private sector and may or may not reflect the prio rities of the state region or locality as contained in short and longrange plans consequently some have suggested that state ppp enabling legislation should not permit unsolicited proposals proponents of ppps argue that this would stifle innovative ideas and that while proposal may be unsolicited to come to fruition it woul d have to pass through the public review process noncompete provisions another possible effect on the transportation system is that some ppp contracts restrict what types of improvements can be made near privately operated facility in some cases the private sector partner has insisted on noncompete clau restricting nearby impr ovements with the potential for reducing traffic on the privately operated facility or if they are made providing compensation some have argued that these noncompete clauses impede the ability of public agencies to increase capacity and their ability to devise coordinated congestion management policies81 proponents of ppps argue that there must be some protection from unlimited competition of freeroads provided by the taxpayer otherwise it would be very difficu lt to secure private sector involvement however some proponents argue that agreem ents need to strike the right balance between protecting the private sector interest and the public interest in mobility and choice consequently concession agreemen ts seldom if ever ban all free road additions near the toll road and they usually provide for compensation for reduced traffic rather than forbidding publicsector roadway additions82 lease duration another effect on the tran sportation network some argue may result from the very longterm nature of some lease agreements terms on recent leases include 90 years for the chicago skyway 75 years for the indiana toll road and 80 years for the northern virginia hot lanes ppp proponents argue that long time horizons are needed to generate th returns necessary to compensate for the risks one concern is that this will tie the hands of policymakers for generations another concern with the leasing of exis ting facilities and the pa yment of an upfront concession fee is that future users may ve to pay higher tolls to finance current spending consequently some have suggested that agr eements should be relatively short and as general rule should not extend bey ond the design life of facility ppp proponents on the other hand argue that concession agreements typically include provisions that allow for reas onable amendments and for thirdparty arbitration of disagreements83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs26 84 government accountability office 2008 see also buxbaum jeffrey n and iris n oritz protecting the public interest the role of longterm concession agreements for providing transportation infrastructure us c keston institute for public finance and infrastructure policy research paper 0702 june 2007foreign control another concern of some oppone nts of ppps is that they often result in concession controlled by foreign company the predominant reason for this is that ppps are more prevalent in other countries particularly france spain and australia hence there are more companies from these countries that have experience with such transactions critics charge that this control might impede national security in an emergency and that the profits will go to foreign investors proponents of ppps point out that there is more risk to the united states from foreignowned companies than domestic ones after all they argue these foreign companies are willing to invest their m oney in an immovable asset proponents argue that this is good thing because it shows foreign investor s have confidence in the economic political and legal environment of the united states protecting the public interest in study of ppps in highway infrastructure provision the government accountability office gao states that these institutional arrangements offer num ber of benefits for states and localities but also present number of tradeoffs and potential problems they identify number of benefits such as the building of new facilities wit hout using public funds and more efficient operations among others they also identify the tradeoffs and problems with ppps such as possible higher toll rates and lack of public control as result the gao argues that as with an highway project there is not one easily identifiable public interest but multiple stakeholders with overlapping interests that must be weighed against each other they note to date that protecting the public interest in ppps has been done on projectbyproject basis through the terms of concession agreements they suggest that more systematic approach to identifying and evaluating the public interest in ppps be developed and employed as has been done in other countries such as australia they suggest that the federal government needs to identify and evaluate the national public interest in highway projects that employ ppp84 policy options for congress there are at least three broad policy opti ons that congress could consider in the formation and operation of ppps in surface tr ansportation infrastructure delivery 1 to continue with the current policy of incremental changes and experimentation in program incentives and regulation 2 to actively encourage ppps with program incentives but with relatively tight regulatory controls and 3 to aggressively encourage the use of ppps through program incentives and deregulation in the areas of tolling contracting and financing it should be pointed out that at the level of detailed policy prescriptions these three options are not necessarily mutually exclusive as congress could decide to deregulate in one area while enhancing regulation in another nd may add funding to one program and cut funding to another for example congress might deci to do away with regulations in the construction and operation of new highway capacity and at the same time develophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs27 tighter regulations in the leasing of existing highways nevertheless these three broad policy options provide an overall framework for congressional action on ppps the first broad policy option is to essentially carry on the path that has been followed over the past few authorizati ons one of incremental changes and experimentation as part of such policy congress may opt to generally reauthorize the existing programs and retain existing regulatory controls this cautious approach might avoid the major pitfalls of privat sector involvement but would likely mean slower growth in toll revenue and private equity inves tment than more aggressive approaches to the development of ppps consequently this approach would require substantial reliance on other funding mechan isms some minor changes to existing programs and regulations might include ex panding the number of available slots in the interstate system construction toll pilot program from the three currently permitted and continuing and expanding the pentap program in transit second option for congress would be to more aggressively promote the use of ppps particularly certain types but with set of new regulations designed to protect the public interest from their pe rceived problems this option might be considered federally directed program of ppp development and is an approach broadly similar to the one advocated by the majority report of the nstprsc the nstprsc report argues that congress should encourage the use of tolling congestion pricing and ppps but with number of conditions and restrictions the nstprsc proposes that states and their partners be give n the authority to variably toll new capacity on the interstate system as way to fund constr uction and to better manage the new lanes they also suggest that authority be given to implement congestion pricing on new and existing interstates in metropolitan areas with population of one million or more the commission argues that for proposals concerning tolling and pricing on the inters tates congress shoul d set up an approval process with strict criteria that includes requirements that reve nue be used only for transportation improvements in the same corridor rates be set to avoid discrimination against certain types of travelers such as interstate travelers or trucks technology be used to collect tolls and planning mu st consider the effects of diversion in encouraging ppps more generally the commission suggests congress require other criteria including high level of transparency in the development of such agreements full public participation nd full compliance with planning and environmental regulations they also suggest that ppp agreements should not contain noncompete clauses toll rates s hould be capped states should share in revenues over and above certain set amount concession agreements should not exceed reasonable length and an analysis be done to insure that private sector financing provides better value than public sector financing minority of nstprsc commissioners issued separate statement agreeing that congress should encourage the use of ppps but argued that these new regulations would stifle their formation as the minority statement in the report stated the commission proposes new federal regulations of state contracts with the private sector the commission report includes recommendations to replace what would otherwise be specifically negotiated terms and cond itions with

strangely subjects innovative forms of project delivery to greater federal scrutiny th an traditional procurement approaches the commission report would also subjec t private toll operators under contract with state to greater federal scrutin than the scrutiny to which local public toll authorities are subject there is basis for this distinction85 the commissions minority view theref ore suggests third broad policy option for congress to consider this op tion would more aggressively encourage ppps by providing program funding to encourage innovation and generally deregulating the use of tolling and private sector involvement thereby letting states decide when and how to enter into agreements this is also in general terms the position of the aashto officials as th ey note in their policy report on revenue source in transportation aashto has taken the position that ever state should be given all options possible for funding opportun ities in the areas of to lling and public private ventures so states can determine for them selves what is in the best interests of their citizens aashto has also embraced bold goal of increasing the percentage of toll revenues to 9 percent of the total for highway revenues nationally aashtos position is that federal policy should enable and encourage innovative finance tools and innovative contracting tools as well86 the federal role in such scenario may be mostly limited to providing guidance about instituting good practices and avoiding common pitfalls some past legislative proposals have linked regulation in the area of tolling and publicprivate partnerships with devoluti on of federal respons ibilities in highways and transit back to the states87 other policy options may arise from work being done by many different groups on surface transportation reauthorizati on proposals and recommendations one of the most important is the national surface transportation infrastructure finance commission nstifc second national commission established in safetea charged with developing recommendations fo r congress on the future federal role in funding surface transportation infrastruct ure an interim report was released february 1 200888 and final report is expected in 2009 among other things nstifc is expected to examine and make recommendations on the role that ppps might play in the future httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34567crs29 in addition to policy decisions at the federal level the future role of ppps will also depend in large measure on decisions at the state and local level states and localities rely on wide vari ety of funding sources othe r than federal aid including fuels taxes other motorvehicle taxes and fees sales and propert taxes and general fund appropriations the ability of states and localities to fund their systems with these revenue sources may determine how far and how fast ppps are deployed state and local innovation in ppps their succe sses and failures and ultimately public acceptance also will be key terminants of deployment federal influence on the prevalence and structure of ppps to some extent will be related to the amount of federal funding flowing to state and local governments an amount that is still largely dependent on th future financial health of the highway trust fund declining inflationadjusted revenues accruing to the trust fund as result of trends in fuel consumption and the level of prices in general may result in waning of federal influence on how highways and transit systems are built maintained and operated and the importance of ppps declining inflationadjusted revenues to the trust fund are not inevitable however the federal fuels tax is subject to change it has been raised several times in the past alternatively other federal funding mechanisms such as national in frastructure bonds or even general fund appropriations may emerge to fund greater share of federal programs consequently the federal role in shaping ppps likely will be important for some time to come
