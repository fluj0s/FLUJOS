divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33115cleanup after hurricane katrina environmental considerations summary local state and federal responders face numerous cleanup challenges associated with hurricane katrina in mississippi alabama and parts of louisiana much of the focus has been on restoring infrastructure and managing debris and waste in new orleans where most da mage was due to floodwaters the immediate tasks were unwatering nd evaluation of potential risk s from contaminated water sediment and air as floodwaters recede d debris management and infrastructure repair began monitoring and analysis of air water and resi dual sediment and soil continues to inform decisions about wh ether neig hborhoods are safe for returning residents local authorities with assistance from federal agencies have worked to determine how and where disa sterrelated wastes would be gathered separated and disposed this report provides an overview of the immediate and intermediate cleanup tasks and the federal role supporting these tasks state county and local municipalities ve jurisdiction with regard to cleanup after any natural catastrophe however becau the president issued major disaster declaration at the governors requests unde r the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act in response to hurricane katrina federal agencies have been broadly authorized to provide assistance federal cleanup assistance efforts are being coordinated by the army corps of engineers the corps the us coast guard and the environmental prot ection agency epa the corps has coordinated unwatering of new orleans assessment and repa ir of water and wastewater systems and nonhazardous debr is removal in conjunction with other emergency response activities such as filling levee breaches epa and the us coast guard have primary responsibility for assessing and managing releases of oil and other hazardous substances epa is also overseeing the co llection and disposal of electronic wastes eg computers and televisi ons and household hazardous wastes eg household cleaners pesticides many other federal agencies have also been contributing various expertise and assistance to the cleanup effort the greatest portion of katrinarelated disa ster debris was ge nerated in coastal mississippi and louisiana removal of that debris and waste tinues to be major concern the sheer volume of the debris nd scope of the destru ction together with the inability of significant percentage of the affected residents to return to their homes to address potential demolition and debris removal decisions ensures that the debris removal process will continue for many months to come throughout the katrinaaffected region drinking water nd sewage treatment plants were damaged most are ope rating again now however many require substantial repair or rec onstruction which will likely ta ke many months in new orleans some katrinagenerated waste was contaminated making the potential for toxic chemical exposure of returning residents significant concern sampling results of residue sediment s and air have indicated so sediment contamination with bacteria and chemicals possible health risks from contact with deposited sediment or with contaminants in dust as the sediments dry remain concern mold is another issue of concern this report will not be

events in 2005 struck the breadth of the gulf coast and caused significant damage including some of the same locations damaged by katrina the brunt of the hurricanerelated damage in the region resulted from hurricane katrina which thus has been at the center of the publics and policymakers attention 2 the 109th congress enacted two fy2005 emergenc supplemental appropriations bills pl 10961 and pl 10962 which appropr iated 623 billion for immediate relief and response needs an additional request of 198 billion in supplemental fy2006 funding for recovery assistance submitted by the admi

considerations introduction local state and federal responders f ace numerous cleanup challenges associated with the effects of hurricane katrina1 many of them unique due to the magnitude of events and specific features of communities affected the immediate need was to clear debris and control releas of hazardous substances that might have posed health and safety threat or hampered emergency response activities subsequently authorities initiated efforts to determine how and where the huge quantities of hurricane katr inarelated waste and debris hazardous and nonhazardous would be gathered separated nd ultimately disposed the 109th congress has been working to ddress the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in the gulf states which is on scale larger than any experienced by the united states in single natural disa ster incident in addition to supplemental funding2 number of legislative proposals re garding procedures and requirements for the response and recovery from supe r catastrophes are being debated and considered this report aims to provide an overview of envir onmental considerations raised by the immediate and intermed iate cleanup tasks across the diverse communities in the affected region and of federal legal aut horities and plans for tackling those tasks the report also discusses coordinated roles and activities among local state and federal agencies and official s finally the report serves to reference other more detailed crs re ports and other sources on particular katrina cleanup activities public health and environmental concerns

debris from emergency cleanup operations in the past bris from major disasters was most often buried or burned in the community much of the katrinagenerated debris that was handled in the immediate aftermath of the hurrica ne was burned burning is limited option however since only clean ie uncontaminated debris can be burned also citizens do not want to inhale the smoke from open burning further even if the smoke from burning operations is controlled it is not an option for waste containing hazardous constituents eg contaminated structures and their contents in new orleans or asbest oscontaining wastes 22 42 usc 69016991k 23 42 usc 74017671initially debris activities pr imarily involved removal from public land or rights of way such as roads or canals most ongoing debris re moval activities involve waste on private property in such cas the removal process generally entails collecting waste that has been left at the curbside of private property20 hauling the waste to staging area to segregate materials when the different types of waste are not separated by the individual leaving it curbside and hauling the waste to landfill reclamation facility ie site wh ere it will be recycled or reused in some manner or burning site21 debris is currently being separated with metals recycled white goods and electronic wastes havi ng hazardous components removed then recycled clean vegetative debris mulched and used for landfill cover in most areas and some vegetative debris burned and construction and demolition debris going to approved landfills of the debris collected so far in all areas comprehensive data are available delineating the percentage of debris that has been landfilled burned or reclaimed besides the tremendous volume of debris another complicating factor in the debris removal proce ss has been the scope of katrin as destruction most natural disasters in the united states have invol ved destruction over relatively small area eg 500 square miles for hurricane andrew typically residents evacuate the area during an emergency and return afterward to assist with the cleanup eg remove debris from their property and leave it for curbside pickup th declared disaster area for hurricane katrina covered 90000 square miles and included major metropolitan area new orleans and the entir coast of mississippi the destruction to homes and infrastructure was so great that many residents have been unable to return meaning that substantial amount of debris on private property has yet to be removed laws governing debris removal most of the debris generated as result of hurricane katrina must be managed in accordance with certain provisions of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra22 and the clean air act23 rcra applies to the

significant health risk particularly to children returning to highly contaminated areas61 interpreting the significance of these findings is complicated by the fact that at least some of the contamination existed before katrina flooded new orleans in 2004 researchers analyzed nearly 5000 soil samples from across the city and found that 40 of new orleans soils exceed epa s lead cleanup

and possible soil cleanup in th state of louisiana some hot spots in residential neighborhoods have levels of contamination that are ten times or even more than hundred times normal soil cleanup levels63 louisiana officials responded to th groups report by saying that it misrepresents epa and state data by using state screening standards that indicate if detected concentrations in soil require further evaluation or management and presenting them as healthbased standards concentration greater than the states screening level does not mean the levels are going to pose an unacceptable health risk especially because health risk levels are based on assuming that individuals are continuously exposed to that concentrati on for 30year period rather than the shorterterm generally associated with posthurricane exposures64 the controversy about sediment contam ination highlights the difficulty that public officials face in trying to inform the public about potential risks from short term exposure to pollutants when healthbased standards that regulators use to establish emission controls or discharge limitations are based on risks from longterm exposurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33115crs21 65 for information see http wwwepagovkatrina testresultsairair quality mold and vector concerns epa scientists are concerned that air pollution may result not only from ch emical spills and releases at industrial plants but also may emanate from contaminated sediments as contaminated sediments dry they may release pollutants that can be resuspended as dust for example vehicular traffic that disrupts sediments on previously flooded roadways can resuspend or aerosolize fine powdery dust that presents an inhalation hazard in addition some scientists are concerned that as flooded areas dry out some of the pathogens in the contaminated water will become airborne epa began screening air quality in hurricaneaffected areas on august 30 to provide an initial assessment of air quality in coordination with louisiana and mississippi epa has been monitoring air quality since the storms to assess damage from the hurricanes as well as problems that could occur as result of cleanup and restoration activities epa and state officials continue to work to restore the stationary air quality monitoring network sites in louisiana and mississippi which were heavily damaged portable and mob ile collection devices an epa helicopter buses and an air force plane continue to be used to monitor air quality where stationary networks have not been restored sampling has been done to test for metals eg lead and arsenic vocs pahs particulate matter and other pollutants early screening results indicated that chemical concentrations in the air were below atsdr health standards and that longterm exposure year or more at the levels detected would be re quired for health effects to be of concern the sampling identified particle po llution at levels considered moderate meaning that unusually sensitive people should consider avoiding vi gorous exercise however samples were not collected with standard monitors meaning that the mix of particles in the screening samples cannot easily be compared to epa standards epa cautioned that initial sampling did not represent air qua lity conditions throughout the region and should not be used to make general characterizations while measurements for most pollutants reported were below epas health based screening levels for chemicals monitoring at certain sites showed elevated levels of some pollutants acrolein nd formaldehyde for example at the concentrations measured mporary irritation of the eyes nose and throat could result epa said that elevated exposures would not be acceptable on regular basis extended over weeks at time but isolated exposures to such concentrations are not believed to be associated w ith longterm health problems65 significant concern associated with the cleanup is the potential for health hazards due to the presence of molds mildew and other fungi in soggy damaged structures the excess moisture and standing water resulting from katrina contributed to the growth of molds in homes and other buildings particularly in the new orleans area where 6080 of reside ntial structures sustained severe flood damage and experienced conditions conduc ive to mold

cdc also said that there are criteria for using either the concentration or type of mold in buildings to make informed decisions66 health authorities remain alert to the fact that mold may emerge as one of the environmental health challenges in coming months related issue is an increase of rodents and insects that might carry diseases such as west nile virus hurricane ka trina compounded louisianas insect problem on several levels including forcing the evacuation of standard vector control personnel destroying vector disease control equipment and dramatically increasing the number of stagnant bodies of wate r throughout new orleans and surrounding parishes which serve as ideal breeding gr ounds for insects like mosquitoes medical personnel from the us navy worked with the cdc and louisiana department of public health to eliminate vectorborne disease and other insectrelated problems associated with mosquitoes however because spraying for mosquito control can affect workers in the region spraying wa s used conservatively according to the navy epa worked with state agencies fe ma and others to expedite any requests needed for pesticide use and also worked with manufacturers to make sure that adequate supplies of pes ticides were available water discharged into lake pontchartrain while necessary to the overall cleanup from the hurricane katrina the water removal from new orleans raised number of concerns removal involved pumping the floodwater into lake pontchartrain an option that was necessari ly expedient but not necessarily ideal because contamination in the lake could rm aquatic plants and animals as noted above because of geography the city lacks sufficient natural drainage for the water to remove itself pumping it into the mississippi river was not viable option as the floodwater could conta minate river water which is the source of the citys drinking water supply treatment of the contaminated floodwaters prior to discharge was not possible because of the need to unwater the city rapidly and the unavailability of full treatment technology nor wa s it possible to hold the pumped water somewhere to filter out pollution the corps took some steps to remove wastes prior to discharge into the lake such as putting booms and skimmers in place at outfalls to trap floating material and debris and installing aeration units in canals in unwatering new orleans the corps pumpe d the equivalent of 5 of the lakes volume back into the lake the conta minated floodwaters were low in dissolved oxygen because of the presence of oxygenconsuming matter in

quality assisted by such federal partners as the us geological survey usgs began testing lake pontchartrain to assess short term and longterm ffects of discharging pumped water into the lake and the

especially esf 10 epa and corps of engineers sta ff have conducted ssessments providing assistance to state and local government personnel to evaluate damages steps involved in actually restoring service include drying out and cleaning engines testing and repairing waterlogged electrical systems testing for toxic chemicals that may have infiltrated pipes and plants restor ing pressure drinking water distribution lines activating disinfection units restoring bacteria needed to treat wastes wastewater plants and cleaning repair ing and flushing distribution and sewer lines damages at many facilities included loss of electric power to pump process and treat raw water supply and wastewater as electric power was restored many of the affected systems were able to restor needed services although some drinking water facilities are still operating under boilwater notices pending test results to ensure that the water has been restored to standards safe for pub lic consumption the number of sites that were offline ch anged frequently by october 10 2005 epa reported that more than 85 of drinking water and 95 of wastewater treatment facilities in the affected region were operational however epa estimated that facilities not operating or with unknown status normally served about 200000 drinking water customers and more than half million wastewater customers by december epa reports indicated that all wastewater treatment plants in mississippi and alabama were considered to be opera tional in louisiana small number of wastewater treatment plants were not yet operational including three large facilities serving about 150000 customers nearly all drinking wate r treatment plants throughout the region also had restored at least partial service although about 5 remained under boil

or where available are consid ered preliminary in 2006 the epa inspector general reported that louisiana and mississippi officials estimate that about 615 million will be needed in thos two states for public water system replacements and repairs due to hurricane katrina71 in louisiana and mississippi officials estimated in february that costs to repair those states damaged wastewater infrastructure exceed 13 billion with about 12 bi llion needed just in new orleans as noted however all such estimates are very rough impacts on new orleanss water systems were particularly severe in the central portion of the city in addition to electric power impairments extensive damage occurred from flooding of treatment plants drinking water distribution lines and collector and interceptor sewers and the water systems power plant even after restoration of electricity cleanup and reco very at flooded water and sewage treatment plants are taking considerable time the first task was to remove excess stormwater which required extensive repair of the citys stormwater system including levees and drainage pumps once floodwaters were addressed drinking water restoration became the next priority the largest of the citys two drinking water plants located where the worst flooding took place was completely underwater for nearly two weeks it was repaired sufficiently to pr ovide flow ie for fire fighting but may not be capable of providing potable water for some time officials say the issue with regard to drinking water in this area is large numbers of waterline breaks resulting from house connections that were damaged when trees fell fire hydrants that were damaged by debris or debris cl eanup efforts and lines that were crushed or fractured by the weight of floodwaters affected areas remain under boil water advisories or are receiving drinking wa ter from tanker trucks and emergency pilot scale treatment plants for flooded areas sewage trea tment often is the last thing back online because plants are at the lowest point of the city to take advantage of gravity and thus were under the deepest water new orleanss two wastewater treatment plants were damaged the larger f acility which serves 12 million customers was flooded until the end of september and standing water significantly damaged pumps and electrical equipment this plant partially restored service in october and was able to provide secondary treatment of wastes by midnovember but numerous continuing operational problems persist including po wer disruptions leaks and equipment difficulties the citys public works offici als reportedly believe that much of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33115crs27 sewer system has probably been damaged and cracks leaks and breaks will need to be fixed by tearing up roads although road repairs already may be required as part of the overall cleanup effort pot entially lengthy repair process ironically one problem facing new orleans and number of other communities that were extensively damaged by the hurri canes is lack of customers although the majority of water and sewer facilities have been able to resume operations some are not in use because displaced citizens ve been unable to return some of the systems considered to be ope rational are serving only small percentage of their pre katrina customers thus there is little or population present for utilities to serve meaning that there is insufficient demand for drinking water or waste flowing into wastewater treatment plants for normal operations and utilities are unable to collect revenues needed to pay existing bills repair or maintain their facilities or make payments on bonds potential challenges and issues the enormity of the tasks associated with cleaning up from natural disaster on the scale of hurricane katrina is probabl unprecedented and likely to exceed others in this countrys history in terms of sc ope duration and cost an overriding issue concerns the effectiveness of current fe deral roles and whet her existing federal cleanup authorities are adequate to address the damage cause d by disaster as large scale as hurricane katrina the range of tasks described in this report have occurred and will continue to occur over varying periods of time from th immediate res ponses of reducing threats to public health and safety to assessing hurricane katrinas impacts to removing repairing and re building and to longterm monitoring of the impacts of actions that are taken to mitigate the storms damages each of these phases of cleanup which reflect continuum more th an discrete steps presents numerous challenges and issues some of these issues are listed below the scale of the cleanup both geog raphic and volume represents huge management challenge for all levels of government and the private sector potential concerns include adequacy of landfill capacity health and safety of cl eanup workers and capability of or community resistance to applying best practices for waste management potential longterm ecological effects if any that may result from recovery measures such as disc harging contaminated floodwaters from new orleans into lake pontchartrain the volume of stormrelated waste containing hazardous materials and the difficulty in separating hazardous and nonhazardous wastes the limited number of homeowners that have returned to new orleans stretches the debris re moval process out indefinitelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33115crs28 except under certain conditions prope rty owners will be responsible for debris removal and decisions to demolish private properties the potential for homes to contain asbestos slows the demolition and renovation process for those hom that have been cleared for demolition moreover human remain s are still being found in the rubble demolition of structure ca nnot be undertaken quickly if it is determined that it is possible that human remains are inside the ongoing need to balance public health protection with allowing access to homes and businesses public involvement in cleanup d ecisions the public especially residents of the affected region has strong interest in the cleanup since they will experi ence impacts of those actions keeping the public well informed and involved is critical but also has been difficult especially in the early aftermath of the storm events understanding and communicating th nature and degree of risks to public health and the environment associated with contaminants identified in water soil and air this issue is complicated by the difficulty in knowing whether contaminant levels represent pollution generated solely by the hurricane from leaks or spills for example or if they are legacy problems that preexisted in the environment before the storm occurred furthe r public officials are unable to effectively assure residents that the posthurricane environment is safe because the standards being applied do not clearly distinguish between longterm health concerns and screening determinations to identify necessary remediationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33115crs29 appendix 1 table 1 federal departmentagency cleanup
