legislation domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33975vulnerable youth background and policies summary the majority of young people in the ited states grow up healthy and safe in their communities most of those of sc hool age live with parents who provide for their wellbeing and they attend schools that prepare th em for advanced education or vocational training and ultimately selfsufficiency many youth also receive assistance from their families during the tran sition to adulthood during this period young adults cycle between attending sc hool living independently and staying with their families on average parents gi ve their children an estimated 38000 or about 2200 year while they are between the ages of 18 and 34 to supplement wages pay for college tuition and assist with dow n payments on house among other types of financial help even with this assistance the current move from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and increasingly complex for vulnerable or atrisk youth popul ations the transition to adulthood is further complicated by number of challenges including family conflict or abandonment and obstacles to securing em ployment that provi des adequate wages and health insurance these youth may be prone to outcomes that have negative consequences for their future development as responsible selfsufficient adults risk outcomes include teenage parenthood hom elessness drug abuse delinquency physical and sexual abuse and school dr opout detachment from the labor market and school or disconnectedne ss may be the single strongest indicator that the transition to adulthood has not been ma successfully pproximately 18 million noninstitutionalized civilian youth are not working or in school the federal government s not adopted single ove rarching federal policy or legislative vehicle that addresses the challenges vulnerable youth experience in adolescence or while making the transition to adulthood rather federal youth policy today has evolved from multiple programs established in the early 20th century and expanded in the years following the 1964 announcement of the war on poverty these programs are concentrated in six areas workforce development education juvenile justice and deli nquency prevention social services public health and national and community service they ar intended to provide vulnerable youth with opportunities to develop skills to assist them in adulthood despite the range of federal services and activities to assist disadvantaged youth many of these programs have not developed into cohere nt system of support this is due in part to the administration of programs within several agencies and the lack of mechanisms to coordinate their activities in res ponse to concerns about the complex federal structure veloped to assist vulnerabl youth congress passed the tom osborne federal youth coordi nation act pl 109365 in 2006 this legislation like predecessor

initiatives that promote coordination among federal agencies nd support programs with positive youth development focus overview age of youth and the transition to adulthood for the purposes of this report youth refers to adolescents and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24 under th is definition there are approximately 60 million youth or 21 of the population in the united states1 although traditional definitions of youth include adolescents ages 12 to 18 cultural and economic shifts have protracted the period of adolescence children as young as 10 are included in this range because puberty begins at this age for some youth and experiences in early adolescence often shape endur ing patterns of behavior2 older youth up to age 24 are in the process of transitioning to dulthood many young people in their mid20s attend school or begin to wor k and some live with their parents or other relatives the current move from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and more complex3 youth of the 1950s were more likely to follow an orderly path to adulthood they generally completed thei r education andor secured employment for males including military service which was followed by marriage and parenthood in their early 20s this was not true for every young person for example african americans and immigrants in certain parts of the country faced barriers to employment unlike thei r postwar counterparts who had access to plentiful jobs in the industrial sector youth today must compete in global informationdriven economy many more youth now receive vocational training or

report rs22501 child welfare the chafee foster care independence program cfcip by adrienne fernandesperiod of transition young adults cy cle between attending school living independently and staying with their parents they also use this time to explore career options and relationships with poten tial longterm partners the median age of first marriage has risen each decade since the 1950s with 27 now being the median age for men and 25 the median age for women5 these choices enable youth to delay becoming financially independent which can cr eate financial burden for their families on average parent s give their child ren an estimated 38000 or about 2200 year between the ages of 18 and 34 to supplement wages pay for college tuition and help with housing co sts among other types of financial assistance6 parents also provide support by allowing their adult children to live with them or providing child care for their gr andchildren approxima tely 23 of adults ages 23 to 27 lived with one or both of their parents in 20037 programs that assist youth making the transition to adulthood also recognize that adolescence is longer finite period ending at age 18 since fy2003 the chafee foster care education and training vouc hers program has pr ovided vouchers worth up to 5000 annually per youth who is agin g out of foster care or was adopted from foster care after 16 years of age8 the vouchers are available for the cost of attendance at an institution of higher edu cation as defined by the higher education act of 1965 youth receiving voucher at ag 21 may continue to participate in the voucher program until age 23 further the changing concept of the age of adulthood is gaining currency among organizations and f oundati ons that support and study youth development

live with parents who provide for their emotional and ec onomic wellbeing and they attend schools that prepare them for continuing education or the workforce and ultimately self sufficiency approximately onequarter of todays youth will graduate from four year college or university10 nonetheless some young people do not grow up in secure environment or with parents that provide comprehensive system of support these youth often live in impoverish ed neighborhoods nd come to school unprepared to learn even youth who have adequate academic and emotional support may experience greater challenges as they transition to adulthood there is universal definition of the terms vulnerable or atrisk youth and some believe that these labels should not be used because of their potentially stigmatizing effects11 the terms have been used to denote individuals who experience emotional and adjustment problem s are at risk of dropping out or lack the skills to succeed after graduation12 they have also been used to suggest that youth grow up in unstable family or community environments13 researchers policymakers and youth advocates howev er might agree to this definition vulnerable youth have charact eristics and experiences that put them at risk of developing problem behavior s and outcomes that have the potential to hurt their community themselves or both14 at risk does not necessarily mean youth has already experienced negative outcomes but it suggests that negative outcomes are more likely youth may also experience different levels of risk on risk continuum

ex periencing poor outcomes as they enter adulthood16 these groups include but are not limited to the following youth emancipating from foster care runaway and homeless youth youth involved in the juvenile justice system immigrant youth and youth with limited english proficiency lep youth with physical and mental disabilities youth with mental disorders and youth receiving special education some researchers have also classified ot her groups of vulnerable youth based on risk outcomes young unmarried mothers hi gh school dropouts and disconnected eg not in school nor working youth among the seven groups listed above so lack financial assistance and emotional support from their families former foster youth for example often do not have parents who can provi financial assistance while they attend college or vocational schools other vulnerable yout h have difficulty securing employment because of their disabilities mental illne ss juvenile justice records or other challenges vulnerable youth who have depended on public syst ems of support often lose needed assistance at the age of majority17 many will lose health insurance coverage vocational services and supplementary income18 they will also face challenges in accessing adult public syst ems where professionals are not always trained to address the special needs of young adults regardless of their specific risk factors groups of vulnerabl youth share many of the same barriers to successfully transitioning into their 20s figure 1 below shows the approximate num ber or percentage of youth who belong to each

of access to systems of care such as health care and vocational assistance19 youth may also be members of multiple vulnerable populations for instance former foster youth are particularly at ri sk of becoming homeless each year about 20000 youth age out of foster care and of these youth bout twofifths r eceive independent living services20 emancipated youth may have inadequate housing supports21 even if states made available all federal funds under the chafee foster care independence program for housing each emancipated youth would receive less than 800 per year22 recently emancipated foster youth also tend to be less economically secure than their counterpa rts in the general youth population because they earn lower wages and are more likely to forego college and vocational training23 their economic vulnerability can place them at risk of losing their housing figure 1 shows the overlap that exists among so of the seven groups of youth note figure 1 does not include all possible

wellbeing of youth poverty community conditions and family structure are three primary antecedents of risk poverty is linked to number of potentia l future problems among youth including low professional attainment and meager future earnings an analysis that utilized data from the national longitudinal rvey of youth and us census tract information for 1980 to 1990 estimated that adolescents ages 14 to 22 who grew up in relatively high poverty metropolita n neighborhoods had lesser likelihood as adults of being employed25 other macrolevel forces the location of employers and the erosion of the manufacturing sect or can also limit the jobs available to poor youth who live in urban areas26 some analyses have found that youths place of residence in proximity to jobs affects their labor market i nvolvement independent of other factors27 jobs in the manufacturing sector have been replaced by the growth of the service and hightechnology sectors jobs requiring tec hnical and managerial skills28 youth who drop out of school or do not pursue postsecondary education cannot easily compete for available jobs markers of risk also suggest that youth will experience negative outcomes in adolescence and beyond markers of risk are tangible indicators that can be measured or documented in public record s low school performance and involvement in the child welfare system are

data used definition of disconnectedness to include noninstitutio nalized youth ages 16 through 24 who did not work anytime during previous year due primarily to reason other than school and were presently usu ally march or april of th current year not working or in school the definition excludes youth who are married to connected partner and are parenting on the assumption that these young people work in the home and rely on financial and social support from their spouses thus young people who are married without children to connected or disconnected partner or are cohabiting with or without children meet the definiti on of being disconnected according to this definition 18 million youth or 49 percen t of the general youth population ages through 24 were disconnected in 200733

to adulthood positive adolescent development is facilitated when youth express independence from their parents yet rely on their pare nts for emotional support empathy and advice parenting styles and family structure play important roles in the lives of youth parents who discipline in moderate and caring manner and provide positive sanctions for prosocia l behaviors can assist youth to develop sense of control over their future family structures that promote positive parentchild relationships even after divorce or times of stress such as separation or loss of parent can provide youth with emotional and other support during adolescence and beyond the youth development movement the belief that all youth are assets has formed the basis of the youth devel opment movement that began in the

guidance for program planners and policymakers about prioritizing which outh to serve given the limited resources available to communities for youth programs they have also criticized the lack of sufficient evaluation of programs and organizations using positive development approach according to these advocates some youth development efforts have been built on insufficient data about demand for or supply of programs and were started without baseline data on reasona ble youth indicators furthe r they argue that youth development messages have at times failed to generate excitement among policymakers because they did not conve how positive youth development policy and programs could respond to the challenges young people face and lead to better outcomes for youth and society at large in turn the movement has failed to adequately link to local and re gional infrastructures that ssist with funding training and network development to address these challenges youth advocat the same groups that have raised criticisms about the moveme nt have proposed number of recommendations for example the forum for youth has urged dvocates to clarify youth development message that specifies

delivery of social services to children youth and their families through improved coordination at the state and local levels101 in its report supporting the acts coordinating provisions the senate labor and human resources committee noted102 the committee is concerned that the current system of service is fragmented and disjointed making it difficult if not im possible for children and families who are being served in one system to access needed services from another this creates situation in which problems of children and families not only go unmet but undetected and unresolved through th inclusion of these proposals the committee hopes to articulate national commitment to our nations children youth and families and to encourage greater cooperation at federal state and local levels federal council on children youth and families the federal council on children youth nd families was authorized by the young americans act to address concerns about the fragmentation and duplica tion of services for youth at the federal and local levels the act provided that the council comprise representatives from federal agencies and st ate or local agencies that serve youth rural and urban

youth and identifying duplication of services for these youth and 3 making recommendations to the president and c ongress to streamline services reduce duplication of services and encourage coor dination of services for youth and their families at the state and local levels the act was amended in 1994 pl 103252 to require that the council also identify program regulations pr actices and

deficitbased models which focus primarily on specific youth problems federal legislation and initiatives have been framed through the youth development philosophy with the goal of providing resources and guidance to communities and youthfocused programs that engage young people in roles as full participants in the work place community and society at large major legislation with positive youth approach has included the youth development community block grant of 1995 hr 2807s 673 nd the younger americans act of 2001 hr 17s 1005 both of which did not pa ss out of committee the administration

near ly two dozen federal youth programs administered by the us departments of education health and human services and justice the purpose of the legislation was to shift from system of categorical

interrelated programs must consider the overall development of individual oungsters rather than focusing on one problem in isolation our current syst em of narrowly defined categorical programs is rather like the pieces of jigsaw puzzle scattered over card table the ydcbg puts these pieces together111 the ydbcg act did not prescribe specific activities or program types for which the funds were to be used rather the legislation would have required states to submit plan to hhs that outlined their youth development priorities funding would have flowed to local community boards which would have tailored local ydcbg programs to community needs consistent with the goals of these plans funding from the block grant could only supplement and not supplant existing funds for youth development programs and activities the block grant was to be based on three equally weighted formula factors the proportion of the nations total youth defined as ages 6 to 17 that reside in each state proportion of the nations poor youth defined as youth from lowincome families that reside in each state and the average incidence of juvenile crime during the most recent fouryear period this 900 million proposed grant would have been funded through the programs that were be eliminated with 10 overall reduction the legislation was referred out of committee in both the house and senate but was not taken up again younger americans act of 2001 hr 17s 1005 the goal of the younger americans ac t of 2001 hr 17s 1005 was to create national youth policy that would have f unded network of youth

youth consisting of 1 ongoing relationships with caring adults 2 safe places with structured ac tivities 3 access to services that promote healthy lifestyles including those designed to improve

between those states and local juri sdictions and indian tribes the purpose of the projects is to facilitate communica tion and cooperation am ong different levels of government and the nonprofit sector that provide services to young people and to energize local constituencies around the issu of youth development for example one of the projects in chicago illinoi s has forged community

examined the federal role in supporting these youth although precise number of vulnerable youth cannot be aggregated and should not be due to data constraints these youth are generally concentrated among seven groups youth aging out of foster care runaways and homeless youth juvenile justiceinvolved youth immigrant youth and youth with limited english proficiency lep youth with physical and mental disabilities youth with mental disorders and youth receiving special education each of these categories is co mprised of youth with distinct challenges and backgrounds however many of these youth share common experiences such as unstable home and neighborhood environments coupled with challenges in school without protective factors in place vulnerable youth may have difficulty transitioning to adulthood detachment from the labor market and school orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33975crs48 disconnectedness is perhaps the single st rongest indicator that the transition has not been made adequately despite the negative forecast for the employment and education prospects of vulnerable youth some youth experience positive outcomes in adulthood youth who develop strong co gnitive emotional and vocational skills among other types of competencies have greater opportunities to reach their goals advocates for youth promote the belief th at all youth have assets and can make valuable contributions to their communities despite their challenges the federal government has not deve loped single overarching policy or program to assist vulnerable youth like the older americans act program for the elderly since the 1960s number of pr ograms many operating in isolation from others have worked to address the specific needs ie vocational educational social services juvenile justice and delinquency prevention and health of these youth more recently policymakers have taken step s toward more comprehensive federal response to the populati on the youthbuild transfer act of 2006 moved the youthbuild program from hud to dol becau the program is more aligned with dols mission of administering workforce nd training programs also in 2006 the tom obsborne youth coordination act wa s passed to improve coordination across federal agencies that administer programs for vulnerable youth nd to assist federal agencies with evaluating these programs in february 2008 president bush signed an executive order establishing fede ral interagency working group on youth programs other coordinating efforts such as the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention council and shared youth vision initiative may have the resources and leadership to create more unified fe deral youth policy albeit the jjdpc has primary focus on juvenile justice involved youth in addition

communities has not been reported out of committee the 1995 youth development community block grant and 2001 younger americans act would have provided grant funding to the states with the greatest
