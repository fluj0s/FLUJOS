drought in diﬀerent region and why drought occurs in the united states it brieﬂy discusses periods of drought in the countrys past that equaled or exceeded drought conditions experienced during the 20th century including periods during earlier centuries where the american west was substantially drier on average than it is today this is followed by discussion of the prospects for future climate in the west that may be drier than the average 20th century climate perhaps similar to drier periods centuries ago the report concludes with discussion of policy challenges for congress such as the existing federalnonfederal split in drought response and management and the patchwork of drought programs subject to oversight by multiple congressional committees these policy challenges may become increasingly more diﬃcult to address in the face of changing climate that could exacerbate drought conditions in some regions of the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580 order code rl34580 drought in

states causes and issues for congress summary drought is commonly defined as defici ency of precipitation over an extended period of time usually season or more relative to some longterm average condition droughts have aff licted the united states particularly the american west for centuries drought affects societies because of the combination of reduced supply eg less precipitation reduced rese rvoir levels lower groundwater table and competing demand eg for irrigation municipal and industrial supply energy production species protection this re port focuses on the physical causes of drought its history in the united states and what may be expected in the near future although currently drought can be predicted for particular region for at best few months in advance past history suggest s that severe and extended droughts are inevitable and part of natural climate cycles particularly in the west drought concerns are increasing as so studies suggest that the american west may be in transition to more arid climate more prone to extreme drought than was the norm during most of the 20th century while drought is most common in the west drought can also provoke water resource conflicts in other parts of the country for example the 20072008 drought in the southeast has heightened longstanding dispute over water in th apalachicolachattahoocheeflint river basin even though the three states at odds with each other georgia alabama and florida receive more rainfall in dry years than many western states receive in average years the physical conditions causing drought in the united states are increasingly understood to be linked to sea surface temper atures ssts in the tropical pacific ocean studies indicate that coolerthanaverage ssts have been connected to the recent severe western drought vere droughts of the late 19th century and precolonial north american megadroughts some climate model projections suggest that warming temperatures resu lting from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could return the western united states to more arid baseline conditions within decades ie conditions s imilar to those during earlier times the prospect of extended droughts and mo re arid baseline conditions in parts of the united states could present new ch allenges to federal water projects the construction of which was based largely on 20th century climate conditions in responding to competing demands for wate r eg deliveries to serve agricultural demands versus supporting endangered speci federal water delivery systems may have to be retuned to match drier average climate in the west the evolving nature of drought sp lit federal and nonfe deral responsibilities and patchwork of federal programs and congressional committee jurisdictions make development of comprehens ive national drought policy difficult while congress has considered some of th recommendations issued by the national drought policy commission in 2000 comprehensive drought legislation has not been enacted congress may wish to review responses to the 20072008 southeast drought as well as revisit recommendations of th national drought policy

10 of the country is typically experiencing drought of at least moderate intensity1 over the last eight years as much as 45 of the country has been affected by at least moderate intensity drought at one time2 over the same time span extreme or exceptional drought affected an average of approximately 7 of the nation by area3 i n t h 2 0st century droughts in the 1930s and 1950s were particularly severe at the maximum geographic extent of the 1930s drought in 1934 65 of the contiguous united states was affected by severe to extreme drought conditions4 how droughts are classified and what is meant by moderate severe and extreme drought classification is discussed further below drought has afflicted tions of north america for thousands of years particularly in the west although severe drought has also occurred in the more humid mississippi valley and southeastern united states severe longlasting droughts may have been an im portant factor in the disint egration of pueblo society in the southwest during the 13th century and in the demise of central and lower mississippi valley societies in the 14th through 16th centuries5 severe drought has occurred and will likely continue to occur periodically in the united states the likelihood of extended periods of severe drought simila r to conditions experiencedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs2 6 ndmc at httpwwwdrought

ponds 8 ndmc at httpwwwdrought unleduwhatisconcepthtmcenturies ago and its effects on 21st century society in the united states raise several issues for congress the recurrence of drought is of concer n to congress for many reasons drought often results in significant agricultural losses which can have widespread effects it can also impact other industries nd services including power production navigation recreation and na tural resources such as fisheries and water quality addressing these impacts on an emergency basis is costly often resulting in hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars in federal assistance additionally drought affects management of federal rese rvoirs and in many cases exacerbates existing tensions among competing uses this report discusses how drought is fined eg why drought in one region of the country is different from drought in different region and why drought occurs in the united states it briefly di scusses periods of drought in the countrys past that equaled or exceeded drought conditions experienced during the 20th century including periods during earlier centuries wh ere the american west was substantially drier on average than it is

concludes with discussion of policy challenges for c ongress such as the existing federalnon federal split in drought re sponse and management and the patchwork of drought programs subject to oversight by multiple congressional committees these policy challenges may become increasingly more difficult to address in the face of changing climate that could exacerbate dr ought conditions in some regions of the country what is drought drought has number of definitions6 the simplest conceptual definition may be deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time usually season or more drought is usually considered relative to some longterm average condition or balance between precipitation eva poration and transpiration by plants evaporation and transpiration are typically combined into one term evapotranspiration7 an imbalance could result fro m decrease in precipitation or an increase in evapotranspiration from drie r conditions higher temperatures higher winds or both it is important to distinguish between drought which has beginning and an end and aridity which is restricted to low rainfall regions and is relatively permanent feature of climate eg deserts are regions of relatively permanent aridity8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs3 9 see us drought monitor at h ttpwwwdroughtunledudmmonitorhtml 10 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration

reported in an index known as the us drought monitor which synthesizes va rious drought indices and impacts and represents consensus view of ongoing drought conditions between academic and federal scientists drought is relative normal conditions can vary considerab ly from region to region for example in early april 2008 extreme drought s imultaneously gripped south texas and northeast alabama according to the us drought monitor9 see figure 1 however extreme drought means something di fferent to the city of laredo in south texas than it does for the city of huntsv ille in northeast alabama laredo receives an average total of 262 inches of rain from january through march of each year10 in contrast huntsville receives an averag of 172 inches over the same time period11 in 2008 huntsville received 1126 inches fro m january through march four times the average precipitation for laredo but only 65 of what huntsville normally receives each city received abnormally low rainfall in the first quarter of 2008 but what is normal for each city is different to deal with these differences meteorologists use the term meteorological drought usually defined as the degree of dryness relative to some average amount of dryness and relative to th duration of the dry period meteorological drought is regionspecific because atmospheric cond itions creating precipi tation deficiencies vary from region to region both huntsv ille and lare do tx experienced meteorological drought in the first quart er of 2008 even though each city received different amounts of rainfall drought is multifaceted the drought monitor uses an to indicate that the primary physical effects are agricultural crops pastures and gra sslands and an h to indicate that the primary impacts are hydrological to water supplies such as rivers groundwater and reservoirs12 when both effects are apparent the letters are combined appearing as ah on drought monitor maps see figure 1 to continue the

discussed below source us drought monitor at httpwww droughtunledudmmonito rhtml on april 8 2008 drought classification to assess and classify the intensity nd type of drought certain measures or drought indices are typically used drought intensity in turn is the trigger for local state and federal responses th at could lead to the flow of billions of dollars in relief to droughtstricken regions13 the classification of drought intensity such as that shown in figure 1 may depend on single indicator or several indicators often combined with expert opinion from the acad emic public and private sectors the us drought monitor uses five key indicators14 together with expert opinion with indices to account for conditions in the west where snowpack is relatively important and with other indices used mainly during the growing season15 the drought monitor intensity scheme d0 to d4 is used to depict broadscale conditions but figure 1 example of drought conditions map in the united

the large regions depicted as red in figure 1 faced severe drought conditions in early 2008 but they may contain local areas and individual communities that experienced less or more severe drought the and h terms shown on figure 1 give additional information on the nature of the drought in the affected region agricultural drought can be defined as when there is insufficient moisture to meet the needs of particular crop at particular time16 for example deficient topsoil moisture during planting might hinder germination and affect the final yield even if moisture is replenished later in the growing season however if enough moisture is available for early growth requirements although below normal levels the final yield may not be affected if subsoil moisture is replenished ove r the length of the growing season17 hydrological drought h can be define d as deficiencies in water supplies as measured by stream flows lake or reser voir levels or eleva tion of the ground water surface hydrological drought usually lags behind agricultural drought because it takes longer for deficiencies in precipitati on to affect the broader hydrologic system lack of rainfall during critical part of the growing season may have an immediate impact on farmers an agricultural drought but the deficiency may not affect reservoir or river leve ls for many months18 because hydrological drought affects the broader hydrologic system such as one or several river basins severe hydrological drought could exacerbate competition among water uses irrigation navigation recreation energy producti on preservation of endangered species and others an example of hydrological drought is the drought in the southeastern united states which includes northeast alabama and the city of huntsville in the example discussed above as well as atlanta and northeast georgi persistent severe drought in the region beginning with belo waverage rainfall in the spring of 200619 exacerbated an ongoing interstate conflict among alabama florida and georgia over water allocation in the apalachicolacha ttahoocheeflint acf river system the decision to draw down lake lanier the uppermost federal rese rvoir in the

state governor for locality or region of the united states it sets in motion series of alerts recommendations activities and possible restrictions at the local regional or state level depending on the drought length and severity ultimately multiyear severe drought could initiate federa l response and transfer of fe deral dollars to the affected area before drought severity reaches level requiring fede ral response however many states take action often according to their version of drought management plan22 for example the governor of alabam issued drought declaration on march 21 2008 placing the 10 northernmost countie s under an emergency drought level in accordance with the draft alabama drought management plan23 the emergency drought level for alabama is its most ex treme category of drought according to alabamas plan declaring drought does not automatically invoke required response from the various cat egories of water users24 however upon confirmation of drought emergency the governors ffice may issue public statements that drought emergency exists disaster declar ations and the appropriate implementation of water conservation and dr ought emergency ordinances25 federal aid if the effects of drought overwhelm state or local resources the president at the request of the state governor is au thorized under the stafford act 42 usc 5121 et seq to issue major disaster or em ergency declarations that result in the distribution of federal ai d to affected parties26 for example on october 20 2007 the governor of georgia requested presid ential drought disaster declaration because of prolonged exceptional drought conditions existing in the northern third of the state27 such presidential declaration s occurred in response to the request more frequently state

department of agricultures risk management agency since the severe drought of 1988 congress has also regularly made supplemental financial assistance available to farmers nd ranchers primarily in the form of crop disaster payments and emergency livestock assistance since 2000 the federal contribution to the crop insurance progra m has averaged about 33 billion per year mostly in the form of premium subsidy and reimbursements to private insurance companies29 another 11 billion in adhoc crop disaster payments has been made available on average each year since 2000 federal facilities even absent federal drought disaster declarations sustained hydrological drought can affect operations of fede rally managed reser voirs dams locks hydroelectric facilities and ot her components of the nation s water infrastructure as discussed above the current southeast dr ought directly affects how the corps manages its facilities in acf basin similarly current drought conditions in california

consequences for congressional oversig ht and funding what causes drought in the united states the immediate cause of drought is the predominant sinking motion of air s ubsidence that results in compressional warming or high pressure which inhib its cloud formation and results in lower relative humidity and less precipitation regions under the influence of semipermanent high pressure during all or major portion of the year are usually deserts such as the sahara and kalahari deserts of africa and the gobi desert of asia32 desert regions that experience semipermanent high pressure are arid regions of the globe reflecting persistent dry climate conditions as distinguished from drought which is shorterterm departur from wetter average conditions prolonged droughts occur when atmospheric conditions leading to the predominant sinking motion of air over certa in geographic area as result of large scale anomalies in atmospheric circulati on patterns persist for months or years33 predicting drought however is difficult because the ability to forecast surface temperature and precipitation depends on number of key va riables such as airsea interactions topography soil moisture land surface processes and how other aspects of the dynamics of weather systems influence each other34 scientists seek to understand how all these variab interact and thus impr ove the ability to predict sustained and severe dr oughts more than season or two in advancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs10 35 cook et 2007 36 hoerling martin and arun kumar the perfect ocean for drought science vol

were more extreme than any us droughts since 1850 when instrumental records began some modeling studies suggest that within few decades the western united states may again face higher base levels of dryness or aridity akin to the 9001300 ad period39 although the relationship between coole rthannormal eastern tropical pacific ssts niñalike conditions and drought is becoming more firmly established meteorological drought is probably never the result of single cause climate is inherently variable and accu rately predicting drought fo r one region in the united states for more than few months or s easons in advance is not yet possible because so many factors influence regional drought what is emerging from the scientific study of drought is an improved unde rstanding of globa l linkages called teleconnections by scientists between interacting weather systems such as the niñosouthern oscillation or enso see box below for description of enso for example some scientists link niña conditions between 1998 and 2002 with the occurrence of nearsimultaneous drought in the southern united states southern europe and southwest asia40 prehistorical and historical droughts in the united states some

where direct measurements are unavailable tree rings can be used as proxy for measuring dryness and drought similarly ice cores from glaciers and polar caps can be used as proxies for measuring atmospheric temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations from thousands of years ago 43 cook et 2007 44 herweiger et 2006 45 ibidproxies42 in the absence of direct measurements what these

1 million acres of federal land in each state provided that the state met several requirements for the eventual development of water resources for reclamation some observers have suggested that the failure of the carey act to foster irrigation projects in all the land made available compounded in part by the 18901896 drought led to the reclamation act of 1902 and the emergence of the bureau of

bowl drought and the 1950s southwest drought are commonly cited as the two most severe multiyear droughts in the united states47 the 19871989 drought was also widesp read and severe mainly affecting the great plains but also instigating extensive western forest fires including the widespread yellowstone fire of 1988 ccording to several studies however the 19th and 20th century severe droughts occurred dur ing regime of relatively less arid conditions compared to the average aridity in the american west during the early megadroughts one study indicates that the early drought record shows similar variability drought periods followed by wetter periods compared to today but the average climate cond itions were much drier48 thus droughts we re more severe drought forecasts for the united states as indicated above predicting the sever ity and duration of severe drought over specific region of the country is not yet po ssible more than few months in advance because of the many factors that influence drought nevertheless some modeling studies suggest that transition to more arid average climate in the american west perhaps similar to conditions in precol onial north america may be underway49 some studies have suggested that human influences on climate caused by emissions of greenhouse gases may be re sponsible for drying trend50 whether future greenhouse gasdriven warming can be linked to niña like conditions discussed above as possible mechanis m for causing drought conditions in the united states is unclear51 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs13 52 tim p barnett and david

2021 to run dry and 10 chance by 2014 to drop below levels needed to provide hydroelectric power under current c limate conditions and without changes to water allocation in the basin52 this study raised awareness of the vulnerability of western water systems but invoked criticism that global climate models are insufficient to forecast climate change effects at the regional scale53 some western water officials were especially critical of the reports assertions one noted that reclamation and other agencies recently developed new criteria for the allocation of colorado river water in times of shortages shortage criteria including drought leaving the likelihood lake mead would run dry absurd54 the study was based on predictions of futu re warming in the west without increased precipitation if reduced runoff predictions bear out then water allocation policies for regions like the colorado river basin ma need to be revisited55 policy challenges severe drought can exacerbate water compe tition in nearly all regions of the united states at so time in other words ar ea of the country is immune to drought however several key factors have made it difficult to address drought policy in systematic fashion at the national level some key policy challenges include the creeping nature of drought split federal and nonfe deral drought res ponse and management responsibilities patchwork of federal programs and program oversight and littlecoordination at th federal level drought conditions often develop sl owly and are not easily identified consequently drought declarations ar made well after the onset of drought conditions typically once impacts are felt this situation makes it difficult to mitigate or prevent drought impacts furthe r even though drought is taken to be inevitable the unpredictability of its timing location and sever ity makes it difficult to address systematically when severe meteorological drought affects region suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs14 56 the national drought policy act of 1998 pl 105199 42 usc 5121 noteas the southeast and southwest droughts or the 2001 klamath river basin drought the supply of available water often shrinks before demand is reduced the resulting mismatch between s upply and demand underscores the responsibility of local state and federal au thorities as well as the private sector to anticipate the influence of drought and plan accordingly the federal government has several drought monitoring and response pr ograms the latter of which are primarily aimed at easing the economic impacts of drought drought planning and mitigation responsibilities lie largely at th nonfederal level ie at the state and local levels but the federal government also provi des some drought planning assistance additionally the federal g overnment often provides em ergency funding for drought relief the national drought commission d iscussed below and others have noted federal relief programs and emergency funding provide little incentive for state and local planning and drought mitigation further challenge is that there is cohesive national drought policy at the federal level nor is there lead agency that coordinates federa l programs rather several federal programs ve been developed over the years often in response to specific droughts additionally occasi onal widespread economic effects have prompted creation of severa l federal relief programs th programs in turn are overseen by several different congressional committees legislative action congress has long recognized the lack of coordinated droug ht planning and mitigation activities among federal agencies and the predominance of crisis management approach to dealing with drought over the last decade legislative action has focused on the question of whethe r there is need for national drought policy for example in 1998 congress passed the national drought policy act pl 105199 which created nationa l drought policy commission congress also considered but did not enact legi slation creating na tional drought council during deliberations on the 2008 farm bill congress has considered recommendations from the commissions 2000 re port to date it has enacted one part of the recommendations both the commi ssion findings and the proposed council are discussed below the national drought policy act of 1998 in passing the national drought policy act of 1998 congress found that at the federal level even though historically there have been frequent sign ificant droughts of na tional consequences drought is addressed mainly through special legislation and ad hoc action rather than through systematic and perm anent process as occurs with other natural disasters56 further congress found an increasing n eed at the federal level to emphasize preparedness mitigation and ri sk management those fi ndings are consistent with recognition of the inevitability albeit unpred ictability of severe drought occurring the act created the national drought policy commission and required the commission to conduct study and submit report to congress onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs15 57 the report is available via the national drought mitigation center at httpwwwndmcunledu pubspfd21mainhtml 58 see full report p 1 at http wwwndmcunledupubs pfd21mainhtmlwhat is needed to respond to drought emergencies what federal laws and pr ograms address drought what are pertinent state tribal and local laws and how various needs laws and pr ograms can be better integrated while recognizing the primacy of states to control water through state law in may 2000 the commission submitted its report57 which included 29 specific recommendations to achieve the goals of national drought policy including the establishment of nationa l drought council the appendix of this report lists the five goals in the commissions report most of the specific recommendations were targeted at the president and federal agenci coupled with calls for congress to fund droughtrelated activities supporting the recommendations an overarching recommendation was for congress to pass national drought preparedness act to implement the commissions recommendations as background for its recommendations the commission noted the pa tchwork nature of drought programs and that despite major fe deral role in responding to drought single federal agency leads or coordinates drought progra ms instead the federal role is more of crisis management58 national drought preparedness legislation and the 2008 farm bill national drought prepar edness act bills were introduced in 2002 107th congress 2003 108th congress and 2005 109th congress but were not enacted similar standalone legisla tion has not been introduced in the 110th congress however the housepassed version of hr 2419 the fa rm nutrition and bioenergy act of 2008 also known as the 2008 farm bill contai ned section creating national drought council this section of the farm bill w ould have charged the council with creating national drought policy action plan that would incorporate many of the components recommended in the commissions report however it was not included in the conference agreement the senate ve rsion of hr 2419 contained similar section although the senate bill authorized permanent di saster payments in hopes of precluding the need for ad hoc disaster payments the conference agreement on the 2008 farm b ill pl 110246 enacted june 18 2008 included new 38 b illion trust fund to cover the cost of making ag ricultural disaster ssistance available on an ongoing basis over the next four years national integrated drought information system although congress has not enacted comprehensive national dr ought preparedness legislation it acted on the second of five commission goals by passing the national integrated drought information system nidis act of 2006 pl 109430 that goal called for enhanced observation networks monitoring prediction and information delivery of drought information pl 109430 estab lished nidis within the national oceanichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs16 59 more information about nidis is available at

improve drought monitoring and forecasting abilities59 conclusion while many water alloca tion and other water ma nagement responsibilities largely lie at the state or local level localities and individuals often look to the federal government for relief when disasters occur over time congress has created various drought programs often in res ponse to specific droughts and authored by different committees crafting systematic or broad drought policy that might encompass the jurisdiction of many different congressional committees is often difficult this is similar to the situation for flood policy and wa ter policy in general at the national level the national drought policy commission recognized these patterns and that recognition underlies many of the co mmissions recommendations60 the current fragmented appro ach can be costly to national taxpayers however it is not certain that increased federal investment in drought preparation mitigati on and improved coordina tion would produce more economically efficient outcomes the overall costs to the federal government as result of extreme drought apart from relief to the agricultural sector are more difficult to assess as discussed above the operation of the nations complex federal water infrastructure is affected by drought thus congress may wish to ex amine how the two major federal water management agencies the corps and recl amation plan for and respond to severe drought and account for its impacts for example congress may wish to explore how national drought policy may or may not address the complex factors that have led to the current stalemate over tristate water allocation agreement in the acf basin how national drought policy w ould apply to and potentially assist in alleviating conflicts over water use in other complex river basins managed by reclamation and the corps such as the colorado river klamath river missouri river sacramento and san joaqui n rivers is also at issue in its report accompanying the nidis act of 2006 the house committee on science wrote experts in drought mitigation argue that substantial losses from drought are not inevitable with ade quate forecasting and monitoring capabilities government and business can adjust their activities and substantially mitigate the extent and severity of many impacts of drought61 the national drought policy commission identified forecasting and monito ring activities as one important aspect of the nations overall drought management policy as well as numerous other facets of federal drought manage ment congress may choose to revisit the commissions recommendations and reevaluate whethe r current federal practices could be supplemented with actions to coordina prepare for and respond to the unpredictable but inevitable occurrence of drought given the daunting task ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34580crs17 managing drought congress may also wish to consider proposals to manage drought impacts such as assisting localities w ith water supply augmentation via water conservation and reuse projects and ssisting with development of demand management techniques such as facilitating water
