6202c07 shspec112 missed withholds if in running havingness process you get needle action you should realize that there is something strange to get out of the road so you could ask about aspects of havingness and see if there is anything that would keep the pc from having etc clean it up always audit with the meter in direct line of sight so that by merely lifting or dropping your gaze you can see pc and meter without turning your head turning your head signifies to the pc that you are not interested in his case in organizations keep students and pcs missed withholds well cleaned up similarly with staff auditors what missed withhold is is subject to misinterpretation people are apt to ask for withholds when that is not what is wanted it is not unpulled unrestimulated withholds that cause trouble it is the whatshouldhavebeenfoundoutandwasnt it is not withhold it is shouldhavefoundout empirically it turns out that all arc breaks blows upsets natter etc stem from missed withholds the mechanism and the theory may be what was outlined in the last lecture or it may not but this is still true as an empirical fact christ was crucified because he missed withholds the withhold can be inadvertent or didnt know matter what the pcs modifier of his main goal line will be thrown into dramatization when the withhold is missed you can prevent this by cleaning up arc breaks as soon as they happen pulling withholds as soon as they happen and keeping ruds in rigorously or if you know the modifier you can chant it to the pc to turn off the dramatization this is poor way to do it but possible you can get list to read in this way but just running shouldhaveknown to death would get all ruds in with clank this can be used at any time not parked in ritual of pattern random rudiment dont drop are you withholding anything from ruds but realize that the missed withhold is totally different question and proposition and area using missed withholds you can shortcircuit all the other outruds one caution if you open up whole new area of track the condition of the case has changed and you will want to check missed withholds again since new crop may have come to light from the change auditors dont always expect or allow for change in the pc they should the consequence of change is that aspects of the case shift this is quite apparent in 3dxx every identity you go through has its own bank its own package of engrams if you are listing effectively the pc is sitting right next to the terminal you announce so you are pulling up bank every item if the pc is really in session even though they are only lock valences the pc will dramatize the last item you found when you get these case changes you are getting bunch of shouldhaveknowns you hadnt seen before you handle them in sloppy fashion with middle rudiments dont distract the pc with them or make big fuss over them but when you notice the pc even one tenth out of session dont wait for more upset get in the shouldhaveknown since the pc is in valence with missed withholds that werent there for the valence he was in minute earlier catch it the instant the pc starts to slip out of session the quality of an auditor is observable at the stage of arc break where the auditor acts the less arc break needed to get action the better change of pace is enough lrh cleans up the session before the pc knows he has an arc break but not to the extent of patching up nonexistent arc breaks and causing one pc who has shouldhavefoundout is always on the verge of an arc break he is the arc breaky pc anybody who gives you bunch of upset disagreement with the organization etc has continuous missed withhold this principle is responsible for more loss of dissemination loss of scientologists and of public to scientology than any single factor pe foundations and coaudits need this datum you could run them on the basis that everyone in the pe foundation is professional findoutabouter then anyone who walks in on pe course should be assumed to have continuous missed withholds which they have come to see if you can find out about they dont really come in to find out about scientology or to be helped or anything else if you dont find out about them they arc break and go out and badmouth you you can create an antiscientology public by doing tests on people since doing so can result in just missing their withholds you would never lose people who you checked on meter with what should we find out about you what should the last group you were in have found out about you that they didnt and cleared up the reads knowingness to most people is knowledge of their ows the reason coaudit doesnt build up is that when auditing without meters withholds are missed and people blow knowledge as knowledge of overts is the bottom rung of knowledge it is past withhold that is restimulated an auditor is locked on by pcs as an expert if he can get the missed withholds off the case any criticism the pc throws at you is just caused by the shouldhavefoundout you didnt ask for even if you are actually worthy of criticism in your auditing tech so add missed withholds to both ends of the session and use shouldhaveknown in mid ruds cases that have reputation for being rough to audit should be approached by finding an area of shouldhaveknown prior to scientology and shooting it full of holes then get all the shouldhaveknowns from scientology cleaned up
