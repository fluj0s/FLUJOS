us environmental protection agency epa to address sites that may be contaminated by hazardous substances1 but do not pose serious enough public health risk to warrant cleanup under the superfund program2 epa defines brownfields as abandoned idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination3 they range in size from corner gas station to abandoned factories and mill sites estimates of the number of sites range from the tens of thousands to as high as 450000 they are often in economically distressed areas brownfield sites face paradox they are generally not eligible for remediation funding under the superfund program because they pose low public health risk while at the same time developers may avoid them because of cleanup costs potential liability or related reasons thereby stalling economic development with bipartisan support the 106th congress considered variety of bills and the clinton administration adopted certain initiatives which sought to remove disincentives that impede economic development of these sites brownfield issues have been the specific subject of hearings and have been discussed in superfund and appropriations hearings4 support for the brownfields concept comes from wide array of states and localities environmental groups business developers and community activists proponents argue that the program has the potential to leverage federal state local and private funds to improve the environment by addressing lowlevel lowrisk contamination

decline environmental groups and epa want assurance that epa will retain the authority to intervene in cases of threats to public health or the environment but otherwise objections to the brownfields legislation are primarily directed more at specific procedural matters such as whether the program should go beyond characterizing sites ie determining the degree and nature of any contamination and fund cleanup as well and whether legislation should be separate from superfund amendments two major legislative issues in the congressional debate have been 1 should the program be authorized explicitly and if so how and 2 shou ld certain tax incentives be adopted to encourage more cleanups there is also the strategic and political question of whether to treat the popular brownfields legislation within overall superfund reform legislation or to consider it separately5 one way states are dealing with contaminated sites is through voluntary cleanup programs which had been adopted by 44 states as of the end of 1997 there are of course variety of federal programs that target urban renewal6 and the brownfields program is designed to supplement not duplicate them the program itself does not aim to perform the cleanups it generally provides grants which are to serve as catalysts to bring together other resources in the communities to provide the environmental cleanup component of redevelopment efforts overall the brownfields program is intended to fill previously unmet need and to offer hope for cleaner environment new jobs stronger tax base and economic recovery voluntary cleanups vs brownfields voluntary cleanup programs are state sponsored programs that encourage owners or developers to work cooperatively with the state outside of the states enforcement driven cleanup program and thereby avoid some of the costs and delays associated with that approach cleanup standards are usually identical to those used at statelead enforcement sites according to the environmental law institute eli7 most states provide incentives for participating in the program most commonly some form of liability release other incentives inclu streamlined process financial or tax incentives and technical assistance states created voluntary cleanup programs in the absence of federal legislation or standards and these programs vary considerablyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97731crs3 8 environmental law institute p 43 9 environmental law institute p 46 10 environmental law institute p 44states define brownfield sites in different ways but they usually echo epas definition encompassing urban industrial or commercial facilities that are abandoned or underutilized due in part to environmental contamination or fear of contamination8 eli noted that few states have different standards or cleanup approaches for brownfields and voluntary cleanup sites florida provides for site specific cleanup levels based on risk allowing institutional or engineering controls instead of the statewide remediation levels otherwis required north carolina allows for alternative cleanup strategies focusing on removal of exposure pathways at certain brownfield sites and mississippis standards were not set but the statute requires that risk assessment be used9 the difference in brownfields and voluntary programs in the states is often matter of semantics the environmental law institute distinguished them thus typically voluntary programs do not focus on redevelopment nor do they target urban sites specifically rather voluntary programs are more often aimed at getting simple less contaminated sites cleaned up regardless of whether they are reused brownfield programs on the other hand are more likely to focus on redevelopment and be part of broader state strategy or set of social policies aimed at improving distressed urban areas10 why brownfields is an issue epas brownfields program has become legislative issue for several reasons first epa initiated the program administratively using superfund monies this has raised the question of its legal authority as well as whether the funds have been expended in accordance with superfund statutory criteria second the program has proved generally popular and has expanded substantially with the increasing financial commitment questions have arisen about the effectiveness of the program and whether the assumptions underlying the use of the funds have proved valid these two issues legal authority and program assumptions and effectiveness have led to congressional interest in statutorily authorizing the program and articulating its authorities more clearly and this comes at the same time other proposals for amending superfund are being made brownfields legislation has become intertwined with superfund proposals and whether the two should be separated or not is third issue twelve of the 28 brownfields bills that the 106th congress considered including the two that were reported would have provided the statutory authority the two were superfund reauthorization bills hr 1300 was reported by the house transportation and infrastructure committee on september 30 1999 hrept 106 353 part i and hr 2580 was ordered reported by the house commerce committee on october 13 1999 hrept 106775 part

legal authority the superfund program was created to address major threats to public health and the environment and the authorized uses of fund monies are specified in cercla section 111 epa administratively created the brownfields program under superfund authority and financed it from its superfund appropriation beginning in 1993 and for the first 4 years of the program epa drew on superfund monies for the program without explicit statutory authority however beginning in fy1997 appropriations legislation included funding for brownfields activities as the amount of funding rose and the nature of expenditures went beyond cleanup some in congress questioned epas authority for carrying out the program this issue was specifically raised by house appropriations subcommittee chairman jerry lewis at hearing on epas fy1998 appropriations11 in response epa administrator carol browner relied on opinions from the agencys general counsel which said the brownfields pilots were legally acceptable under cercla section 104 if limited to precleanup activities some of the other activities could be funded under the broad research authority of section 311c12 epas inspector general ig also considered this question of legislative authority and reviewed the general counsels legal opinions but did not comment further13 the lead ig investigator observed that congress had appropriated funds for the brownfields program14 implying that the appropriations represented tacit congressional acceptance of epas position despite the questions about the programs statutory basis congressional appropriators have acceded to the popularity of the program and have continued to recognize it with funding from superfund the funding history and congressional specifications are discussed below expansion of the program in keeping with administrator browners reference to it as work in progress the program has been redefined and expanded several times the number of brownfields assessment pilots has been increased from the original 50 to more than 300 brownfields cleanup revolving loan fund grants and job training grants have been initiated and the brownfields national

communities the agenda grouped the activities into four broad and overlapping categories the brownfields pilots clarification of liability and cleanup issues partnerships and outreach and job development and training pilots the centerpiece of the action agenda is the brownfields pilot projects which provide grants of up to 200000 over 2 years for site assessments and other preremedial activities browner said epa would fund 50 of these the first grant was made to cleveland ohio in november 1993 to determine the best way to develop national model for revitalizing these areas across the country15 and two more pilots were awarded in 1994 throu gh fy2000 epa made 363 brownfield assessment pilot project grants of up to 200000 over 2 years for total of more than 57 million in fy 2001 the agency expects to award 35 new assessment pilots and an additional 50000 may be awarded for sites used for greenspace purposes epa also expects to provide supplemental assistance of up to 150000 to previously awarded pilots to continue and expand their efforts16 clarification of liability and cleanup issues the second element of the action agenda is intended to relieve uncertainty over cleanup liability several of epas actions relate to property transfer as the sale of real estate is frequently central element to redevelopment in key move administrator browner anno unced that 25000 sites would be removed from the comprehensive environmental respon compensation and liability information system cerclis the superfund programs database of sites suspected of being contaminated by hazardous substances as required by law the worst of the cerclis sites which numbered about 38000 at the time are placed on the national priorities list npl to be cleaned up under the superfund program however procedures existed to remove less seriously contaminated facilities many of them brownfields from the registry and the stigma of being associated with the superfund program reputedly often prevented sale or development of cerclislisted properties even if they had never been contaminated in the first place since browners announcement more than 32000 cerclis sites have been archived procedures are now in place to remove from cerclis those sites where further response action is planned epa also issued guidances which addressed the liability status of prospective purchasers of contaminated property and of property owners with groundwater contamination that originated on neighboring property other guidances addressed the transfer of federally owned property aspects of the underground storage tank cleanup program soil testing and the rcra corrective action program17 in addition epa and the department of justice clarified enforcement policy

the policy into law partnerships and outreach in addition to state city and community representatives epa has developed cooperative relationships with other federal agencies ultimately in july 1996 epa created the interagency working group on brownfields with staff from more than 20 federal agencies and the interagency steering committee to share knowledge on economic redevel opment and environmen tal principles and to develop comprehensive coordinated federal approach to local communities these coordinating efforts subsequently led to the brownfields national partnership and the showcase communities discussed below epa is also working to improve communication with minority communities and to increase their involvement early and meaningfully in the brownfields effort the agencys national environmental justice advisory council nejac held series of public hearings in five cities and relea sed report containing number of recommendations to incorporate the communities own visions of the future and to identify ways to create healthy and sustainable communities19 june 1999 report found that the quality and scope of community involvement conducted by the pilots as well as the fact that brownfields are not usually redeveloped into heavy industrial or other uses which would raise concerns of discrimination under title vi of the civil rights act minimizes the likelihood that title vi complaints would be raised at brownfield sites and hinder redevelopment of these areas20 jobs and training starting in fy1998 epa created job training and development activities associated with brownfields grant recipients through 47 grants to community colleges universities cities and nonprofit organizations the 2year grants at up to 200000 each are intended to assure that residents of brownfields communities are trained for jobs that will allow them to benefit from the industrial and commercial activities associated with site cleanup ten more job training pilots are

the primary reason for the difference between the planned and actual financial assistance for hud is that about 100 million of the planned assistance for brownfieldrelated activities was from huds community development block grant program under this program communities have wide discretion in how they use their funds and while the agency does track communities use of funds it does not track whether funds were specifically spent on brownfields therefore hud could not report an amount of obligations made for brownfields under its block grant program b the other federal agencies are the departments of energy health and human services and transportation the national oceanic and atmospheric administration department of commerce and the general services administration c under huds

loans compared to the planned 165 million 85 see table 1 gao said the apparent 129 million shortfall in the department of housing and urban developments hud obligations was due to huds inability to discern whether community deve lopment block grants were spent on brownfields or on other authorized activities see table footnote the agencies were not able to measure economic outcomes of their brownfield programs gao said the benefits of new jobs more private investment and protected greenfields were estimates of potential longterm benefits generated from economic models that might result from the federal support for redeveloping brownfields they were not goals that the agencies could measure and achieve within the 2year period of the partnership initiative25 the brownfields showcase communities one element of the brownfields national partnership is the showcase communities program under which 28 different types of communities such as urban rural coastal have been selected to demonstrate how federal support could be applied successfully to redevelop their brownfields properties gao reported that the 10 federal agencies they reviewed had improved their coordination of brownfield activities both within their own agency and between agencies the showcase communities also acknowledged improvement they are now better aware of the federal resources availab to support brownfield redevelopment and how to access them and are getting more technical and financial help from agencies major reason for this success is that epa loaned staff person to each city under the intergovernmental personnel act for 2 years26 four professional associations involved with brownfield issue s agreed with this assessment27 effectiveness this expansio n of the program into new

hereinafter cited as hudepa study 33hudepa study p viixithese statements speak to the perceived size of the problem and the potential benefits of redevelopment in the sample cities the survey also asked the mayors about impediments to development and the responses were consistent with earlier reports the three most frequently cited impediments to redevelopment were lack of cleanup funds 204 cities or 91 of 223 respondents liability issues 175 cities 78 and the need for environmental assessments 139 cities 62 however joint hudepa study32 raised some questions about whether the program was meeting those needs and being effective the study challenged some of the original assumptions of the program suggesting that part of the effort might be misdirected in particular it suggested that the prospect for redevelopment was proba bly more affected by the underlying economics of any proposed development of brownfield site than by the liability risk arising from the possible contamination overall the study indicated that brownfield site has to be ripe for development from an economic perspective before improvements to its environmental situation will make difference this is not in conflict with the mayors report 76 said they would need additional subsidies or resourc such as infrastructure upgrades and demolition of obsolete buildings in order to attract private investment many of the hudepa studys findings had to do with state efforts but there were implications for the federal program33 if state employs landusebased cleanup standards and institutional controls which can bring faster cheaper redevelopment the federal government must ensure protection of health and the environment inasmuch as economic development agencies are generally developers point of entry to the environmental arena training is needed for the agencies staffs on environmental standards remediation technol ogies and liability issues particularly in rural and smaller urban areas similar technical education for lenders especially smaller lenders and those in areas with little past history in redevelopment holds promise of increased credit availability these two studies highlight different perspectives on the importance of liability in constraining brownfields development writings about brownfields often assume that the threat of triggering superfund liability has chilling effect on redevelopment in the us conference of mayors study 78 of the respondent cities cited liability issues as an impediment but the hud study concluded that liability concerns were never the sole critical

previously unknown contamination possible litigation and other uncertain events never constituted the sole significant environmental obstacle affecting site redevelopment in any event the importance of the liability threat has most often commanded attention for example in superfund barriers to brownfields redevelopment june 199635 gao concluded that cerclas liability provisions are serious obstacle to development that discouraged lenders developers and property owners from participating in renewal projects both federal and state cleanup liability laws can apply at any site not just those on superfunds national priorities list gao noted that there are other barriers to development however such as the actual cleanup costs and high urban property taxes and in march 1997 the agency said that most of the state voluntary cleanup program managers in the 15 states it surveyed judged that fear of federal superfund liability discouraged some people from initiating cleanup36 ones view of the importance of the liability constraint on brownfields development has consequences for how one would support efforts to achieve development to the extent liability is key constraint attention to reducing liability is important it is being addressed both through epa guidances in the brownfields action agenda as discussed previously and by funding risk characterization and remediation on the other hand to the extent that liability is subordinate issue compared to the basic community economic situation attention and funding might more appropriately focus on such activities as research partnerships and outreach and job development and training along with site assessment thus the elements of the program necessary for effectiveness depend on an accurate understanding of the true impediments to development of brownfields impact of voluntary cleanup and brownfield programs in the states another perspective is offered by the third survey of the 50 states conducted by the northeastmidwest institute in 2000 it revealed that there is increasing activity with new state programs being put in place and others being modifi ed to accommodate their particular situation and needs the information in table 2 on page 12 which does not distinguish between brownfield and voluntary cleanup accomplishments was compiled from the institutes statebystate listings one should be aware that significant differences exist among the states progr ams and that eligibility requirements for participation in voluntary programs vary the authors also note that most states have yet to gather hard economic information on their programs many programs are still too new to gain handle on impacts other states have not yet been able to find the resources to collect any data beyond the

current year was enacted in the 105th congress as part of the taxpayer relief act of 199741 good for 3 years until december 31 2000 in the 106th congress the tax break was extended to the end of 2003 and expanded to include all brownfields certified by the appropriate state agency the 1997 act limited eligibility for the tax break to the 76 brownfields pilots announced prior to februa ry 1 1997 areas with poverty rate of 20 or more adjacent industrial or commercial areas and empowerment zones and enterprise communities ezecs the tax extenders act of 199942 added year to the life of the incentive to december 31 2000 and the consolidated appropriations act 200143 extended the brownfields tax incentive for an additional 2 years to december 31 2003 and broadened eligibility for the tax break to include any site containing hazardous substance that is certified by the appropriate state environmental agency superfund sites are excluded this provision resolved an issue that arose from the tax treatm ent of costs of cleaning up contaminated land in general costs incurred for new buildings or for permanent improvements to increase the value of property must be capitalized that is the cost must be deducted over period of years some expenses such as repairs are currently deductible that is deductible in the year in which the cost is incurred this is also called expensing it is considerable financial advantage to be able to fully deduct an expense in one year rather than many the issue arose as result of 1994 ruling by the internal revenue service holding that the costs of cleaning up contaminated land and groundwater are currently deductible but only for the person who contaminated the land44 also the cleanup would have to be done without any anticipation of putting the land to new use further any monitoring equipment with useful life beyond the year it was acquired would have to be capitalized on the other hand person who acquired previously contaminated land such as brownfield site would have to capitalize his cleanup costs spreading them out over number of years cleanup costs are major barrier to redevelopment and the irs ruling made challenging situation even more difficult for developers the taxpayer relief act thus had the effect of overturning the ruling and allowing developers who had not caused the contamination to deduct cleanup costs in the current year rather than to have to capitalize them 106th congress legislative proposals in the 106th congress 27 brownfields bills including six broader superfund reauthorization bills were introduced the bills largely reflected the general approach that epa has adopted and differed primarily in what additional features they included such as liability protection and taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97731crs16 incentives they fell into three groups twelve of the bills including all the reauthorization measures would have given statutory authority to the brownfields program and most of these also would have provided some degree of relief from superfund liability nine did not address the issue of establishing the program but would have provided different combinations of liability protection andor tax incentives the other six bills would have made funds available for brownfields in agencies other than epa hr 1776 bill to expand home ownership in the us would have provide statutory authority for the hud brownfields program authorizing the use of community devel opment block grants for environmental cleanup and econom ic development related to brownfields it passed the house but wen further s 1408 would have made funds available for brownfields under program in the small business administration and s 1573 would have provided funding via proposed environmenta l stewardship fund that would have used receipts from outer continental shelf revenues three bills would have authorized the us army corps of engineers to undert ake brownfield cleanups one of the superfund reauthorization bills in the first group hr 2956 also would have provided funds to the hud brownfields program the lists of sponsors and cosponsors show bipartisan support and the testimony at hearings has been generally favorable at least with regard to the program and its objectives the provisions of the bills of the 106th congress are summarized in table 3 and the features of the bills authorizing characterization grants and revolving loan fund grants are presented in table 4 two of the superfund reauthorization bills were reported hr 1300 from the transportation and infrastructure committee and hr 2580 from the commerce committee at the request of speaker dennis hastert the two committees tried to merge the bills in time to bring superfund reauthorization bill to the floor before the first session adjourned but reportedly encountered difficulties in discussions with the ways and means committee over reauthorizing the superfund taxes there was further action both bills would have essentially codified the existing brownfield program authorized rlfs and addressed liability issues hr 1300 also would have provided assistance for state voluntary cleanup further discussion of the bills can be found in crs issue brief ib10011 superfund reauthorization issues in the 106th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97731crs17 table table 3
