delta and the rangoon area of burma estimates of the number of people who died was 135000 as of early june 2008 hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes and sources of livelihood foreign governments and relief organizations sought to bring in massive aid but the burmese government spdc restricted the volume of goods that came in and access of disaster experts and relief workers to the affected areas in the meantime the spdc proceeded to hold referendum on new constitution in areas not affected by the cyclone it announced on may 15 that voters approved the constitution by 924 many observers assessed the referendum process as not being free and open this appeared in line with the spdcs reported poor human rights record since 1990 including the suppression of antiregime protests in september 2007 the spdc appears unaffected by sanctions imposed by the united states and other western nations western sanctions are uneven with us sanctions being the heaviest burma has been able to expand exports of variety of commodities including growing earnings from natural gas production china and india have signed deals with the spdc for substantial purchases of natural gas burma also reportedly earns between 1 billion and 2 billion annually from exports of illegal drugs heroin and methamphetamines most of these earnings go to drug traffickers connected to the wa and shan ethnic groups but burmese military officials have means to gain substantial share of these earnings burmas fellow members in the association of southeast asian nations asean have grown more critical of the spdc but they continue to oppose sanctions chinese diplomatic support of the spdc and military and economic aid is very important 2 billion in military aid since the early 1990s 200 million annually in economic aid substantial foreign investment including new investment in natural gas and huge influx of chinese migrants into burma mainly traders ch inas role is prime justification for indias constructive engagement policy toward burma although india suspended arms sales after the september 2007 uprising burma has reestablished diplomatic relations with north korea amidst reports of growing military cooperation between them since 1988 the united states has imposed sanctions against burma including congressional passage in 2003 of the burma freedom and demo cracy act pl 10861

june 2008 the united nations estimated that between 16 million and 25 million people were affected by the storm left homeless or without ba sic sources of livelihood such as food and water immediately foreign governments the united nations and international relief organizations offered massive disaster relief to burma the bush administration pledged 1625 million1 the burmese government spdc initially took the position that it could handle the situation it followed policy of allowing limited amount of foreign relief goods into the country and permitting relatively small number of foreign relief workers to operate within restricted set of rules the spdc imposed special restrictions against the united states france and other western countries that had long imposed sanctions on the spdc over human rights issues the spdc did allowed large number of us c130 transport aircraft to bring relief supplies into the country2 however it barred us disaster experts relief specialists and search and rescue teams from the country it also prohibited the us military from bringing relief goods directly into the country despite the large relief capacity of several us naval vessels off burmas coast restrictions on the united states france and great britain which also had naval contingents offshore were the most severe however the spdc imposed limitations on other governments and on private aid groups it limited the number of entrance visas issued to foreign relief workers and it restricted access of foreign relief workers into the irrawaddy delta the area hit hardest by the cyclone3 however the trend into june 2008 was gradual easing of these spdc restrictions4 the singapore foreign minister announced on may 20 that the spdc had agreed to allow its fellow members in the association of southeast asian nations asean to coordinate the inflow of foreign relief aid asean he said would work with the united nations the spdc appears to have decided to allow larger presence of relief workers and medical workers from neighboring asian countries the asean countries china and india these personnel were reported to be entering the countries singapores foreign mini ster cautioned that the spdc still would impose limits on foreign access 5 many foreign governments including the bush administration and united nations officials and private aid groups criticized the spdc for these restrictions the bush administration and european governments considered sending aid into burma including aid transported by military units without the permission of the spdc there were proposals to invoke responsibility to protect doctrine that the united nations general assembly had adopted in 20056 however they have hesitated partly because china threatened to veto any proposed resolution in

myanmar however the us government has continued to use burma in official statements and this report will use burma unless statements are quoted using myanmar since 1988 numerous reports including the annual reports of the us state department have described extensive abuses of human rights perpetuated by the spdc and the burmese military these assessments have changed little over the subsequent 17 years the state departments human rights report for 2004 concluded that the spdc has an extremely poor human rights record and the 2004 and 2005 reports asserted that the situation had worsened in each year numerous reports throughout 2006 and 2007 indicate continuation of this trend the departments reports and reports of private groups have laid out familiar pattern of government and military

government negotiated ceasefire agreements with 17 ethnic insurgencies in the 1990s but three groups the karen karenni and shan have continued to fight ethnic minorities make up the bulk of an estimated 540000 internally displaced people in eastern burma and over 150000 refugees who have fled across the border into thailand largescale burmese military offensive against karen insurgents throughout 2006 and 2007 reportedly has included burning of villages forced relocations of civilians minelaying in civilian areas and rapes 22 government policies reportedly are particularly oppressive against members of the muslim rohingya minority in western burma whom the spdc has barred from citizenship23 the worsening human rights situation has been influenced by the deteriorating political situation since 2002 it began with the physical attack by spdc supporters on aung san suu kyi and her followers in may 2003 and her subsequent house arrest in october 2004 the spdc arrested khin nyunt chief of burmas defense intelligence organization and scores of his intelligence officials khin nyunt had been the arm of th spdc in dealing with foreign governments including the united

criticisms of the spdc he reportedly had convinced the junta to release aung san suu kyi from house arrest in april 2002 and his representatives had contacted us officials urging positive us response to the spdcs decision khin nyunts fall from power apparently removed from within the spdc the main element in favor of greater flexibility 24 since the purge younger burmese military commanders have assumed higher positions of power many have been field commanders in areas of reported high levels of human rights abuses they have had little foreign contacts and little apparent awareness of foreign

sanctions are more limited in scope and do not totally cut off trade and investment with burma the european union eu has imposed visa ban on burmese officials an arms embargo freeze on burmese assets in eu countries and suspension of mostfavorednation trade treatment but there is ban on imports of burmese products or eu private investments in burma great britain reportedly is the third largest private investor in burma with investments valued at 14 billion in 2004 in 2005 the eu provided nearly 45 million in aid primarily for health education and the environment 28 japan has funded aid projects in burma reportedly totaling more than 18 million in 2004 includ ing hydroelectric power and the rangoon airport after japanese reporter was killed in rangoon during the september 2007 uprising the japanese government stated that it would consider new sanctions against burma but in january 2008 japan pledged 179 million in humanitarian aid the japanese government defines its aid as humanitarian but other governments including the clinton and bush administrations have countered that the aid is actually infrastructure aid 29 even us sanctions do not include the biggest us business activity in burma the yadana offshore natural gas production and the gas pipeline into thailand constructed and operated by consortium that has included the us unocal corporation unocal recently was taken over by chevron chevron has 28 share of the co nsortium the other consortium members are the french corporation total with 31 share pt t exploration and production public company of thailand with 26 share and the burmese governmentowned myanmar oil and gas enterprise with 15 share the newspaper the myanmar times reported in its august 2026 2007 edition that the yadana project earned 216 billion in 2006 an estimate for the consortiums earnings in 2007 is 28 billion 30 chevrons 28 share of the 216 billion profit in 2006 would be approximately 600 million conservative estimate of the burmese governments income from the yadana project in 2006 is about 500 million of the 216 billion profit the myanmar oil and gas enterprise would receive about 330 million based on its 15 continued

from number of these major government corporations conservative estimate of burmas corporate income tax intake would be 10 of 183 billion the consortiums 2006 profit minus the share of the myanmar oil and gas enterprise about 183 million the government may be able to draw in additional money from the project in other ways but this is not known the second factor is the ability of burma to expand exports of variety of commodities to countries of asia and beyond these include natural resources such as natural gas nickel precious gems and timber shrimp and other seabased products and illegal drugs heroin and methamphetamines reportedly exports of textiles have picked up since the us import ban of 2003 as burma has found other markets in asia and europe31 burma earned an estimated 1 billion in exports of natural gas in 2004 and 200532 and earnings could grow substantially in the future from new natural gas explorations and production the south korean company daewoo announced in august 2006 the discovery of gas field off burmas coast that could produce between 57 and 10 trillion cubic feet of gas that could lead to annual production for the next 20 25 years the british petroleum statistical review puts burmas proven gas reserves at 19 trillion cubic feet china and india have signed deals with the spdc which would make them primary customers for this gas and future discoveries of gas the chinese deal reportedly would have burma supply 65 trillion cubic feet of gas to china over 30 years in april 2006 russias zarubezhneft oil company signed an agreement with the spdcs energy ministry which reportedly will open the way for russian investments in burmas oil and gas industry 33 investors must conclude profit or productionsharing agreem ents with stateowned corporations or with regional military commands which insures significant flow of money to the spdc and members of the ruling militarybased elite burma reportedly earns between 1 billion and 2 billion annually from exports of the illegal drugs heroin and methamphetamines this seems to be at least as much and possibly substantially more than the 900 million annually which the us embassy in rangoon estimated that burma earned in the mid1990s34 most of these earnings predominately foreign exchange go to drug traffickers who produce and ship the drugs across burmas borders most of the traffickers are connected to particular ethnic groups along burmas borders with china and thailand such as the wa and the shan however burmese military officials at various levels have number of means to gain substantial share of these earnings local military commands reportedly collect high government taxes on the drug traffickers as well as fees for military protection and transportation assistance us state department annual international narcotics reports have stated that there is reliable evidence that senior officials in the burmese government are directly involved in the drug trade 35 however

and taxes from these enterprises military officers sometimes are partners in them the traffickers usually deposit the earnings from these enterprises into banks controlled by the military military officers reportedly deposit much of their drugrelated money in foreign bank accounts in places like bangkok and singapore36 however in 2005 the spdc did shut down three banks allegedly due to drug related money laundering the burmese military has had an especially close relationship with the wa tribe including the wa drug producers and traffickers in ceasefire agreement of 1989 the military allowed the wa wide autonomy including the maintenance of armed wa military forces and the freedom to produce drugs the wa soon became dominant factor in the heroin trade in 2001 burmese military intelligence officials and the wa leadership reportedly concluded an agreement under which the wa were encouraged to reduce their production of opium and heroin but were given free hand to expand production of methamphetamine pills for export 37 opium production dropped from an estimated 2500 metric tons in the mid1990s to 953 tons in 2001 to just over 600 tons in 2002 and to 380 metric tons in 2005 according to us estimates38 nevertheless at the same time the wa were expanding their production of methamphetamine pills smuggling into thailand rose from an estimated 300 million tablets in 1999 to 1 billion in 200339 wa earnings from methamphetamine sales was estimated at 300 million in 2002 and wa earnings from heroin smuggling was estimated at 250300 million 40 reports on the 2001 agreement between the burmese intelligence officials and wa leaders assert that the agreement included profit sharing provisions which give the military share possibly as high as 50 of wa earnings from drug trafficking41 third factor limiting the impact of international sanctions is the constructive engagement policy of burmas fellow members in the association of southeast asian nations asean which eschews sanctions and diplomatic pressure thailand has important economic interests in burma including 129 billion in private investme nts in 49 projects within burma in 2004 and imports from burma valued at 106 billion in the thai fy20032004 singapores investments in burma reportedly totaled 14 billion in 200442 singapore reportedly is major travel destination for the burmese elite and spdc leader than sh we reportedly has been treated for intestinal cancer at singapore government hospital singapore also is believed to have sold arms to burmas military43 however several asean

influence on aseans relations with the european union and the united states malaysian and indonesian officials have stepped up criticisms of the spdc members of asean country parliaments have formed an asean interparliamentary caucus on democracy in myanmar in 2005 asean governments pressured burma to either institute political reforms or give up its scheduled chairmanship of asean in 2006 the spdc chose to give up the chairmanship another indication of its continued resistance to outside pressures malaysian foreign minister syed hamid albar went to burma in march 2006 as special asean envoy to discuss democratic reforms but his visit accomplished little the spdc did not allow him to meet with aung sann suu kyi despite diplomatic pressure asean leaders stressed to the bush administration that asean assertiveness has limits and will not include economic sanctions against burma however asean took first diplomatic step when its secretary general publicly called on china and india to take larger role in encouraging myanmar to speed reform measures 44 indonesian foreign minister hassan wiradjuda followed up with statement on may 19 2006 in washington dc that china india and south korea should use their aid and investments in burma to make sure that myanmar changes itself to be more democratic45 nevertheless indonesia demonstrated the limits of aseans assertiveness when it abstained in the security council vote in january 2007 on us resolution condemning the spdc and calling for reforms malaysian prime minister abdullah badawi also expressed opposition to the us resolution in the september 2007 crisis asean leaders criticized the burmese government but they indicated support for the useu effort to get the security council to consider sanctions asean governments reactions to the spdcs february 2008 announcements of constitutional referendum and 2010 elections were guardedly positive the fourth and probably biggest factor is chinese economic and military aid to burma china takes the position that political and human rights conditions in burma are the internal affairs of burma the spdcs prime minister soe win stated after his february 2006 trip to china that chinese premier wen jiabao had pledged chinas unwavering support and said that beijing would oppose the imposition of economic sanctions by the united nations46 china fulfilled that apparent pledge when it vetoed the us resolution in the security council in january 2007 and blocked the useu initiative in the security council in september 2007 china and russia argued that despite burmas internal problems burma does not constitute threat to regional and international peace and security that would bring it within the purview of the security council china reportedly has counseled the spdc to moderate its behavior and has expressed concern over the flow of narcotics into southern china since the september 2007 protests and spdc crackdown china has supported the dispatch of united nations mediator but it claims to have minimal influence china reportedly has initiated quiet contacts with exiled burmese opposition leaders 47 but it refuses to

ndum and elections were due to pressure from china48 china took diplomatic initiative in june 2007 when it arranged meeting in beijing between state department official and burmese govern ment representatives the state department provided little information on the content of the meeting chinese officials have not discussed publicly their objectives in setting up the meeting it may be that china seeks to facilitate sustained usburma dialogue similar to the us north korean dialogue that china encouraged and helped to facilitate in late 2006 and throughout 2007 chinas extensive role in burma has five compone nts first china has provided burma with an estimated 2 to 3 billion in military aid since the early 1990s which has enabled the burmese army to expand from 180000 to 450000 in 2005 china was active in shipping weapons to burma in 2006 coinciding with the burmese armys offensive against the karens 49 second chinas economic aid is estimated at 200 million annually much of which goes into infrastructure including electric power50 third china is believed to be the largest foreign investor in burma chinese companies reportedly have invested in more than 800 projects with direct investment estimated at close to 3 billion51 report by an expert at the asiapacific center for security studies research organization of the us pacific command estimated that china controls more than 60 percent of the burmese economy52 visitors to burma report large chinese economic presence in burma from mandalay northward including an estimated one million or more chinese migrants into burma since 1995 mainly traders fourth china officially has been burmas third largest trading partner but there reportedly is huge informal crossborder trade that is unrecorded the burmese and chinese governments projected bilateral trade reached close to 2 billion in 200753 the fifth component is chinas interest in burmas natural gas and potential pipelines across burma into china the chineseburmese natural gas deal discussed earlier undoubtedly will increase chinas interest in supporting the spdc china also reportedly is planning the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines from burmas coast on the indian ocean northward into china through which chinese oil purchased in the middle east and burmese natural gas could be transported to china rather than by sea through the strait of malacca and the south china sea 54 chinas growing role also is cited by indian officials as prime justification for indias constructive engagement policy toward burma this has included

sell arms to the burmese military india initially took low posture toward the spdcs crackdown on the september 2007 protests but it later halted arms shipments to burma another negative development is the reestablishment of burmas diplomatic relations and military links with north korea burma broke diplomatic relations with north korea in 1983 after north korean agents planted bomb in rangoon which killed 17 highranking south korean officials in april 2006 they reestablished diplomatic relations it is known that since the late 1990s burma has purchased artillery and ammunition from north korea has sent military delegations to pyongyang and has received north korean technicians at burmese naval base north korean ships and diplomats have been caught carrying heroin with double uo labels brand of heroin produced in the golden triangle region of burma there also are reports that burma is interested in acquiring north kore an shortrange surfacetosurface missiles and submarines although purchases have been confirmed observers too have speculated that burma and north korea might collaborate in developing nuclear facilities inside burma but there appears to be little hard evidence to substantiate this 56 likely fifth factor in the failure of usled sanctions to pressure the spdc into making political concessions is that the spdc requires significant income including foreign exchange for relatively narrow segment of burmas population several hundred highranking military officers and their families are the core of the ruling elite they reportedly are involved in many business ventures and manage state corporations that regulate and enter into partnership agreements with private companies including foreign investors 57 income earned domestically and from foreign transactions appears to be easily sufficient to ensure that the ruling class enjoys high standard of living moreover the priority given to the military in government budgets appears to provide adequate resources for rank and file military personnel g23g495g21g495g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 since 1988 the united states has imposed wide range of sanctions against burma by 2004 these had terminated nearly all economic relations with burma the main sanctions currently are suspension of aid including antinarcotics aid opposition to new loans to burma by the international financial institutions an executive order by president clinton on may 20 1997 prohibiting us private companies from making new investments in burma and congressional passage of the burmese freedom and democracy

bush announced new sanctions freezing of the assets in the united states of burmese several stateowned burmese companies on may 1 2008 on the eve of cyclone nargis these firms were covered by previous sanctions both he and first lady laura bush voiced criticisms of the spdc immediately after the storm struck in response to the cyclone he stated that the united states wants to help the burmese people deal with the disaster and at the same time of course we want them to live in free society 58 laura bush described the spdc as friendless regime that should step aside their statements drew criticisms from some burmese exiled opposition figures officials of other southeast asian governments and from the european unions director of humanitarian affairs as being inappropriate in the aftermath of natural disaster 59 the united states has not had an ambassador to burma since 1992 when the senate foreign relations committee refused to confirm the nomination of an ambassador because of the human rights abuses the state department also concluded that burmese officials were profiting from groups that produced and exported heroin and other illicit drugs despite some spdc moves to limit opium production and drugrelated money laundering burma is on the us list of uncooperative drugproducing or transit countries the dominant objective of bush administration diplomacy has been to strengthen international sanctions against burma president bush raised the issue with other heads of government at the apec summit of november 2005 the administration stepped up bilateral diplomacy with the asean countries and apparently for the first time the administration included burma on the us bilateral agenda with china the administrations major initiative was the effort to have burma placed on the agenda of the security council report issued in mid2005 by nobel peace prize winners vaclav havel former president of the czech republic and archbishop desmond tutu of south africa proposed that the security council take an initiative on the human rights situation in burma the bush administration succeeded in securing private security council meeting on burma in december 2005 after the spdc extended the house arrest of aung san suu kyi in may 2006 the administration proposed formal resolution on burma in the security council the us draft resolution included the following points burma poses serious risks to peace and security in the region the spdc should release ung san suu kyi and all political prisoners the spdc should allow full freedom of expression and allow the national league for democracy and other political parties to operate freely the spdc should begin without delay substantive political dialogue which would lead to genuine democratic transition to include all political stakeholders the spdc should cease military attacks against civilians in ethnic minority regions and end human rights violations against ethnic minorities the spdc should allow

defeat in january 2007 when china and russia vetoed the us resolution in the security council and indonesia abstained on the vote future us diplomatic options to bring about appear minimal given chinas blockage of the useu initiative in the security council in september 2007 the administrations steppedup diplomacy with china did produce in 2007 single us diplomatic move not related to sanctions in june 2007 the bush administration agreed to send diplomat to beijing for chinesearranged meeting with burmese government official the administration and the state department did not disclose information about the meeting in the aftermath of the september 2007 uprising the bush administration does not appear interested further meetings in the past the administration has indicated that it would use sanctions to initiate kind of road map process with the spdc in which the administration would respond to positive measure by the spdc by selectively lifting an individual sanction with the prospect of additional lifting of sanctions in response to additional positive measures by the spdc us business groups and several us academic experts support such strategy they argue that sanctions will not produce total spdc capitulation or regime collapse and that us sanctions are contributing to chinas increased role in burma they assert that the united states should engage the spdc 60 when the spdc released aung san suu kyi from house arrest in 2002 the state department discussed with burmese officials resumption of antinarcotics aid the department reportedly considered recommending that burma be certified as eligible for us antinarcotics aid in view of the spdcs apparent success in reducing opium and he roin production however this initiative drew strong negative reactions from the press and especially from key members of congress which reportedly resulted in its abandonment 61 in statement of may 23 2006 assistant secretary of state christopher hill indicated that the bush administration might consider road map process if the spdc took some specific actions he mentioned the release of the many hundreds even thousands of political prisoners the release of aung sann suu kyi and resumption of dialogues between the spdc and the opposition hill suggested that if the spdc took positive measure on any of these issues the administration would initiate positive measure in return if we see movement in this direction if we see an effort of course well respond62 however sentiment in congress appears to be against road map approach and favors maintaining the full range of us sanctions until the spdc and the burmese military terminate major human rights abuses and make fundamental political concessions to aung sann suu kyi in comprehensive
