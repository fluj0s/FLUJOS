federal government are to significant extent defined by the united states constitution and relevant case law in recent years however the supreme court has decided number of cases that would seem to reevaluate this historical relationship this report discusses state and federal legislative power generally focusing on number of these federalism cases the report does not however address the larger policy issue of when it is appropriateas opposed to constitutionally permissibleto exercise federal powers the us constitution provides that congress sh all have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the various states this power has been cited as the constitutional basis for significant portion of the laws passed by congress over the last 50 years and it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers in united states v lopez and subsequent cases however the supreme court did bring into question the extent to which congress can rely on the commerce clause as basis for federal jurisdiction another significant source of congressional power is the fourteenth amendment specifically the equal protection and due process clauses section 5 of that amendment provides that congress has the power to enforce its provisions in the case of flores v city of boerne however the court imposed limits on this power requiring that there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be remedied and the law adopted to that end the tenth amendment provides that powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people while this language would appear to represent one of the most clear examples of federalist principle in the constitution it has not had significant impact in limiting federal powers however in new york v united states and printz v united states the court did find that under the tenth amendment congress cannot commandeer either the legislative process of state or the services of state executive branch officials the eleventh amendment provides that the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state although this text is limited to preventing citizens from bringing diversity cases against states in federal courts the supreme court has expanded the concept of state sovereign immunity further to prohibit citizens generally from bringing suits against states under federal law generally there are exceptions to this limitation however and congress also has limited ability to abrogate such state immunity finally congress has the power under the spending clause to require states to undertake certain activities as condition of receiving federal monies such conditions however must be related to the underlying grant and the financial consequences of noncompliance cannot be coercive

generally legislate on all matters within their territorial jurisdiction this police power does not arise from the constitution but is an inherent attribute of the states territorial sovereignty the constitution does however prov ide certain specific limitations on that power for instance state is relatively limited in its authority regarding the regulation of foreign imports and exports 2 or the conduct of foreign affairs3 further states must respect the decisions of courts of other states4 and are limited in their ability to vary their territory without congressional permission5 in addition the supreme court has found that states are limited in their ability to burden interstate commerce6

basis for federal jurisdiction under the gunfree school zones act of 1990 congress made it federal offense for any individual knowingly to possess firearm at pl ace that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone31 in lopez the court held that because the act neither regulated commercial activity nor contained requirement that the possession was connected to interstate commerce the act exceeded the authority of congress under the commerce clause although the court did not explicitly overrule any previous rulings upholding federal statutes 23 the times

would appear to suggest new limits to congresss legislative authority the scope and extent of the commerce clause does not appear to have been of particular concern to the framers of the constitution32 there are indications that the founding fathers considered the federal regulation of commerce to be an important power of the new constitution primarily as means of facilitating trade and of raising revenue33 while the antifederalists argued that the new constitution gave too much power to the fede ral government they apparently did not raise significant objections to the granting of power to regulate interstate commerce34 the supreme court however developed an expansive view of the commerce clause relatively early in the history of judicial review for instance chief justice marshall wrote in 1824 that the power over commerce is vested in congress as absolutely as it would be in single government and that the influence which their constituents possess at elections are the sole restraints on this power35 however the issue in most of the early supreme court commerce clause cases dealt not with the limits of congressional authority but on the implied limitation of the commerce clause on states ability to regulate commerce36 it has been suggested that the commerce clause should be restricted to the regulation of selling buying bartering and transporting37 in fact much of the federal legislation approved of by the supreme court early in the 20th century did relate to issues such as the regulation of lottery tickets38 the transporting of adulterated food39 and the interstate transportation of prostitutes40 moreover during the early 1900s the supreme court struck down series of federal statutes that attempted to extend commerce regulation to activities such as production manufacturing41 and mining42 starting in 1937 however with the decision in nlrb v jones laughlin steel corporation 43 the supreme court held that congress has the abil ity to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions that affect commerce transactions in the nlrb case the court upheld the national labor relations act finding that by controlling industrial labor

the court rejected previous distinctions between the economic activities such as manufacturing that led up to interstate economic transactions and the interstate transactions themselves by allowing congress to regulate activities that were in the stream of commerce the court also set the stage for the regulation of variety of other activities that affect commerce subsequent court decisions found that congress had considerable discretion in determining which activities affect interstate commerce as long as the legislation was reasonably related to achieving its goals of regulating interstate commerce45 thus the court found that in some cases events of purely local commerce such as local working conditions might because of market forces negatively affect the regulation of interstate commerce and thus would be susceptible to regulation46 the court has also held that an activity which in itself does not affect interstate commerce could be regulated if all such activities taken in the aggregate did affect interstate commerce47 under the reasoning of these cases the court has upheld many diverse laws including laws regulating production of wheat on farms48 racial discrimination by businesses49 and loansharking50 the lopez case was significant in that it is the first time since 1937 that the supreme court struck down federal statute purely based on finding that congress had exceeded it powers under the commerce clause51 in doing so the court revisited its prior cases sorted the commerce power into three categories and asserted that congress could not go beyond these three categories 1 regulation of channels of commerce 2 regulation of instrumentalities of commerce and 3 regulation of economic activities that affect commerce52 within the third category of activities that ffect commerce the court determined that the power to regulate commerce applies to intrastate activities only when they substantially affect commerce 53 still the court in lopez spoke approvingly of earlier cases upholding laws that regulated intrastate credit transactions restaurants utilizing interstate supplies and hotels catering to interstate guests the court also recognized

legal times 25 may 8 1995 52 the court failed to note that to some extent the three categories are intertwined for instance the first category the regulation of streams or channels of commerce allows regulation of the creation movement sale and consumption of merchandise or services but the initial extension of the streams of commerce analysis by the court to intrastate trade was justified by the effect of these other activities on commerce see nlrb v jones laughlin 301 us 1 31 1936 similarly the second category which allows the regulation of such instrumentalities of commerce as planes trains or trucks is also based on the th eory that threat to these instrumentalitie s affects commerce even if the effect is local in nature southern railway company v united stat 222 us 21 2627 1911re

rulings wickard v filburn which allowed the regulation of the production and consumption of wheat for home consumption54 the court in lopez found however that the gunfree school zones act fell into none of the three categories set out above it held that it is not regulation of channels of commerce nor does it protect an instrumentality of commerce finally its effect on interstate commerce was found to be too removed to be substantial the court noted that the regulated activity possessing guns in school neither by itself nor in the aggregate affected commercial transactions 55 further the statute contained requirement that interstate commerce be affected such as that the gun had been previously transported in interstate commerce56 nor was the criminalization of possession of gun near school part of larger regulatory scheme that did regulate commerce57 finally the court indicated that criminal law enforcement is an area of law traditionally reserved to the states 58 consequently the court found that congress did not have the authority to pass the gun free school zone act it should be noted that the lopez court purported to be limiting but not overruling prior case law that had supported an expansive interpretation of the commerce clause consequently most existing federal laws which have traditionally been drafted to be consistent with this case law59 would survive constitutional scrutiny even under lopez however in at least one significant case congress passed law the violence against women act that seemed to invoke the same concerns that the court found in lopez consequently the relevant portion of that act was struck down in united states v morrison 60 in morrison the court evaluated whether 42 usc 13981 which provides federal private right of action for victims of gendermotivated violence was within the power of congress to enact under the commerce clause in morrison the victim of an alleged rape brought suit against the alleged rapist arguing that this portion of the act was sustainable because it addressed activities that substantially affect interstate commerce 61 the court however noted that unlike traditional statutes based on the commerce clause the activity in question had nothing to do with commerce or an economic enterprise this point had been made previously in lopez and here the court reaffirmed the holding that in order to fall under the acceptable category of laws that substantially affect commerce the underlying activity itself must generally be economic or 54 wickard v filburn 317 us 111 1942 55 514 us at 564 the

relate to an economic activity the court held that it was beyond the authority of congress to regulate in the case of gonzales v raich 63 the court evaluated an as applied challenge to the controlled substances act as regards obtaining manufacturing or possessing marijuana for medical purposes the case was brought by two seriously ill residents of california who used marijuana in compliance with the california compassionate use act of 199664 the challenge was based on the argument that the narrow class of activity being engaged inthe intrastate noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by patients physician pursuant to valid california state lawdid not have substantial impact on commerce and thus could not be regulated under the commerce clause65 in upholding the application of the controlled substances act in the raich case the court relied on its decision in wickard v filburn 66 which held that even if appellees activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce it may still whatever its nature be reached by congress if it exerts substantial economic effect on interstate commerce67 the wickard case upheld the application of the agricultural adjustment act of 193868 which was designed to control prices by regulating the volume of wheat moving in interstate commerce the court in wickard held that congress could regulate not only the wheat sold into commerce but also wheat retained for consumption on farm 69 the court did so on the theory that the while the impact of wheat consumed on the farm on interstate commerce might be trivial it was significant when combined with wheat from other farmers similarly situated70 based on wickard the court in raich held that congress could consider the aggregate effect that allowing the production and consumption of ma rijuana for medical purposes would have on the 62 the requirement that commerce clause regulation be economic or commercial has been influential in number of subsequent statutory interpretation cases in jones v united states 529 us 848 2000 criminal defendant challenged his conviction under 18 usc 844i which in part makes it crime to destroy by fire or explosive building used in interstate commerce applying the statutory canon that one should interpret statute to avoid constitutional doubt jones v united states 526 us 227 2 39 1999 the court held that the statute did not apply to private residence that was used as collateral to obtain and secure loan used to obtain insurance and used to receive natural gas from other sources the court construed the statute to require that building protected by 844i be actively employed for commercial purposes id at 855 arguing that broader interpretation would extend the statute to virtually every arson in the country similar result occurred in the case of solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 in swancc the court considered challenge to the migratory bird rule 51 fed reg 41217 which extended 404a of the clean water act cwa 33 usc 1344a to nonnavigable isolated wetlands the court held that this interpretation of the statute would raise serious constitutional questions requiring for instance close examination of precisely what activity was being regulated absent clear statement from congress that it

diversion of marijuana grown for medicinal purposes for other uses would frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market72 in both cases the court found that the regulation was within congresss commerce pow er because congress had rational basis to determine that production of commodity meant for home consumption be it wheat or marijuana could have substantial effect on supply and demand in addition because exempting the use of medical marijuana could undercut enforcement of the controlled substances act the court found that the application in this case was within congresss authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper 73 to effectuate its powers

amendment provides that states shall not deprive citizens of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deprive them or equal protection of the laws section 5 provides that congress has the power to legislate to enforce the amendment the fourteenth amendment represented significant shift of power in the nations federal system until the passage of the fourteenth amendment the constitution was limited to establishing the powers and limitations of the federal government however the amendments passed immediately after the civil war the thirteenth 74 fourteenth and fifteenth75 amendments dramatically altered this regime passage of these amendments subjected states control over its own citizens to oversight by eith er the federal judiciary or congress the most significant impact of the fourteenth amendment has been its implementation by the federal courts as state legislation came under scrutiny for having violated due process or equal protection however congress has also seen fi t to exercise its power under the fourteenth amendment to address issues such as voting rights and police brutality the scope of congresss power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment however has been in flux over the years in katzenbach v morgan 76 the court held that 5 of the fourteenth amendment authorized congress not just to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment as defined by the courts but to help define its scope in katzenbach the court upheld portion of the v oting rights act of 1965 that barred the application of english literacy requirements to persons who had reached 6th grade in puerto rican school taught in spanish in upholding the statute the court rejected the argument that c ongresss power to legislate under the fourteenth amendment was limited to enforcing that which the supreme court found to be violation of that amendment rather the court held that congress could enforce the fourteenth amendment by appropriate legislation consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution the rationale for this holding appears to be that congress has the ability to evaluate and address factual situations that it determines may

constitutional violation to have occurred in fact what the court appeared to have done was to require only that congress establish rational basis for why the legislation was necessary to protect fourteenth amendment right subsequent supreme court cases however have limited the reach of katzenbach in oregon v mitchell 77 the court struck down requirement that the voting age be lowered to 18 for state elections in prohibiting congress from dictating the voting age for state elections splintered court appears to have supported congresss power to pass laws that protect fourteenth amendment rights against state intrusions but rejected the ability of congress to extend the substantive content of those rights as 18yearolds are not protected class under the fourteenth amendment the court found that congress was attempting to create rather than protect fourteenth amendment rights more recently in the case of flores v city of boerne 78 the court struck down the religious freedom restoration act rfra as beyond the au thority of congress under 5 of the fourteenth amendment for many years prior to the passage of rfra law of general applicability restricting the free exercise of religion to be consistent with the freedom of exercise clause of the first amendment had to be justified by compelling governmental interest however in the 1990 case of oregon v smith 79 the court had lowered this standard the smith case involved members of the native american church who we re denied unemployment benefits when they lost their jobs for having used peyote during religious ceremony the smith case held that neutral generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even if the law is not supported by compelling governmental interest rfra in response was an attempt by congress to overturn the smith case and to require compelling governmental interest when state applied generally applied law to religion the city of boerne case arose when the city of boerne denied church building permit to expand because the church was in designated historical district the church challenged the zoning decision under rfra the supreme court reiterated that 5 of the fourteenth amendment gave congress the power to enforce existing constitutional protections but found that this did not automatically include the power to pass any legislation to protect these rights instead the court held that there must be co ngruence and proportionality between the injury to be remedied and the law adopted to that end for instance the courts decision in katzenbach v morgan of allowing the banning of literacy tests was justified based on an extensive history of minorities being denied suffrage in this country in contrast the court found similar pattern of the use of neutral laws of general applicability disguising religious bigotry and animus against religion rather than an attempt to remedy problem rfra was seen by the court as an attempt by congress to overturn an unpopular supreme court decision the law focused on one area of alleged harm to religion but rather just broadly inhibited state and local regulations of all types consequently the court found rfra to be an overbroad response to relatively nonexistent problem the scope of the enforcement power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment also has become important in cases where the court has found that congress

provision thereof for instance as discussed in detail below the supreme court has held that the eleventh amendment and state sovereign immunity generally prohibit individuals from suing states for damages under federal law80 however the supreme court has also held that congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity under the fourteenth amendment81 this means that in many cases litigants suing states will have to find fourteenth amendment basis for federal legislation in order to defeat an eleventh amendment defense for instance significant amount of federal legislation is clearly supported by the commerce clause but it might not be supported under 5 recently the court decided two cases that illustrate the difficulties of establishing fourteenth amendment authority for such legislation in college savings bank v florida prepai d postsecondary education expense board 82 the supreme court considered an unfair competition suit brought by new jersey savings bank against the state of florida the new jersey savings bank had developed patented program where individuals could use certificate of deposit contract to save for college the state of florida set up similar program and the college savings bank sued florida for false and misleading advertising under provision of the trademark act of 1946 lanham act83 alleging that florida had made misleading representations about its own product the court first noted that under seminole tribe of florida v florida article i powers such as the power to regulate commerce were insufficie nt to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity thus the court next considered whether the lanham act could be characterized as an exercise of congresss power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment although the fourteenth amendment provides that state shall deprive person of property without due process of law the court found that the unfair trade in question whic h consisted of allegedly inaccurate statements made by the state of florida about its own saving program did not infringe on any exclusive property right held by the college savings bank as the court found that congress had not established an authority under the fourteenth amendment to abrogate the states immunity the college savings bank could not proceed against the state of florida for unfair trade practices even if property interest is established it would still need to be determined that congress had the authority to protect that property interest under the fourteenth amendment in florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board v college savings bank 84 the court in decision concerning the same parties as the case discussed above considered whether the college savings bank could sue the state of florida for patent infringement congress had passed law specifically providing that states could be sued for patent violations85 citing three sources of constitutional authority the article i patent clause86 the article i interstate commerce clause87 and 5

the question became whether congress had the authority to pass patent legislation under 5 of the fourteenth amendment unlike the previous case the court found that under long line of precedents patents were considered property rights however the court had to further consider whether the protection of such property right under 5 of the fourteenth amendment was appropriate under its ruling in city of boerne consequently the court evaluated whether federal right to enforce patents against states was appropriate remedial or preven tive legislation aimed at securing the protections of the fourteenth amendment for patent owners specifically the court sought to evaluate whether unremedied patent infringement by states rose to the level of fourteenth amendment violation that congress could redress the court noted that congress had failed to identify pattern of patent infringement by the states and that only handful of patent infringement cases had been brought against states in the last 100 years the court also noted that congress had failed to establish that state remedies for patent infringement were inadequate for citizens to seek compensation for injury in fact the state of florida argued that constitutionally based violation had occurred as it had procedures in place that would provide the necessary due process for patent infringement by the state to be challenged consequently the court found that the exercise of 5 of the fourteenth amendment in this context would be out of proportion to the remedial objective the court engaged in similar analysis with like results in evaluating the application of age discrimination laws to the states in kimel v florida board of regents 88 the court noted that the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 while valid exercise of congresss commerce power could not be applied to the states unle ss congress also had the power to enact it under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the kimel court held however that age is not suspect class and that the provisions of the adea far surpassed the kind of protections that would be afforded such class under the fourteenth amendment further the court found that an analysis of congresss ability to legislate prophylactically under section 5 required an examination of the legislative record to determine whether the remedies provided were proportional and congruent to the problem review by the court of the adea legisl ative record found evidence of pattern of state governments discriminating against employees on the basis of age consequently the court held that state could not be liable for damages under the adea similarly the application of title i of the americans with disabilities act ada to states was considered in the case of the board of trustees v garrett 89 again with similar result in garrett the court evaluated whether two plaintiffs could bring claims for money damages against state university for failing to make reasonable employment accommodations for their disabilities one plaintiff was under treatment for cancer the other for asthma and sleep apnea although disability is not suspect class and thus discrimination is evaluated under rational basis test the court had previously shown heightened sensitivity to arbitrary discrimination against the disabled 90 further congress had made substantial findings regarding the pervasiveness of such discrimination however the supreme court declin ed to consider evidence of discrimination by either the private sector or local government nd dismissed the examples that did relate to the states as unlikely to rise to the level of constitutionally irrational discrimination ultimately the 88 528 us 62 2000 89 531 us 356 2001 90 cleburne v cleburne living center inc 473 us

discrimination against the disabled had been established and that the application of the ada was not proportionate response to any pattern that might exist however the court reached different conclusion in the case of nevada department of human resources v hibbs 91 in the hibbs case an employee of the nevada department of human resources had dispute with the department regarding how much leave time he had available under the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla the fmla requires employers to provide employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for close relative with serious health condition 92 in hibbs the court held that congress had the power to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity under the fmla so that state employee could recover money damages the court found that congress had established significant evidence of long and extensive history of sex discrimination with respect to the administration of leave benefits by the states and that history was sufficient to justify the enactment of the legislation under 5 the standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of genderbased classification is more difficult to meet than the rationalbasis test such was at issue in kimel and garrett so it was easier for congress to show pattern of state constitutional violations even where the eleventh amendment and state sovereign immunity are not at issue the court may be asked to consider whether the fourteenth amendment establishes sufficient basis for federal law that does not appear to have constitutional basis elsewhere in the constitution for instance in united states v morrison 93 discussed previously94 the court found that congress in creating federal private right of action for victims of gendermotivated violence had exceeded its authority under the commerce clause consequently the plaintiff in that case made the alternate argument that the federal private right of action could be sustained under 5 of the fourteenth amendment this argument however suffered from two major fects first the court has long held that the fourteenth amendment provides congress with the authority to regulate states but not individuals 95 in morrison however the civil case had been brought against the individuals alleged to have engaged in the offense the plaintiff attempted to avoid this problem by arguing that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gendermotivated violence and that providing federal private right of action was an appropriate means to remedy this state action however the court rejected this argument finding that the remedy did not meet the city of boerne test of congruence and proportionality to the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end 96

action could not be supported by reference to the fourteenth amendment97 the court again considered the issue of congresss power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment in tennessee v lane98 in the lane case two paraplegic plaintiffs alleged that the state of tennessee and several of its counties violated title ii of the ada which requires that the disabled be provided access to public services programs and activities by failing to provide physical access to state courts 99 the court held that title ii as applied to this right of access to the courts was proper exercise of congresss authority under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to abrogate states eleventh amendment im munity similar to its holdings in the garrett and hibbs cases the court found that congress had established sufficient evidence of the sustained denial of persons with disabilities of access to the courts100 in applying the boerne congruence and proportionality test the court in lane distinguished the rights congress intended to protect in title ii access to public services programs and activities from the title i employment rights that had been struck down in garrett while both titles i and ii were intended to address unequal treatment of the disabled which is only constitutional violation when it is irrational the court held that title ii was also intended to reach the more rigorously protected rights of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment such as the right of access to the courts101 the court stated that the due process rights congress sought to protect under title ii required standard of judicial review at least as searching as the sexbased classifications the court considered in hibbs 102 the limited nature of title ii as remedy for the denial of the right of access to courts also informed the courts holding that the measure is valid prophylactic remedy103 congresss authority under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to abrogate states eleventh amendment

the ada for purposes of fourteenth amendment analysis based on this narrow scope of inquiry the court determined that both the pattern of past discrimination in access to the courts and the failure of previous legislative attempts to remedy the injury were sufficient to hold that title ii is valid exercise of congress power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment 102 541 us at 529 as noted by chief

prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people while this language would appear to represent one of the most clear examples of federalist principle in the constitution it has not had significant impact in limiting federal powers initially the supreme court interpre ted the tenth amendment to have substantive content so that certain core state functions would be beyond the authority of the federal government to regulate thus in national league of cities v usery 106 the court struck down federal wage and price controls on state employees as involving the regulation of core state functions107 the court however overruled national league of cities in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority108 in sum the court in garcia seems to have said that most disputes over the effects on state sovereignty of federal commerce power legislation are to be considered political questions and that the states should look for relief from federal regulation through the political process 109 this appeared to have ended the courts attempt to substantively limit federal government regulation of the states the court soon turned however to the question of how the constitution limits the process by which the federal government regulates the states in new york v united states 110 congress had attempted to regulate in the area of lowlevel radioactive waste in 1985 statute congress provided that states must either develop legislation on how to dispose of all lowlevel radioactive waste generated within the state or the state would be forced to take title to such waste which would mean that it became the states responsibi lity the court found that although congress had the authority under the commerce clause to regulate lowlevel radioactive waste it only had the power to regulate the waste directly here congress had attempted to require the states to perform the regulation and decreed that the failure to do so would require the state to deal with the financial consequences of owning large quantities of radioactive waste in effect congress sought to commandeer the legislative process of the states in the new york case the court 105 id at 881 106 426 us 833 1976 107 in national league of cities v usery the court conceded that the legislation under attack which regulated the wages and hours of certain state and local governmental employees was undoubtedly within the scope of the commerce clause but it cautioned that there are attributes of sovereignty attaching to every state government which may not be impaired by congress not because congress may lack an affirmative grant of legislative authority to reach the matter but because the constitution prohibits it from exercising the authority in that manner 108 469 us 528 1985 justice blackmuns opinion for the court in garcia concluded that the national league of cities test for integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions had proven impractical and that the court in 1976 had tried to repair what did not need repair 109 see also south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988 110 505 us 144 1992

of the constitution and it was thus violation of the tenth amendment later case presented the question of the extent to which congress could regulate through states executive branch officers this case printz v united states 111 involved the brady handgun act the brady handgun act required state and local lawenforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers within five business days of an attempted purchase this portion of the act was challenged under the tenth amendment under the theory that congress was without authority to commandeer state executive branch officials after historical study of federal commandeering of state officials the court concluded that commandeering of state executive branch officials was like commandeering of the legislature outside of congresss power and consequently violation of the tenth amendment although the federal government is prohibited from commandeering either the legislature or executive branch of state this does not appear to be the case with state judicial branches the federal judicial system and the state judicial system were not intended to be as separate as the other branches of government and the supremacy clause of the constitution explicitly provides that state courts must follow federal law even if it overrides state laws or constitutions 112 so there appears to be less of concern regarding the commandeering of state courts key distinction between constitutional substantive regulation and unconstitutional commandeering appears to be whether or not the federal mandate in question is regulating state activities or whether it is seeking to control the manner in which states regulate private parties thus for instance the court recently held in reno v condon113 that the drivers privacy protection act of 1994 which regulates the sale of personal information gathered from persons seeking drivers licenses was substantive regulation not commandeering in that case the court found that the state was not being directed on how to regulate its citizens but rather on how to treat information that had been elicited from those citizens however because the regulation affected both state governments and private reselle rs of such information the court reserved the question as to whether law which only regulated state activities would be constitutionally suspect

purposes of the eleventh amendment the court noted that the bankruptcy petition in question was an in rem proceeding so that the courts jurisdiction was over the petitioners debt rather than over her

factors including what law the suit is being brought under whether the state has taken action to make itself amenable to such law and what relief is being sought the starting point for such discussion is us ually the eleventh amendment the eleventh amendment reads as follows the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state the actual text of the amendment appears to be limited to preventing citizens from bringing diversity cases against states in federal courts however the supreme court has expanded the concept of state sovereign immunity to reach much further than the text of the amendment the eleventh amendment the first amendment to the constitution after the adoption of the bill of rights was passed as response to the case of chisholm v georgia 115 immediately after the adoption of the constitution number of citizens filed cases in federal court against states one of these chisholm was diversity suit filed by two citizens of south carolina against the state of georgia to recover revolutionary war debt in chisholm the supreme court noted that article iii of the constitution specifically grants the federal courts diversity jurisdiction over suits between state and citizens of another state116 thus the court held that this grant of jurisdiction authorized the private citizen of one state to sue another state in federal court without that states consent the states were outraged that such suit could be brought in federal court protesting that the drafters of the constitution had promised the states they would not be sued by their debtors in federal courts almost immediately after the decision of the chisholm cases resolutions were introduced in congress to overturn it the end result being the eleventh amendment the amendment ensured that citizen of one state could not sue another state in federal courtin other words citizen could not sue under federal diversity jurisdiction without states permission however even after the eleventh amendment was passed number of cases were filed against states by private citizens with jurisdiction base d on federal question rather than diversity under this reasoning if citizen of state sued his or her own state in federal court the prohibition of the eleventh amendment would not apply consequently for number of years after the passage of the eleventh amendment this type of case was entertained by the federal courts however this line of cases was ended by the case of hans v louisiana 117 in hans v louisiana the court provided for an interpretation of the eleventh amendment that allowed the court to move beyond the literal text of that amendment under the reasoning of the court the eleventh amendment was not so much an amendment to the original structure of the constitution as it was an attempt to overturn specific court decision that had misinterpreted this structure according to this line of reasoning the eleventh amendment was not an amendment but restoration of the original constitutional design 115 2 us dall 419 1793 116 us const

in subsequent cases was not the eleventh amendment but the issue of state sovereign immunity state sovereign immunity means that state must consent to be sued in its own court system this concept is based on early english law which provided that the crown could not be sued in english courts without its consent the doctrine of sovereign immunity was in effect in the states that were in existence at the time of the drafting of the constitution further various writings by the founding fathers seemed to support the concept 118 thus the issue before the court in hans was whether the grant of jurisdiction to federal courts under article iii of the constitution had abrogated state sovereign immunity the hans court found that article iii did not have this effect although the hans court answered the issue of whether adoption of article iii of the constitution had waived state sovereign immunity in federal courts it left number of questions unanswered for instance the question as to whether there are any instances where congress could by statute abrogate states sovereign immunity so that citizen could sue state under federal law in seminole tribe of florida v florida 119 the court seemed to answer that in most cases such suits would not be accepted the seminole case involved the indian gaming regulatory act of 1988 which provided indian tribes with an opportun ity to establish gambling operations however to establish such gambling the indian tribes had to enter into compact with the state in which they were located the states in turn were obligated to negotiate with the indian tribes in good faith and this requirement was made enforceable in federal court thus the question arose as to whether the tribes could sue the states under the eleventh amendment the court in seminole found it important to establish what constitutional authority was being exercised by the passage of the indian gaming law the court determined that the power being exercised was the indian commerce clause 120 which is found in article i the court had found previously in pennsylvania v union gas 121 that the commerce power as plenary power was so broad that of necessity it required the ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity in seminole however the court overturned union gas holding that as the eleventh amendment was ratified after the passage of the constitution and article i it was limitation on congresss authority to waive states sovereign immunity under that article the court did indicate however that congress can abrogate state sove reignty under the fourteenth amendment while the logic behind this distinction is unclear 122 it means that in many cases litigants suing states 118 see alden v maine 527 us 706 2248 1999 119 517 us 44 1996 120 us const art i 8 cl 3 121 491 us 1 1989 122 one apparent argument is that the fourteenth amendment was passed after the eleventh amendment and thus unlike legislative powers found in article i of the constitution it can be seen as an alteration of the restrictions of the eleventh amendment seminole tribe of florida v florida 517 us 44 6566 1996 however as is discussed in detail below the supreme court has held that state sovereign immunity preceded and predated the constitution alden v maine 527 us 706 2248 1999 consequently all the articles of the constitution could arguably be seen as altering the restrictions of the state sovereign immunity another argument made by the court in seminole is that the fourteenth amendment was designed to alter the pre existing balance between state and federal power at the time of its passage this argument is more plausible but is still difficult to differentiate between congresss power under the fourteenth amendment and congresss power under the articles of the constitution like the fourteenth amendment the articles of the constitution were clearly intended to alter the balance between state and federal power at the tim of the passage of the constitution which included state sovereign immunity this is exemplified by the supremacy clau us const art vi cl 2 which provides that laws passed under the articles of the constitution would be

legislation to defeat an eleventh amendment defense question left unanswered by the hans decision was whether the eleventh amendment which prohibited congress from abrogating states sovere ign immunity in federal court extended to states own courts in alden v maine 123 the supreme court found that the same principles of sovereign immunity identified in hans would prevent congress from authorizing state to be sued in its own courts without permission as in hans the court acknowledged that the literal text of the eleventh amendment does not prohibit such suits as its language addresses only suits brought in federal courts consequently the court relied instead on the proposition that sovereign immunity is fundamental postulate of the constitutional design and is not amenable to congressional abrogation the same reasoning that prohibited these suits from being brought in federal court deference to the respect and dignity of state sovereignty led the court to conclude that it would be anomalous to allow such cases to be brought instead in state court in federal maritime commn v south carolina state ports authority the court addressed the issue of whether state sovereign immunity extended to proceedings before federal agencies 124 in this case the south carolina state ports authority denied cruise ship permission to berth at the states port facilities in charleston south carolina contending that the primary purpose of the cruise was for gambling the cruise ship company maritime services filed claim with the federal maritime commission fmc arguing that south carolina had discriminated against it in violation of the shipping act of 1984 and sought among other things damages for loss of profits 125 the port authority however successfully moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that it was inconsistent with the concept of state sovereign immunity in reviewing the case the court analogized between the fmcs quasijudicial proceedings and traditional judicial proceedings while noting that the preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord states the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities126 consequently the court agreed that state sovereign immunity bars the fmc from adjudicating damage claims made by private party against nonconsenting state127 in dissent however justice breyer noted that agency administrative proceedings are not judicial proceedings and that the ultimate enforcement of such proceedings in court is done by the federal agency to which state sovereign immunity does not apply thus while an agency remains capable of enforcement actions against states in federal court it cannot use its own adjudicative process to determine whether to do so but must rely on its investigatory powers 128 according to 123 527 us 706 1999 124 122 s ct 186 2002 125 46 usc app 1701 1994 supp v 126 122 s ct at 1874 127 the court noted that there are numerous common featur shared by administrative adjudications and judicial proceedings 122 s ct at 1872 federal administrative law requires that agency adjudication contain many of the same safeguards as are available in the judicial process the proceedings are adversary in nature they are c onducted before trier of fact insulated from political influence party is entitled to present his case by oral or documentary evidence and the transcript of testimony and exhibits together with the pleadings constitutes the exclusive record for decision the parties are entitled to know the findings and conclusions on all of the issues of fact law or discretion presented on the record id 128 justice breyer noted that after this decision private person cannot bring complaint against state to federal administrative agency where the agency 1 will use an intern adjudication process to decide if the complaint is well founded and 2 if so pro ceed to court to enforce the law id at 1881

many instances the federal government still has the ability to influence state behavior despite the constitutional limits discussed above130 one of the more significant ways that the federal government can encourage state behavior is to impose conditions on the receipt of federal monies by the states considering the large amount of funds provided to states by the federal government this represents sign ificant power for congress to exercise further as the concept of grant conditioning can involve waiver by the states of tenth and eleventh amendment rights these grant conditions may allow congress to indirectly achieve compliance by state in way that could not be achieved directly the question of whether state can be required to perform or refrain from certain actions was addressed in the supreme court case of south dakota v dole 131 in dole congress enacted the national minimum drinking age amendment of 1984132 which directed the secretary of transportation to withhold percentage of federal highway funds from states in which the age for purchase of alcohol was below 21 years the state of south dakota which permitted 19year olds to purchase beer brought suit arguing that the law was an invalid exercise of congresss power under the spending clause to provide for the general welfare133 the supreme court held that as the indirect imposition of such standard was directed toward the general welfare of the country it was valid exercise of congresss spending power the court noted that the grant condition did not implicate an independent constitutional bar ie the grant condition did not require the state to engage in an unconstitutional activity further the court noted that the grant condition was not violation of the tenth amendment which generally prevents congress from commandeering state legislatures 134 and executive branch officials135 to implement federal programs136 the tenth amendment would not apply here the court held because the state officials were voluntarily cooperating in order to receive federal grants and thus were not being directed to comply with federal mandates 129 id 130 for instance the federal government has in some cases made the application of federal regulatory authority contingent so that if state chooses to regulate in that field the federal regulatory role is circumscribed in many cases this will encourage

congresss power under the spending clause to require states to meet certain grant conditions first grant condition must be related to the particular national projects or programs to which the money was being directed137 in dole the congressional condition imposing specific drinking age was found to be related to the national concern of safe interstate travel which was one of the main purposes for highway funds being expended second the court suggested that in some circumstances the financial inducements offered by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion 138 in dole however the percentage of highway funds that were to be withheld from state with drinking age below 21 was relatively small so that congresss program did not coerce the states to enact high er minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose one of the more controversial potential applications of this doctrine arises when the government requires that in order to receive grant state waive its sovereign immunity to suits brought by private citizens as discussed above the supreme court has imposed significant limits on congresss ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity however this does not appear to have prevented the lower courts from finding that states can be required to waive their sovereign immunity as condition of receiving grants states sovereign immunity is personal privilege which it may waive at its pleasure139 thus it is clearly possible for state under some circumstances to waive sovereign immunity as condition of receiving federal funds140 the supreme court has held that mere receipt of federal funds is insufficient to constitute waiver of state sovereign immunity141 however the court has also held that where federal statut contains an unambiguous waiver of states eleventh amendment immunity then states acceptance of such funds can be an effective waiver 142 137 483 us at 207 138 id at 211 139 college savings bank

grant condition would pass constitutional muster under dole just as states may waive their tenth amendment rights not to be commandeered when accepting grant conditions as noted in dole it seems generally accepted that there is constitutional bar to state voluntarily waiving its sovereign immunity rights143 as general matter conditioning federal grant on the voluntary waiver of state sovereign immunity does not seem to be of particular constitutional concern under dole however court would on casebycase basis need to examine the level of financial burden that would be imposed on the state by the withdrawal of particular federal grant to ensure that the condition was not coercive further under dole court would need to examine how related the purpose of the proposed bill was to the waiver of sovereign immunity in connection with particular grant program144 however the court in dole indicated that it would show significant deference to congress in dete rmining whether grant condition relates to an underlying federal program and this requirement does not appear to have been of concern to lower courts considering waiver of sovereign immunity as grant condition145 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 it would appear that the status of the state in the federal system has been strengthened by recent supreme court opinions although the court s not scaled back the federal governments substantive jurisdiction significantly it has to some extent prevented the expansion of congresss power under the commerce clause and under 5 of the fourteenth amendment further it has created variety of obstacles as to how these powers can be executed forbidding congress under the tenth amendment from commandeering the authority of state legislative and executive branches and limiting the authority of congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity ultimately however congress retains significant powers to influence state behavior such as through the spending clause and under the supremacy clause congress may require the enforcement of its laws in both state and federal court 143 susan m luken irreconcilable differences the spending clause and the eleventh
