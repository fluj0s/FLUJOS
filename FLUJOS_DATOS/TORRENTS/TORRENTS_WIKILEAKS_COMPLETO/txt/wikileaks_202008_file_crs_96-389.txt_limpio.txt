international trade and finance environment and natural resources policy division summary the north american free trade agreement nafta was implemented in january 1994 thus far clear pattern has emerged regarding usmexico cattle trade in the first year the us trade deficit in cattle fell but in the second year that deficit reached record level while some us cattle producers blamed nafta for the record deficit the underlying causes were devaluation of the peso mexicos economic contraction and drought in northern mexico lower us cattle prices which some also contend were the result of nafta were the result of several factors including high grain prices and large domestic cattle supplies introduction during 1995 us cattle imports from mexico surged in value by 54 from the year earlier over the same time us exports fell to an almost negligible level many cattle producers in the united states blamed the recently implemented nafta for the dramatic change cattle imports from mexico were about 1 of the total us herd feeder cattle imports represented 45 of all us feeder cattle usmexico trade in cattle figure 1 on the following page shows us imports and exports for 19911995 this period includes the three years preceding nafta implementation on january 1 1994 and the two years since the data show that both before and after nafta us imports of cattle from mexico were much greater than us exports in the first year of nafta 1994 us imports of cattle from mexico fell from the prior year and us exports grew causing the us deficit in cattle to fall below the deficit in the three prenafta years in the second year of nafta 1995 however that pattern changed us imports of cattle shot up and exports nearly disappeared causing record us bilateral trade deficit in cattle

and why did us exports fall so much the three chief reasons were 1 peso devaluation 2 economic contraction in mexico and 3 drought in northern mexico crs4 peso devaluation on december 20 1994 the mexican government devalued the peso by 15 in succeeding days the peso swiftly floated downward for total drop of 40 in value1 the drop in the pesos value was followed by other serious economic problems including higher inflation and deep depression by the summer of 1995 the united states and international financial organizations had extended assistance to mexico to help stabilize its economy the peso devaluation has several implications for us agricultural and other trade the devaluation caused us exports which are denominated in dollars to become relatively more expensive in the mexican market and caused mexican exports which are denominated in pesos to become relatively less expensive in the us market thus us cattle exports to mexico became more costly while mexican cattle exports to the us market became less costly the effect of the peso devaluation was felt most in the first half of 1995 for by the last quarter of the year cattle imports were at about the same level as year earlier2 adjustment as seen in the current account balance may be largely behind for mexico however mexico is still recovering economic contraction in mexico historically mexicos economy and us total exports to mexico have moved in the same direction3 when mexicos economy has grown us exports to mexico also have grown and when mexicos economy contracted us exports to mexico contracted the reason these two measures move together is that as mexicos economy grows or contracts mexican consumers have more or less income to spend on all products and services including imports the link between the two measures has not changed with nafta in 1993 the year before nafta the mexican economy grew at an almost flat 04 and total us exports to mexico grew at 24 in 1994 the first year of nafta mexicos economy grew at strong 35 and total us exports grew by 223 in 1995 however mexicos economy contracted by 69the largest oneyear decline since the depressionand total us exports fell by 107 looking only at us agricultural exports the same relationship was seen except that the rates of growth and contraction were even greater if mexicos economy turns around in 1996 then us exports to mexico could increase the us department of the treasury reports that mexicos recession probably 1 for more information on the peso devaluation see us library of congress congressional research service

report states that mexicos economy grew by 28 and 23 during the third and fourth quarters of 1995 respectively and it cites forecast of 22 in real economic growth in 1996 drought and other problems the northern states of mexico experienced severe drought in 1994 and 1995 which caused an immediate increase in cattle shipped to the united states as mexican ranchers quickly sold their cattle for export nevertheless about 300000 cattle in mexico perished because of the drought according to mexicos national livestock confederation5 higher exports and deaths cut mexicos herd by 8 during 1995 according to one estimate6 the higher exports that were caused by drought are not expected to continue into 1996 the herd size is smaller fertility rates have fallen and the drought has not ended other problems have hurt the mexican cattle industry as well the peso devaluation pushed up prices for inputs drugs for the animals feedstuffs and machinery7 credit problems discourage capitalization as long as the drought and other problems continue mexicos herd is unlikely to grow much and analysts do not expect exports to the united states to reach the levels seen in late 1994 and 19958 nafta and cattle trade the three developments discussed above were important reasons for higher us imports and lower us exports of cattle but was nafta also an important reason looking at naftas provisions relating to cattle trade the trade agreement most likely was not notable cause of worsened cattle trade with mexico absent the other unexpected developments if anything the tariff provisions of the trade agreement should have increased us exports more than imports mexico had 15 tariff on cattle before nafta and immediately eliminated the tariff under the trade agreement under normal circumstances this would have been expected to increase us exports to mexico moreover before nafta us imports of purebred breeding and dairy cattle entered tarifffree so there was change under nafta and us imports of other cattle had tariff of about 1 cent per pound which was eliminated immediately under nafta less direct changes were made under other nafta provisions sections on animal health import licensing and border inspections were expected to facilitate trade in both 4 us department of the treasury treasury secretarys report to congress on mexico updated april 4 1996 on internet at

provisions were intended to increase trade by providing more predictable and stable trading system and were not expected to change the immediate level of trade unless they were invoked nafta and cattle prices some in the cattle industry have blamed nafta for the drop in cattle prices that has taken place since 1993 this position was wellknown in mexico mexican cattlemen were concerned about the us industry perception that record mexican live cattle exports have contributed to reduce us southern cattle prices9 as at least one us farming source reported however there was definitely regional price effect but nafta didnt cause it10 the drop in cattle prices was due to causes other than nafta chief among them were high grain prices and large cattle supplies11 when grain prices are high feedlots which fatten cows on grain before slaughter must pay more for feed and pay less for cattle corn prices are at record levels and have pushed down cattle prices the supply of cattle is at high point in the multiyear supply cycle more calves are still being born even though prices are falling so the supply of cattle may not fall for another year or two cattle supplies include imports from mexico but imports are only small share of total supplies imports from mexico during 1995 were at most only about 1 of the total us cattle herd and even feeder imports cattle that are at the grain feeding stage before slaughter which were the major share of imports represented only 45 of all us feeder cattle thus imports from mexico were not the major determinant in the drop in cattle
