intelligence surveillance and reconnaissancebackground deepwater missions the coast guard performs variety of missions in the deepwater environment which generally refers to waters more than 50 miles from shore these missions include search and rescue drug interdiction alien migra nt interdiction fisheries enforcement marine pollution law enforcem ent enforcement of lightering ie at sea cargotransfer zones the internationa l ice patrol in northern waters overseas inspection of foreign vessels entering us ports overseas maritime intercept sanctionsenforcement ope rations overseas port securi ty and defense overseas peacetime military engagement and general defense opera tions in conjunction with the navy deepwatercapable assets are also used closer to shore for various operations origin of deepwater acquisition effort the coast guard initiated the deepwater acquisition effort in the late 1990s following determination by the coast guard that many of its existing ie legacy deepwatercapable legacy assets were projected to reach their retirement ages within several years of one another the coast guards legacy assets at the time included 93 aging cutters and patrol boats and 207 aging aircraft many of these ships and aircraft are expensive to operate in part because the cutters require large crews increasingly expensive to maintai n technologically obsolete and in some cases poorly suited for performin g todays deepwater missions structure of deepwater acquisition effort structure until 2007 until 2007 the coast guard pursued deepwater acquisition through single performancebased systemofsystems acquisition program that used privatesector lead system integrator lsi systemofsystems acquisition rather than replacing its deepwatercapable legacy assets through series of individual acquisition programs the coast guard initially decided to pursue the deepwater acquisition effort as an integrated systemofsystems acquisition under which combin ation of new and modernized cutters patrol boats aircraft along with associated c4isr1 systems and logistics support would be pr ocured as single integrated package ie system of systems the coast guard believed that systemofsystems approach would permit deepwater acquisition to be optimized ie made most cost effective at the overall deepwater systemofsystems level rather than suboptimized at the level of individual deepwa ter platforms and systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs3 2 for more on privatesector lsis see crs report rs22631 defense acquisition use of lead system integrators lsis background oversight issues and options for congress by valerie bailey grassoprivatesector lead sy stems integrator lsi to execute this systemofsystems acquisition approach the coast guard initially decided to use privatesector lead system integrator lsi an industry entity responsible for desi gning building and integrating the various elements of the package so that it met the coast guards projected deepwater operational requi rements at the lowest possible cost2 the coast guard decided to use privatesector lsi in part because the size and complexity of the deepwater program was thought to be beyond the systemi ntegration capabilities of the coast guards relatively small in house acquisition work force performancebased acquisition the coast guard initially pursued the deepwater program as performancebased acquisition meaning that the coast guard set performance requirements for the program and permitted the privatesector lsi some latitude in determining how the various elements of the deepwater system would meet those requirements the coast guard conducted competition to select the privatesector lsi for the deepwater program three industr teams competed and on june 25 2002 the coast guard awarded the role to integrated coast guard systems icgs an industry team led by lockheed martin and northrop grumman ship systems ngss icgs was awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract for the deepwater program that included fiveyear baseline term that ended in june 2007 and five potential add itional award terms of up to five years 60 months each on may 19 2006 the coast guard announced that it was awarding icgs 43month first additional award term reflecting good but not excellent performance by icgs with this additi onal award term the contract has been extended to january 2011 revised structure since 2007 in 2007 as the coast guards management and execution of the thenintegrated deepwater program was being strongly criticized by various observers the co ast guard announced number of reform actions that significantly altered the services approach to deepwater acquisition and to acquisition in general as result of these reforms the coast guard among other things stopped pursuing deepwater acquisition through single performancebased systemofsystems acquisition program that used privatesector lsi and began pursuing deepwater acquisition as coll ection of individua l definedbased acquisition programs with the coast guard assuming the lead role as systems integrator for each individual programs although deepwater acquisition programs still appear in the budget under the common heading ids the coast guard is now pursuing deepwa ter acquisition programs as individual programs rather than as elements of single integratedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs4 program the coast guard states that it is still using systems approach to optimizing its acquisition programs including the deepwater acquisition programs but that the system being optimized is now the coast guard as whole as opposed to the deepwater subset of programs coast guard as system integrator the coast guard announced in april 2007 that among other things it would assume the lead role as systems integrator for all coast guard deepwater assets as well as other major coast guard acquisiti ons as appropriate the coast guard is phasing out its reliance on icgs as privatesector lsi for deepwater acquisition and shifting systemintegration responsibilities to itself to support this shift the coast guard is increasing its inhouse systemintegration capabilities definedbased acquisition the coast guard has decided to shift from performancebased acquisition to the use of moredetailed specifications of the capabilities that various deepwater assets are to have the coast guard states that although this new approach involves setting moredetailed performance specifications it does not represent return to minutelydetailed specifications such as the military specification milspec system once used in department of defense dod acquisition programs the coast guard refers to its new approach as defi nedbased acquisition the coast guard has stated that the 43 month award term with icgs is being used to complete deepwater acquisition efforts already underway task orders issued under the award term the coast gu ard has stated are for performance periods of not more than 18 months with the aim of closing out these efforts by july 1 2007 the coast guard has stated only thr ee deepwater contract line item numbers clins remained with icgs those for the national security cutter nsc the maritime patrol aircraft mpa and c4isr integration the coast guard states that as of lateapril 2008 its inhouse acquisition and programmanagement staff included 946 pe ople the coast guards goal is to increase that figure to about 1000 the coas t guard states that as of lateapril 2008 there were shortfalls within the coast guards acquisition and programmanagement staff in the areas of contract officers and certain other specialities the coast guard stated that it is addressing these shortfa lls through new hiring and training and that the effort to overcome these shortfalls mig ht be complete within about 24 months depending on budgets and the hiring environment the coast guard states that it will continue to use the services of independent thirdparty sources of support including the navy the coast guard states that government program manageme nt will be performed by uni formed or ci vilian coast guard members

is working on implementing the remainder see discussion below on gao pe rspective the coast guard is also now using document called the major systems acquisition manual masm as standard guide for its various acquisition programs the coast guard notes that although problems occurred with the cutter acquisition programs and the vuav program many other elements of the deepwaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs12 13 source for information in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph coast guard briefing to crs on the deepwater program april 28 2008 for an overview of developments regarding coast guard manage ment of deepwater acquisition through mid 2008 see john c marcario deepwater gains seapower august 2008 1618program are being successfully implemented the coast guard states that funding spent on the 110123 patrol boat conversi on program 96 million the initial design effort for the frc 33 million and the initial portion of the vuav effort roughly 115 million together constitute only small fraction of the total funding spent on various deepwater acquisition programs nd that funding spent elsewhere in the program has achieved numerous results in terms of newly delivered capabilities13 gao perspective gao has been assessing and making recommendations for coast guard management of deepwate r acquisition for several years recent gao reports on the issue include those discussed below june 2008 gao report regarding overall management of deepwater acquisition gao reported in june 2008 that coast guard leadership has increased accountab ility by bringing deepwater under restructured acquisition function and vesting its government project managers with management and oversight responsibilities formerly held by icgs however like other federal agenci it has faced challenges in building an adequate government workforce july 2007 reorganization of the acquisition function placed deepwater which had been insulated from other coast guard acquisitions within conso lidated acquisition directorate allowing the agency to operate in more strategic fashion the coast guard has also shifted the roles and responsibilities of ke positions within this new acquisition structure formerly icgs had significant program management responsibilities such as contractual responsibility for dr afting task orders including statements of work and managing the system integration of deepwater as whole coast guard project managers and technical experts now hold the greater balance of management responsibility and accountability for program outcomes the coast guard like other federal agencies faces challenges in building capable government workforce to manage this large acquisition while it attempts to reduce vacancy rates it is relying on support contractors in key positions such as cost estimation and analysis the i ssue of support contractors in acquisition is not unique to the coast guard we re cently reported that the department of defense also relies heavily on contractors to perform roles in program management cost estimation and gineering and technical functions the coast guards decision to manage deepwater under an assetbased approach rather than an overall system ofsystems has resulted in increased government control and visibility over its acquisitions coast guard officials are reevaluating their longterm relationship with icgs and have begun to hold competitions for deepwater assets outside of that contract further cost and schedule information is now captured at the individual asset level which has resulted in improved visibility such as the ability to track and report cost breaches for assets under the prior struct ure cost breach was to be tracked at the overall deepwater program level and the threshold was so high that breach would have been triggered only by catastrophic event while the assetbased approach is beneficial certain crosscutting aspects of deepwater such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs13 c4isr and the overall numbers of each asset needed to meet requirements still require systemlevel approach the coast guard is not fully positioned to manage these aspects for example it has not developed an acquisition strategy for c4isr and lacks at present the ab ility to model the capabilities of planned and existing assets in manner that informs decisions on the numbers of deepwater assets needed the coast gu ard maintains however that it must proceed with its acquisitions in the absence of this information under the assetbased acquisition approach the coast guard has begun to follow the disciplined project management framework of its major systems acquisition manual msam which requi res documentation and approval of decisions at key points in programs lif cycle by designated officials at high levels while the msam process is significant improvement over the past approach it has some shortcomings for example the process currently allows limited or lowrate initial production to proceed before the majority of design activities have been completed as evidenced by our work on acquisition best practices this situation could result in increased costs stemming from concurrent design and production in addition the pproval process established by the msam is not being followed because dhs delegated review and approval of asset decisions to the coast guard further the coast guard previously authorized deviation from the requirement to follow the msam process for deepwater as it was not thought to be compatible with the programs broad systemofsystems approach consequently decisions to proceed with individual deepwater projects were not based on specific criteria under disciplined process such as determination as to whether the proposed asset would fulfill coast guard requirements the consequences of not following disciplined acquisition approach are clear now that deepwater assets such as the national security cutter nsc ve been paid for and delivered without the coast guards having determined whether the assets planned capabilities would meet mission needs the coast guard is now in the process of developing the documents and test plans it needs to do so the coast guard has developed new reporting systems designed to help project managers and decision makers affect project outcomes but some key information is not reliable quarterly pr oject reports compile cost and schedule information to summarize the status of ea ch asset and the probability of project success tool is intended to discern future outcomes through analysis of multitude of different elements however coast guard officials currently lack enough detail into the earned value management data reported by the contractor these data are used to assess progress on cost and schedule goals in addition the processes used by northrop grumman one of the firsttier subcontractors to generate earned value data may need to be recertified to ensure the datas reliability the resulting lack of confiden ce in the earned value data the coast guard currently receives will have an impact on decision making for future assets as officials need to be informed of contractors past cost and schedule performance when evaluating proposed pr ices such as prices for longlead materials for and production of the fourth nsc officials state that they are addressing these issues through joint efforts with the navy and the defense contract management agency dcma as the coast guard assumes greater control over the deepwater program we are making recommendations to further strengthen its management and oversight specifically we are recomme nding that the secretary of homeland security improve dhss oversight of th deepwater program by rescinding thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs14 14 government accountability office coast guard change in course improves deepwater management and oversight but outcome still uncertain gao08745 june 2008 pp 36delegation of deepwater acquisition au thority we are also recommending that the commandant of the coast guard revise msam procedures to insert formal design review before lowrate initial production can begin and that the commandant develop an approach to increase visibility into northrop grummans earned value management data before the coast guard enters into any additional contractual relati onships with that contractor14 the report also states in response to significant problems in achieving its intended outcomes under deepwater coast guard leadership has made major change in course in its management and oversight of this program even with this change the coast guard continues to face numerous risks of varying magnitude in moving forward with an acquisition program of this size while the initiatives the coast guard has underway have already begun to have positive impact on reducing these risks the extent and durability of their impact depends on positive decisions that continue to increase and improve government management and oversight the current reliance on informal pro cedures to keep dhs informed of deepwater developments is not appropriate for an acquisition of this magnitude the deepwater program will continue for some time to come and the full burden of transcending the inevitable challeng should not rest solely with the initiatives of the current coast guard leadership the coast guards major systems acquisition process requires dhs approval of milestone decisions however the 2003 dhs delegation to the co ast guard of such approval means that dhs does not have formal approv authority and it could lack the information needed to strategically allocate funding by balancing requirements and needed capabilities across departmental components in addition the coast guards acquisition process calls for decision to authorize initial production before knowledge is gathered about the stabi lity of an assets design and production processes which is contrary to best practices and could result in cost increases and schedule delays because of redesign and because the coast guards knowledge of the reasonablene ss of contractors proposed cost and schedule targets for deepwater assets relies in part on visibility into and confidence in the contractors earned va lue management data the coast guard may lack solid basis to evaluate fu ture proposals by northrop grumman until known problems with its data are resolved to help ensure that th initiatives to improve deepwater management and oversight continue as intended and to facilitate decisionmaking across the department we recommend that the secret ary of homeland security direct the under secretary for management to rescind the delegation of deepwater acquisition decision authority we also recommend that the commandant of the coast guard take the following two actions to improve knowledgebased decisionmaking for its acquisitions revise the procedures in the major systems acquisition manual related to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs15 15 ibid pp 2931authorization of lowrate initial producti on by requiring formal design review to ensure that the design is stable as well as review before authorizing initial production to improve program management of surface assets contracted to northrop grumman ship systems develop an appr oach to increase visibility into that contractors earned value management data reporting before entering into any further contractual relationships such as for long lead material for and production of the fourth nsc in written comments on draft of this report the department of homeland security concurred with our findings th department stated that it would take our recommendation on rescinding the delegation of deepwater acquisition decision authority under advisement but neither concurred nor disagreed with the recommendation the coast guard c oncurred with our recommendation on requiring formal design review before lowrate initial production and plans to incorporate such review in its next re vision of the msam process in addition it partially concurred with our recommendation to improve program management of surface assets by developing an appr oach to increase visibility into northrop grummans earned value management data the coast guard stated that it agrees with the recommendation and is in the process of funding dcma for surveillance of northrops earned value system and increasing the level of visibility into northrops data starting with the fourth nsc production contract however the coast guard stated that earned value data would provide limited utility for the fixedprice long lead materi als contract for this acquisition and that obtaining the data would pose sign ificant cost and schedule impact to determine fair and reasonable price fo r the long lead and production contracts the coast guard plans to obtain and review northrops certified cost and pricing data it appears to us that the coast guard has developed an approach for increasing visibility into the earned value management data for future contracts with northrop grumman we believe this approach if implemented as planned will address our recommendation15 march 2008 gao report gao reported in march 2008 that the coast guard has changed how d ecisions are made about purchasing deepwater assets it is moving from systemofsystems acquisition model with the contractor icgs as the syst em integrator to more traditional acquisition strategy in which the coast guard will take more direct role and manage the acquisition of each asset separately we have closed two of the five open recommendations from our previous report pertaining to the coast guards us of models and metrics to measure the contractors progress toward improving operational effectiveness and establishing criteria for when to adjust the total ownership cost baseline the coast guard has taken actions on the three recommendations that remain open such as designating coast guard offici als as the lead on integrated product teams developing draft maintenance and logistics plan for the deepwater assets and potentially eliminating the award term provision from the icgshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs16 16 government accountability office status of selected aspe cts of the coast guards deepwater program gao08270r march 11 2008 p p 23 17 ibid objective 1 page 2contract however at this time the actions are not sufficient to allow us to close them16 the same gao report also stated the coast guard is moving away from the icgs contract and the system ofsystems model with the contractor as system integrator to more traditional acquisition strategy where the coast guard will manage the acquisition of each asset separately in series of reports since 2001 we have noted the risks inherent in the systems integrator approach to the deepwater program and have made number of recommendations intended to improve the coast guards management and oversight we specifically focused on the need to improve program management contractor accountability and cost control we as well as the dhs inspector general and others have also noted problems in specific acquisition efforts notably the nationa l security cutter n sc and the 110foot patrol boat modernization which was permanently halted due to operational and safety concerns the coast guard has recognized that it needs to increase government oversight and has begun to transfer system integration and program management responsibilities back to the coast guard it has begun taking formal steps to reclaim authority over decision making and to more closely monitor program outcomes the coast guard has also begun to competitively purchase one asset the fast response cutterb and plans to competitively purchase other assets outside of the icgs contract expanded the role of third parties including the us navy to perform independent cost assessments and program technical analyses and reorganized and consolidated the acquisition function to strengthen its ability to manage projects additionally because the idiq contract minimum was met during the 5year base term the government is under further obligation to use the contract coast guard officials said that they are currently evaluating whether to continue to use the icgs contract for fforts that are already under way such as the nsc versus contracting directly with the subcontractors further they may continue to use the icgs contract fo r certain efforts such as logistics17 regarding gao recommendation to take steps to make integrated product teams ipts effective the same gao report states current status partially implemented the coast guard is in the process of restructuring the ipts which remain key program management tool coast guard program managers rather than icgs representatives now chair the ipts the ipts current role is to discuss options for problem solving related to cost schedule and performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs17 18 ibid objective 4 page 8 19 ibid objective 3 page 9objectives but the program manager is ultimately responsible for making decisions in addition to evaluating and rechartering some existing ipts the coast guard has organized two new ones nd is in the process of establishing several others since the coast guard will now chair ipts the chartering of subipts to clarify roles and responsibilities is longer an issue coast guard officials plan to use working groups established under the authority of the ipts to address specific issues working groups are more informal and can come together and disband on an asneeded basis finally the electronic information system built and managed by icgs is still used as tool used to share information among geographically dispersed ipt members specifically icgs and the coast guard however with the decreasing reliance on icgs as the system integrator this particular contractorled electronic informationsh aring system may become less integral to effective management of the deepwater program due to the ongoing chartering restruct uring and reevaluation of the roles and responsibilities of the ipts within the new construct of the deepwater program this recommendation remains open as partially implemented18 regarding gao recommendation to provi information on maintenance and logistics responsibilities th same gao report stated current status partially implemented in june 2007 we reported that the coast guard announced it was assuming the role of the default provider of maintenance and logistics supplemented by contractors as necessary the coast guard is still formalizing its assumption of maintenance and logistics responsibilities the coast guard technical authority is developing commandant instruction th at outlines policies processes roles and responsibilities for maintenance and logistics support for deepwater assets the coast guard plans for deepwater ssets to follow the same maintenance program already familiar to coast guard maintenance personnel as its other assets however the coast guard expects that some areas such as command control communications nd computer electronics will require contractor support until coast guard pers onnel can be trained or new personnel can be hired to fill these roles because the coast guard has not yet issued the final commandant instruction that assigns maintenance nd logistics responsibilities to coast guard personnel instead of icgs we are leaving this recommendation open as partially implemented once the instruction that addresses our recommendation is issued we plan to close this recommendation as implemented19 regarding gao recommendation to hold the system integrator acc ountable for competition

partially implemented the coast guard has taken steps to increase its insight into makeorbuy decisions for deepwater assets under the icgs contract in 2005 the coast guard asked icgs to notify the government of makeorbuy decisions of 10 million or more however in december 2006 the coast guard reported that contractor data were inadequate to determine the level of competition achieved subsequently the june 2007 award term modification incorporated formal requirement for reporting makeorbuy decisions icgs must submit makeorbuy plan that outlines rationale and justification for each dto proposal that contains work items or work efforts priced at more than 5 million andor that would typically require company management review because of complexity cost need for large quan tities or requirement for additional production facilities the rationale should consider overall benefit to the government including 1 longterm andor nearterm cost benefit 2 adequacy of considerations made in the makeorbuy determination 3 impacts on product performance 4 present and future supportability maintenance andor upgrade potential and 5 proprietary data or other restrictions that could limit pursuit of future costeffective alternatives the coast guard is putting less emphasis on the subcontractor competition issue due to the move away from using the icgs contract and more toward full and open competition in fact coast guar d officials told us that because of potential legislation that would prohib it them from using icgs as the system integrator they are considering eliminating award term provisions from the contract in addition the coast guard longer uses award fees under the icgs contract however it has incorporated an incentive fee for the nsc we are leaving this recommendation

compliance w ith emission security requirements the coast guard adheres closely to th department of homeland security department of defense and the national s ecurity agency rules regulations and protocols for tempest testing and cer tification as stated previously classified information is permitted to be loaded on any system that does not meet these stringent requirements the coast guard recognized earlyon that since the bertholf was first in class close attention needed to be paid to ia since the contract emphasized commercial equipment and software use where possible to mitigate this risk the coast guard began testing and evaluating the systems as early as possible often before installations were complete this effort provided excellent data to the coast guard and contractor for focusing efforts this preliminary testing revealed several areas within the bertholfs c4isr suite that required attention to date the testing regimen has incl uded the following informal and formal tests mini instrumented tempest survey may 31june 3 2007 various discrepancies were noted to the contractor for corrective actions visual tempest inspection july 2007 the inspection generated

needs are one of the main reasons for the cost increases hurricane katrina was another contributing factor but coast guard actions also contributed to the increases such as the decision to proceed with production before reso lving fatigue life concerns fatigue is physical weakening because of age stress or vibration us navy analysis done for the coast guard determined that the ships design was unlikely to meet fatigue life expectations the coast gu ard ultimately decided to correct the structural deficiencies for the first tw national security cutters at scheduled points after construction is completed to avoid stopping the production lines and to incorporate structural enhancements into the design and production for future ships in august 2007 the coast guard and icgs agreed to consolidated contracting action to resolve the contract ors request for equitable adjustment of 300 million stemming from icgss contention that the coast guard had deviated from very detailed

includi ng certain repairs that fall under the ships warranty35 march 2008 gao report in march 2008 gao reported the following regarding the status of the nsc program changes to the nsc have had cost schedule and performance ramifications the estimated costs for the first thre ships have generally doubled from the initial projected costs due to numbe r of contributing factors including requirements changes as result of september 11 hurricane katrina damages and some program management actions by the coast guard delivery of the ship could be delayed an aggressive trial schedule leaves little time for dealing with the unexpected and most certifications have yet to be completed coast guard officials expect the ship to meet all performance parameters but will not know for certain until the ship undergoes trials further coast guard engineers have concerns that most of th ships available weight margin has been consumed during construction meaning that subsequent changes to the ship will require additional redesign and engineering to offset the additional weight36 the gao report also stated the nscs projected costs have increa sed compared to the initial baseline as

survivab ility including chemical biological and radiological measures increased flight capability via longer and enhanced flight deck upgraded weapon systems and improved classified communication capabilities another contributing factor was hurri cane katrina which not only caused considerable damage to the shipyard in cluding tooling equipment shops and other facilities but also caused an exodus of the experienced workforce the overall number of shipworkers declined significantly causing the contractor to use more overtime hours the loss of worker s in turn considerably disrupted the ships learning curve which normally resu lts in greater efficiencies in production of subsequent ships however some of the increase can be attributed to coast guard actions for example the contractor used the co ast guards failure to precisely execute the contract according to the implemen tation plan as basis for requesting an equitable adjustment furthermore even though the coast guards own technical staff raised fatigue life concerns later confirmed by us navy study during the design phase the decision was made to proceed with production of the first two nscs and enhance the structure

several factors involving testing certifications and other areas of technical risk machinery trials occurred in early cember and builders trials occurred february 8 11 2008 the current schedule leaves little margin for delay acceptance trials are scheduled to be gin april 7 2008 the contract requires 30 days between acceptance trials and ship delivery but the scheduled dates for these events are about 3 weeks apart the coast guard and the contractor are aware of the discrepancy however cision has been made on how to resolve this issue the coast guard will have to either extend the delivery date of the ship to meet the requirement or waive it our prior work has shown that eventdriven rather than scheduledriven decisions are preferable thus it may be in the best interest of the coast guard to delay acceptance of the first nsc until number of these issues are resolved of the 987 certification standards icgs was to submit documentation on 892 for review and acceptance by the coast guard technical authority almost all remain outstanding in addition the coast guard and contractor differed in their understanding of the number of certifications for which abs was responsible northrop grumman had c ontracted with abs to certify 60 standards however the coast guard believed abs was responsible for 84 according to coast guard officials the issue has been resolved and abs will now be responsible for 86 certifications fu rther for nsc 3 and later ships abs will be responsible for about 200 certifications other third parties will certify 11 of the standards the coast guard has identified 13 i ssues pertaining to c4isr and hull mechanical and electrical as risk areas 8 of which have moderate to high risk of occurrence or impact if not resolved on of these relates to the results of the july 2007 visual tempest inspection conducted by team of coast guard officials the team reported hundreds of di screpancies over 40 percent of which pertain to cable grounding

moved forward with the award of design and construction contract to bollinger shipyards for the first fast response cutter frc which is based on dutch design defense daily sept 29 that contract potentia lly worth 15 billion is only for between 24 and 34 of the 153foot sentinelclass cutters even though the coast guards requirement is for 58 of the vessels thats because the coast guard wants to leave open its options for either reintroducing competition into the progra m or possibly transitioning to more advanced technological design at some point rear admiral gary blore said at one time the coast guard had planned to have the frcs made with composite hull design which it thought would reduce the lifetime maintenance costs for the vessels but the coast guar d decided against that route because it feels the technology isnt mature enough in fact when it announced bollingers win the coast guard said the composite technology would likely not be ready in the foreseeable future but blore said the coast guard will keep its options open and look at the technology again in couple of years still he said in his professional judgment i dont see anything happening in composites in the next couple of years thats going to make difference one of the reasons why it would be difficult to move forward with composite hull patrol boat design is the fact the service time required to get the payback for the higher upfront costs is longer and will outstrip the life of the subsystems so basically you have to strip the ship down and rebuild that from the inside out and when you do that it doesnt have cost advantage over aluminum or steel construction blore also said there are few ports around the united states canada and the caribbean with ship composite shops comp ared to machine shops that work with aluminum and steel to conduct repair s which could be problematic52 gao perspective june 2008 gao report in june 2008 gao reported the following regarding the status of the frcb

proposed by the system integrator to assess and mitigate technical risks this design was known as the frca the co mmandant of the coast guard officially terminated frca design efforts in february 2008 after approximately 35 million had been obligated to icgs to meet an aggressive schedule the frca was initiated as an undefinitized ct action uca meaning that the contractor was authorized to begin work and incur costs before final agreement on contract terms and conditions including price was reached under ucas the government risks paying increased costs because the contractor has little incentive to control costs the uca was expected to be definitized in january 2006 but this has not yet occurred coast guard officials anticipate its happening soon over the past 2 years the coast guard has pursued acquisition of modified commercially available pa trol boat with similar performance capabilities to the frca termed the f rcb the coast guard issued request for proposals for the frcb and is currently reviewing contractor responses coast guard officials told us there wa s sufficient competition and they plan to award the contract in july 2008 the first frcb is scheduled to be delivered in 2010 the contract is for the design and production of up to 34 cutters the coast guard intends to acquire 12 frcs by 2012 for an estimated cost of 593 million or 494 million per cutter coast guard officials told us they are pursuing this 12boat acquisition strategy to help fill the current patrol boat operational gap they plan to assess the capabilities of th frcb before exercising options for additional cutters the officials told us they have not updated the acquisition program baseline for this asset and they do not plan to update cost estimates until the contract is awarded53 march 2008 gao report in march 2008 gao reported that the coast guard obligated approximately 35 million on the icgs design for the frc but concerns prompted fficials to put the acquisition on hold to fill its urgent need for patrol boats the coast guard plans to award contract for commercially available design of the frc coast guard officials said this approach will help ensure competition nd meet their tight time frames the new requirements for this design of the frc have some differences these include top speed that is 2 knots slower 28 instead of 30 knots and allowance of manual smallboat launch and recovery system that coast guard officials said is not as safe and requires more crew to operate than the preferred stern ramp system54 the same gao report also stated frca design efforts remain suspendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs37 55 ibid objective 2 page 3since the frca acquisition effort began the coast guard obligated approximately 35 million to icgs for the design of this asset but viable design has not been produced coast guard officials told us that at this time design efforts remain suspended they do not expect to incur any additional costs related to the frca the original estimate for the fleet of 58 frcas was approximately 32 billion due to high risk and uncertain cost savings coast guard officials recommended to the commandant that the coast guard not pursue acquisition of an frca design that includes unpr oven composite hull technology the officials told us this recommendation was largely based on thirdparty analysis that found the composite technology unlikely to meet the desired 35year service life under the coast guards operational c onditions therefore officials believe that the use of the proposed composite materials would not offset high initial acquisition costs as icgs had initially proposed cost schedule and pe rformance of frcb in june 2007 the coast guard issued an rfp for the design construction and delivery of modified commercially available patrol boat for the frcb the coast guard estimated in late 2006 that the total acquisition cost for 12 frcbs would be 593 million coast guard officials do not plan to update cost estimates for the frcb until after the contract is awarded the coast guard is currently evaluating proposals and expects to award the frcb contract in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 with the lead cutter to be delivered in 2010 coast guard officials stated that their goal is still to acquire 12 frcbs by 2012 the contract will include 2year base period for the design and production of the lead cutter and six 1year option pe riods the first option period includes 3 lowrate initial production cutters and the subsequent five option periods include an option of 4 or 6 cutters each the coas t guard intends to award fixed price contract for design and construction of the frcb with the potential to acquire total of 34 cutters regarding performance there are some key differences in the frcb as outlined in the rfp compared with the requirements for the frca one difference is speed the coast guard lowered the minimum requirement for sprint speed from 30 knots for the frca to 28 for the frcb another pertains to onboard small boat launchandrecovery mechanisms the initial design for the frca included stern ramp launch this capability is not required on the frcb however coast guard officials expressed preference for the stern ramp launchandrecovery system because it would be safer and require fewer crew to operate than manual alternative coast guard officials said that eliminating these design requirements would ensure more competition on the open market and meet their urgent need for patrol boats55 revolving door and potential for conflicts of interest the socalled

officials to oversee one of the federal governments most complex experiments at privatiza tion known as deepwater who had past or subsequent business ties to the contract consortium led by industry giants northrop grumman and lockheed martin the secretary of transportation norman mineta whose department included the coast guard when the cont ract was awarded in 2002 was former lockheed executive two deputy secretaries of the department of homeland security which the coast guard became part of in 2003 were former lockheed executives and third later served on its board washingtons revolvingdoor laws ve long allowed officials from industry giants such as lockheed the nations largest defense contractor to spend parts of their careers working for us security agencies that make huge purchases from those companies though there are limits but deepwater dramatizes new concer n current and former us officials said how dwindling competition in the private sector mushrooming federal defense spending and the governments diminished contract management skills raise the stakes for potential conflicts of interest deepwater also illustrates how federal ethics rules carve out loopholes for senior policymakers to oversee decisions that may benefit former or prospective employers these include outsourcing strategies under which taxpayers bear most of the risks for failure analysts said there is sign that any of the retired admirals or former lockheed officials did anything illegal but the connections between the agenci and the contractors have drawn the attention of the dhs

stated aviation mission hour gap the committee is concerned about the significant shortfall of maritime patrol aircraft mpa resource hours cu rrently confronting coast guard which estimates that it will be nearly 50 percent below its mpa resource hour needs in 2008 this gap is not expected to be eliminated until 2015 one example of this gap is the absence of permanent maritime patrol aircraft capability operating from air station borinquen puerto rico the committee is concerned about the impact of this absence upon coast guards ability to patrol the highly trafficked smuggling routes of the caribbean basin co ast guard is directed to report to the committee later than february 16 2009 on its plan to provide adequate resources for the maritime surveillance mission needs in the air station borinquen area of responsibility coast guard is in the process of analyzing short term stopgap measures to address its mpa capability needs until its largescale acquisitions are in full operation the committee has included 10000000 to fund such stopgap measures before this funding may be obligated coast guard shall submit an expenditure plan for approval to the committees on appropriations legacy cutter sustainment the committee is concerned about coast guards reliance upon high endurance and medium endurance cutters th at are rapidly aging many of which have completed over 30 years of service life and the implications this has for the mission availability of these assets as of the end of fiscal year 2007 the 378foot 270foot and 210foot cutters had percent time fully mission capable ptfmc combined average of only 583 percent 337 percent below the combined average ptfmc target for these cutters these concerns are punctuated by recent major causalities crew habitability issues and significant maintenance costs according to coast guards 2008 revised deepwater implementation plan the 378foot cutte r fleet will be operating through 2017 the 270foot cutter fleet will be operating through 2027 and the 210foot cutter fleet will be operating through 2022 in each case the expected operating life is much longer than forecast just two years ago the committee directs coast guard to provide later than february 16 2009 detailed analysis of maintenance costs for the 378foot 270f oot and 210foot classes of cutters including comparisons of pre and post mission effectiveness projects where applicable examination of major engineering causalities over the last three years and an examination of the costs and benefits of an intensive maintenance program upon

issues and options for congress by ronald orourkepolar icebreaking operating and maintenance costs and future polar needs58 the committee is concerned about coast guards ability to meet its polar operations mission requirements and pr ovide the united states with the capability to support national interests in the polar regions the committee provides 200000 as requested to conduct an analysis of national mission needs in the high latitude regions to inform the national polar policy debate in fiscal year 2006 the committees on appropriations approved an administration request for the nationa l science foundation nsf the primary user of the three coast guard polar ic ebreaker vessels to fund the costs of operating and maintaining these aging vessels because it has become more apparent that the national interest in the polar regions extends beyond scientific research the committee questions whether this arrangement should continue accordingly the committee directs coas t guard and nsf to renegotiate the existing agreement in order to return the budget for operating and maintaining these vessels to coast guard for fiscal year 2010 this change is consistent with new joint plan for coast guard support of scientific research by nsf and other federal agencies which also is to be included in the 2010 budget request nsf shall retain responsibility for the contrac ting of scientific support services that coast guard does not have the capability to perform or ca nnot perform on costcompetitive basis the committee is aware of 4000 000 funding shortfall related to the

570035000 has been appropriated for 12 mpas in april 2003 coast guard informed the committee that the requirements for the mpa were as follows 1 the ability to arrive on the scene of 90 percent of search and rescue emergencies within two hours of initial notification and 2 the ability to travel 300 nautical miles in 90 minutes 212 knot ground speed with time to climb factored in stay on scene for approximately four hours and return over 300 nautical miles with required fuel reserves however the committee understands that coast guards formal requirements for the mpa and plan for operational testing of those requirements have not been finalized ye t this is surprising since the mpa entered the operational testing phase in march 2008 the committee directs coast guard to withhold obligation of 2009 mpa funding until its formal requirements for the mpa and the mpas operational testing plan are provided to the committee unmanned aircraft systems the committee does not provide the 3000000 requested to study unmanned aerial vehicle solutions for meeting deepwaters maritime surveillance requirements instead funding is provided for this study within the research development test and ev

its surveillance range to approximately 100 nautical miles for up to twelve hours per day in fact the number of planned nscs was reduced from 12 to 8 in part due to this anticipated extension of operational effectiveness unfortunately the vuav has not worked as planned and coast guard has nothing to show for the 114550590 it has ob ligated for this project because some of this obligated amount has not yet been expended and coast guard has plans for its expenditure th committee rescinds 20000000 currently unexpended for uavs long range surveillance aircraft hc 130j the first hc130j was delivered in february 2008 however due to parallel design and installation activities resulting in rework changes in aircraft power requirements late delivery of gove rnmentfurnished equipment and

carderock division of the naval surface warfare center coast guard anticipates completion of the design and technical reviews of the third nsc by december 2008 the committee reduces nsc funding for two main reasons first the committee believes that construction of the fourth nsc likely will be delayed since the design and technical changes made to the fourth nsc will require another substantive technical review second gao fo und that coast guard plans to proceed with issuance of task orde r for long lead materials on the fourth nsc despite not having reliable data on which to base an evaluation of the contractors proposed pri ce gao has pointed out to the committee that because coast guard lacks confidence in how the contractor is representing its cost and schedule performance on the nsc coast guard is likely to be in the position of paying the contractor for future projects without the understanding necessary to evaluate proposed prices the committee directs coast guard to increase its visibility into the contractors earned va lue management data before it enters into contract to construct the fourth nsc the committee expects this enhanced visibility to lead to cost reductions fast response cutter frcbreplacement patrol boat the committee provides the requested 115 300000 for limited production of the frc breplacement patrol boat coast guard has proceeded with competitive procurement for the frcb with award projected for july 2008 the lead cutter is expected to be delivered two years later in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 the committee is concerned that this 115300000 when combined with the 41580000 in prior year funds that coast guard plans to use for the frcb results in an average cost for the three limited production vessels of 52000000 well above earlier estimates provided by the coast guard the committee understands that cost estimates for this cutter are based on limited data and directs coast guard to take all steps necessary to control costs including conducting formal design review to ensure that at least 90 percent of the design drawings are complete by the critical design review stage offshore patrol cutter opc the committee recommends 3003000 for opc requirements analysis as requested the opc is the replacement cutter for the current 210foot and 270foot medium ndurance cutters in march 2006 after spending 19758000 coast guard suspended opc design efforts due to cost concerns the committee understands that in making subseque nt decision to proceed with the opc requirements analysis the coast gu ard documented the opcs expected capabilities draft concept of operations and an initial assessment of cost and schedule coast guard is directed to provide this documentation to the committees on

guard does not have an approved acquisition strategy for c4isr coast gu ard needs to develop an architecture with common components for use on assets and to decide whether to acquire c4isr on an assetbyasset basis or at system level the committee understands that coast guard is revisiting the c4isr approach proposed by the deepwater contractor and is analyzin g requirements and architecture the committee encourages such assessment and provides the 88100000 requested for c4isr if not all of this funding is required for c4isr coast guard may use the remainder for additional modeling nd simulation activities that will help in determining the capabilities of existing and planned assets and inform the number of deepwater assets required personnel the committee recommends 95 572000 for acquisition personnel 12852000 above the amount provided in fiscal year 2008 the total equals the amount requested for this purpose when the budgets proposed in operating expenses and aci are combined coast guard faces at least three challenges as it seeks to improve its acquisition management and oversight the first is shortage of civilian acquis ition staff with an almost 20 percent vacancy rate coast guard is directed to report to the committees on any additional authorities or bonuses needed to attract civilian acqui sition expertise the second is the lack of acquisition career path for coast guard military personnel coast guard is directed to explore the establishment of dedicated acquisition and finance career field for military personnel and to report to the committee on the benefits and costs of this option the third challenge is coast guards reliance on contractors for technical and programmatic expertise the committee is pleased to hear that coast guard is currently an alyzing its workforce to determine which roles are appropriate for contractors such analysis should be provided to the committee upon its completion unmanned aerial systems the committee provides

must meet tempest certification to prevent unintended information emanation nd in order to process classified information this certification has not occurred the coast guard is to keep the committee updated on progress made to resolve ongoing information assurance issues including tempest certification in addition to the status of critical decision points and dates for all nscs the committee strongly supports the pr ocurement of one national security cutter per year until all eight planned ships are procured the continuation of production without break will ensure that these ships which are vital to the coast guards mission are procured at the lowest cost and that they enter the coast guard fleet as soon as possible replacement patrol boat the recommendation includes 115300000 for the coast guards replacement patrol boat known as the fast response cutter frc b of this amount 94000000 is for producti on of frcb 3 and 4 and 21300000 is for logistics spares program management and crew training the frcb program is critical for the coast guard to close the coast guards patrol boat hours gap which is approximately 100000 hours below the desired level the first frcb is scheduled for delivery dur ing the fourth quarter of 2010 and will be ready for mission status in 2012 th committee directs the coast guard to provide quarterly briefings on the status of this procurement including critical decision points and dates planned servi ce life extensions of the existing 110 foot patrol boats and patrol boat operational metrics mission effectiveness project the recommendation includes 66300000 for the mission effectiveness project the same as the budget re quest of this amount 35500000 is for sustainment of two 270 feet and three 210 feet medium endurance cutters and 30800000 is for sustainment of three 110 feet legacy patrol boats this funding will allow the coast guard to extend the operational life of critical legacy cutters until deepwater assets become available for missionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs52 c130j missionization and fleet introduction the committee recommends 23700000 to complete the missionization of aircraft 4 through 6 to include ra dars sensors identification systems displays antennas and mission operators station the request included funding for this program in november 2007 the coast guard reported the missionization project for the six c130js in inventory exceeded the estimated cost to complete by 15 to 20 percent resulting in the missionization of only aircraft 1 through 3 while the committee remains concerned with the programs price escalation missionizing aircraft 4 through 6 is critical to closing the shortfall of maritime patrol resource hours which is nearly 50 percent below its resource hour needs deepwater expenditure plan the committee requires the coast guard to submit an expenditure plan for deepwater that contains the following lifecycle staffing and training needs

supplemental appropriations act public law 110 28 the coast guard submitted report on the resources including training staff and expertise required to provide appropriate management and oversight of the integrated deepwater systems program the report provided limited insight into the coast guards human capital requirements except to say that workforce resource plan was being developed that provides the framework for assessing current and future workforce needs given the challenges this program has experienced and the coast guards intention to assume the role of system integrator for all deepwater assets the committee is concerned with the lack of progress made in developing workforce estimates the coast guard is to brief the committee by july 31 2008 detailing the results of its workforce forecasting process and plans to fill staffing shortfalls that will ensure capable and productive acquisition workforce now and in the future pages 8588 srept 110396 also

management the committee approves the request to transfer 3859000 from the systems engineering and integration ppa in the acquisition construction and improvements aci appropriation to the operating expenses appropriation for general services administration gsa rent this transfer is necessary to move all government personnel and government support contractors to one location and is part of the coast guards strate gy to shift management and oversight responsibilities from deepwater contractor to the coast guard60 acquisition personnel consistent with the budget request the committee transfers 82215000 and 652 fte from aci appropriation to oe appropriation to increase the oversight and ability to manage multiple major acquisition projects this transfer will improve the stewardship of major sy stems acquisition such as the integrated deepwater systems program by transfe rring aci funding to oe personnel can be surged to and from aci projec ts where needed and allow flexibility to match competencies to core requirements the committee recommends 4500000 to hire 65 additional personnel to enhance the coast guards ability to perform the systems integrator role for the integrated deepwater program and to execute traditional acquisition projects the recommended level is 4498000 below the request the committee fully supports the coast guards effort to be the systems integrator for the integrat ed deepwater program however the request included funds for fullyear fte which means the 65 new positions would need to be onboard by oct ober 1 2008 given the coast guards 185 percent vacancy rate for acquisition personnel this is an unrealistic proposal therefore the committee recommendation provides halfyear funding for this initiative the committee expects the coast guard to fully annualize the positions in fiscal year 2010 page 7761 compromise in lieu of conference report there was compromise version of the fy2009 dhs appropriations bill that was incorporated as

guard deepwater program february 2007appendix criticism of deepwater management in 2007 overall management of program many observers in 2007 believed the problems experienced in the three deepwater cutter acquisition efforts were the product of broader problems in the coast guards overall manage ment of the deepwater program reports and testimony in 2007 and prior years from the dhs ig and gao as well as february 2007 dau quick look study requested by the coast guard64 expressed serious concerns about the coast guards overall management of the deepwater program some observers expressed the view that using privatesector lsi to implement the deepwater program made complex program more complex and set the stage for waste fraud and abuse by effectively out sourcing oversight of the program to the private sector and by creating conflict of interest for the private sector in executing the program other observers including gao and the dau expressed the view that using privatesector lsi is basically valid approach but that the contract the coast guard used to implement the approach for the deepwater program was flawed in various ways undermining the coast guards ability to assess contractor performance control costs ensure accountability and c onduct general oversight of the program observers raised various issues about the deepwater contract among other things they expressed concern that the cont ract was an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract which they said can be an inappropriate kind of contract for program like the deepwater program observers also expressed concern that the contract transferred too much authority to the privatesector lsi for defining performance specifications for subsequently modifying them and for making technical judgements permitted the privatesector lsi to certify that certain performance goals had been met socalled selfcertificati on which critics argue can equate to meaningful certification provided the coast guard with insufficient authority over the privatesector lsi for resolving technical disputes between the coast guard and the privatesector lsi was vaguely worded with regard to certain operational requirements and technical specifications reducing the coast guards ability to assess performance and ensure that the program would achieve coast guard goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs59 65 for

making up the privatesector lsi to make little use of competition between supplie rs in selecting products to be used in the deepwater program to tailor requirements to fit their own products and consequently to rely too much on their own products as opposed to produc ts available from other manufacturers permitted the privatesector lsis performance during the first five year period to be scored in way that did not sufficiently take into account recent problems in th cutter acquisition efforts permitted award fees and incentive f ees ie bonuses to be paid to the privatesector lsi on the basis of attitude and effort rather than successful outcomes and lacked sufficient penalties and exit clauses observers also expressed concern that the coast guard did not have enough in house staff and inhouse expertise in areas such as program ma nagement financial management and system integration to properly oversee and manage an acquisition effort as large and complex as the deepwater program and that the coast guard did not make sufficient use of the navy or other thirdparty i ndependent sources of technical expertise advice and assessments they also expressed concern that the coast guard in implementing the deepwater program placed higher priority on meeting schedule as opposed to ensuring performance in response to criticisms of the mana gement and execution of the

appendix b coast guard reform actions in 2007 actions announced in april 2007 on april 17 2007 the coast guard announced six changes intended to reform management of the deepwater program in announcing the actions admiral thad allen the commandant of the co ast guard stated in part working together with industry th coast guard will make the following six 6 fundamental changes in the ma nagement of our deepwater program 1 the coast guard will assume the lead role as systems integrator for all coast guard deepwater assets as well as other major acquisitions as appropriate 2 the coast guard will take fu ll responsibility for leading the management of all life cycle logistics functions within the deepwater program under an improved logistics architecture established with the new mission support organization 3 the coast guard will expand the role of the american bureau of shipping or other thirdparties as appr opriate for deepwater vessels to increase assurances that deepwater assets are properly designed and constructed in accordance with established standards 4 the coast guard will work collaboratively with integrated coast guard systems to identify and implement an xpeditious resolution to all outstanding issues regarding the national security cutters 5 the coast guard will consider placing contract responsib ilities for continued production of an asset class on casebycase basis directly with the prime vendor consistent with competition requirements if 1 deemed to be in the best interest of the government and 2 only after we verify lead asset performance with established mission requirements 6 finally i will meet less than quarterly with my counterparts from industry until any and all deepwater program issues are fully adjudicated and resolved our next meeting is to be scheduled within month these improvements in program management and oversight going forward will change the course of deepwater by redefining our roles and responsibilities redefining our relationships with our industry partners and rede fining how we assess the success of government and industry management and performance the deepwater program of tomorrow will be fundamentally better than the deepwater program of today as many of you know i have directed number of significant organizational changes to the coast guard embedded within direction and orders to better prepare the coast guard to meet and stain mission performance long into thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs63 future as we confront broad range of converging threats and challenges to the safety security and stewardship of americas vital maritime interests whats important to understand here is that these proposed changes in organizational structure alignment and bus iness processes intended to make the coast guard more adaptive responsive and accountable are not separate and distinct from what we have been doing ov er the past year to improve deepwater in fact many of these initiatives can be traced directly to challenges weve faced in part in our deepwater program consequently we will be better organized better trained and better equipped to manage large complex acquisitions like deepwater in the coming days weeks months and years as we complete these servicewide enhancements to our mission support systems specifically our acquisition financial and logistics functions that is the future of the coast guard and that is the future of deepwater to be frank i am tired of looking in the rearview mirror conducting what has been the equivalent of an archaeol ogical dig into deepwater we already understand all too well what has been ailing us within deepwater in the past five years weve relied too much on contractors to do the work of government as result of tightening aci budgets arth of contracting personnel in the federal government and loss of focus on critical governmental roles and responsibilities in the management and oversight of the program we struggle with balancing the benefits of innovation and technology offered through the private sector agains t the governments fundamental reliance on robust competition both industry and government have failed to fully understand each others needs and requirements all too often resulting in both organizations operating at counterodds to one another that have benefited neither industry nor government and both industry and government have failed to accurately predict and control costs while we can and are certainly learning from the past we ought to be about the business of looking forwar d with binoculars even as we seek to see what is out over the horizon so we can better prepare to anticipate challenges and develop solutions with full transparency and accountability that is the business of government and its the same principle that needs to govern business as well and its precisely what i intend to do with the changes in management and oversight i outlined for you here today with the changes we are making in the terms and conditions of the deepwater c ontract and with the changes we will make in our acquisition and logistic s support systems throughout the coast guard if we do i have doubt in my mind that we will exceed all expectations for deepwater the deepwater program of tomorrow will be fundamentally better than the deepwater program of todayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs64 71 coast guard press release dated april 17 2007 entitled statement by adm thad allen on the converted 123foot patrol boats nd changes to the deepwater acquisition programthe coast guard has long histor of demonstrating exceptional stewardship and care of the ships airc raft and resources provided it by the public routinely extending the life of our assets far beyond original design specifications to meet the vital maritime safety security and stewardship needs of the nation knowing that to be the case i am personally committed to ensuring that our newest ships aircraft and systems acqui red through the coast guards integrated deepwater system are capable of meeting our mission requirements from the moment they enter service until they are taken out of service many many years into the future as ive said many times in the past the safety and security of all americans depends on ready and capable coast guard and the coast guard depends on our deepwater program to keep us ready long into the future the changes to deepwater management and oversight i outlined here for you today reflect significant change in the course of deepwater i will vigorously implement these and other changes that may be necessary to ensure that our coast guard men and women have the most capable fleet of ships aircraft and systems they need to do the job i ask them to do each and every day on behalf of the american people71 other actions announced in 2007 the coast guard in 2007 also did the following announced reorganization of cer tain coast guard commands including the creation of unified coast guard acquisition office that is intended in part to strengthen the coast guards ability to manage acquisition projects in cluding the deepwater program stated that would alter the terms of the deepwater contract for the 43month award term that commenced in june 2007 so as to address concerns raised about the current deepwater contract announced that it intended to proc ure the 12 frcb cutters directly from the manufacturer rather than through icgs stated that it was hiring additional people with acquisition experience so as to strengthen its inhouse capability for managing the deepwater program and other coast guard acquisition efforts stated that it concurred with many of the recommendations made in the dhs ig reports and was moving to implement themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33753crs65 stated that it was weighing th recommendations of the dau quick look study and stated that it had also implemented many recommendations regarding deepwater
