analyst in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division iraq oilforfood program illicit trade and investigations summary the oilforfood program offp was the centerpiece of longstanding security council effort to alleviate human suffering in iraq while maintaining key elements of the 1991 gulf warrelated sanctions regime in order to ensure that iraq remained contained and that only humanitarian needs were served by the program the program imposed controls on iraqi oil exports and humanitarian imports all iraqi oil revenues legally earned under the program were held in uncontrolled escrow account and were not accessible to the regime of saddam hussein the program was in operation from december 1996 until march 2003 observers generally agree that the program substantially eased but did not eliminate human suffering in iraq concerns about the programs early difficulties prompted criticism of the united states critics asserted that the us strategy was to maintain sanctions on iraq indefinitely as means of weakening saddam husseins grip on power at the same time growing regional and international sympathy for the iraqi people resulted in pronounced relaxation of regional enforcement or even open defiance of the iraq sanctions the united states and other members of the united nations security council were aware of billions of dollars in oil sales by iraq to its neighbors in violation of the sanctions regime and outside of the offp but did not take action to punish states engaged in illicit oil trading with saddam husseins regime successive administrations issued annual waivers to congress exempting turkey and jordan from unilateral us sanctions for their violations of the oil embargo on iraq until 2002 the united states argued that continued sanctions were critical to preventing iraq from acquiring equipment that could be used to reconstitute banned weapons of mass destruction wmd programs in 2002 the bush administration asserted that sanctions were eroding and the administration decided that the overthrow of that regime had become necessary the program terminated following the fall of saddam husseins regime the assumption of sovereignty by an interim iraqi government on june 28 2004 and the lifting of saddamera sanctions however after the fall of the regime there were new allegations of mismanagement and abuse of the program including allegations that saddam husseins regime manipulated the program to influence officials contractors and politicians and businessmen in numerous countries new attention also has been focused on iraqs oil sales to neighboring countries outside the control or monitoring of the offp several investigations revealed evidence of corruption and mismanagement on the part of some officials and contractors involved with the offp and called into question the lack of action on the part of sanctions committee members including the united states to halt iraqs profitable oil sales outside of the program over ten year period this product will be updated as warranted by major

trade and investigations background and structure of the oilforfood program the establishment of the united nations oilforfood program offp reflected longstanding security council effort to alleviate human suffering in iraq while pressing iraq to comply with all relevant security council resolutions1 the program was temporary and limited exception to the international trade embargo imposed on iraq by security council resolution 661 adopted on august 6 1990 after iraqs invasion of kuwait on august 2 1990 security council resolution 687 april 3 1991 provided for the international embargo on iraqs exportation of oil2 to end once iraq had fully complied with efforts to end its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs the wmd inspections began in april 1991 but proceeded more slowly than expected and an end to sanctions did not appear to be in sight by the mid1990s without oil export revenues iraq was unable to import sufficient quantities of food and medical supplies and according to virtually all accepted indicators infant and child mortality caloric intake and other indicators living conditions deteriorated sharply during 19911995 the first version of an oilforfood plan would have allowed iraq to export 16 billion in oil every six months it was adopted by the council in 1991 in resolutions 706 august 15 1991 and 712 an implementing plan adopted september 19 1991 but iraq rejected it as too limited in scope and an infringement on iraqs sovereignty there was little movement on the issue during 199195 despite dramatic declines in iraqs living standards during this period iraq continued to sell its oil under the terms of trade protocols with some of its neighbors in violation of the sanctions regime these sales were known to members of the sanctions committee including the united states on april 15 1995 the security council adopted resolution 986 which took into account one of iraqs concerns by allowing the export of 2 billion in oil every six months pressured by fears of unrest caused by the drop in living standards iraq accepted this proposal and it and the united nations signed memorandum of 1 for further discussion of security council resolutions and requirements on iraq see crs report rl32379 iraq former regime weapons programs human rights violations and us policy 2 that embargo was imposed by security council resolution 661 of august 6 1990 crs2 understanding on the program on may 20 1996 document number s1996356 3 after several more months of negotiations on details the first iraqi oil exports under the offp began on december 10 1996 after the first year of the program the secretary general determined that the program was not meeting the food and medical needs of the iraqi people and resolution 1153 february 20 1998 raised the oil export ceiling to 5256 billion per sixmonth phase in an effort to provide iraq an incentive to cooperate with new program of wmd inspections the security council in resolution 1284 december 17 1999 abolished the export limit entirely oilforfood program operations prior to the 2003 war from inception in december 1996 until the usled war that began march 19 2003 the offp was progressively modified to try to remove obstacles to the delivery of civilian goods to iraq however the program did not and was not intended to restore normal economic activity to iraq or completely blunt the effect of international sanctions on iraq during the rule of saddam hussein moreover the program did not and was not intended to monitor iraqs compliance with the wider trade embargo governed by resolution 661 the sanctions committee4 administered the implementation of sanctions on iraq and was responsible for ensuring that iraq complied with all relevant sanctions including the embargo on oil sales outside of the program during the rule of saddam hussein after the fall of the regime at the hands of us forces on april 9 2003 the united states achieved support for its proposal to phase the program out entirely and to allow iraq to resume normal commercial interactions for an outline of offp operations see appendix in order to ensure that only humanitarian objectives were served the offp placed substantial controls on approved iraqi oil exports and humanitarian imports under its jurisdiction under the terms of the memorandum of understanding drafted to implement resolution 986 iraqs stateowned oil marketing company state oil marketing organization somo was empowered to negotiate contracts with international oil companies to sell iraqi oil once finalized the oil purchase contracts were reviewed by panel of oil contract overseers reporting to the sanctions committee the oil overseers reviewed iraqs pricing proposals monthly under the program iraq was allowed to export only oil not any other products the oil sold under the offps auspices was exported through an iraqturkey pipeline and from iraqs terminals in the persian gulf according to resolution 986 the larger share of these oil exports ran through the turkish route the proceeds from these sales were deposited directly by the oil purchasers into unmonitored escrow account held at the new york branch of frances banque nationale paris 3 memorandum of understanding between the secretariat of the united nations and the government of iraq on the implementation of security council resolution 986 available at httpdaccessddsunorgdocundocgenn9612771pdfn9612771pdf 4 the sanctions committee set up by resolution 661 consists of representatives of the member states on the security council crs3 bnp now bnpparibas5 iraqs approved oil exports were monitored at the point of exportation by personnel from saybolt nederland bv an energy services firm working under contract to the program under its contract saybolt was not asked or expected to ensure that iraq was using only the approved export routes or to police any other illicit exportation of oil according to secretary general reports on the program6 in each sixmonth phase of the program iraq purchased goods and services directly from supplier firms in accordance with an agreed distribution plan allocating anticipated revenues among categories of goods to be purchased in that phase prior to the major amendment to the program approved in may 2002 which is discussed below the sanctions committee reviewed and had authority to approve contracts for the export of goods to iraq the committee operated by consensus any sanctions committee member could place hold on contract for goods to be imported by iraq and the united states often placed holds on exports of dual use items civilian items that could have military applications in deciding whether to place hold on contract the us representative on the sanctions committee consulted with agencies of the us government to determine whether iraq could use the requested items for military purposes under the procedures adopted in security council resolution 1409 may 14 2002 and placed into effect in july 2002 the weapons inspection unit unmovic monitoring verification and inspection commission reviewed export contracts to ensure that they did not contain items on designated list of dual use items known as the goods review list grl if so the sanctions committee then decided whether to approve that portion of the contract containing the grl items in question under us regulations written for the program us firms could buy iraqi oil and sell goods to iraq including oil industry spare parts and equipment over the last few years purchases of iraqi oil by us firms ranged between onethird to onehalf of iraqs pre2003 war export volume of about 21 million barrels per day in february 2003 just prior to the start of the war us imports of iraqi oil tended toward the high end of that range about 1 million barrels per day the us imports came primarily by purchases from intermediate energy trading firms rather than direct buys from iraq once contract was approved funds from the escrow account were used to pay letters of credit for the purchased goods the arriving supplies were monitored at 5 in response to concerns that too much money was being concentrated at bnp the number of banks receiving oilforfood deposits was expanded after 2000 to include jp morgan chase deutsche bank banco bilbao vizcaya credit agricole indosuez credit suisse and hypovereinsbank 6 that was the task of the usled multilateral interdiction force mif five ship naval unit that patrolled the persian gulf to prevent illicit iraqi exportation the mif was commanded through navcent the bahrainbased us navy component of us central command centcom based at mcdill afb in tampa florida crs4 their point of entry into iraq by about 50 personnel from the swiss firm cotecna7 at four approved border crossings umm qasr on the persian gulf trebil on the iraqi jordanian border walid on the iraqisyrian border and zakho on the iraqiturkish border in november 2002 fifth border point at arar on the saudiiraq border was established few years after saudi arabia decided to reopen its border with iraq cotecna and its predecessor lloyds register did not inspect monitor or report on goods entering or leaving iraq outside of the auspices of the offp and neither firm was empowered or expected to do so under the terms of resolution 986 or the memorandum of understanding agreed to by the united nations and the iraqi government cotecna was not responsible for searching or authenticating other goods imported by iraq through bilateral trade agreements with its neighbors or purchased with other iraqi government funds even if those goods entered iraq through the approved offp border entry points mentioned above nor was cotecna responsible for certifying what price was paid for the goods imported under the offp although cotecna says it offered that service to the office of the iraq program but was turned down8 in baghdadcontrolled iraq the iraqi government distributed imports to the population through an extensive government rationing system that employed about 40000 iraqis distribution was monitored by about 158 workers from the world food program the food and agriculture organization the world health organization and unicef the personnel visited ration centers marketplaces warehouses and other installations to ensure that distribution was equitable and accorded with the targeted allocation plans submitted by iraq for each six month phase in kurdishcontrolled iraq about 65 workers accompanied by about 130 security guards performed the distribution function some goods bound for the kurdishcontrolled areas were combined with baghdads purchases in order to obtain more favorable prices in bulk under security council resolution 1051 march 27 1996 exports to iraq of dualuse items were supposed to be monitored by weapons inspectors at their point of entry and site of end use in iraq this import monitoring mechanism was altered during 19982002 when the weapons inspection regime was not in operation inside iraq security council resolution 1284 december 17 1999 replaced unscom with unmovic which was to perform that enduse monitoring function after reentering iraq in november 2002 although unmovic withdrew from iraq on the eve of operation iraqi freedom before beginning those monitoring activities during the 19982002 hiatus in weapons inspections enduse monitoring in iraq was performed by some of the 158 employees who monitored the distribution of civilian goods coming into iraq however these monitors were not trained weapons inspectors and this caused the united states and britain to closely scrutinize and to place many holds on exports of dualuse items to iraq 7 cotecna replaced lloyds register as pointofentry monitoring contractor on february 1 1999 8 pruniaux testimony opcit crs5 the offp attempted to help iraq meet its international obligations and ensure equitable distribution of imports to the iraqi people the revenues from iraqs oil sales were distributed as follows 25 was transferred to compensation commission uncc to pay reparations to victims of iraqs invasion of kuwait resolution 1284 december 17 1999 reduced the deduction percentage to the 25 level as of december 2000 from the previous level of 30 59 was used to purchase humanitarian items for baghdad controlled iraq this account was increased from its previous level of 53 when the reparations deduction was reduced in december 2000 13 was used to purchase supplies in the three kurdishinhabited provinces of northern iraq 3 paid for costs to administer the offp 22 as well as unmovics operating costs 08 1 was allocated to reimburse member states that had previously provided funds to an escrow account set up by security council resolution 778 october 2 1992 during the period before the offp began operating that escrow account had received donations and the proceeds of unfrozen iraqi assets which were used to fund operations in iraq some humanitarian relief activities and compensation to the victims of iraqs invasion of kuwait changes outlined in resolution 1284 security council resolution 1284 was intended in part to improve the provision of relief for the iraqi people and to offer iraq an incentive to readmit weapons inspectors the following highlights key provisions of it and related decisions as noted previously resolution 1284 eliminated the limit on the amount of oil iraq could export the resolution began the process continued in subsequent offp rollover resolutions of easing restrictions on the flow of civilian goods to iraq it directed the sanctions committee to draw up lists of items in several categories that would longer be subject to sanctions committee review and therefore would not be vulnerable to holds the accelerated approval procedures for foodstuffs and educational goods began in march 2000 and continued with pharmaceuticals medical supplies medical equipment and agricultural equipment march 2000 water treatment and sanitation supplies august 2000 goods for the housing sector february 2001 and electricity supplies may 2001 crs6 the resolution laid the groundwork for foreign investment to explore for and produce oil in iraq although the resolution made this investment contingent on full iraqi cooperation with unmovic in 2000 and 2001 the sanctions committee approved drilling in existing fields by two russian firms tatneft and slavneft and turkish firm turkish petroleum company but exploration of new fields was still not permitted resolution 1284 created incentives for iraq to cooperate with unmovic by expressing the intention if iraq is deemed to have cooperated in all respects with unmovic to suspend export and import sanctions for 120 days renewable by the security council the resolution implied that the security council would have to vote to implement the sanctions suspension resolution 1284 made some oil industry spare parts eligible for streamlined approval process contracts for such equipment were scrutinized by the same sanctions committee panel of oil overseers that reviewed iraqs oil sales contracts without requiring full sanctions committee review security council resolution 1293 march 31 2000 increased the value of oil industry spare parts that iraq could import per oilforfood phase to 600 million from 300 million this decision was taken in response to recommendations by the secretary general that improving the humanitarian situation was contingent on the rehabilitation of iraqs ability to export its oil accomplishments of the program there is consensus among officials and outside observers that the offp eased substantially but did not eliminate severe economic hardship in iraq the program as well as some economic liberalization measures and illicit activity outside the program discussed below enabled iraq to achieve 15 economic growth during 2000 according to the cias world factbook 2001 in total the program generated about 642 billion in revenues with oil sales of approximately 34 billion barrels of oil to 248 companies9 of that amount according to the office of the iraq programme the administering office for the program headed by benon sevan about 39 billion worth of humanitarian supplies and equipment were delivered to iraq both baghdad controlled and kurdish controlled under the program up to the november 21 2003 the termination date of that amount 61 billion was for the kurdish areas that amounted to 88 of total funds available somewhat less than the 13 intended to be used for the kurdish areas iraqs oil exports were shut down during the usled war that began march 19 2003 and did not resume again until well into the period of us occupation 9 independent inquiry committee into the united nations oilforfood programme briefing paper october 21 2004 including interest and currency gains the total funds available to the program were 695

resolutions allow iraq to generate revenue over and above the ceilings to pay the costs of transit fees for exporting oil through turkey which explains why some figures might exceed stated ceilings crs8 the following represent the major accomplishments of the program in improving the living standards of the iraqi people taken mostly from report by the secretary general to the security council dated november 12 2002 few months before the war to overthrow saddam hussein food according to the report in baghdadcontrolled iraq iraqis were receiving about 2200 kilocalories of food per person per day about 90 of the target caloric intake of 2463 kilocalories per person per day the full ration was achieved only during december 2000 the report noted that 60 of iraqs families relied solely on the food ration under the program to meet all household needs according to november 19 2003 fact sheet the eve of the programs handover to us occupation authorities malnutrition rates in 2002 in centresouth were half those of preprogram iraq among children under the age of five health sanitation and electricity the report said that there were notable achievements in the health sector including an increase in major surgeries performed and reduction in communicable diseases this and previous reports on the program noted improvement in the diagnostic and other equipment in use in iraqs hospitals in the related area of water and sanitation the fact sheet of november 19 2003 said that the deterioration of water facilities was halted by the offp the november 2002 report said the status of electricity provision had been improving gradually noting more reliable supply of electricity to iraqis than was the case previously in mid1999 unicef released its first countrywide survey of infant and maternal mortality in iraq since 1991 the unicef survey team took number of precautions to ensure that the survey results would not be altered or modified and unicef is confident that the survey information is accurate it showed that infant mortality in the southern and central sections of iraq under the control of the iraqi government rose from 471 deaths per thousand live births during 19841989 to 1079 deaths per thousand during 19941999 the under fiveyearold mortality rate rose from 56 to 1306 per thousand live births in the same time period according to the report this increase in mortality resulted in about 500000 more deaths among children under five than would have been the case if child mortality trends noted prior to 1990 imposition of sanctions had continued in northern iraq the mortality rate has declined over the same period infant mortality dropped from 639 per thousand live births in 19841989 to 587 in 19941999 and under fiveyearold mortality dropped from 802 per thousand live births to 718 per thousand education the report identified significant shortages of materials and equipment throughout the education sector particularly school overcrowding the report says that the distribution of 12 million school desks had met 60 of the need at primary and secondary schools whereas prior to the inception of the program students sat on bare floors according to an earlier report september 8 2000 iraqs literacy rate 537 of adults and 707 of the youth has remained fixed for number of years crs9 prewar debates over sanctions the accomplishments of the program did not end debate over how strictly to enforce some of the programs restrictions the united states and britain tended to place most of the blame for the programs shortcomings on iraq alleging that the iraqi regime disregarded the needs of its people administrators of the program criticized iraq on similar grounds but they also attributed program deficiencies to us and british policy which they said slowed or halted the flow of infrastructure equipment that was required to realize the programs benefits the issue of contract holds on infrastructure equipment was one of the most contentious that the offp faced past reports on the program claimed that infrastructure equipment such as trucks communications gear forklifts electricity and water treatment equipment were crucial to the timely distribution and proper storage and functioning of foodstuffs and medical products at the time of the adoption in may 2002 of aspects of the smart sanctions plan discussed below the united states had placed almost 5 billion of goods on hold in response to criticism of the holds the united states asserted that 90 of all contracts were approved and that the holds had minimal impact the united states maintained that all contracts needed to be scrutinized to ensure that equipment would be used to rebuild wmd programs especially during the time weapons inspectors were not in iraq december 1998 november 2002 to monitor dualuse exports that were shipped there reports did not accuse iraq of purposely diverting imports from the program to the military or regime supporters although some us reports such as february 28 1998 state department fact sheet made such allegations the smart sanctions plan at the start of the george w bush administration with permanent end to international sanctions in sight due to the lack of weapons inspections the debate over further modifications to the offp was the centerpiece of broader debate over iraq policy and sanctions the debate intensified in may 2001 when the five permanent members of the security council began discussing the us plan to adopt smart sanctions on iraq the smart sanctions plan represented an effort articulated primarily by secretary of state colin powell in early 2001 to rebuild consensus to contain iraq when the bush administration came into office administration officials asserted that international sanctions enforcement was collapsing and that iraq was using the relaxation to acquire prohibited goods and raise illicit revenue the us smart sanctions proposal centered on tradeoff in which restrictions on the flow of civilian goods to iraq would be greatly eased and in return iraqs illicit trade with its neighbors would be brought under the offp and its monitoring and control mechanisms the net effect according to the concept would be to target sanctions only on limiting iraqs strategic capabilities and not on its civilian economy the smart sanctions plan was intended to defuse criticism by several governments including permanent members of the security council france russia and china that the united states was using international sanctions to promote the overthrow of the iraqi government or to punish iraq indefinitely for the invasion of kuwait however differences between the permanent members over how to implement these measures prevented immediate agreement on the us plan the september 11 2001 attacks and the war in afghanistan brought the united crs10 states politically closer to russia and to lesser extent china and the security council reached agreement to adopt some elements of the us plan as provided for in security council resolution 1409 may 14 2002 the resolution created the goods review list grl mentioned above list of dual use items that were subject to review by unmovic before they could be exported to iraq10 resolution 1447 december 4 2002 contained pledge to add within 30 days certain items to the grl items that the united states said could be used by iraq to counter us military offensive the security council added 36 ussuggested items to the grl on december 30 2002 resolution 1454 enhanced border control provisions central element of the original us smart sanctions plan were not included in resolution 1409 largely because of strong opposition by iraqs neighbors to controls on illicit trade with iraq iraqs neighbors maintained that enhanced border controls would harm their economies the resolution did not contain us proposals that would have restricted civilian flights to iraq it did not permit new foreign investment in iraqs energy sector provision that had been sought by russia france and china whose energy companies had signed deals to explore for oil and gas in iraq once sanctions were lifted other sources of prewar humanitarian aid unicef the world food program wfp the development program undp the european community echo the international committee of the red cross icrc governments and private relief organizations such as catholic relief services and save the children provided additional relief to supplement the offp unicef echo and wfp focus their humanitarian aid on southern and central iraq rather than on the economically better off kurdish north there is single source for information on prewar humanitarian assistance to iraq report of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd which provides donor information for the years 1994 through 1998 indicated that iraq received total of 7636 million in bilateral assistance in 199811 this did not include any funds provided by agencies but does include grants by the european commission humanitarian aid department echo washington based official of the european commission said in june 2001 that the european union gave over 200 million in aid to iraq during 19912003 prewar exportation to iraq although the offp did not open iraq to free and unfettered international trade firms of many countries participated in the program by buying iraqi oil and selling civilian goods table 2 provides list of countries whose firms exported more than 10 the goods review list is contained in document s2002515 of may 3 2002 it

million worth of goods to iraq in 1998 the latest full year for which international statistics were available it is probable that almost all of the exports in these statistics represented offp related transactions although it is possible that some transactions were conducted separately from the program under preexisting regulations that allowed iraq to import certain civilian items using its own funds the statistics did not cover illicit trade that by nature generally went unreported to statisticskeeping organizations table 2 major exporters of goods to iraq 1998 in millions of dollars

42 united states 106 termination of the program the program was suspended just before operation iraqi freedom began on march 19 2003 staff in iraq departed on march 28 2003 as us forces moved north toward baghdad the security council adopted resolution 1472 restarting the programs operations empowering the united nations to take direct control of all aspects of the program and directing the united nations to set priorities on the delivery of already contracted supplies the enhanced authority was later extended to june 3 2003 on may 22 2003 resolution 1483 was adopted lifting sanctions on iraq and providing for the phasing out of the offp within six months in accordance with the resolution the program new contract agreements terminated on november 21 2003 and was taken over by the us occupation authority the coalition provisional authority cpa since then iraq has sold its oil unfettered oil revenues are longer held in unrun escrow account and the programs oil sales monitoring infrastructure is longer in operation crs12 the cpa with the help of agencies and the world food program administered the same food distribution network utilized by the offp the cpa also continued to receive and distribute goods from the 3000 contracts signed under the program but not delivered by the time of the november 21 2003 termination12 since the handover of sovereignty to an iraqi interim government on june 28 2004 iraqs ministry of trade has managed the receipt and distribution of residual contracts security council resolution 1546 june 8 2004 which endorsed the handover of sovereignty gave formal responsibility for final offp closeout to the iraqi interim government the iraqi government is also continuing to distribute civilian necessities procured under the offp and outside the program to needy iraqis for new purchases of civilian goods the government is using funds generated by oil sales the office of the iraq program which ran the offp has now closed as of the start of the war in march 2003 the programs escrow account had over 10 billion remaining the funds remained because iraqs oil revenues grew faster than import contracts were signed of that approximately 9 billion was transferred to iraqs development fund for iraq dfi and 216 million remained in accounts as of february 200513 resolution 1483 referenced above abolished the iraq sanctions committee as of november 21 2003 however subsequent security council resolution 1518 set up new security council committee the 1518 committee consisting of all members of the council to continue to locate financial assets held by members of the former regime allegations and investigations according to investigations conducted by us and iraqi officials the regime of saddam hussein used two distinct illicit methods to generate funds following the imposition of sanctions on iraq by the united nations security council first iraq illicitly sold oil to some neighboring countries from 1990 to

of the former regime on january 25 2004 an independent iraqi newspaper mada published list of 270 individuals and entities who allegedly benefitted from oil vouchers granted by the former regime the list was purportedly obtained from records kept by the staterun oil marketing organization somo15 according to the iraqi newspaper those listed were given vouchers that could be exchanged for quantities of oil that could be sold legitimately through the offp for fuller detail see the section on oil vouchers below some of the listed voucher recipients were alleged have sold the oil vouchers to third parties in exchange for profit others were considered to have supported the former iraqi regime politically of the 270 entities named the most notable figure was benon sevan the executive director of the offp several other alleged recipients were political parties mostly in the former east bloc states and some were sitting highranking officials or their relatives in various countries fortysix russiabased entities were named far more than from any other country and the list included most of russias major energy firms in statements and letters to various news organizations several of those named in the iraqi article including sevan have categorically denied the allegations some have confirmed the allegations but claimed that the payments were legitimate commissions for oil deals brokered or donations for humanitarian work others said they were improperly named in the iraqi newspaper because the paper sought to expose politicians that had been somewhat supportive of saddam husseins regime16 some observers say that some of the allegations appear intended to highlight flaws and perhaps question the united nations advisory role in post saddam governance nevertheless the voucherrelated claims brought renewed scrutiny to the management of the offp and the efforts of saddam husseins government to manipulate and undermine the program and the wider sanctions regime

program illicit trade trade protocols illicit oil sales and oil smuggling according to the iic report saddam husseins regime earned 11 billion from illicit oil sales that began before the offp started and remained outside of the scope or authority of the offp and in violation of sanctions on iraq the regimes illicit oil sales were conducted on the basis oftrade protocols between iraq and individual governments or on the basis of private sector export agreements between iraqi authorities and private individuals and entities the importation of civilian goods under iraqs trade protocols with its neighbors was not necessarily prohibited by sanctions and under us sanctions iraq was allowed to import additional goods separate from the offp using its own nonun escrow account revenues all iraqi oil sales outside of the auspices of the offp were prohibited by sanctions governments individuals and commercial entities engaged in buying and selling iraqi oil outside the auspices of the offp did so in violation of the sanctions regime the united states and other members of the sanctions committee took note of iraqs illicit oil sales to some of its neighbors but for number of reasons chose not to take direct action to halt the sales or punish states or entities engaged in them prior to the onset of operation iraqi freedom in march 2003 the iics final report on the management of the offp links this inaction to what it describes as the primacy of political preference over even handed enforcement of sanctions against iraq and its neighboring countries the iic report describes many examples of this phenomenon and singles out two cases as particularly noteworthy the united states tolerance for trade with jordan and turkey but not syria and russias and frances reluctance to redress smuggling activity between iraq and syria jordan after the 1991 persian gulf war jordan notified the security council that it was importing iraqi oil at belowmarket prices under the terms of official trade protocols negotiated annually between jordanian and iraqi officials according to jordanian officials iraqi oil was imported in exchange for civilian goods and writedowns of iraqs debt to jordan according to the iic jordan made repeated but unsuccessful requests to gain approval for the trade through legitimate channels the united states supported the sanctions committee decision to take note of the jordanian purchases neither approving them nor deeming them violation the united states and other sanctions committee members considered jordans economy to be dependent on discounted iraqi oil and sought to preserve jordans support for the offp the nonoil related sanctions regime and the middle east peace process the clinton and bush administrations annually waived unilateral us sanctions on jordan that could have been imposed because of jordans illicit trade with iraq23 23 every fiscal year since 1994 congress has included provision in foreign aid appropriations cutting us aid to countries that violated the iraq embargo crs18 according to the duelfer report iraqs trade protocol with jordan ensured the saddam hussein regimes financial survival until the creation of the offp in late 1996 the iics final report estimates that iraq earned total of 6 billion from the jordanian trade protocol 26 billion from 1990 to 1996 when the offp was created and 34 billion during the programs duration until 2003 in october 2000 jordan cancelled an agreement with lloyds registry in force since 1993 for the firm to inspect iraqbound cargo in jordans port of aqaba this inspection agreement covered goods other than those imported under the offp goods imported under the program continued to be monitored by cotecna at all points of entry including the iraqjordanian border syria in late 2000 according to several press reports iraq began exporting oil through an iraqsyria pipeline closed since 1982 but subsequently repaired according to two gao studies iraq exported 180000 250000 barrels per day through this route in march 2002 and exports through syria were at similar levels as of the start of the 2003 war24 the oil exports were based on trade protocol under which syria paid iraq about half the world market price for oil refined the imported iraqi oil for domestic use and exported previouslyreserved syrian oil at world market prices according to the duelfer report the iraqsyrian trade protocol served as iraqs primary illicit income source from early 2000 to march 2003 the iic final report estimates the value of iraqs oil sales to syria at 31 billion the united nations did not formally approve this export route and the united states argued that the trade was illegitimate and contrary to pledges made to the bush administration in early 2001 many experts believe the united states did not forcefully press syria to cease its oil importation from iraq in order to enlist syrias support in the global war on terrorism and the us effort to build international support for confronting iraq according to the iic syrias membership on the security council in 2002 and its corresponding membership on the iraq sanctions committee allowed syria toblock any inquiry by the committee into the illegal imports because of the committees consensus voting rule france and russia also opposed tough committee action against syria turkey according to 2002 gao study iraq exported the equivalent of 40000 80000 barrels per day of oil through turkey in march 2002 in another trade protocol negotiated at regular intervals25 the exportation was in the form of possibly as many as 1000 turkish trucks per day carrying iraqi oil products not crude oil through the iraqi kurdish areas into turkey in spare fuel tanks the turkish government taxed and regulated the illicit imports as in the case of jordan the clinton and bush administrations annually waived unilateral us sanctions on turkey that could be imposed because of this illicit trade26 turkey and others

in anticipation of the usled war against iraq iran and the persian gulf 2002 gao study estimates that iraq was exporting illicitly about 30000 40000 barrels per day through the persian gulf in march 200227 this exportation was apparently conducted with cooperation from iran of the funds generated through this export channel about onehalf went to iraq onequarter to smugglers and middlemen and onequarter to irans revolutionary guard for protection fees to allow the shipments to hug its coast and avoid capture many believe that exports through the gulf were higher during 19982000 but they fell because iraq was diverting oil to the syrian route where there were fewer middlemen to pay the iic final report credits us naval presence in the persian gulf and irans cooperation with ultimately limiting smuggling via the gulf route oilforfood program allegations of mismanagement and abuse current allegations regarding the mismanagement and abuse of the offp fit into two broad categories 1 allegations of mismanagement of the contracts and administration of the offp by contractors and staff and 2 abuse of the program through vouchers surcharges and kickbacks by the regime of saddam hussein linking the two categories are allegations that contractors and staff including oip executive director benon sevan personally solicited and received on behalf of themselves or associates oil vouchers or bribes from iraqi authorities while administering their official program duties with regard to the allegations of and contractor mismanagement investigations of the offps operations have revealed flaws and shortcomings in the awarding management and auditing of program contracts w i t h regard t t h allegations of abuse of the program by the regime of saddam hussein investigations have revealed evidence that iraq raised illicit funds through surcharges on offp oil shipments and kickbacks on approved commercial and humanitarian good contracts the iics final report estimates that iraq earned 18 billion in illicit funds using these methods investigations also have uncovered evidence that the former iraqi government created secret oil voucher system to allocate oil that was approved for sale under the offp to politically sympathetic individuals and entities according to former regime officials iraq used the oil voucher system to encourage foreign individuals and entities

annan influenced or attempted to influence the selection of cotecna for the offp inspection contract however the iic report found that secretary general annan did not conduct an adequate inquiry following reports of his sons continued employment by cotecna and public allegations of prior wrongdoing by senior cotecna executives the report states that such an independent inquiry may have

contracts from june 2000 until march 200333 iraqi officials reportedly demanded 2530 cent surcharge from buyers on each offpapproved barrel of oil beginning in the eighth phase of the offp june 2000 somo records indicate that these surcharges were placed on 1117 billion barrels of oil from june 2000 to march 2003 creating surcharge contracts valued at 2653 million however iraqi authorities were only able to collect 2288 million in surcharges and iraqs somo reportedly terminated oil contracts with some buyers because of the buyers unwillingness or inability to pay the demanded surcharges total of 248 companies purchased oil from iraq under the offp according to the iic final report 139 of them paid surcharges to iraq on their oil contracts iraqi authorities instituted similar kickback scheme on humanitarian and commercial goods contracts approved by the offp iraq generally demanded 10 percent kickback from suppliers on the value of offp goods contracts earning an estimated 1583 billion from late 2000 until march 2003 the kickback scheme was rooted in complex arrangements whereby iraqi authorities would sign contracts with cooperative suppliers for first quality goods and accept delivery of poorer quality goods without notifying offp officials of the discrepancy the resulting profits to the cooperating suppliers were returned to iraqi authorities after the suppliers

during 2001 and 2002 and the security council was aware of the allegations and moved to address them some members of the sanctions committee sought to complicate iraqs ability to impose surcharges on its oil buyers the surcharges constituted illicit revenue and were prohibited for example the sanctions committee had evaluated but not adopted another idea to limit iraqs oil buyers to major international oil firms rather than smaller oil traders that were willing to pay iraq the surcharge march 2001 press report listed companies that were purchasing iraqi oil many were small companies from countries that sought to do business with iraq or were sympathetic to easing sanctions on iraq34 us major oil companies were said to have bought iraqi oil shipments from these small traders however according to us officials some member states reputed to be the same countries seeking to ease sanctions on iraq did not immediately agree to these proposed mechanisms35 in september 2001 the security council reached agreement to move to pricing formula called retroactive pricing in which the oil was priced after sale this significantly reduced iraqs oil sales by about 25 although the united nations noted rebound to previous levels about 2 million barrels per day as of september 2002 iraq sometimes unilaterally interrupted the sale of oil to protest security council policy or to challenge the united states and its allies for example iraq suspended its offp oil sales for the month of april 2002 in protest against israels military incursion into the west bank oil allocations or vouchers under the terms of the memorandum of understanding between the united nations and iraq that implemented security council resolution 986 the iraqi government was granted the power to choose

hussein personally involved himself in the selection of oil buyers and good providers participating in the offp37 the duelfer and iic reports address allegations similar to those contained in the mada publication mentioned above according to the iic report iraq allocated oil vouchers based on total of 453 billion barrels of oil but only 343 billion barrels of oil were actually lifted38 the duelfer report groups allocation recipients into three categories 1 traditional oil companies that owned refineries 2 personalities and parties including benon sevanand numerous individuals including russian yugoslav ukrainian and french citizens and 3 the russian state with specific recipients identified there is considerable overlap between those named in the mada article and those named in the duelfer and iic reports most notably offp executive director benon sevan some experts believe that some allocation recipients were able to arrange for the lifting of their oil allocations and oil surcharges apparently served as their profit on the transaction the iic and duelfer reports state that some oil contracts were never actually lifted and that those who were assigned allocations based on those oil contracts might never have received any funds bayoil and other voucher allegations reports issued by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations in may 2005 allege that several prominent international political figures received and traded in oil vouchers from the saddam hussein regime39 the reports claim that russian official vladimir zhirinovsky was granted lucrative allocations of

bilateral relationships to other us foreign policy priorities the memoranda did not contain estimates of the value of the illicit oil sales to iraq or estimates of the possible uses of illicit revenue from the sales by saddam husseins regime given contemporaneous us concerns about iraqs efforts to reconstitute its wmd programs and its alleged support for international terrorism inclusion of
