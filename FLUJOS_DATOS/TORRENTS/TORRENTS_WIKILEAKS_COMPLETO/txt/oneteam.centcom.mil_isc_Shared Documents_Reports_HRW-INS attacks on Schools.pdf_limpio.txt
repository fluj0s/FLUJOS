speak some 100000 afghan children who went to school last year and the year before last do not go to school president karzai on international womens day march 8 2006 during ramadan late 2005 the girls were still going to school there was letter posted on the communitys mosque saying that men who are working with ngos and girls going to school need to be careful about their safety if we put acid on their faces or they are murdered then the blame will be on the parents after that we were scared and talked about it but we decided to let them keep going anyway but after eid second letter was posted on the street near to there and the community decided that it was not worth the risk and stopped all girls over age ten from going to school my daughters are afraidthey are telling us well get killed and be lying on the streets and you wont even know mother of two girls withdrawn from fourth and fifth grades kandahar city december 8 2005 brutal attacks by armed opposition groups on afghan teachers students and their schools have occurred throughout much of afghanistan in recent months particularly in the south these attacks and the inability of the government and its international backers to stop them demonstrate the deteriorating security conditions under which many afghans are now living while ultimate responsibility lies with the perpetrators much about the response of the international community and the afghan government can and must be improved if afghanistan is to move forward the situation is not hopeless yet this crisis of insecurity now affecting millions of afghans was predictable and avoidable the international community led by the united sta tes has consistently failed to provide the economic political and military support necessary for securing the most basic rights of the afghan people as detailed below groups opposed to the authority of the afghan central government and its international supporters have increasingly filled this vacuum using tactics such as suicide bombings and attacks on soft targets such as schools and teachers to instill terror in ordinary afghans and thus turn them away from central government that is unable to protect them such attacks are not just criminal offenses in violation of afghan law they are abuses that infringe upon the fundamental right to education when committed as part of the ongoing armed conflict in afghanistan these attacks are serious violations of international humanitarian lawthey are war crimes human rights watch vol 18 6c 4attacks on teachers students and schools 1105 62106

opposition groups and international security forces and rampant lawlessnessaffects all aspects of afghans lives their ability to work to reach medical care to go to the market and to attend school afghan women and girls who have always confronted formidable social and historical barriers to traveling freely or receiving an education especially under the taliban and their mujahedin predecessors are particularly hard hit this report examines the impact of insecurity on education in afghanistan especially on girls education it concentrates on armed attacks on the education system in the south and southeast of the country where resurgent opposition forces local warlords and increasingly powerful criminal groups have committed abuses aimed at terrorizing the civilian population and contesting the authority of the central government and its foreign supporters this confrontation has stunted and in some places even stopped the development and reconstruction work so desperately desired and needed by local residents attacks on all aspects of the education process sharply increased in late 2005 and the first half of 2006 as of this writing more attacks have been reported in the first half of 2006 than in all of 2005 previously secure schools such as girls schools in kandahar city and in northern provinces such as balkh have come under attack there have been reports of at least seventeen assassinations of teachers and education officials in 2005 and 2006 several are detailed below this report also documents more than 204 attacks on teachers students and schools in the past eighteen months january 2005 to june 21 2006 even more common have been threatening night letters alone or preceding actual attacks distributed in mosques around schools and on ro utes taken by students and teachers warning them against attending school and making credible threats of violence physical attacks or threats against schools and their staff hurt education directly and indirectly directly an attack may force school to close either because the building is destroyed or because the teachers and students are too afraid to attend attacks and threats may also have an indirect ripple effect causing school s in the surrounding area to shut down as well human rights watch vol 18 6c 5attacks on teachers students and schools by province january 1 2005 june 21 2006

and students undertake every day single episodes of violence even in far away districts accumulate to establish pattern in country as traumatized by violence as afghanistan teachers parents and students are keenly attuned to fluctuations in this pattern and decide to continueor stopgoing to school based on how they view the general climate of insecurity parents often have lower threshold for pulling their daughters out of school than boys given greater social restrictions on girls movements and legitimate concerns about sexual harassment and violence as result of the cumulative impact of attacks and closures over the past three years schools which were only recently opened or reopened have once again been shut down in many districts in the south and southeast in many districts in these areas schools operate at all general insecurity and violence targeted against education also exacerbate other barriers that keep children particularly girls from going to school these include having to travel long way to the nearest school or having school available at all poor school infrastructure shortage of qualified teachers especially women teachers the low quality of teaching and poverty all of these factors affect and are affected by afghanistans varied but conservative culture each has greater impact on girls and women in large part because there are far fewer girls schools than boys schools measuring the deleterious impact of insecurity on education provides strong diagnostic indicator of the costs of insecurity more generally basic education is important for childrens intellectual and social development and provides them with critical skills for leading productive lives as citizens and workers education is central to the realization of other human rights such as freedom of expression association and ssembly full participation in ones community and freedom from discrimination sexual ex ploitation and the worst forms of child labor human rights watch vol 18 6c 6education also facilitates many other socially important activities such as improvements in the economy development of the rule of law and public health restrictions on girls right to education especially hurt the countrys development for example girls and womens literacy is associated with lower infant and maternal mortality and unsurprisingly better education for future generations of children girls not educated today are the missing teachers administrators and policymakers of tomorrow after the taliban afghanistan cannot afford to lose another generation such tragedy would compound the misfortune the already beleaguered nation has faced in focusing on the nexus between insecurity and access to education we seek to establish new benchmarks for assessing the performance of afghan and international security forces and measuring progress on the security front the benchmarks most often used at presentnumbers of afghan troops trained and international troops deployed or the number of armed opponents killedare important but they do not accurately assess the security situation what is more important is how much these and related efforts improve the daytoday security of the afghan people we urge that access to education be made one key benchmark we suggest this benchmark for three reasons on political level because teachers and schools are typically the most basic level of government and the most common point of interaction in many villages the only point of contact between ordinary afghans and their government on practical level because this benchmark lends itself to diagnostic nationally comparable data analysis for instance the number of operational schools the number of students the enrollment of girls focused on outcomes instead of the number of troops or vague references to providing security and on policy level because providing education to new generation of afghans is essential to the countrys longterm development plight of the education system the talibans prohibition on educating girls and women was rightly viewed as one of their most egregious human rights violations even for government notorious for operating without respect for basic human rights and dignities but even before the taliban the mujahedin factions that ripped the country apart between 1992 and 1996 often opposed modern education in particular the education of girls since the united states and its coalition partners ousted the taliban from power in 2001 afghans throughout the country have told human rights watch that they want their childrenincluding girlsto be educated afghans have asked their government and its human rights watch vol 18 6c 7international supporters to help create the infrastructure and environment necessary for educating their children great deal of progress has been made when the taliban were forced from power may students returned to school according to the world bank an estimated 774000 children attended school in 2001 1 by 2005 with girls education longer prohibited and with much international assistance 52 million children were officially enrolled in grades one through twelve according to the ministry of education 2 all statistics on education in afghanistan should be understood as rough approximations at best despite these improvements the situation is far from what it could or should have been particularly for girls the majority of primaryschoolage girls remain out of school and many children in rural areas have access to schools at all at the secondary level the numbers are far worse gross enrollment rates were only 5 percent for girls in 2004 compared with 20 percent for boys 3 moreover the gains of the past fourandahalf years appear to have reached plateau the ministry of education told human rights watch that it did not expect total school enrollments to increase in 2006 indeed they expect new enrollments to decrease by 2008 as refugee returns level off 4 in areas where students do attend school the quality of education is extremely low two critical factors are first that attacks on teachers students and schools by armed groups have forced schools to close and second that attacks against representatives of the afghan government and nongovernmental organizations ngos along with general lawlessness has made it too dangerous for them to open new schools or continue to operate in certain areas where schools do remain open parents are often afraid to send their childrenin particular girlsto school the continuing denial of education to most afghan children is human rights crisis that should be of serious concern to those who strive to end afghanistans savage cycle of violence and war 1 world bank genderstats database of gender statis tics httpdevdataworldbankorg retrieved april 17

insecurity in afghanistan is most dire in the countrys south and southeast although it is by means limited to those areas the problem is particularly acute outside of larger urban areas and off major roads where an estimated 70 percent of afghans reside and where us forces the international security assistance force led by the north atlantic treaty organization nato and afghanistans small but growing security forces rarely reach three different and at times overlapping groups are broadly responsible for causing insecurity in afghanistan 1 opposition armed forces primarily the taliban and forces allied with the taliban movement or with veteran pashtun warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar 2 regional warlords and militia commanders ostensibly loyal to the central government now entrenched as powerbrokers after the flawed parliamentary elections of october 2005 and 3 criminal groups mostly involved in afghanistans booming narcotics tradea trade which is believed to provide much of the financing for the warlords and opposition forces each of the above groups attempts to impose their rule on the local population disrupt or subvert the activity of the central government and either divert development aid into their own coffers or block development altogether in many cases that human rights watch investigated we were not able to determine with certainty either who was behind particular attack or the cause but it is clear that many attacks on teachers students and schools have been carried out by taliban forces now apparently confederation of mostly pashtun tribal militias and political groups or groups allied with the taliban such as the forces of gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbe islami previously bitter rivals of the taliban but the taliban are clearly not the only perpetrators of such attacks because in many areas local observers and human rights watchs investigation indicated the involvement of militias of local warlords for instance in wardak province where forces loyal to the warlord abdul rabb rasul sayyaf hold sway or criminal groups such as those controlling smuggling routes in kandahar and helmand provinces the motives behind the attacks differ in some instances it appears that the attacks are motivated by ideological opposition to education generally or to girls education specifically in other instances schools and teachers may be attacked as symbols of the government often the only government presence in an area or if run by international nongovernmental organizations as the work of foreigners in few cases the attacks seem to reflect local grievances and rivalries regardless of the motivation of the attackers the result is the same afghanistans educational system one of the weakest in the world is facing serious and worsening threat insecurity and the attendant difficulty it causes for government agencies foreign reconstruction groups and aid organizations has also distorted nationallevel reconstruction policies in human rights watch vol 18 6c 9afghanistan southern and southeastern afghanistan which have suffered most from insecurity have witnessed significant drop in reconstruction activity many ngos which play significant role in providing education and other development activities in afghanistan longer feel it is safe to operate outside of urban areas and off major roads linking them as of this writingmidway through 2006already twentyfour aid workers have been killed in afghanistan this year significant increase from the rates seen in previous years when thirtyone aid workers were killed in 2005 and twentyfour in 2004 several large international ngos told human rights watch in december 2005 that they had curtailed their activities in the south and southeast or aborted plans to operate there as result of insecurity afghan ngos also face significant constraints together security logistical and infrastructural limitations are keeping organizations out of the areas where their assistance is most needed senior western education expert working in afghanistan expressed his apprehension about this phenomenon we are very concerned about disparities that were creating were not covering the whole country there are some places in the country that have never seen operation 5 the failure to provide adequate aid to southern and southeastern afghanistan also has significant political impact because it has fostered resentment against the perceived failures and biases of the central afghan government and its international supporters afghans in the largely pashtun south and southeast complain when they see more development aid and projects go to nonpashtun areas in other parts of the country lacking the ability to confront the security threats facing them they feel that they are being doubly punishedby the taliban and criminal groups who impinge on their security and by international aid providers being driven away due to justified fear of the taliban other opposition elements and criminal groups international and afghan response to insecurity the international community has shortchanged afghanistan security and development since the fall of the taliban both qualitatively and quantitatively international military and economic aid to afghanistan was and remains fraction of that disbursed by the international community in other recent postconflict situations for the past four years afghanistans government and its international supporters chiefly the united states have understood security mostly as matter of the relative dominance of various armed forces presented this way addressing insecurity revolves around matters such as troop numbers geographic coverage and political allegiance development and reconstruction become viewed as part of hearts and minds campaign necessary to placate potentially hostile populationnot as 5 human rights watch interview with highlevel staffer who requested anonymity because he did not want to publicize internal debates kabul december 5 2005 human rights watch vol 18 6c 10preconditions for healthy peaceful and stable society and certainly not as steps toward the realization of the fundamental human rights of the afghan people the international communitys chief tool for providing security and local development in afghanistan has been the provincial reconstruction teams prts military units ranging in size from eighty to three hundred military personnel combined with small number usually about 10 percent of the total of civilians from development background or the diplomatic corps the prt program initially developed by the united states to compensate for the inadequate troop numbers committed to secure afghanistan after the taliban eventually became the template for international security assistance after three years the prt program has now expanded to most of afghanistans provinces as of this writing there are twentythree prts operating in afghanistan note however that the presence of small prts in province does not necessarily mean there is geographic coverage of the province outside prt headquarters the united states still operates the most prts all of them now in southern and southeastern afghanistan where military threats are more pronounced other countries mostly under the umbrella of nato includ ing the united kingdom canada the netherlands and germany as well as nonnato us allies such as new zealand also field prts the uk canada and the netherlands have begun moving prts into some provinces in southern afghanistan since mid2005 nato is scheduled to take over security in southern afghanistan by mid 2006 the prts were conceived of as blend of military frontier posts and humanitarian and development aid providers this has proven to be an uneasy combination from the military point of view as well as in terms of development there is coherent nationwide strategy for the prts nor are there any clear benchmarks for their performance each prt reports to its own national capital and despite some efforts at coordination does not share information or lessons learned with other prts the handful of public assessments of the prts performance have generally agreed that thus far the prts have succeeded in improving security and development only in fairly limited areas primarily in northern and central afghanistan in this sense prts may be considered to have been successful within their limited areas of operation but the prts have not provided an adequate response to the broader problem of insecurity in afghanistan as evidenced by the countrys overall deteriorating security situation nor have they been particularly successful at providing development or humanitarian assistance key recommendations the government of afghanistan is ultimately responsible for the security of the afghan people the afghan army and police forces operate with varying degrees of effectiveness in practice usled coalition forces and nato provide muc h of the security stru cture throughout the country and particularly in the south and other volatile areas as the responsibility for providing security in southern afghanistan shifts from the usled coalition to nato forces human rights watch vol 18 6c 11human rights watch believes that key measure of their success or failure should be whether children are able to go to school this will require military and policing strategy that directly addresses how to provide the security necessary for the afghan government and its international supporters to develop afghanistans most difficult and unserved areas the afghan government and the international community have not developed adequate policy responses to the impact of increasing insecurity on development in general and education in particulara particularly sensitive topic because education is often touted as one of the major successes of the posttaliban government in afghanistan unfortunately the international community and the afghan government have failed to address this policy shortcoming in the afghanistan compact the blueprint for afghanistans reconstruction agreed upon after major international conference in london in january 2006 while the compact lists security as one of the key components of afghanistans reconstruction security is discussed in terms of troop num bers instead of whether the composition and mission of these forces is sufficient to improve security for the population at risk the compact explicitly links itself with the afghanistan national development strategy but development goalsmore broadly speaking the notion of human securitydo not appear among the benchmarks used to measure security in implementing the compact the afghan government and the international community should ensure th at they refocus their security efforts on fostering climate conducive to the necessary work of development and reconstruction human rights watch urges the afghan governme nt nato and usled coalition forces to implement coherent nationwide security policy firmly tethered to the development needs of the afghan people critical benchmark of success in improving security should be whether afghans can exercise their basic rights starting with access to basic education such benchmark should be explicitly incorporated into the afghanistan compact human rights watch also urges nato and the usled coalition to improve coordination between their prts and the government to impr ove communication with aid organizations and within six months to assess whether they have committed resources troops materiel and development assistance sufficient to meet set goals finally given the emergence of schools as frontline in afghanistans internal military conflict human rights watch urges the government and its international supporters to immediately develop and implement policy specifically designed to monitor prevent and respond to attacks on teachers students and educational facilities more detailed recommendations can be found at the end of this report human rights watch vol 18 6c 12 this report is based on human rights watch research in afghanistan from may to july 2005 and from december 2005 to may 2006 as well as research by telephone and electronic mail from new york in afghanistan we visited the provinces of balkh ghazni heart kabul kapisa laghman logar kandahar nangarhar paktia parwan and wardak we also spoke in person and by telephone with people from other provinces including helmand and zabul which we were unable to visit due to curity concerns during the course of our investigations we interviewed more than two hundred individuals including teachers principals and other school officials students staff of afghan and international ngos government officials responsible for education at the district provincial and national levels staff of the ministry of womens affairs members of the afghan independent human rights commission police officials staff of the european union world bank usaid and its contractors and the united nations including the assistance mission to afghanistan the childrens fund unicef and the united nations development fund for women unifem officials from nato and other experts on education or security in afghanistan many afghans asked that their names not be used fearing retaliation for identifying opposition groups including the taliban and local strongmen that they believe are responsible for the attacks on schools documented in this report im afraid of this attack this terrorism man working in logar told us dont mention our names in this report there is security we dont feel secure in border areas 6 similarly many ngo staff and others working in the field of education requested anonymity reflecting bot h fear of these groups and pressure to maintain positive picture of education in afghanistan in the face of crisis all numbers in this report regarding education should be understood as rough estimates onlydata are incomplete and those which are available are often unreliable and conflicting 7 figures on school enrollment for 20052006 are those provided by the ministry of education to human rights watch the most comprehensive data on factors affecting participation in education available at the time of writing remains that of two nearly nationwide surveys conducted in 2003 the multiple indicator cluster survey mics and the national risk and vulnerability assessment nrva 8 the 2006 briefing paper of afghan research evaluation unit areu entitled looking beyond the school walls household decisionmaking and school enrollment in afghanistan also provides valuable insights regarding several key areas of the country 6 human rights watch interview with ngo education staff member working in logar and ghazni december 20 2005 7 almost everyone human rights watch interviewed involv ed in education policy cautioned that education statistics in afghanistan were unreliable although national educati on management information system emis was made available in 2006 problems with the datas colle ction have called into question their accuracy 8 even with these surveys insecurity prevent ed surveyors from reaching some districts human rights watch vol 18 6c 13 ii background afghanistan since the fall of the taliban the talibans ouster the bonn process and the afghanistan compact it has been more than four years since the united states ousted the taliban from kabul in retaliation for their support for osama bin laden an d the largescale murder of civilians in the united states on september 11 2001 much has improved in the lives of afghans in the past four years the most significant improvement perhaps being the ability to hope for better future for afghanistans next generation but the hopes of many afghans are today beset by growing crisis of insecurity this crisis was predictable and largely avoidable the failure of the international community led by the united states to provide adequate financial political and security assistance to afghanistan despite numerous warnings created vacuum of power and authority after the fall of the taliban where the united states and its allies failed to tread abusive forces inimical to the wellbeing of the afghan people have rushed in the united states and the international commu nity too often favored politi cal expediency over the more painstaking efforts necessary to create sustainable system of rule of law and accountability and in afghanistan the bonn agreement which in november 2001 before the taliban had been ousted established framework for creating government in afghanistan after the taliban focused on political benchmarks such as the selection of transitional government the drafting of constitution and holding presidential and parliamentary elections it did not include clear guidelines about how these institutions were to operate the first clear signal that the international commu nity and in particular its facto leader in afghanistan the united states would tolerate and even support the return of the warlords came during the emergency loya jirga grand council convened in june 2002 to form afghanistans transitional government although many warlords had been kept out of the meeting under the selection provisions last minute intervention by zalmai khalilzad then the us ambassador to afghanistan and currently the us ambassador to iraq and lakhdar brahimi the special representative of secretary general kofi annan gave access to all the major regional militia commanders their intimidating presence immediately distorted the proceedings and disappointed afghans hoping for new beginning 9 the authority and power of regional warlords and militia commanders grew with every step in the bonn process10

of relying exclusively on warlords to provi regional security and assistance against the taliban in the summer of 2004 when it became apparent that this strategy was undermining the authority of the central government and causing major resentment among ordina ry afghans pursuant to this shift some of the warlords with the greatest human rights watch vol 18 6c 14the bonn process officially ended with the parliamentary elections of september 2005 election day itself was relatively peaceful but it followed campaign marked by intimidation especially against women candidates and voters and voter discontent ultimately reflected in turnout much lower than expected 11 with the end of the bonn process at the beginning of 2006 the international community established new framework for its cooperation with the afghan government for the next five years this new frameworkknown as the afghanistan compactwas unveiled at an international conference in london in january 2006 with much fanfare and congratulatory rhetoric the conferences official tagline was building on success the reality was more sobering as secretary general kofi annan was quick to point out in london afghanistan today remains an insecure environment terrorism extremist violence the illicit narcotics industry and the corruption it nurture s threaten not only continued state building but also the fruits of the bonn process 12 events have since borne out the accuracy of annans cautionary statement even though afghanistan met the political markers established by the bonn processdrafting constitution and electing the president and parliamentthe situation in the country is far from healthy the taliban and other armed groups opposing the central government are resurgent parliament is dominated by many of the warlords criminals and discredited politicians responsible for much of afghanistans woes since the soviet invasion in 1979 production and trade of narcotics provide more than half of afghanistans total income and is major source of violence corruption and human ri ghts abuse some of the same warlords in parliament or in key official positions in the government or security forces control the drug trade afghanistan remains one of the worlds least developed countries 13 and president karzais government remains completely reliant on international financial political and military support 14

emphasized crosscutting efforts to fight afghanistans burgeoning production and trafficking of heroin the compact established benchmarks for performance in each area explicitly tied to afghanistans national development strategy ands 15 the compact also established joint coordination and monitoring board jcmb to ensure overall strategic coordination of the implementation of the compact with membership including senior afghan government officials appointed by the president and representatives of the internationa l community the jcmb is cochaired by senior afghan government official appointed by the president and by the special representative of the secretarygeneral for afghanistan 16 the compacts preamble identifies security as fundamental prerequisite for achieving stability

security in order to allow essential development to take place security cannot be provided by military means alone it requires good governance justice and the rule of law reinforced by reconstruction

16size of the different forces not on their actual capacity to provide security19 the ability to carry out the development that is earlier recognized as fundamental prerequisite to security do not appear among these benchmarks similarly the compacts benchmarks for development do not refer at all to the fact that as was obvious while the compact was being drafted in late 2005 security conditions precluded development and reconstruction in many areas of the country for instance the ambitious benchmarks for primary secondary and higher education set out that by 2010 net enrolment in primary school for girls and boys will be at least 60 and 75 respectively female teachers will be increased by 50 enrolment of students to universities will be 100000 with at least 35 female students and the curriculum in afghanistans public u niversities will be revised to meet the development needs of the country and private sector growth 20 there was recognition that in many parts of afghanistan schools have become frontline in the military conflict between the afghan government and the armed opposition as documented in this report these attacks signal major breakdown in security and in the ability of the central government and its international supporters to provide for the basic needs of the afghan people and meet the goals established in the afghanistan compact 19 the afghanistan compact the london conference on afghanistan annex 1 p 10 20 ibid human rights watch vol 18 6c 17 afghanistan ngo safety office map of insecure areas june 15 2006 2006 anso insecurity in afghanistan at its simplest insecurity in afghanistan can be understood as violence and the threat of violence which depending on the locale are often quite pervasive direct sources of insecuritythat is the agents responsible for the violencecan be characterized in three overlapping categories groups opposed to the central government including the taliban groups linked to the taliban those allied with warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar and tribal or ethnic groups opposed to government presence at any given particular time forces of regional military figures warlords but also some security officials militia commanders and even some governors with independent armed forces who maintain their local authority while ostensibly operating under the umbrella of the central government in kabul and criminal enterprises particularly those involved in the production and trafficking of narcotics human rights watch vol 18 6c 18the source and type of insecurity varies across the country and can be distinguished between the north and south and between urban and rural area s insecurity is also perceived differently by men and women and by the local population and foreign aid workers and contractors wherever it happens and whoever causes it the impact of insecurity is largely the same it keeps afghans from enjoying their most basic rights as human beings rights such as the right to life the rights to freedom of association and assembly the right to obtain health care the right to work and to participate in public life and the right to education as explained in afghanistans 2004 national human development report traditional security threats to the people of afghanistan are both direct violence killings etc and indirect the latter emerge from weakened state capacity and challenges to the legitimacy of institutions outside the capital or from the withdrawal of international aid agencies from dangerous but needy zones 21 in much of afghanistan the basic difficulties of living in war shattered impoverished country gripped by draught and chronic food shortages aggravate the insecurity as set out in more detail below insecurity has limited the work of the government and of aid agencies in many areas of the south and southeast exacerbating the insecurity afghans in these areas experience direct insecurity increased sharply in afghanistan in 2005 and early 2006 the first half of 2006 january to june witnessed the greatest number of conflictrelated deaths in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban with nearly 1000 people both civilians and combatants killed in conflictrelated incidents in the first six months of the year 22 this fatality rate is markedly higher than the previous rate of 1600 people who died in conflictrelated violence in 2005 according to the afghan ngo security office anso 23 for the international community in afghanistan this has included attacks on both fo reign militaries nato and usled coalition forces and the humanitarian aid workers whose efforts are essential for maintaining and improving the lives of the afghan people for aid workers 2006 has been particularly bloody year with 24 killed as of june 20 2006 24 this marks serious escalation in the risk facing aid workers compared with the previous year when thirtyone aid workers were killeditself significant increase compared to twentyfour aid workers killed in 2004

of their heaviest casualties in 2006 as of june 15 2006 300 us troops had died in afghanistan as well as eightytwo from other countries 27 of this total fortyseven us troops died in 2006 along with seventeen from other countries28 this trend continues from 2005 when ninetyone us troops died in combat and from accidents in 2005 more than double the total for the previous year 29 geographically the sources of insecurity can be distinguished along line dividing afghanistan along gentle gradient from the southwest to the northeast and passing directly through kabul north of this line insecurity largely reflects the activity of narcotics networks and the growing authority and impunity of regional military commanderswarlordswho have returned and entrenched themselves by subverting the political process most notably during parliamentary elections in september 2005 30 many regional commanders were able to use intimidation and fraud to place themselves or their proxies in the national parliament or the local shuras or provincial councils thus adding political legitimacy to their rule of the gun and the financial independence many of them enjoy due to the drug trade 31 alarmingly groups allied with the taliban and with gulbuddin hekmatyar have also begun operating more openly in the north even in areas quite close to kabul for now it is in the interest of regional powerholders in the north to minimize blatant use of force in confronting one another or the central government while this state of affairs has allowed the residents of northern and western afgh anistan some measure of respite their sense of insecuritytheir fear that any gains they make could be taken away arbitrarilyremains high 32 while factional fighting and overt violence has decreased in areas outside the south and southeast insecurity remains high because of the near absolute impunity with which regional strongmen are able to act the rule of law and the justice system remain very weak in afghanistan so it is not enough for incidents of actual violence to decrease for the sense of insecurity to lessen 33 the problem of impunity must first be addressed 26 ngo insecurity in

many senior government and security posts after the taliban were overthrown many warlords took on the mantle of government authority by rebranding themselves as security forces without changing how they operate 34 many observers including the united nations the united states and nato consider the narcotics trade as the gravest threat to the security of afghanistan 35 the illicit drug trade accounts for an estimated us27 billion annually surpassing the governments official budget and equaling nearly 40 percent of the countrys legal gross domestic product 36 as barnett rubin has put it the livelihoods of the people of this impoverished devastated country are more dependent on illegal narcotics than any other country in the world 37 however rubin points out that according to estimates nearly 80 percent of this income goes not to farmers but to traffickers and heroin processors 38 criminal gangs involved in the drug trade are major source of violence and insecurity in afghanistan as their interests seem to transcend any particular ideology and focus on maintaining their ability to operate without any inhibitions or monitoring from the government or its international allies despite over us500 million dollars dedicated to the counternarcotics campaign by the united states and the united kingdom drug production raged out of control in 2005 and there are strong indications that it will reach record highs in 2006 39 this vast criminal enterprise undermines the rule of law challenges the authority of the central government and provides easy and massive funding for military groups operating independently of the central government 40 both the insurgents and the regional warlords assuming government authority have benefited from afghanistans booming drug trade and the criminal networks it has spawnedraising fears that afghanistan is turning into narcostate 41 there is very strong belief among afghans and outside observers that senior

21involved in the drug trade42 even the taliban who had effectively stamped out poppy cultivation during their reign are now cooperating with criminal networks and apparently using it to finance their military and political activity another factor complicating the security situation is interference by afghanistans neighbors afghanistans central asian neighborsturkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistaneach have significant ethnic and economic interests in afghanistan while iran and pakistan have historically maintained unofficial zones of influence across their respective borders afghans throughout the country and particularly in the south and southeast in interviews with human rights watch in december 2005 were adamant in blaming pakistan for directly controlling or at least sheltering the forces responsible for destabilizing southern and southeastern afghanistan 43 the proximity of pakistan and its tribal areas typically described as ungovernable or lawless is one reason why insecurity in afghanistan is markedly higher in the countrys southern and southeastern areas it is in these areas where the taliban and warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar have historically centered their operations both groups are predominantly pashtun and derive their strength from pashtun tribes straddling the afghanpakistani border usled coalition forces have concentrated their antitaliban activity and the search for qaeda operatives in this area at times engaging in heavy clashes with opposition forces nearly third of afghanistans population lives in the countrys southern and southeastern provinces the south is the heartland of fghanistans pashtun co mmunity and the cradle of the taliban movement 44 by all accounts and benchmarks security has deteriorated sharply in this area over the

the us had helped us in the 1970s unfortunately the situation is the reverse of what we hoped our peoples hopes have turned to dust this is because of poor management the presence of the commanders who have been put in charge by the government 46 in 2004 more robust and aggressive strategy by the coalition managed to push the opposition forces out of some of these areas prompting the us and afghan governments to pronounce again that the taliban were on the verge of defeat 47 but in 2005 taliban and other opposition forces changed tactics away from direct confrontations and instead began

number of girls able to attend clandestine home schools the misogynistic rule of the taliban left an entire generation of girls and young women illiterate 54 however opposition to nonmadrassa based socalled modern education and to girls participation predates the taliban when it first captured international attention education for girls was historically nearly nonexistent in rural afghanistan and almost exclusively confined to the capital in 1919 king amanullah seized the afghan throne and began rapid expansion of the countrys secular education system directly threatening the clergys centuriesold monopoly on traditional madrassa education for boys amanullahs experiment with secular and modern education system particularly as it addressed the education of girls aroused protest from countrys religious establishment who eventually supported the kings overthrow with amanullahs ouster educational reforms were significantly slowed and in some cases reversed nevertheless over the course of the twentieth century and in particular during king mohammed zahirs long reign between 1933 and 1973 afghanistans education system steadily expanded while continuing to be influenced by demands from the countrys conservative culture and religious authorities 55 after the communist coup detat of 1978 the education system was dramatically revamped to reflect the governing ideology the curriculum downgraded the importance of religion and emphasized marxistleninism the communists educational policies set off serious backlash as the religious establishment assisted by the militant islamic groups cast schools as centers for communist party activity 56 schools became one of the first military targets for the mujahedin and the long war against the soviet occupation57 with the fall of the communist government in 1992 the country was divided among warring factions many of them religiouslyinspired mujahedin groups ideologically opposed to modern education and to educating girls

separation of girls and boys is law but this is certainly policy it was not the case in the past it only started with the mujahedin regime in 1992 it is not applied in private schools 82 demand for separation also comes from local residents 83 some communities refuse even to allow girls to attend school that ever has boys in it others allow girls to go in separate shift or allow very young girls to attend classes with boys official figures may overrepresent the number of functioning girls schools as explained below the number of functioning boys schools is also likely overstated because of closures following attacks human rights watch received information about two instances of new girls schools not being used for their intended purpose woranga safi the thendirector of secondary education department at the ministry of education described an incident in takhar province that she said was typical example of provinces failing to give attention to female education brand new school had been built according to plan established by the ministry of education in kabul in cooperation with the provincial administration it was school dedicated for girls education it worked for few days it was then hijacked by local authorities and turned into school for boys the girls could not return to the school 84 in kapisa province human rights watch visited newlybuilt girls school that police had taken over for their own use because girls from the local community did not attend it 85 secondary education for which girls and boy are separated is far less available to girls than to boys and human rights watch heard reports of certain provinces having secondary schools for girls at all however neither the ministry of education nor unicef were able to provide us with listing of provinces

afghanistans constitution education is compulsory and free from grades one through nine and free up to the undergraduate level of university87 children begin grade one at age six or seven primary education consists of grades one throug h six junior or middle secondary education grades seven through nine and upper secondary education grades ten through twelve formal education options also include vocational educ ation and teacher education grades ten through fourteen and islamic education grades seven through fourteen in cold areas the school year begins after the persian new year in march in hot areas the school year begins in september the school year usually lasts nine months divided into two semesters with twoandahalf month break at the end of the academic year the school day is short typically lasting from three to threeandahalf hours which allows teachers to work at other jobs or schools to operate multiple shifts in addition to formal schools run by the ministry of education other forms of education are available in certain areas this includes lit eracy programs communitybased schools and accelerated learning programs which typically target but are not limited to girls who cannot go to regular school accelerated learning programs educate children who have missed some years of school but seek to rejoin the formal education system by stud ying the formal curriculum at an accelerated pace these programs may be admini stered by ngos or the government with the largest being the usaidfunded afghanis tan funded primary education program apep implemented primarily through afghan ngos international donors have long played role in education in afghanistan and since the fall of the taliban education has been almost completely dependent on international support provided directly to the government or to private contractors and ngos the largest international donors for education in afghanistan are the united states via usaid and the world bank other donors include denmark ireland japan the netherla nds sweden the united kingdom unesco and unicef donor money has gone to school construction and rehabilitation textbook printing and distribution

providing them with critical skills for leading productive lives as citizens and workers education is also central to the realization of other human rights 89 for girls moreover access to education correlates strongly with later marriage and childbirth90 which in turn correlate strongly with improved health including significantly reduced maternal mortality education not only benefits the children themselves it also benefits the countrys development it is now wellestablished that increasing girls and womens access to education improves maternal and child health improves their own childrens access to education and promotes economic growth 91 for example research has shown that an additional year of school for girls can reduce infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent and that reducing the gender gap in education increases per capita income growth 92 indeed studies have found greater returns through higher wages on school investments for girls than for boys particularly for secondary education93 the low numbers of girls receiving secondary education and higher education is especially troubling and carries profound consequences for the future participation of women in the social economic and political life of the country without higher levels of education womens opportunities to secure skilled employment gain leadership roles in local and national government or to impart education as teachers themselves are severely restricted as one woman leader in kandahar pointed out this young generation can be trained well but what about older girls they will remain illiterate an illiterate woman cannot be teacher how can she train the next generation 94 some of the most important development benefits of girls education for country also take place at the

when president karzai stated in march 2006 that some 100000 afghan children who had gone to school in 2003 and 2004 longer went to school he said that this was in part because some two hundred schools that we built were torched or destroyed 97 in fact the number of schools put out of commission is even higher listing schools that were closed in 2005 provincial and district education officials told us of at least fortynine in kandahar 98 fourteen in ghazni99 and eightysix in zabul100 in january 2006 the director of education for helmand province told journalists that 165 schools had been closed for security reasons 101 according to nader nadery of the afghan independent human rights commission more than three hundred schools have been burned or for the major part have been shut down most of the schools have been closed because of the fear of attacks by taliban and alqaeda forces and due to the insecurity that the people in the region feel parents are refusing to send their kids to schools 102 attacks against schools teachers and students rose markedly in late 2005 and the first half of 2006 human rights watch recorded at least 204 reported physical attacks or attempted attacks

watch vol 18 6c 32own interviews103 of these attacks 110 occurred in th first half of 2006 this represents significant increase in attacks reported to anso or otherwise recorded by human rights watch in previous years 104 although human rights watch was not able to independently verify most of these reports our count for 2006 is essentially consistent with that of the world food programme which stated that as of june 19 2006 119 schools had been attacked in 2006 seventytwo of them completely or partially burned and twentyfive have been subject to threats 105 who and why schools in afghanistan have historically been targets of violence directed at the central government or perceived foreign interference and frequently both in the current environment the perpetrators of attacks on teachers and schools and their motives vary in several cases that human rights watch independently investigated we were unable to determine with certainty who was behind the attacks or why schools and school personnel were targeted but certain general conclusions are possible as set out above insecurity in afghanistan has variety of sources and the people we spoke with identified combination of motives these fall into three overlapping categories first opposition to the government and its international supporters by taliban or other armed groups chief among them veteran antigovernment warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar and including at times regional warlords with local grievances and criminal groups trying to restrict government activity second ideological opposition to education other than that offered in madrassas islamic schools and in particular opposition to girls education and third opposition to the authority of the central government and the rule of law by criminal groupsparticularly those in the narcotics tradeanxious to avoid interference with their activity in many instances opposition forces or criminals attack schools and teachers as easy to reach symbols of the government and often the only sign of the government in the area armed 103 human rights watch was not able to independently verify r eports to other organizations anso told us that they attempt to verify the reports they record info rmation is based on reports of attacks from january 2005 through june 21 2006 only and does not include information from icef which has chosen not to make their data public these numbers should be understood as an approximation at best of the total number of attacks many attacks are likely never reported the circumstanc surrounding attacks in many parts of the country are impossible for humanitarian and human rights workers j ournalists and government officials to verify in person precisely because insecurity prevents them from going there 104 see ansos

httpwwwhrworgreports2003afghanistan0703afghanistan0703pd f as explained elsewhere in this report the government does not centrally track attacks on schools and unama and unicef began recording such attacks only recently accordingly trend data are incomplete 105 world food programme emergency report n 24 june 16 2006 httpwwwwfporgenglishmoduleid78key691004 retrieved june 20 2006 human rights watch vol 18 6c 33oppostion groups have changed their tactics to attack soft targets that is low level government employees and symbols of government presence106 teachers and schools often isolated in rural areas and with little or security present perfect targets for such attacks another method of frustrating government policies is to stymie development projects opposition groups have explicitly adopted this position in some instances and targeted development agencies and ngos in several recent instances opposition forces have killed foreign and afghan staffers of development groups the taliban are most often blamed for these attacks but it seems that other groups at times with local grievances or criminal groups eager to keep government influence at bay are also responsible for instance anso reported that on february 4 2006 in saydabad district of wardak province unknown men distributed night letters threatening letters often left in public places at night in the area the night letter asked afghans to join jihad and not to work for foreign organizations and the afghan government there was specific warning to drivers who are transporting goods for organizations and government that they will be face severe consequences if they continue 107 it is possible that the taliban issued this war ning on the other hand the area is quite close to kabul and is dominated by forces allied with abdul rabb rasul sayyaf radical warlord with history of abusive behavior and now prominent member of the afghan parliament108 wardak was also the site of several attacks on schools in 2005 which local government official there attributed to people trying to stop the improvement of this place they target schools because of improvement 109 such warnings and attacks serve to maintain or strengthen local forces by weakening government authority some attacks appear to be the result of tribal or private disputes surrounding the local disbursement of resources inclu ding schools the location of school in southern kandahar province for instance set off longrunning dispute between two tribes vying for government assistance when one tribe attacked the school built on territory of the other tribe it reflected local grievances as well as opposition to the governments policies in that region 110 in other areas schools are attacked not as symbols of government but rather because they provide modern that is not solely religious education especially for girls and women 106 see walter pincus growing threat seen in afghan in surgency defense intelligence agency

spokesperson of the taliban leadership council mohammed hanif the taliban explicitly threatened to attack schools because of their curriculum in general the present academic curriculum is influenced by the puppet administration and foreign invaders the government has given teachers in primary and middle schools the task to openly deliver political lectures against the resistance put up by those who seek independence the use of the curriculum as mouthpiece of the state will provoke the people against it if schools are turned into centers of violence the government is to blame for it 111 the statement went on to target girls education directly another matter worth pointing out is that failure to observe the islamic veil at girls schools coeducation and visits by the american forces to schools are not acceptable to any afghan therefore we are strongly opposed to it and cannot tolerate it 112 around the same time however hanif told journalist we have not threatened anybody except those who work for christians and for foreigners in afghanistan we have never killed any teacher or any student 113 in fact human rights watch has documented many instances set out in detail below when taliban attacks were directed at girls schools exclusively or explicitly targeted teachers and schools providing education to girls similarly on april 27 2006 antigovernment warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar reportedly issued press statement vowing to continue jihad against foreign forces and stating that now the infidel forces had been forming education system and syllabus for afghans to divert our youth from islam to christianity 114 the rest of this section surveys cases of attacks on teachers students and school buildings in several provinces from 2004 to 2006 and the use of socalled

while they were in government since the talibans overthrow the international community led by the united states has maintained significant military presence there and made efforts to develop the areas economy since late 2005 canadian forces have taken the lead in providing security for kandahar nevertheless increasing insecurity has significantly constrained much of the development work limiting it by and large to the city limits representative on the kandahar provincial council provided her impression of the impact of rising insecurity on education particularly for girls in kandahar in december 2005 the security situation was fine but during the last two years it is growing worse day by day in the first three years there were lot of girl studentseveryone wanted to send their daughters to

who spoke with the head teacher three days later described what the head teacher said happened that night about 7 or 8 pm when people started eating dinner the taliban came to his house they knocked

that we went to those students who arent coming now but who came before and they said what can we learn and we will even lose our lives its because of the insecurity now when there are enemies moving

commission researchers found in 2005 that in qalat district of zabul province interviewees reported that they do not send their children to school because of security fears kidnapping and threats from armed men and because the children have to work 189 the afghanistan independent human rights commission s report highlights that in zabul like in other areas across southern afghanistan it is difficult to distinguish between in surgent activity and the action of criminals because in some cases the two groups share common purpose in weakening the government or even work directly to support

of northern india pakistan afghanistan and eastern iran in the eleventh century today it is capital of one of afghanistans more volatile provinces the international community largely suspended operations there in may 2003 when french unhcr employee was killed in ghazni city the city itself is relatively calm but much of the province is beset by opposition groups including the taliban those associated with gulbuddin hekmatyar and local criminal gangs broadly speaking areas south of the ring road are considered seriously unsafe while northern areas are calmer 193 local education officials blame the taliban for some of the attacks on education in ghazni one official from gilan province one of the least secure in ghazni province said some talibs are from the community and some are coming from zabul those coming from zabul taunt our taliban and say if there are schools running in zabul how come the schools are running in gilan 194 in other cases evidence indicates criminal responsibility for instance particularly brutal attack during which killed two education officials in early december 2005 was blamed on robbers because the officials were robbed of the payrolls they were carrying contrary to the usual practice of the ideologically motivated groups 195 overall in 20042005 31 percent of students officially enrolled in school in ghazni were girls but enrollment was much higher in districts north of the ring road than those south of it the two districts out of eighteen with girls enrolled were in southern ghazni 196 teacher from troubled gilan district south of ghazni city described his school we have two shifts one from first to sixth grade one from seventh to twelfth in the evening there are about five to six hundred students there are eighteen teachers forty students in one class the school has frequently faced security problems he told us last year in april 2005 our school was closed by the taliban for two months they threatened us and told us this school must be closed night lette rs are regularly sent 197 193 for instance ghaznis northwestern mountainous district of jaghori mainly hazara area is generally calm and demilitarized and the scene

shortly afterwards the mine was very big and heavy but the person who was doing it didnt set it up right so it was not totally blasted he told us the school principal called him and the afghan national army he said but the army did not respond so he and others cleared the mine shrapnel and searched the school themselves we asked the ana and the police to search for them but they didnt

responsibilities they have right to claim that they have not been informed 264 ibid human rights watch vol 18 6c 69impact of crime and impunity on education not all attacks on teachers students and schools stem from political or ideological opposition to the central government and its international supporters much of the insecurity plaguing afghanistan is result of breakdown in law and order driven in large part by the countrys exploding narcotics trade and abetted by the tremendous weakness of the countrys police and judiciary aggravating the problem is that in many areas of afghanistan security forces are essentially simply reconstituted local militias either directly or indirectly involved with the armed groups attacking teachers and schools police official from wardak told human rights watch if the police were clean they would be effective in theory yes the police could provide the security that you want to schools but theyre not strong or clean enough people want good police to protect their children if the police are polluted dont expect too much from this country the police are connected with the taliban sometimes qaeda and criminal networks it is easy to understand why the police have not protected schools and investigated their attacks sometimes they are involved in the crimes or agree with the criminals 265 in this environment of impunity criminal activity is systemic threat to the wellbeing of the afghan people as politically motivated groups also engage in common brigandage extortion and intimidation to finance themselves and establish regional authority children are frequent targets of criminals and criminal acts various often unidentified armed groups and individuals have targeted children in some cases on the way to school for kidnapping for ransom rape forced marriage and other crimes 266 lawlessness and especially attacks on children seriously obstruct education throughout the country rumors about kidnappings of children swept afghanistan in 2004 and 2005 fueled by number of apparently real cases throughout the country from july to december 2004 the afghan independent human rights commission officially registered fifty kidnapping cases in

were reported by anso268 the kidnappings had powerful effect even on those not directly connected with the incidents for example the director of girls school in herat told us in july of 2005 that in the last year the rumor of kidnapping children has affected attendance of our students nowadays it is again improving 269 similarly teacher in mazare sharif also told us that when kidnapping occurs parents dont send their boys and girls to school for some time270 teacher from deh yek district in ghazni said school attendance at his school decreased severely after nineyearold boy was kidnapped and sexually assaulted in may 2005 271 in kandahar city human rights watch interviewed mother who withdrew her three daughters from primary school after girl in one daughters class was kidnapped and killed 272 her cousins husband found the classmates body around the time of the persian new year march 21 in 2005 the mother said dead with her books all around her he took her to the hospital and found out that the girl was from the school where my daughters attended after that she said i took them out and since then they have never gone back they were afraid they themselves didnt want to go 273 the mother emphasized that she thought education was good thing the girls are very smartthey ask the boys all the time about their books i can see that they are interested we understand that school is good for the future its just the talk of the community the threats that prevent us from allowing our girls to continue 274 although parents of boys also told us they feared crime against their children and boys have been the target of wellpublicized kidnappings 275 the fear of violence and the likelihood that it will never be punished has an especially profound effect on girls and women both because they are targeted for genderbased violence and because of the additional stigma and other consequences that fall on female victims 276 teachers students and ngos report that sexual

another mother in kandahar city told us that man in police uniform tried to take her twelveyearold one evening at the end of ramadan but that people on t he street stopped him believing he was an

documented how physical and sexual violence including by soldiers of warlords kept girls from going to sc hool in human rights watch killing you is very easy thi ng for us human rights abuses in southeast afghanistan pp 7781 human rights watch vol 18 6c 71girls education277 in cases of forced marriage or other forms of genderbased violence there are few avenues for redress social stigma often prevents women and girls from reporting such cases and even if they do the lack of clear legal standards the apathy and lack of appropriate training of the police as well as the dominance of local warlords and their supporters who might be implicated result in virtual impunity for perpetrators according to an afghan independent human rights commission staff member there are probably many hundreds of cases that afghans dont want to register because they consider it shame to the family for instance i know woman whose daughter was kidnapped four months ago but it has not been reported to the police but she has consulted mejust sharing her grief with her daughter was twenty or twentyone years old and teaching at high school the father says its not good to look for her and tell people what happened 278 in addition to the physical and psychological harm caused by these attacks they also serve to limit the participation of women in civil society and the public sphere and their rights to work to privacy and to health care the fear of sexual violence based on years of bitter experience is so great that even an unconfirmed rumor of an attack will deter many parents from sending their children particularly their daughters to school under these circumstances groups opposed to girls education have also used threats of genderbased violence to stop parents from sending girls to school several incidents in the southeastern province of nangarhar province in 2005 illustrate the problem of genderbased violence the lack of redress and the immediate impact on girls education the

student in jalalabad city earlier in that year280 according to teacher in the city the students father pulled her out of school after sami started following her to class 281 but sami then abducted her from the market and took her to dubai for around two months the teacher said when they came back her father was forced to accept the marriage local official with detailed information about the case also confirmed details of this story but could not be identified due to history of reprisals by hazrat ali and members of his family 282 the teacher said one of his students dropped out after the kidnapping according to the local official fear of these kinds of kidnapping has had tangible effect on girls mobility in jalalabad much of the time girls in grades four to six the family stops them from going to school mostly they are afraid of gunmen kidnapping girls other commanders kidnapped girls as sami did then when the family goes to them they are married so people are cautious 283 in second case the father of seventeenyearold girl told human rights watch that armed men he believed to be connected with local strongman attempted to kidnap his daughter in jalalabad at the end of january 2005 as his daughter was walking home from class the father told us three armed men in red toyota pickup repeatedly approached her and asked her to get in the car 284 she threw stones at the car and people nearby chased the men off later however when she was riding in rickshaw the men in the truck reappeared and followed her soon after she arrived home the men knocked on the door when her grandmother opened it they ordered her to bring the girl out the grandmother brandished large axe shouting as long as i am here you wont be able to take my girl from i know how to punish you bastards this attracted other people and the men fled the father told us that he asked around and heard that the car belonged to armed men under local commander he then spoke with high level official under the commander who promised to punish the men and assured him that there was need to follow the i ssue but when he did follow up he was told that the men had escaped he said he also went to government officials and was advised not to follow such case because it might create insecurity for and especially for my daughter which he took as further evidence that the men were protected by powerful strongman he dropped the matter and his daughter stayed home from school for several months he told us now he said she is returning but she is scared and is under strong stress due to all of this she is scared of going out and her psychological condition is also not very good 285 280 human rights watch interview with local education officials and aid workers nangarhar june 6 2005 281 human rights watch interview with teacher nangarhar june 6 2005 282 human rights watch telephone interview with local official may 27 2005 283 ibid 284 human rights watch interview jalalabad june 6 2005 285 ibid human rights watch vol 18 6c 73a third case was recounted to human rights by nineteenyearold woman in nangarhar village286 the woman spoke to us about her cousin who at the time of the presidential elections in 2004 was studying in the eighth grade and working to register voters one evening when the work ran later than expected the driver who was taking her to her familys village raped her the cousin arrived at her uncles house injured and with torn clothes when the village found out she doused herself with petrol and lit herself on fire after four days the young woman said her cousin died it is very sad to explain all this but such terrible experience made us all afraid now even though i am in tenth grade i dont go to school anymore and neither do my cousins because the question to us and our families is not only losing someone but also the familys honor is very important to us we afghans pay lot of respect to issue s of honor and maybe some people in village know that my cousin was innocent but it doesnt matter if she was innocent or notshe was working out of the house and such thing can happen to any other girl so thats why we cant go to school anymore 287 because girls and women are both specially targeted and more deeply affected by violence providing girls with equal access to education will require additional measures of protection for them criminal behavior is problem not only for teachers and students but also for education providers particularly ngos there has been massive increase in criminality in the last year anso staff told human rights watch 288 many recent attacks on ngos they said are criminally not politically motivated289 human rights watch also heard reports which we were not able to verify of corrupt individual s destroying schools in

coursenneff human rights watch vol 18 6c 75 iv the indirect impact of insecurity on education when family wants to send their daughters to school but they see the school is not close or its not good building or there are not qualified teachers many parents dont send their children to school because they see some danger some problem its circular three components are very important 1 security 2 teachers 3 buildings all are impacted by security mohammeed azim karbalai director of planning department ministry of education kabul december 15 2005 regardless of the motivation for attacks on teachers students and schools in afghanistan their effect is devastating and farreaching parents are afraid to send their children to school teachers are afraid to teach and schools are shut down education providersthe afghan government and ngosare forced to withdraw from insecure areas or are unable to expand to areas that desperately need them in every respect girls who have much more limited access to education to begin with and who are typically the first to be pulled out of school because of insecurity are disproportionately affected this climate of insecurity has seriously retarded and in places even stopped the crucial task of educating afghan children the problem is particularly acute outside of larger urban areas and off major roads although early 2006 saw new attacks on previously secure schools in urban areas in southern and southeastern afghanistan where new rash of suicide bombings and targeting of teachers and schools has directly put schools in the line of fire insecurity has cast an even more serious pall yet it is impossible to gauge the exact impact of insecurity on education because oneincluding the government and the united nationshas comprehensive view of the number of schools and other educational settings operating in the south and southeast at any given moment the failure to monitor attacks on education is discussed in the section on governme nt and international responsibility below even when schools continue operating students may not attend after threat or an attack each incident affects the risk assessment that parents and students undertake nearly every day single episodes even from far away districts accumulate to establish pattern in country as traumatized by violence as afghanistan teachers parents and students are keenly attuned to fluctuations in this pattern and decide to continueor stoptheir education based on how they view the general climate of insecurity and how it will manifest itself in their immediate human rights watch vol 18 6c 76environment290 parents have an even lower threshold for insecurity when it comes to the school attendance of their daughters as noted above one senior western education expert explained the closure of school is bound to have ripple effect so that many other schools close around one affected school for particular reason except that the school was burned when it reopens fewer girls come back more boys 291 this ripple effect magnifies the gravity of each attack and raises fears elsewhere for example after the office of the afghan ngo coordination of humanitarian assistance cha in panjwai was attacked in april 2004 and two staff members were killed residents of neighboring district subsequently decided not to go forward with an accelerated learning program aimed at women and girls 292 staff member of major international ngo with extensive experience in education provided similar assessment describing how threats against schools can create climate of fear the problem with nightletters happened in pole khumri near kabul last spring and so many times in the southeastern provinces logar wardak ghazni people cannot make decisions very easily for month or two months you cannot see any children in school because they may fear very bad news from people who distributed night letters or attack or bomb the school for weeks you cannot expect to have children back in schools 293 without an effective government or credible media that can track and speak definitively about the security environment afghan parents and students are forced to assess their risk based on rumors and incomplete information there is sense of insecurity and fear maybe it happened to someones daughter it creates sense of concern because of limited reporting very limited number of attacks are getting reported but people fear the worst said horia mossadeq of human rights research and advocacy consortium which has investigated the state of afghanistans educational system for several years 294 for example the afghan independent human rights commission which investigated rumors in mazare sharif about the kidnapping of students in 2004 and 2005 that decreased student attendance found only 290 for example education staff of an ngo working in eastern afghanistan noted that when there is fighting in some villages people dont want to put their children in danger so they keep them home for while affected areas he said included laghman alishing district nuri stan and parts of kunar human right s watch interview with ngo education staff

vol 18 6c 77one incident in that city295 local investigators with the afghan independent human rights commission believed that local individuals opposed to education magnified the incident in order to discourage school attendance 296 in another example the mother of five girls attending school in kandahar explained how she assesses the incomplete information about security circulating around her community she keeps her daughters at home she said at times when the security gets particularly bad when people talk about it there is official announcement but the community talks about the situation getting worse so we stop them from going 297 insecurity not only impedes education when it keeps children and teachers home shuts down schools and prevents the government and ngos from opening new schools it also exacerbates other factors that keep children from enrolling in or staying in school in afghanistan these include insufficient development aid and services schools that are too far away or simply unavailable especially girls schools in rural areas and girls secondary schools school facilities that are physically inadequate or culturally inappropriate shortage of qualified teachers especially female teachers the poor quality of education offered poverty that requires children to work for income or in the home or that places school supplies and transport out of reach negative attitudes about girls education or girls being seen outside the home and early marriage of girls 298 295 human rights watch interview with director afghani stan independent human rights commission

decisions about whether to send children to school are complex it is often impossible to point to single reason children are kept out299 the statements of school official from maywand district kandahar illustrate this complexity around three to four years before he told us girls in his district went to school for one year but they stopped he said because of the threat from the outside and because of the cultural norms of society people teased those who sent their girls and there were separate schools or female teachers available 300 what is clear however is that insecurity heightens the effect of existing barriers to education on girls and women making it especially troublesome that there are far fewer girls schools than boys schools anything in security terms is more serious for women said staff member of an ngo providing homebased education distance permission to leave home quality 301 insufficient development aid and services even before the recent upswing in suicide bombings and attacks on education the aid community in afghanistan faced increasingly widespread and lethal violence in 2004 and 2005 although worse in the south and east attacks also spread to the north and west where more ngos operate 302 ngo staff are literally paying with their lives everyone we spoke with who was involved with development in afghanistan told us that insecurityincluding

yearnumber of fatalities at minimum the threat of violence has caused ngos and government officials to take precautions such as changing their vehicles removing ngo logos using more secure but less direct routes and not traveling before or after certain hours 303 ngos also described difficulties recruiting people to go to insecure areas and having to open and close field offices depending on the security climate for example one afghan ngo staff person told us that the organization closed its office in logar the previous year when mine was laid in front of the door in this case the office was able to reopen when local people came and said please come back and we will guarantee security 304 interruptions in operations and other constraints slow the pace of work and can hurt the quality of services provided for example staff member of an ngo in kandahar told us security has held us back i used to go out lot more but more and more i feel that i cant do that as much as i would like to we always have to be careful when we do womens activitiesour words statements physical appearanceso that because of our activities women are not targeted it hinders our progresssomething that can take month may take us four to five months because we have to be so careful this makes us look bad to someone in washington this is not rocket science so why is it taking so long but it is the insurgency that hampers us from moving faster 305 303 human rights watch interview with afghan ngo staff kabul december 15 2005 describing precautions taken in ghazni 304 ibid 305 human rights watch interview with rangina hamidi afghans for civil society kandahar december 8 2005 human rights watch vol 18 6c 80several ngos and others told us they could not monitor projects in the way they would like306 for example some must bring project repr esentatives into provincial centers instead of traveling to projects and seeing them for themselves307 another ngo staff member noted that insecurity in parts of paktia and nangahar does prevent staff from making field visits last year in these provinces there were moments when we didnt let staff in and couldnt carry out training monitor and supervise distribute materials and that slows our training 308 international organizations have severely restrained their foreign staff from traveling and working in many areas of the south and southeast an american usaid contractor noted security very much impacts our movements and our staff here in kabul in the provinces we just dont get out as much our monitoring and evaluation team are afghans id love to go with them but when i go security and movement are compromised 309 world bank official confirmed security does affect my work i know my project would move faster if i could go there i have projects in helmand zabul kandahar kandahar i go helmand zabul one is going not even the deputy minister there are ngos who work there but its very difficult to monitor so security is huge there 310 some ngos and other agencies have been forced to close down operations because of insecurity senior official who did not wish to be named told human rights watch in december areas are becoming more insecure there are areas where agencies can operate the government cant operate prts arent there more and more areas are closed off to us 311 security is defining concern for us said staff member of prominent education provider in several districts she said the organization has had to turn over its schools to the government and other organizations because it c ouldnt send in national staff to

because there are lot of threats313 oxfam which was one of the few international humanitarian organizations working in rural zabul and kandahar drastically scaled back its work to kandahar city in late 2003 after some of their staff were threatened and beaten and their vehicle hijacked 314 similarly employees of an ngo working primarily in the north and west told us that they phased out their program in kandahar in mid2005 primarily due to insecurity and availability of resources but if security permits we would definitely like to go back but for education we would think several times before doing it there that area has strong taliban influence first there is the physical presence of the taliban second even when they are not there their influence is felt 315 moreover many ngos who have historically worked in other parts of afghanistan have not expanded to the south or southeast as one staff person noted simply security impacts where we choose to work if there is high risk that staff will lose their lives then its key consideration 316 staff of an afghan ngo that has weathered serious security problems explained to human rights watch why he had urged the coordinator of joint ngo program not to expand the program to helmand i said please dont include helmand province in your target areas because we will have to hire staff two times we will send staff and they will be killed this is not joke we cannot take charge of working there this is the main place where the taliban operates its close to pakistan and they can easily infiltrate during the night 317 the government of afghanistan suffers from problems similar to those of ngos increasing insecurity and targeting of educational staff has placed nearly unbearable burdens on the afghan governments already inefficient bureaucracy local ministry of education officials and district heads from different areas in southern and southeastern afghanistan told human rights watch that they were greatly limited in what they could do because of the threats directed at them and their educational staff for example the head of the education department in saydabad district of wardak province about an hours drive

badghis with eight women teachers three months ago they wrote night letters saying we will close your school so we closed the program after few days we convinced people that this program is good so we managed to succeed on november 25 2005 we tried to hold meeting with teachers from ghor herat and badghis but there was fighting between two commanders in ghor so one from ghor could come and visit 319 mohammed azim karbalai director of planning for the ministry of education explained that the insecurity has significantly impeded the afghan governments efforts to increase the educational rate throughout the country an important policy of the ministry is balanced education in all provinces and all districts so each year we have plan so each year we plan for the constructioneach province has to have certain number of schools constructed but if we have some security problems we dont achieve these targets by the end of the year we ask ngos and companies that have to go to these areasthey dont go if they have security problems it is the main obstruction problem for the reconstruction of schools 320 insecurity and the attendant difficulty of government agencies foreign reconstruction agencies and ngo aid workers working in insecure areas has also distorted nationallevel reconstruction policies in afghanistan southern and southeastern afghanistan which have suffered most from insecurity have witnessed significant drop in reconstruction activity senior western education expert working in afghanistan expressed his concern about this phenomenon we are very concerned about

afghanistan has had significant political impact because it has fostered resentment against the perceived failures and biases of the central afghan government and its international supporters insecurity leads to driving ngos away which leads to low development which leads to local resentment which leads to insecurity explained observer 322 the thenprovincial us commander in helmand told journalists in january 2006 that recent attacks on schools and the killing of teacher had left many residents of the province including influential tribal leaders hedging their bets people are

schools and infrastructure an estimated 80 percent of existing schools in afghanistan were either damaged or destroyed during the years of war324 despite the construction or refurbishment of more than 1100 schools since 2001 afghanistan still has far fewer schools that it needs more than half of rural communities had primary school at all in 2003325 as explained in the background section above there are many more boys schools than girls schools despite the greater impact of distance on girls the shortage of girls schools is even more acute at the secondary level an analysis of the 2003 national risk and vulnerability assessment nrva found that many parents said they didnt send their children to school because it was too far away but parents are more likely to consider schools too far away if they perceive the route to be risky the researchers concluded that the reason for not sending child to school did not always refer literally to distance the actual distance child walks to school may be short but if for example the journey is unsafe or girls must walk through busy bazaar then it is considered by respondents to be too far away 326 as an education specialist for an afghan ngo explained security is very big issue all over afghanistan and sometimes it is an obstacle for education but why are we thinking about security to it is not security but accessibilityits walking distance that stops girls from going to school if school is very nearby or in house then the issue is not security there is need to walk long distance and be targeted by bad guys 327 the mother of two girls in kandahar city who attended afterschool classes told us she was considering pulling them out of the classes because they have to walk home education is good but security is bad she explained its the walking i fear of course i am scared there are bomb blasts constantly so of course i m very worried i pray all the time that they will be protected may god protect them i hope that god can take this fear from when there is security i will not prevent my daughters from doing anything 328 324 world bank afghanistan national reconstruction and poverty reductionthe role of women in

security reasons kidnappings and murders and because of the heat during the hot seasonits too hard to walk we are scared when our children go to school because of dangers because the streets are not safe there are proper roads the kids walk through the fields when the wheat is high we cant see anything its not safe 331 and grandmother in laghman said yes we send our boys to school but not our girls it is not safe for girls to go to schoolthe way is not good they have to walk through fields that we dont think is safe for them to cross our younger girls ages six to nine were going to school but their teacher got married and she went very far from here now my grandchildren six to nineyearold girls have not gone to school for months for the older ones as i told you they dont go 332 329

the population of the area the number of girls is low the area where school is located is safe but families who live far away dont let their girls to come to school 333 hangama anwari of the afghan independent human rights commission confirmed all over afghanistan security is the biggest issue pecially when it comes to girls if it takes more than ten minutes to reach school parents wont send their girls to school they send their boys though part of the problem is warlords and commanders 334 similarly the afghan human rights commission found in research in 2005 that the most common reason interviewees gave for not sending girls to school was distance too far worried about securityactually conflating these two factors far fewer interviewees cited this reason for not sending boys 335 the problem is especially acute at the secondary level where there are far fewer schools the statements of elders in bagrami district kabul illustrate this problem as one said if we had high school in this part of the village we would send our girls to this high school we can assure you that we are not against teenage girls being educated we have some of them going to high school already however it is the tradition here not to allow grown up girls to go to school if they have to go far and to cross other villages there is competition between villages and it is not good at all for these girls to risk being in contact with boys from other villages now we allow only girls from first to sixth grades to go to school if we had school on this side of the village the older girls would attend in this village if grown up girls are not allowed to go to school it is for reasons of honor and security we are not against them been educatedto the contrary 336 mother in parwan province also explained to

such far places my he is man he can go for him it is not big risk but for girl who is young also it is dangerous to go to city 337 staff member of an ngo that runs schools in the north northeast west and southeast explained how in the areas in which they operate they try to overcome these barriers security problems and distance from schools are especially problems for girls plus agegirls who become older parents prefer not to send them plus there is preference for boys education in many families some families are quite sensitive to girls educationthey dont want girls to be sent so we find that distances have much greater impact on girls so we decided to establish schools nearer their homes communitybased schools this also decreases security problems distance problems encouraging girls to come to school 338 where schools do exist families may find them inadequate unsafe or culturally inappropriate 339 in many areas school are held in tents private homes donated structures mosques and outside340 for example teacher in nesh district kandahar where there are girls schools told human rights watch most of our schools are mobile they have set place tent they are held under trees in

surrounding wall 342 director mohammed azim karbalai gave an illustrative example of the vicious circle formed by the failures of reconstruction due to insecurity in southern and southeastern afghanistan in afghanistan the main demand from families is safe environment inside schools so if they dont have building then families dont allow their children to go especially in zabul and uruzgan we have this problem we havent reconstructed lot of schools and families complained that they didnt have suitable buildings for schools but at this time we cannot do anything in this area 343 human rights watch also interviewed group of women and girls from returnee camp in paktia who said the camp elders were threatening them for leaving the camp to attend teacher training and their students for attending their schools in the camp most schools are in tents so our elders want school in the camp in gardez the provincial capital the security is better so girls are encouraged to attend school 344 in addition there may be separate school or shift for girls the teachers may be male or there may be water toilets or wall around the school all of which keep girls from attending school 345 other infrastructure problems include lack of school furniture educational supplies science and laboratory equipment for secondary schools and heat during cold weather346 shortage of teachers experienced

education staff explained347 the exact number of teachers and where they are is still not known the ministry of education estimated that it had around 140000 teachers in 20052006 but many others working with the ministry dispute this figure 348 according to the ministry around 28 percent of teachers were female in 20042005 and most were in kabul city leaving an extreme shortfall in most areas349 for example the ministry reports that there were just seven female teachers in uruzgan in 20042005 twentyeight in zabul and 172 in kandahar 350 the problem is particularly acute in rural areas where qualified women are unable or unwilling to travel to or live women teachers wont go to remote areas because the salary is low there is facility available for living said an ngo staff person 351 security problems may also prevent women from teachers even when they alre ady live in the community for example teacher in deh yek district ghazni described the situation in his village there is girls school up to third grade built in 20022003 but we have women for teaching girls there are women teachers in our district but they are afraid to teach because of the taliban their fears appeared wellfoundedat least two male teachers houses had been bombed he said after they received night letters warning them against teaching girls 352 the governments teacher training program and ngos have focused on training local women however the lack of educated or even literate women in rural areas makes it difficult even to find women to train and can limit the quality of education

original object was to include women teachers we dont have special measures to make sure that the trainers are women but our original goal for master trainers was fiftyfifty but there are limits because the women core trainers cant travel there are some provinces women couldnt go to some could have mahram close male relative to accompany her but some couldnt get anyone to go with her so we had to limit assigning women to the provinces they are doing work here in kabul the problems are security transport accommodation regarding security in wardak in ghazni woman traveling to vi sit schools is so unusual you need to have team so that women dont look like woman alone we dont have women traveling alone with man because people are not used to it and women dont feel comfortable in mazar and herat we sent women but they need transportationthey dont feel comfortable sitting in taxi and we cant afford to hire car so the only place they can work comfortably is kabul 354 other barriers to recruiting more women teachers include low salaries 18002000 afghanis us3741 month depending on the teachers qualifications which result in experienced teachers seeking other or second

that the ministry of education needs to do more to attract and retain women teachers including creating special asures for recruiting women adopting more flexible accreditation programs for women teachers and providing housing and protection at teacher training programs offered in urban centers so that women from rural areas can participate 359 much more must be done to keep girls many who

communitybased education noted that the low quality of education and the low returns on education discourage children especially girls from attending school theres the practical aspect of educationmost children who do go to school for three years dont know how to read and write if they do they lose it quickly because theres nothing to read so theres problem with motivation to go to

primary income earners and that households poverty and the opportunity costs involved in sending working children to school are primary factors inhibiting the enrolment of both boys and girls

they rented minibus as group and it is good but not all people can pay money for transportation if there is any support from the government side to provide girls school with transportation it can be

let them go girls should be at home if they go to school people will see them on the street and that would be very shameful for after they go to school girls think that they can go anywhere that they do not have to wear the hijab head covering and that they dont have to hide their faces islam does not accept that 381 practices such as early marriage of girls also result in their being taken out of school when they are engaged or married the prohibition on married girls attending school was officially rescinded by presidential decree in 2004 but this is not necessarily known or enforced at the local level 382 resistance to educating girls increases as girls grow older also the point at which most girls typically must travel farther to reach secondary scho ol if one is available at all

grade its our culturethey cant leave the village one thing is culture the other is security 383 girl in parwan told human rights watch we are concerned about the future the next year because the school now is up to ninth grade for the next year we suggested extending the school into high school we as girls can not travel out of district we need at least high school for girls and otherwise our education will remain incomplete 384 insecurity may reinforce conservative beliefs about girls education for example by exposing girls to real physical risks either at school or route and by preventing or discouraging female teachers from going to certain areas the world bank has noted it is difficult to separate the issue of cultural barriers to mobility from those of securityhow much of

affects his efforts to encourage girls to come to school more girls can attend school with the emergence of better cultural environment and that is only possible with establishment of overall security when the security of an area is guaranteed families will not feel unsafe to send their daughters to schools and on the other hand irresponsible persons will not have any chance to go around and disturb people especially women and girls attending schools i think security is the first priorityonce it is safe people are more interested in getting education they will feel secure to send their daughters to school 386 because of insecurity problems in the area as well as traditional society he said i would estimate only 10 percent of female students participation in the school while 75 percent of boys are normally attending the school in the area 387 moreover according to teacher trainer in paktia people ideologically opposed to education nurture parents fears about girls education in paktia the cultural problem for educating girls is that people feel shame about sending their daughters to school but theres also the influence of people who oppose girls education people who oppose the government are under foreign influence say girls education is against religion paktia is border region pakistan has influence and agents who tell people their daughters will get stolen

introduce education into communities for the first time when they have the security to operate rangina hamidi with afghans for civil society in kandahar described one approach that ngos have been forced to employ ive been working here for three years yes its conservative society but there are methods to deal with it its true that majority of people dont send girls to school but thats because they havent seen the benefit of education in their lives and less because traditions are hard to change so we suggest that home schools for girls be created our income generation projects have been successful because they are homebased we give them an opportunity to earn money but also within their tradition and we give them information about the outside world its longterm development so that the next generation of women hopefully their daughters will have better lives but this is long term 397 human rights watch heard examples of women and girls and their male family members taking great risks to get education when opportunities are available even in very culturally conservative environments for example one young woman in her late teens attending teacher education seminar told human rights watch we need educationwe lied to come here i told my mother i went to get water i had to get my brother to convince my other brother and my mother to allow to attend the workshop 398 researchers from the afghan research and evaluation unit also found if daughter is enrolled in school the fear of being shamed by extended family members in other households neighbours and others is

in the street laugh at and call names they say why are you going to school youre girl and you dont need this but i begged my family for months to let go and they finally did 400 but many of her friends had dropped out she said401 even individuals who are willing to take these risks cannot do so for long without protection or support from government community and religious leaders for example teacher from deh yek district in southern ghazni told us that despite great demand for girls primary education this year we had more girl students than we could handle he said the bombing of teachers homes and threats against girls education may prove successful its real possibility that girls schools wont operate next year he concluded generally the people support girls education its the ignorant jihadis and the taliban against the government who fight this the ignorant people say if you educate your girl she will become independent she wont get married 402 the experience of teachers in gardez paktia who were attending short teacher education seminar wellillustrates the need for protection for teachers and students 403 one told human rights watch as returned refugees who were educated outside the country we are now having problems now were not allowed to learn because of tribal persecution we were educated in pakistan but our parents and tribal elders now threaten us 404 according to five eyewitnesses on saturday december 3 2005 local malik named yousuff khan berzat and his strongmen threatened the teachers as they prepared to leave the camp for the seminar and threw rock at their car according to one witness yousuff khan said that nobody should go to the seminar and if anyone goes then we will snatch off what you are wearing or we will make you lose your chastity you are disgracing women nobody needs your education now that you got educated you have brought at bad name to us the teachers missed one day of the seminar but then sought help from local government officials yousuff khan was arrested on sunday but released the same day 399 pamela hunte looking beyond the school walls pp 5 7 400 wahidullah amani school today iwpr december 23 2005 401 ibid 402

witness gardez december 5 and 6 2005 404 human rights watch group interview with tep trainees in gardez december 6 2005 human rights watch vol 18 6c 100on the day that we interviewed the teachers they said the tribe was deciding whether to banish them this was idle threatwe interviewed another teacher there who had already been banished for her work the iskanderkhel tribe will decide whether to cast out whoever goes to the workshop one woman explained they will be thrown out of the camp there are ten girls from the refugee camp all iskanderkhel tribe weve all faced problems but if i dont work there will be money for the family we dont have any security if we become teachers we cant go to teach our students will be threatened 405 another girl said we are afraid but we wish to continue teaching and also get educated ourselves there are lot of people among those against us who cant even offer prayers correctly and we want to educate people but there is security 405 ibid human rights watch vol 18 6c 101 v the inadequate response of the afghan government and its international supporters to attacks on education i think we know girls dont go to school we need programs or strategies that we can use to get girls to go to school its hard to do because of the security situation and the low capacity of the government i would like to see ngos used more because they can go to places where the government cannot but the government sees ngos as sucking up money we need government that is in the drivers seat 406 education expert world bank kabul december 4 2005 the afghan government and its international supporters have largely failed to provide adequate assistance to promote and protect the development of afghanistans education system neither the afghan government nor the international community have developed strategy to end attacks on girls teachers and schools to keep schools open or to make education accessible to insecure and rural areas such strategy must include preventing attacks monitoring attacks and their effects and responding to attacks once they occur these ideas are developed more fully below in the recommendations there are signs that the afghan govern ment and the international community are now beginning to recognize the crisis posed by the escalating attacks on education as cited at the beginning of this report president karzai has made strong statements deploring such attacks and reiterating the importance of education if you stop sending your children to school because one school is set ablaze or child is threatened or if teacher is martyred then you make your enemy succeed and make yourself fail he said on international womens day 2006 if million times they are threatened send your children back to school million times if million times schools are torched build them million times so that this nation can be freed from fear and horror 407 the special representative of the secretary general thomas koenig who assumed his position in january 2006 i mmediately condemned attacks on schools and appealed to those who disagree with the countrys development to leave afghanistans children alone 408 and the uns special rapporteur on the right to education vernor munoz villalobos condemned attacks on schools after an attack in kunar province killed and wounded several students 409 406 human rights watch interview

rights watch vol 18 6c 102notwithstanding such useful statements not much has improved on the ground in terms of monitoring preventing or responding to the attacks on teachers students and schools as pointed out above the effect of insecurity on education is particularly sensitive topic for the government and international community the resuscitation of the educational system after the fall of the taliban is one of the major successes of the present government and its international backers and as already pointed out is often touted as such but the lack of monitoring and the pressure to present positive image about advances in education in afghanistan have impeded accurate reporting on the impact of insecurity on education 410 human rights watch encountered shared impression by the afghan government unicef and some ngo education providers that reporting attacks and school closures could cause donors to cut off muchneeded funding this concern may well be valid but is not justification for covering up the problem compounding the problem is that the ministry of education is severely constrained by lack of institutional capacity and funding point emphasized by everyone involved with education at every level with whom we spoke one official explained its hard to say if the government is doing enough because of the lack of capacity they cant even do survey to find out how many girls attend in district when the level is so low its hard to say they are not doing enough how can they do more certainly things are happening but without management 411 the afghan research and evaluation unit also noted in 2004 in addition to limited resources the system is plagued with few qualified educators managers or technicians there is complete absence of any information technology and there is communication system to connect ministry of education and provincial education departments peds physical facilities at provincial departments and district education subdepartments are very basic with little or electricity let alone means of communication computers or transport to support school activities furthermore institutional capacity in the provincial education departments and district education subdepartments is limited with little experience in priority setting datasupported planning or management of service delivery 412 although the situation has improved somewhat in terms of basic equipment and infrastructure the ministry of education has still not formulated an adequate response to the current crisis it is clear that any response must be formula ted and implemented from kabul because the educational system in afghanistan is like every other part of the government extremely centralized in its survey of the afghan government bureaucracy the afghan research and evaluation unit explained 410 us gao afghanistan reconstruction 411 human rights watch interview with u n official kabul december 5 2005 412 evans et guide to government in afghanistan p 116 human rights watch vol 18 6c 103almost all key decisions are made in kabul even the provincial and district offices have very limited decisionmaking authority and community managed schools are unheard of except those sponsored by ngos and donors from curriculum development to teacher training to approving the recruitment of teachers and school heads selection and production of texts and especially controlling financing and spending the central ministry of education almost completely dominates decisionmaking with few exceptions culture of dependency on the center pervades the education sector in afghanistan 413 failure to monitor attacks one sign of the lack of strategy is that there is currently domestic or international institution in afghanistan that has full picture of the attacks on education that are taking place and their impact collecting and analyzing this information is necessary to understand the causes and extent of the problem yet even in areas where the government is present it is reluctant to share or even gather information that may indicate that schools are not operating properly the ministry of education told human rights watch that it does not monitor attacks on schools or their effects this reflects in part the ministrys lack of basic data on education including an accurate count of schools teachers and students in addition as documented above attacks on schools have driven even local educational officials out of some districts however the failure to monitor also reflects conscious attempt to avoid bad news i dont think we have this information deputy ministry mohammad sediq patman told us we dont bring information on security incidents to the center because it will have negative effect on our morale 414 probably the most comprehensive record of attacks is interspersed among the weekly security summaries distributed by the ngo secur ity organization anso anso does valuable work but does not disaggregate this information to present coherent picture of the security conditions specific to the education process furthermore ansos information represents an essentially ad hoc system of recordkeeping without focus on educational facilities teachers or students the united nations also seems to lack centralized coordinated information clearing house on security threats to education both unama and unicef are now independently collecting information but as far as we understand do not share this information with each 413 ibid 414 human rights watch interview with mohammad sediq patman deputy minister of education kabul december 14 2005 human rights watch vol 18 6c 104other unicef does share its information with the ministry of education but relies on its zonal offices which are not present in every zone to collect the data as result unicefs database contains only fraction of the total number of attacks and lacks even incidents widely reported in the press unamas human rights capacity has always been too small to provide adequate coverage and analysis of the cou ntrys myriad human rights problems unama recently began tracking attacks through its gender security and human rights units based on information from range of sources including its own staff and security reports but this information is not comprehensive and was not shared with all parts of the united nations as of may 2006 415 in addition the world food program seems to be collecting information about attacks on schools although it is unclear if this information is independently gathered or represents collaboration with other bodies 416 the world bank and usaid the two largest international donors to education in afghanistan also do not have clear view of the extent of the problems caused by insecurity world bank education staff member told human rights wa tch that it does not currently monitor attacks on schools although such an effort would be useful we dont touch attacks on girls schools we only hear about them tracking them would be useful 417 usaid only collects information about attacks on its own education projects418 beyond basic notation of incidents of insecurity there is little monitoring of the impact of such attacks especially beyond the immediate wake of the event unicef notes regarding the cases it records when school has closed down areas to monitor should also include the effects of threats and violence against students and teachers and student attendance especially that of girls in the aftermath of an incident when schools do not shut down the impact on schools in surrounding areas should be recorded as well human rights watch found nobody monitoring early warning signs for attacks such as night letters school being located very near district government office or being the only representation of government in an area or other factors failure to prevent and respond to attacks the lack of information about attacks on education reflects the overall institutional weakness of the afghan government bureaucracy and the failure of the government and international community to prioritize this issue such informati on is critical both for addressing the effects 415 email from staffer of unama human rights unit

ch ris broughton usaid office of south asian affairs washington dc april 11 2006 human rights watch vol 18 6c 105of individual attacks and for crafting strategy to prevent future attacks however information alone is not enough afghan and international ins titutions responsible for education must work closely with international and afghan institutions responsible for security such cooperation is evident now there is institu tion in afghanistan currently willing to take responsibility for securing the access of afghan children to education there is nationwide policy for preventing attacks on schools and there is policy for ensuring individual schools receive assistance after an attack the ministry of education takes the position that ensuring security for education is beyond its mandate and capabilities mohammed azam karbalai the head of the ministry of educations planning department explained that the ministry of education cant do anything about security maybe the ministry of defense the ministry of interior or isaf or other forces 419 karbalai went on explain that when the ministry receives word that school building or tent has been destroyed we refer it to the ministry of interior and we try to reconstruct the building if it is possible also we are working with the governor of provinces to pay attention to schools 420 the afghan police do not prioritize protection of educational facilities and at any rate are viewed as incapable of carrying out strategic response mohammed sediq patman the deputy minister of education suggested that the police lacked the ability to resolve this crisis the police cannot go there places where schools are attacked we dont have this tradition in afghanistan for police to protect schools the people protect the schools 421 human rights watch heard numerous complaints about the afghan national polices failure to investigate or in some cases respond at all to attacks on schools while responses vary from place to place the high commissioner for human rights watch reported to the security council in march that the police failed to adequately investigate these and other cases of school burnings and killing of teachers in 2005 and early 2006 and in only few cases has anyone been arrested in relation to attacks on schools the police complain of limited capacity and lack of access to more insecure areas reinforcing an environment of impunity and climate of fear particularly for those 419 human rights watch interview with mohammed azim kar balai director of planning department ministry of education kabul december 15 2005 420 ibid 421 human rights watch interview with mohammed sediq patman deputy minister of education kabul december 14 2005 human rights watch vol 18 6c 106individuals officials and community leaders supporting the governments development agenda422 education officials at the local level consistently complained that they could not count on governmental security forces for assistance one education official from ghazni province put it succinctly there is police there in our district in ghazni but very weak there is army the police is so weak that if anybody goes to them and asks for help they say if you can provide us with security we will go with you but otherwise not 423 the international response also lacks coordination according to unicef its policy is to provide tents and to replace damaged textbooks and furniture within five days it seems unlikely that it would be able to do so given that based on its records of attacks it has been unaware of many of the attacks that have taken place unama and undp are drafting recommendations about responding to attacks however at present there are broader policies for systematically rebuilding schools or preventing or addressing the ripple effect of attacks on schools and teachers officials in the afghan government and international agencies working on education in afghanistan by and large turn to international security forces for response as we set out below these forces have failed to provide the necessary security environment nationbuilding on the cheap the usled coalition isaf and provincial reconstruction teams prts for the past four years when the international community has discussed security in afghanistan it has generally missed the mark by focusing on whether and how many or how few troops international donors had contributed and how many men the afghan national army and national police could field instead of as king whether ordinary afghans were secure and feeling secure the debate among security officials centered around the size and combat ability of the combined forces the international community led by the united states simply failed to provide afghanistan with the political economic or security assist ance commensurate with the nations needs after the fall of the taliban 424 march 2004 evaluation of the peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan 422 advisory services and technical cooper

appraisal whatever assessment criteria one useswhether it is compliance with the terms of the bonn agreement or broader international standards there have been significant shortcomings in international efforts to consolidate peace there has been major mismatch between the ambitions of the international community and their willingne ss to commit the requisite military political and financial resources it has been bargain basement model this is an attempt to rebuild collapsed state according to favourable model but with minimal resources 425 security assistance to afghanistan has consistently lagged far below that of recent postconflict situations such as east timor the balkans and of course iraq security assistance to afghanistan has also consistently lagged behind the obvious and tangible needs of the country for instance by mid2002 when afghan and interna tional observers loudly and clearly issued warnings about growing insecurity and criminality the united states fielded only about 10000 troops concentrated on the southern bord er while nato countries fielded about 4000 troops stationed only in kabul 426 halfway through 2002 us interest and resources were increasingly channeled to iraq 427 the often heated debate between the united states and its allies over the iraq war also affected peacekeeping in afghanistan as some allies signaled their dissatisfaction by withholding assistance even in afghanistan while others sought to indicate their broader support for the united states by committing to helping the united states in afghanistan but not in iraq as explained eloquently by ahmad rashid one of the most experienced observers of afghanistan how is it then that afghanistan is near collapse once again to put it briefly what has gone wrong has been the invasion of iraq washingtons refusal to take statebuilding in afghanistan seriously and instead waging fruitless war in iraq for afghanistan the results have been too few western troops too little money and lack of coherent strategy and sustained policy initiatives on the part of western and afghan leaders the bonn conference created the scaffolding to build the new afghan

running water inside the scaffolding there is still only the barest shell428 the chief indicator of the international communitys confused security strategy in afghanistan was the fact that since the fall of the taliban afghanistan has had two separate foreign troop contingents with two different missions first that of the united states and members of its coalition and second the natosupplied mandated international security assistance force or isaf the usled coalition under the official name of combined forced commandafghanistan or cfca has maintained force between 16000 and 23000 in afghanistan compared with the 140000 to 180000 posted in iraq country of comparable size and population but incomparably easier terrain the us forces remain focused on carrying out the united states strategic interests by fighting against qaeda and allied taliban forces in southern and southeastern afghanistan this force did not have as its mission the protection of afghans or of humanitarian aid providers except to the extent that such actions pacified or mollified local populations and as pointed out above the united states opposed the deployment of peacekeeping troops in afghanistan until 2003 international security assistance force isaf did have as its primary mission providing security but the united states putative allies quick to wag finger in disapproval of the perceived failure of the united states to embrace peacekeeping lacked the will and the capacity to provide effective security assistance to afghanistan afghan political leaders ngos experts and even lakhdar brahimi the special representative of the united nations secretary general and head of operations in afghanistan failed in their repeated calls on the security council to expand the geographic coverage and mandate of the isaf afghans repeatedly told human rights watch that they we re amused offended and bewildered by the spectacle of the secretary general of nato traveling from one capital to another hat in hand as the secretary general put it to beg for the logistical support necessary to allow nato to begin its expansion 429 the shortchanging of security in afghanistan has continued to date in 2005 the united states declared that it would withdraw 25003000 of its relatively modest contingent nato began moving into southern afghanistan in late 2005 as canadian force took over security responsibilities in kandahar du tch force moved into oruzgan and fairly large british force numbering about 3300 was dispatched to helmand the hotbed of narcotics trade and opposition activity but

many afghans up to and including president karza i to worry about the international communitys commitment to afghanistans security at precisely the moment when the threat posed by opposition groups and criminals was soaring 430 predictably those opposed to the central government were heartened by the indications and have stepped up their campaign of words and attacks in order to intimidate afghans into following their will the provincial reconstruction teams unwilling or unable to provide sufficient military and economic resources for afghanistan and facing deteriorating security and slowing reconstruction in afghanistan the united states and nato have offered the provincial reconstruction teams prts as the answer the prts have not been incorporated into any coherent nationwide development strategy by the afghan government until very recently and still lack an effective coordination mechanism with international donors it is impossible to thoroughly assess the conduct of the prts because there exists public nationwide systematic monitoring of prts their projects and the funding they receive 431 the major publicly available analyses carried out by governmental or academic institutions of donor countries have criticized the current prt strategy as being incoherent and lacking sufficient resources 432 as result these commentators have generally called on the united states and nato to refocus their efforts on providing security and governance 433 the united states unveiled the concept of prts in late 2002 the prts were initially formed as result of the united states refusal to either commit sufficient troops for more traditional peacekeeping mission or to allow other countries to create unmandated peacekeeping mission the prts are small military units ranging in size from 80 to over 300 incorporating small contingent of civilians with development or diplomatic background with mandate to carry out development and humanitarian projects in hearts and

writing the united states and coalition partners maintained fourteen prts while nato countries had established nine under isaf command 437 the prts faced skeptical and at times hostile reception from development aid workers who doubted whether they could effectively provide security assistance and worried that the militarization of aid would jeopardize civilian aid projects and increase the risk

provide assistance to civilian population during conflict it is not for humanitarian purposes but rather to further policies of their national governments provide force protection and meet their international legal obligations redundant assessments conducted by military personnel inadequate coordination with civilian assistance providers leading to duplication of effort and disregard for the longterm capacity of the local population to sustain their projects ar among the most frequently voiced criticisms of military prt assistance projects 443 notwithstanding such criticism most aid organizations operating in afghanistan have had to accept the existence of the prts in part because of recognition that there are areas of afghanistan where civilian humanitarian groups simply cannot operate due to insecurity 444 and in part because of recognition that for now at least the prts are the best that the international community is willing to offer the people of afghanistan 445 nevertheless communications with nongovernmental organizations have been and remain spotty and hampered by mutual suspicion an d incomprehension by both sides446 however human rights watch heard consistent criticism about the failure of prts in southern and southeastern afghanistan to provide durable useful reconstruction as one longterm western observer in ghazni told us the prts build schools but there is follow up to see if there is teacher there year later 447 at this point it is incontrovertible that prts have been unable to materially improve either afghanistans security situation or meet its development needs particularly in the southa fact admitted by the us government 448 the prts can be useful tool for providing security and maybe even limited reconstruction in

providing the necessary security so that studentsgirls and boysand their teachers can safely and securely attend schooland that there is school to attend attacks by the taliban and other groups on students teachers and schools are not just criminal offenses they are human rights abuses that infringe upon the right to freedom of education when committed as part of the ongoing armed conflict in afghanistan these attacks are serious violations of international humanitarian law which are war crimes as are acts and threats of violence with the primary purpose spreading terror among the civilian

of the child and the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women cedaw of which afghanistan has ratified 452 recognizing that different states have different levels of resources the right to education is considered progressive right by becoming party to the international agreements state agrees to take steps to the maximum of its available resources to the full realization of the right to education 453 accordingly international law does not mandate exactly what kind of education must be provided beyond certain m inimum standards primary education must be compulsory and available free to all and secondary education must be available and accessible to every child454 although the right to education is right of progressive implementation the prohibition on discrimination is not the committee on economic social and cultural rights the international body that interprets the icescr has stated the prohibition against discrimination enshrined in article 22

advice on family planning 459 international humanitarian law and attacks on schools threats intimidation and violent attacks on students teachers and the school buildings themselves are criminal offenses in violation of the laws of afghanistan they are also human rights abuses that undermine the right to education under international human rights law and when these attacks are committed as part of the ongoing internal armed conflict in afghanistan between armed opposition groups including the taliban and gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbe islami and afghan security forces and foreign armed forces particularly the usled combined forces command afghanistan cfca international humanitarian law applies international humanitarian lawalso known as the laws of waris the set of rules governing the conduct of parties to international and internal armed conflicts because the current conflict in afghanistan is not between two governments but between government and opposition armed groups it is considered an internal armed conflict the participation of foreign forces on behalf of the afghan government means that it is an internationalized internal armed conflict applicable law can be found in article 3 common to the four geneva conventions of 1949 and customary international humanitarian law afghanistan is not party to the protocol additional of 1977 to the 1949 geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of noninternational armed conflicts protocol ii but most of its provisions are considered reflective of customary international law international humanitarian law is binding on states and nonstate belligerents such as the taliban and the hezbee islami international humanitarian law requires parties to an armed conflict to respect civilians and other persons longer taking part in hostilities the law forbids at all times attacks directed at civilians or civilian objects operations may only be directed against military objectives 460 schools are protected as civilian objects unless being used by the enemys armed forces461 students teachers and school administrators fall under the protection granted to civilians as long as they are not taking direct part in hostilities462 459 ibid 460 see international committee of the red cross customary international humanitarian law cambridge cambridge univ press 2005 chapters 1 and 2 citing for example protocol additional to the g eneva conventions of 12 august 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of noninter national armed conflicts protocol ii adopted june 8 1977 and entered into force december 7 1978 art 13 461 ibid rules 7 and 9 citing various treaties and other evidence of state practice article 513 of protocol i states that in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedica ted to civilian purposes such as place of worship human rights watch vol 18 6c 116 international humanitarian law also forbids acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population463 thus the threat of attacks such as those made through night letters with the intent of keeping students and teachers away from school out of fear of violence also violates the protection provided civilians the convention on the rights of the child also requires states to take all feasible measures to ensure protection and care of children w ho are affected by an armed conflict 464 this is reflected in international humanitarian law which provides that children are entitled to special respect and attention 465 one of the fundamental guarantees in protocol ii is that children shall be provided with the care and aid they require and in particular they shall receive an education including religious and moral education in keeping with the wishes of their parents or in the absence of parents of those responsible for their care 466 afghanistan ratified the statute of the international criminal court in 2003 although afghanistan retains primary responsibility and duty to prosecute individuals for war crimes if it is unwilling or unable to do so the international criminal court is empowered to exercise its jurisdiction over the most serious crimes of international concern under the statute war crimes during an internal armed conflict include attacks intentionally directed against the civilian population and against civilian objects including buildings dedicated to education provided they are not military objectives 467 afghanistan has yet to adopt implementing legislation that would put the provisions of the rome statute into effect in domestic legislation but by ratifying the statute is obligated to do so house or other dwelling or school is being used to make an effective contribution to military action it shall be presumed not to be so used 462 ibid rules 1 5 and 6 citing protocol ii art 133 463 ibid rule 2 citing protocol ii articl 132 and 42d the secretar ygeneral has noted that violations of article 4

and ratified by afghanistan february 10 2003 art 82eiv human rights watch vol 18 6c 117 vii recommendations human rights watch urges that access to educ ation be used as key benchmark to measure the success of afghan and international efforts to bring security to afghanistan we suggest this benchmark for three reasons on political level because teachers and schools are typically the most basic level of government and the most common point of interaction between ordinary afghans and their government and its foreign supporters on practical level because this benchmark lends itself to diagnostic nationally comparable data analysis the number of operational schools the number of students the enrollment of girls focused on outcomes instead of the number of troops or vague references to providing security and on policy level because providing education to new generation of afghans is essential to the countrys longterm development using this benchmark and placing the wellbeing of the afghan people at the center of the security policy in afghanistan will help implement policies that respond to and strengthen the inextricable link between development and security recommendations to the taliban hezb islami and other armed groups immediately stop all attacks on civilians and civilian objects including teachers students and their schools cease all threats against teachers and students such as through the use of night letters publicly declare an end to such attacks and threats provide and facilitate safe rapid and unimpeded access to impartial humanitarian assistance to civilians in need recommendations regarding the im pact of insecurity on education notwithstanding the responsibility of those groups attacking teachers students and schools it is the duty of the government of afghanistan and its international supporters to ensure that afghans receive an adequate and nondiscriminatory education the government of afghanistan and the coordinating body of the afghanistan compact should make access to education benchmark for measuring compliance human rights watch vol 18 6c 118with the compact which sets out security as one of the three pillars of activity for the next five years the government with the assistance of the international community should devise and implement strategy to monitor prevent and respond to attacks on education an effective strategy will require coordinated action by diverse institutions and to this end the government should craft process that involves all relevant institutions from the start including the presidents office the ministries of interior justice womens affairs the afghan national army th afghan national police the afghan independent human rights commission unama unicef undp unifem isaf and the combined forces command afghanistan cfca the strategy should include the following elements monitoring attacks the ministry of education and international agencies responsible for education should cooperate to create national database with accurate uptodate information collected from provincial education offices bodies ngos prts donor agencies and other sources about attacks on educational staff and facilities the status of schools school attendance and the longterm impact of attacks on education monitoring should pay special attention to attacks on girls schools and the effects of attacks on girls education unama and relevant agencies including unicef and the wfp should share information with each other about attacks on schools the government including the afghan independent human rights commission and donors should continue to follow and denounce attacks that undermine the right to education prevention using information gained from monitoring the government and international donors should identify schools at greatest risk of attack and ensure that they receive resources and protection accordingly this should also involve identifying list of risk factors such as night letters being circulated and school being the only sign of government in the area and monitoring for these factors communicating with parents and students more accurate information about security threats so that they are not forced to rely on rumor and incomplete information the government and donors should identify and implement measures that make education safer for students and teachers these could include providing transport to school enhancing security of routes children and teachers use to human rights watch vol 18 6c 119get to schools constructing secure buildings and school walls and providing appropriately trained school guards the government and international donors should work with local communities to mobilize and support community protection efforts these could draw on measures already taken by some communities such as rotating volunteer night watchmen placing monitors along roads at times children go to and from schools and seeking commitments from community leaders to support and protect education provincial and district department of education should work with ngo educational providers to create local contingency plans for addressing threats to schools in medium and high risk districts information about these plans should be provided to teachers and families with schoolage children the afghan national army and the afghan national police should prioritize the protection of educationa l facilities and staff while ensuring that school security remains the responsibility of civilian authorities responding to attacks the ministries of interior and justice and other relevant afghan security services should work closely with the ministry of education ngos and the international community to better respond to cases of attacks threats and intimidation against teachers students and schools this should include full investigations and the prosecution of perpetrators in accordance with international standards the ministry of interior should investigate all those implicated in such attacks including local military authorities civilian officials and those associated with them and powerful individuals and groups with connections to officials who may be involved in attacks and threats in some provinces the afghan government should enact legislation implementing the rome statute of the international criminal court icc to render war crimes including attacks intentionally directed against buildings dedicated to education violations of afghan law the ministry of education and its international funders should establish an emergency fund to immediately rebuild damaged schools and to work with local communities that have been subject to attack to increase security and boost the confidence of parents and commu nity leaders to send children to school unicef should continue its policy of providing tents to destroyed schools and improve its capacity for rapid response which will require improved monitoring of attacks provincial and district departments of education should work with ngo educational providers to minimize interruptions to the educational process human rights watch vol 18 6c 120following an attack such as reopening schools quickly and finding alternative venues in order to focus on providing development more broadly to insecure areas including the south and southeast and to better coordinate development plans for these areas international donors the afghan government the united nations and nongovernmental organizations should consider holding regular meetings to discuss these goals and come up with plan and timetable to reach them recommendations regard ing education generally education in afghanistan remains almost entirely dependent on foreign assistance the overall amount of foreign assistance to afghanistan has been far less than that disbursed in several recent postconflict areas and far less than afghanistan needs according to the world bank and the afghan government international donors should increase support for construction schools and establishing other acceptable learning spaces and for programs geared toward improving the quality of education including teacher training with the goal of providing girls and boys with equal access to schools basic information about the educational system in afghanistan remains highly inadequate such information is vital for creating effective education policies generally and for crafting responses to attacks on the educational system the recent emis data are an important first step the ministry of education should disaggregate this information by sex and region and it should at minimum include numbers locations and condition of infrastructure of schools and other learning spaces whether they are in practice for girls or boys or are coed and whether there is other government infrastructure in the community all areas where girls and boys or girls alone have access to education and areas where girls have access to secondary education childrens school attendance and dropout rates as compared with enrollment numbers and locations of teachers especially female teachers measure progress on education in afghanistan on national provincial and district basis and not on national level numbers alone recommendations regarding improving girls and womens access to education the ministry of education in coordination with the ministry of interior the ministry of womens affairs the president and their international partners should better address girls problems in attending school this will require leadership and political will at the highest levels and accountability at the provincial and district levels human rights watch vol 18 6c 121 the ministry of education should make equal access for girls and women priority at all educational levelsnot only at the primary level among other things it should condition the creation of new schools on equal access for girls in each area where girls and boys are offered different forms of education such as in madrassas and homebased schools the ministry should ensure that girls and boys have equal access to formal education credentials become more public advocate for education especially for girls require teachers and administrators as well as other government officials to educate their own children regardless of gender as condition of employment the government with the international communitys support should continue and enhance efforts to increase girls attendance at all educational levels including prioritizing work in communities with low or zero girls participation in education implementing programs targeted at increasing girls attendance such as wfps food incentives program which provides basic foodstuffs to families who send their daughters to school and initiating public awareness campaign on the economic social and public health benefits that accrue from girls education the ministry of education should do more to increase the number of female teachers especially in rural areas for example it should consider developing more flexible programs to accredit women teachers including those trained outside of the country it should address limits in womens access to teacher training programs for example by providing where possible safe residences at teacher training institutes the ministry of education should work with local communities to overcome local barriers that prevent children and girls in particular from attending school for example the ministry should identify whether schools are available safe and acceptable to local cultural sensitivities whether routes are safe whether transportation is available and whether individuals in the community are blocking girls access the ministry should hold provincial and district officials accountable for improving access for all children in their districts and provinces and reward those who do the ministry of education should drastically increase the representation of women in the ministry at the national provincial and district levels president karzai should remove any appointed leaders who oppose girls education including governors police chiefs cabinet ministers and education officials the council of ulema the highest religious authority in afghanistan should publicly state that it supports girls education at all levels the ministry of education should widely publicize and enforce the 2004 presidential decree lifting the prohibition against married girls and women attending school human rights watch vol 18 6c 122 the afghan government should make greater efforts to discourage underage marriage which results in many girls being withdrawn from school efforts should include publicizing laws on the minimum age of marriage the government of afghanistan should ratify the convention against discrimination in education which sets criteria and standards for girls and womens right to nondiscriminatory education the special rapporteur on education who expressed concern about the systemic targeting of schools on april 16 2006 should visit afghanistan and raise with international actors and the afghan government concerns about the continued gap between girls and boys access to education problems created by insecurity and their disproportionate impact on girls recommendations regarding internat ional military peacekeeping and reconstruction operations in afghanistan isaf contributing states to the usled coalition and unama should assess whether current force configurations are sufficient to provide security to the civilian population as set out in the first pillar of the afghanistan compact isaf and the usled coalition should measure security not by numbers of troops or the presence of armed groups but rather by the security needs of ordinary people whether conditions are sufficiently secure for people to conduct their lives measurements could include the number of operational schools and clinics open roads and distances that are safe to travel all prts should improve nationallevel coordination among themselves and with afghan authorities the united nations and local communities prts should improve communication with national and international ngos this coordination as well as work with local communities will be especially important to ensure that prts take all possible action to improve security for students teachers and schools all prts should establish transparent benchmarks that include access to education for evaluating security in their areas of operation countries contributing troops and staff to pr ts should ensure that their mandates and rules of engagement specifically include protection of the civilian population the high commissioner for human rights should substantially increase its human rights monitoring presence around the country to act as deterrent and expand the information gathered on abuses the united nations should hire sufficient human rights monitoring and protection staff to reliably cover all areas of afghanistan as well as address specific concerns such as abuses against women and minority groups the current number of monitors outside the capital sixteen positions some vacant is insufficient unama should press for responses from regional leaders regarding human rights watch vol 18 6c 123human rights abuses and should regularly publicize its findings and recommendations for appropriate government action acknowledgments zama coursenneff senior researcher in the childrens rights division of human rights watch and

watch vol 18 6c 124 human rights watch vol 18 6c 125 chart attacks on teachers student s and schools in afghanistan human rights watch collected reports of 204 attacks including attempts on schools teachers and students from january 2005 to june 21 2006 of these attacks 110 occurred in the first half of 2006 the pattern of these reports indicates sharp rise in the targeting of afghanistans education process in late 2005 and in 2006 as shown by the graphs in the summary of this report while southern and southeastern provinces generally experienced more attacks northern provinces were not exempt indeed attacks were reported in twentyeight of afghanistans thirtyfour provinces methods each school attacked has been counted as separate incident however where multiple people were injured or killed in the same place at the same time we have chosen to count this as one incident we have also made every effort to avoid recording single incident more than once based on reports from multiple sources however conflicting reports of the same incident make it possible that single incident is recorded more than once these numbers should be understood as an approximation at best of the total number of attacks many attacks are likely never reported the circu mstances surrounding attacks in many parts of the country are impossible for humanitarian and human rights workers journalists and government officials to verify in person precisely because insecurity prevents them from going there what is included in the chart the following chart lists reported accounts of attacks and attempted attacks on teachers students and schools from january 2005 to june 21 2006 the chart draws on four sources anso weekly security situation summaries data from sources from september 2005 to early may 2005 these sources do not include information from unicef which has chosen not to make their information public press reports and human rights watchs own interviews included in the chart are instances in which it is not clear that schools were intentionally targeted for example rocket attacks that hit schools as well as other buildings attacks on homes of government officials where school was being held and attacks on schools used as polling centers around the time of the parliamentary elections what is not included in the chart where human rights watch obtained information that cast doubt on initial reports we have excluded these incidents from the chart for example it was reported that unknown armed human rights watch vol 18 6c 126men fired seven rocketpropelled grenades at girls school in tagab kapisa on april 9 2006 but when human rights watch visited the site we found that the newlybuilt school was being used as police post the district police chief explained the newspapers got the story wrong about the school attack here in tagab yes girls was attacked by seven rockets but it was because we the police are using at base not because girls are going to school girls were going to the school because would let them we the police dont have enough resources and that school was good building so we decided to use it 468 accordingly this incident was not included the chart also does not include threats alone against schools these are both too numerous to count and too often not reported 468 human rights watch interview with abdul halim khan taga b district police chief tagab
