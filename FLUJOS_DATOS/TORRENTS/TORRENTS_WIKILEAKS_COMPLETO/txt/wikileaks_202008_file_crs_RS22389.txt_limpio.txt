to the design of the lowincome housing tax credit mark p keightley analyst in public finance government and finance division summary the lowincome housing tax credit lihtc is federal provision that reduces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22389 the income tax liability of taxpayers claiming the credit these taxpayers are typically investors in real estate development projects that have traded cash for the tax credits to support the production of affordable housing the credit is intended to lower the financing costs of housing developments so that the rental prices of units can be lower than market rates and thus presumably affordable the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hera pl 110289 includes number of provisions that make temporary or permanent changes to the lihtc program for example hera increases the effective lihtc rate applied to new construction completed prior to 2014 and increases the lihtc allocation to states from 200 per capita to 220 per capita through 2009 the act also gives state housing credit agencies the authority to designate certain buildings as qualified for the enhanced lihtc clarifies the circumstances under which building is to be considered federally subsidized and expands the size of the community common areas that may be included in the eligible basis the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa pl 110343 includes temporary change to the lihtc with the intent of assisting victims of hurricane ike and the severe weather and flooding in the midwest specifically eesa allows certain states to allocate additional credits to affected areas for the years 2009 2010 and 2011 for states located in the midwestern disaster area the additional allocation is equal to 800 multiplied by the states disaster area population for the two states most directly affected by hurricane ike texas and louisiana the additional allocation is equal to 1600 multiplied by the states population residing in affected countiesparishes this report will be updated as warranted by legislative changes crs2 overview the lihtc was created by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 to provide an incentive for the acquisition excluding land and development or the rehabilitation of affordable rental housing these federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects sponsors or developers of real estate projects apply to the corresponding state housing finance authority for lihtc allocations for their projects developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital or equity for real estate projects the tax benefit reduces the debt andor equity that the developer would otherwise have to incur with lower financing costs tax credit properties can potentially offer lower more affordable rents the lihtc was originally designed to deliver 10year subsidy equal to 30 or 70 of projects cost dependent on the nature of project rehabilitation and federally subsidized construction is intended to receive the 30 subsidy whereas new construction is supposed to receive the 70 subsidy over time the annual credit rate that has delivered the 30 rehabilitation construction subsidy has approximately equaled 4 of the projects qualified basis although the rate has fallen as low as 3331 at the same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22389 time the annual credit rate implied by the 70 new construction subsidy has approximately equaled 9 with range of 789 to 9272 the method used to determine the actual credit rate project receives depends in part on the prevailing market interest rate at the time the project is completed because the market interest rate changes monthly so do the lihtc rates3 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hera pl 110289 changed the method used to determine the credit rate for new construction projects completed before 2014 under the new law the credit rate assigned to new construction will not be less than 9 if the interest rate that prevails at the time project is completed is such that the credit rate as determined under the previous method is greater than 9 then the project will receive the higher rate on the other hand if the market interest rate is such that the lihtc rate is less than 9 then the project will be assigned credit rate of exactly 9 hera made changes to the credit rate that rehabilitation and federally subsidized construction projects receive the allocation process the process of allocating awarding and then claiming the lihtc is complex and lengthy the process begins at the federal level with each state

the fixed subsidy and variable rate by mark p keightley crs3 lihtc allocation in accordance with federal law state housing agencies than allocate credits to developers of rental housing according to federally required but state created allocation plans the process typically ends with developers exchanging allocated credits for equity with outside investors more detailed discussion of each level of the allocation process is presented below federal allocation to states lihtcs are first allocated to each state according to its population and are typically administered by each states housing finance agency hfa for example hfas originally received annual tax credits equal to 2 per person in 2008 with minimum small population state allocation of 23250004 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 temporarily increases the per capita state allocation by 020 for the years 2008 and 2009 and the minimum small population state allocation by 10 the state allocation limits do not apply in the case of development projects that are financed with taxexempt bond proceeds5 tax credits that are not allocated by states are added to national pool and then redistributed to those states that apply for the excess credits to be eligible for an excess credit allocation state must have allocated its entire previous allotment of tax credits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22389 state allocation to developers state housing finance agencies hfas allocate credits to developers of rental housing according to federally required but state created qualified allocation plans qaps federal law requires that the qap give priority to projects that serve the lowest income households and that remain affordable for the longest period of time many states have two allocation periods per year developers apply for the credits by proposing plans to state agencies on average one project out of five may receive an allocation of tax credits developers of housing projects compete for tax credits as part of the financing for the real estate development by submitting proposals to the hfa types of developers include nonprofit organizations forprofit organizations joint ventures partnerships limited partnerships trusts corporations and limited liability corporations in order to be eligible for the lihtc properties are required to meet certain tests that restrict both the amount of rent that is assessed to tenants and the income of eligible tenants the income test for qualified lowincome housing project requires that the project owner irrevocably elect one of two income level tests either 2050 test or 40 60 test in order to satisfy the first test at least 20 of the units must be occupied by individuals with income of 50 or less of the areas median gross income adjusted for family size to satisfy the second test at least 40 of the units must be occupied by individuals with income of 60 or less of the areas median gross income adjusted for 4 from 1986 through 2000 the initial credit allocation amount was 125 per capita the allocation was increased to 150 in 2001 to 175 in 2002 and 2003 and indexed for inflation annually thereafter the initial minimum tax credit ceiling for small states was 2000000 and was indexed for inflation annually after 2003 5 taxexempt bonds are issued subject to private activity bond volume limit per state for more information see crs report rl31457 private activity bonds an introduction by steven maguire crs4 family size6 qualified lowincome housing project must also meet the gross rents test by ensuring rents do not exceed 30 of the elected 50 or 60 of area median gross income depending on which income test the project elected7 the types of projects eligible for the lihtc are apartment buildings single family dwellings duplexes or townhouses projects may include more than one building tax credit project types also vary by the type of tenants served housing can be for families andor special needs populations including the elderly enhanced lihtcs are available for difficult development areas ddas and qualified census tracts qcts as an incentive to developers to invest in more distressed areas areas where the need is greatest for affordable housing but which can be the most difficult to develop8 in these distressed areas the lihtc can be claimed for 130 instead of the normal 100 of the projects total cost excluding land costs this also means that available credits can be increased by up to 30 pl 110289 allows an hfa to classify any building it sees fit as difficult to develop and hence eligible for the enhanced credit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22389 developers and investors upon receipt of lihtc allocation developers typically exchange the tax credits for equity forprofit developers can either retain tax credits as financing for projects or sell them nonprofit developers sell tax credits taxpayers claiming the tax credits are usually real estate investors not developers the tax credits cannot be claimed until the real estate development is complete and operable this means that more than year or two could pass between the time of the tax credit allocation and the time the credit is claimed if for example project were completed in june of 2008 depending on the filing period of the investor the tax credits may not begin to be claimed until some time in 2009 trading tax credits or selling them refers to the process of exchanging tax credits for equity investment in real estate projects developers recruit investors to provide equity to fund development projects and offer the tax credits to those investors in exchange for their commitment when credits are sold the sale is usually structured with limited partnership between the developer and the investor and sometimes administered by syndicators who must adhere to the complex provisions of the tax code9 as the general partner the developer has very small ownership percentage but maintains the authority to build and run the project on daytoday basis the investor as limited partner has large ownership percentage with an otherwise passive role 6 us department of treasury internal revenue service internal revenue code section 42g1 7 us department of housing and urban development office of policy development and research updating the lowincome housing tax credit lihtc database projects placed in service through 2003 washington january 2006 p 1 8 internal revenue code section 42d5c 9 syndicators are intermediaries who exist almost exclusively to administer tax credit deals in the early years of the lihtc syndicators were more prevalent in later years as the number of corporate investors in the lihtc grew and interacted directly with developers the role of syndicators diminished crs5 typically the investor does not expect the project to produce income instead investors look to the credits which will be used to offset their income tax liabilities as their return on investment the investor can also receive tax benefits related to any tax losses generated through the projects operating costs interest on its debt and deductions such as depreciation and amortization the type of tax credit investor has changed over the life of the lihtc upon the introduction of the lihtc in 1986 public partnerships were the primary source of equity investment in tax credit projects but diminished profit margins have driven some syndicators out of the retail investment market although there are individual tax credit investors in recent years the vast majority of investors have come from corporations either investing directly or through private partnerships10 neither individuals nor corporations can claim the lihtc against the alternative minimum tax different types of investors have different motivations for investing in tax credits an estimated 43 of investors are subject to the community reinvestment act cra and investment in lihtcs is favorably considered under the investment test component of the cra11 other investors include real estate insurance utility and manufacturing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22389 firms many of which list the rate of return on investment as their primary purpose for investing in tax credits tax sheltering is the secondmost highly ranked purpose for investing12 the lihtc finances part of the total cost of many projects rather than the full cost and as result must be combined with other resources the financial resources that may be used in conjunction with the lihtc include conventional mortgage loans provided by private lenders and alternative financing and grants from public or private sources individual states provide financing as well some of which may be in the form of state tax credits modeled after the federal provision additionally some lihtc projects may have tenants who receive other government subsidies such as housing vouchers legislative developments the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hera pl 110289 includes number of provisions that made temporary or permanent changes to the lihtc program13 as discussed earlier in this report hera guarantees that the lihtc rate applied to nonfederally subsidized new buildings completed prior to 2014 will not be less than 9 the act also increases the lihtc allocation to states from 200 per capita to 10 housingfinancecom corporate investment and the future of tax credits
