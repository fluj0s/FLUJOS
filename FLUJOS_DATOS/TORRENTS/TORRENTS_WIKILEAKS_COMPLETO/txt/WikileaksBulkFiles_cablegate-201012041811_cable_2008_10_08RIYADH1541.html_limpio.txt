zardari echoing pakistani interlocutors in washington and islamabad in an introductory call with polcouns pakistani dcm sarfraz khanzada protect characterized saudipakistani relations as under strain this was due he said to lack of saudi confidence in the zardari government he cited sharp reduction in saudi financial assistance to pakistan and said that the saudis had not provided single drop of oil at the concessionary terms promised last year refs c d instead during 2008 the saudis had provided assistance in the form of single 300 million check considerably less than in previous years but beggars cant be choosers he lamented khanzada opined that the saudi government appeared to be waiting for the zardari government to fall 2 c nawas favored khanzada said the pakistanis are convinced that saudi king abdallah would prefer to see pakistan run by former pm nawas sharif and were cutting back assistance to pakistan to hasten this eventuality nawas practically lives in saudi arabia khanzada declared claiming that nawas had even been favored with reserved prayer space in the prophets mosque in medina because nawas daughter is married to grandson of king fahd he has become member of the saudi royal family comment embassy is not able to confirm whether this is true end comment 3 c afghan mediation khanzada claimed that the pakistani government was not directly informed about the saudi afghan mediation effort though they suspected that nawas had been present since he was in mecca at the same time while the pakistani government did not oppose such talks in principle they believe they have little chance of succeeding without us and pakistani participation 4 c comment khanzadas remarks track with reporting from islamabad and washington regarding pakistani concerns about deteriorating relations with the saudis while our saudi interlocutors tend to be less forthcoming theyve made secret of their reservations regarding asif zardari nevertheless officials continue to insist that saudi arabia supports efforts to stabilize pakistan and we expect that saudi officials will participate in the next round of meetings of the friends of pakistan end comment rundell
