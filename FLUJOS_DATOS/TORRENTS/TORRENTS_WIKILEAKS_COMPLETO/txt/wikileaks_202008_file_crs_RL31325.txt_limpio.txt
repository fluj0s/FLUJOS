educational agencies to establish and improve programs for children of migratory farmworkers and fishers the esea and mep were reauthorized by the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 signed into law january 8 2002 this report describes the legislative and funding history of the program highlighting important changes made since it was established section on evaluations of the program is included at the end of the report since 1966 the mep has sought to help migrant children overcome the many problems associated with multiple moves these problems include educational disruption social barriers limited english proficiency various health problems and other factors that keep migrant children from performing well in school mep provides grants to state educational agencies to develop or improve education programs for migrant students most migrant programs are administered by local educational agencies and operate during the summer as well as in the regular school year the mep has been subject to incremental amendments over the years the main changes that have occurred concern student eligibility criteria and records transfer the former change has resulted in expansion of the population served while the latter has simply attempted to keep track of these elusive students the funding formula for the mep has remained largely unchanged over time however it received some modification by the most recent amendments most notably these amendments require significant shift in the source of enrollment data on which the formula is based contents introduction 1 program

behind act of 2001 introduction the educational challenges posed by the disruptions and interruptions associated with repeated and seasonal migration have long been recognized since the 1940s children of migrant workers in agricultural and other sectors of the economy have received help meeting these challenges at first this help came from statesponsored programs and later from the federal government the migrant education program mep was established as part of the 1966 amendments pl 89750 to the elementary and secondary education act esea to help alleviate the problems faced by this mobile student population1 in its first year of existence fy1967 the federal mep had an appropriation of 97 million and provided grants to 44 states which served approximately 169910 students for fy2006 the program was appropriated 387 million and will award grants to all 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico total of 737700 fulltime equivalent fte students were served by the program in fy20042 this report describes the legislative and funding history of the program highlighting important changes made since it was established section on evaluations of the program is

students and especially those who are failing or at greatest risk of failing to meet state performance standards to be eligible for program funding children must have moved from one school district to another from one administrative area to another within state having single district or if living in school district of at least 15000 square miles the child must travel at least 20 miles from their usual residence for purposes of gaining employment for themselves or their parentsguardians population served most of the students served in the early years of the programs existence were usborn african americans or nonhispanic whites however recent study revealed that most 89 of students currently served are hispanic and increasingly foreignborn 3 the study also found that the number of limited english proficiency lep participants has risen in recent years growing from 22 of mep participants in 19981999 to 31 in 20002001 the study also found that mep services are concentrated at the elementary grade level 43 of mep participants were served in elementary grades 16 30 in secondary grades 712 19 in preschool programs and the remaining 8 in ungraded or outofschool programs to put these proportions in the proper context one must also keep in mind that more than half of the migrant student population does not complete high school4 ed data also reveal that migrant students are more likely than other children of school age to come from families with low levels of education households with incomes below the poverty level and to experience health problems including nutritional diseases and respiratory infections another ed study reports that the majority of migrant students receiving services through the mep were concentrated in five sending states california florida michigan texas and washington5 migrant families typically travel in three patterns of migration also known as migrant streams these migrant streams include 1 texas and north through the central plains region 2 california to the northwest and western states and 3 florida and north along the east coast legislative history the mep has been subject to incremental amendments over its 35year existence

the latter has simply attempted to keep track of these elusive students the funding formula for the mep has remained largely unchanged over time however it received significant modification in the most recent reauthorization student eligibility criteria the major revisions to mep eligibility criteria have been the inclusion of additional migratory worker occupational groups wider age groups and broader geographic areas consideration of migratory students themselves as workers and restriction of the number of years of eligibility initially the mep was designed to serve the children of migratory agricultural workers the children of migratory fishers were added to the program in 19746 and children of agricultural dairy workers were added in 19887 the amendments of 1988 also expanded the eligible age range from the 5 to 17 group as defined in the initial legislation to persons between 3 and 21 the 1966 provisions required that students cross school district boundaries to be classified as migratory the 1988 amendments expanded this criterion to include 1 moving from one administrative area to another within state having single school district applicable to hawaii and puerto rico and 2 living in school district of at least 15000 square miles and migrating at least 20 miles to temporary residence to engage in fishing activity applicable to alaska finally the 1988 amendments established the national commission on migrant education to study issues related to the education of migrant children8 in response to the commissions report the amendments of 1994 made two important changes to the mep9 first the definition of migratory child was extended to include unaccompanied minors who are themselves migrant workers or who are married to migrant worker as well as those under the legal guardianship of migrant worker second eligibility was restricted to those moving in the last three years where previously it was five years student records transfer to enumerate migrant students and move records between schools congress established the migrant student records transfer system msrts through the education amendments of 1974 prior to that time data from the department of labor were used to determine the number of eligible migratory children for purposes of calculating state allocations the 1994 amendments eliminated the use of the msrts because of its high cost and alleged ineffectiveness 6 education amendments of 1974 pl 93380 7 hawkinsstafford amendments of 1988 pl 100297 8 the results of this study are discussed in detail in the final section of this report national commission on migrant education invisible children portrait of migrant education in the united states washington 1992 9 improving americas schools act of 1994 p l 103382 crs4 the 1994 amendments also charged the ed with developing new system for counting and keeping track of migrant students to this end the migrant school locator demonstration project was established and pointed to the feasibility of using the internet to count migrant students and locate student information10 compared to the msrts the locator project simply coordinates operations run at the state level this decentralized approach does not send actual educational records from one school system to another rather it helps seas and leas verify the correct student and contact information for the school in which the student had been previously enrolled by the 19971998 school year eight states were participating in the project further the 1994 amendments provided funds for improving this type of inter and intrastate coordination among educational agencies and ensuring the linkage of migrant student records systems across agencies the ed awarded discretionary grants to seas leas institutions of higher education and other public and private nonprofit entities to support such agency coordination in the child left behind act of 2001 nclba up to 10 million can be reserved for these and other coordination activities11 funding formula the nclba also modified the funding formula for the first time in many years since the programs inception the formula has been based on the product of each states share of migratory students and fraction of its perpupil expenditure ppe12 however good estimates of migratory student enrollment have been difficult to obtain thus even though the msrts was eliminated in 1994 current counts of migratory students partially rely on that years enrollment estimates the nclba amendments are intended to modify this practice after the fy2002 allocations each state is entitled to an amount equal to the number of migrant children multiplied by 40 of the average ppe in the state with the resulting amount not to be less than 32 and not greater than 48 of average ppe in the us13 beginning in fy2003 appropriations above the fy2002 level will be allocated based on the same formula but with different enrollment figures the hold harmless language is meant to mitigate any drastic redistribution that may occur as result the new enrollment estimates used after fy2002 simply end the practice of adjusting them to conform to the historic trend in seasonal patterns of mobility specifically the prefy2003 formula used data from msrts to adjusted estimates of the number of fulltime equivalent fte migratory children residing in each state 10 migrant student locator demonstration project report on the findings from the migrantmobile school locator demonstration project april 1998 available online httpwwwedgovofficesoesemepprelimguidelocatorhtml 11 additionally the nclba requires that sea report cards on pupil performance be disaggregated by number of student characteristics including migrant status 12 although the definition of migratory student as was discussed earlier and the fraction of the ppe has evolved over time the basic formula has remained the same 13 the ppe used in the case of puerto rico differs slightly crs5 during the current school year as well as during the summer and intersession14 the amended formula for distributing appropriations over the fy2002 level uses an unadjusted count of the number of migratory children residing in the state during the previous year plus the number receiving services under the mep in summer or inter session during the previous year if funding is insufficient to pay in full the amounts for which all states are eligible the secretary may ratably reduce the amount allocated to each state in the case of states receiving grants of 1000000 or less the secretary will consult with the state agency to determine if consortium arrangement would be most beneficial to service delivery15 funding history table 1 shows the funding history for mep since fy1980 these figures indicate that funding for mep has generally and incrementally increased from year to year the distribution of mep appropriations among the states has remained quite stable over time three states california texas and florida have traditionally received the majority of the funds available for state distribution in fy1980 texas received 27 of these funds followed by california at 22 and florida at 8 in fy2004 california received 33 of the funds followed by texas at 15 and florida at 616 14 these fte estimates are based in part on statespecific factors that were developed from calendar year 1994 mrsts data and represent each states reported ftes as fractional proportion of the unique count of those children who generated ftes memorandum from ed director of the office of migrant education to state directors of migrant education 15 ed was also directed to develop funding mechanism that accurately reflects the cost factors involved in conducting different types of summer programs such as schoolbased versus homebased programs the focus on summer programs is due to the wide variation in the cost of these programs compared to schoolyear programs 16 the data source used for these state grant figures were taken from tables released by the budget office of the department of education crs6 table 1 esea title i migrant education program appropriations

department of education budget service crs7 program evaluations national commission on migrant education congress ordered major evaluation of the mep through the esea amendments of 198817 this law established the national commission on migrant education to study issues related to the education of migrant children the commission released its report in september of 199218 the highlights of the report focus on the changing population served by the program the difficulties faced by this population indicators of their academic achievement and suggestions for improving the program according to the study the migrant population has changed from being predominantly usborn children of agricultural workers following crops to predominantly immigrant population whose parents are or have recently been employed in agricultural work increasing numbers of new farmworkers are young immigrant males many of whom are unaccompanied minors poverty lack of english proficiency parents and other family members with low educational attainment and isolation from the larger community all contribute to difficulties migrant children face in integrating into the social mainstream and obtaining comparable educational opportunities as consequence of these challenges the dropout rate for students in the mep is estimated to be several times higher than the national average the commissions report concluded that while the mep has changed and expanded in scope since 1966 the students served by this program are often overlooked and further the program has been significantly underfunded the commission noted that appropriations in 1991 were only 33 of full funding of the formula in the legislation postcommission evaluations on the heels of the commission report westat inc under contract with the ed released report which provided breakdown of mep participation services and student achievement data for 1992199319 more recent westat report was released that focused on summerterm projects and produced similar results mep participants were more likely to receive instructional services in reading 96 and math 87 than in other instructional services such as science 57 and social science 48 substantial proportion received bilingual instruction 69 as well as variety of noninstructional services including social work and outreach 17 hawkinsstafford amendments of 1988 pl 100297 18 national
