in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division united states of america ex rel rhonda salmeron relator plaintiff v 05 c 4453 enterprise recovery systems inc et defendants memorandum opinion and order this matter is before this court for decision in response to the motions to dismiss with prejudice that have been advanced by all defendants and on which all parties have had their say this court of course recognizes the seriousness of imposing that ultimate sanction because of litigants or lawyers conduct rather than deciding case on the merits subject discussed later in the conclusion of law section so that this memorandum opinion and order will begin with brief recital of the background leading to that conclusion followed by more detailed recital of the facts and then by the conclusion itself for the reasons set forth below the several motions are granted and this case is dismissed in its entirety background summary this action has been pending for over three years throughout the course of this litigation counsel jorge sanchez sanchez for relator rhonda salmeron salmeron has engagedcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 1 of 23 it should be made plain that the may 2008 order was not1 entered with any notion that it would be death sentence for this lawsuit as to which the teaching of such cases as gabriel v hamlin 514 f3d 734 73637 7 cir 2008 is that onlyth egregious delays by litigants can justify such an action to the contrary its sole purpose was to bring forcefully to the attention of sanchez as salmerons counsel the need to break his pattern of inattention to his obligationselse this court would not have as it did invited motion to rescind that order 2in virtually unbroken pattern of dilatory and irresponsible conduct that has regularly included missed deadlines repeated requests for extensions of time failure to comply with this courts orders and procedures and failure to attend status conferences indeed this court took the unusual step of dismissing this case sua sponte for want of prosecution in may 2008 although it thenas it had forecast it would probably doreinstated the case on sanchez claimed explanation as to his past delinquencies and his assurance of future compliance1 after this court had thus granted salmerons motion to reopen the case salmeronthrough counsel sanchezdid not comply with the promise to toe the line going forward in addition to some further noncompliance with procedural requirements which although troublesome might not have called for any severe response counsel sanchez committed far more serious breach he deliberately disclosed confidential and highly sensitive contractual documents that he had obtained through discovery on limited disclosure basis sanchez hascase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 2 of 23 all other dates through finding 7 were also during 20062 so any further year references will be omitted from those next findings 3admitted providing those confidential documents to reporter for the chronicle of higher education to an unidentified potential cocounsel and to salmeron herself sanchez and salmeron also cannot explain how the documents came to be posted numbered with the bates number stamps an identifier that unequivocally confirms their origin as copies of the documents physically delivered to sanchez and sanchez alone on wikileaks worldwide website devoted as the name implies to the leaking of confidential documents in sum the unprofessional and irresponsible conduct of salmerons counsel sanchez leaves this court considered choice but to dismiss this case with prejudice so as to protect the integrity of the judicial system what follows next is the more extended statement of reasons for that conclusion and result findings of fact 1 salmeron filed this action on august 4 2005 pursuant to the false claims act 31 usc 3730b1 within the first six months after filing the case salmerons counsel sanchez began to exhibit pattern of behavior that involved repeated delays and repeated noncompliance with this courts orders 2 on february 3 2006 original defendant enterprise2 recovery system enterprise filed motion to dismiss pursuantcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 3 of 23 in the past few years this court has departed from its3 oncenearautomatic setting of 123 briefing schedule to practice of ordering responsive memorandum followed by an early status hearing experience has taught that litigants often meet headon in the initial memorandum and response thus obviating the need for movant to expend time and the clients money in the preparation and filing of reply as will be seen these findings refer to sanchez4 throughout although his cocounsel john moran moran has also appeared in courtinfrequentlyfrom time to time this court has not troubled itself to listen to the tape recordings of the many hearing dates referred to in these findings to see if any of those dates involved morans presence and sanchez absencebut there is not the slightest question that virtually all if not all of the appearances that involved claimed explanations of and excuses for delayed filings were by sanchez 4to fed r civ p rule 9b and 12b6dkt 24 this court ordered that responses be filed by march 2 dkt 28 with status date set for march 6 to see whether reply was called for just after the march 2 due date on march 3 sanchez filed3 motion to file the response instanter to be presented at the march 6 hearing dkt 34 sanchez cited his workload and personal issues as the reasons for the brief delay dkt 3314 3 on june 6 enterprise filed motion for protective order dkt 59 64 sanchez filed memorandum opposing the proposed protective order adding that he was at loss to even assess whether the defendants proposed order was made in good faith nonetheless sanchez told this court dkt 66 for the time being plaintiff agrees not to disclose the documents to any third parties except for the us attorney or file any documents publicly until 1 defendant has had an opportunity to propose docu ments to be designated as confidential 2 plaintiffcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 4 of 235has had chance to agree or dispute such proposed designations and 3 this court has had the opportunity to rule on any disagreement brought before it on june 14 this court granted enterprises motion for protective order on counsels eyes only basis with formal written order to be submitted dkt 68 4 next on july 28 enterprise filed its second amended motion for entry of protective order dkt 74 on august 2 this court granted the motion but directed counsel for the parties to revise the order dkt 75 then on august 3 enterprise and salmeron submitted the revised protective order which this court signed and entered dkt 77 5 on october 16 added defendant united states aid funds inc usa funds filed motion to dismiss the first amended complaint dkt 96 this court ordered salmeron to file her response to the motion by november 17 dkt 100 again setting status date shortly thereafter to consider whether to schedule reply 6 on november 13 counsel for salmeron and for usa funds held their initial discovery planning conference with usa funds represented by its former counsel mark sweet sweet of wiley rein llp then known as wiley rein fielding llp sweet participated by telephone and told sanchez that to protect usa funds documents it would want the same undertakings and assurances that were afforded by the protective order in placecase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 5 of 23 because all other dates through finding 15 were also5 during 2007 once again year references will be repeated in those next findings 6between enterprise and salmeron in response sanchez agreed during that conference to treat certain documents identified by usa funds as being for attorneys eyes only until such time as modified protective order could be entered 7 on november 20 once again after the due date had passed sanchez filed motion to file salmerons response to usa funds motion to dismiss instanter to be presented at the november 27 status hearing date dkt 109 to complete the parallel to finding 2 sanchez again cited his workload and family obligations as the reasons for the delay 8 on january 31 2007 usa funds made its first production5 of documents which included the third amended and restated guarantee services agreement between usa funds and sallie mae bateslabeled usaf00000001usaf00000060 in the cover letter accompanying that production sweet specifically stated that there were certain documents for which usa funds would be seeking confidential treatment expressly including the guarantee services agreement between usa funds and sallie mae sweet went on to say that he had circulated draft joint motion for entry of modified protective order and that usa funds would move for confidential treatment of these documents when that order has been enteredcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 6 of 2379 sanchez had informed usa funds counsel that he wanted to make some additional modifications to the protective order so that it would cover documents from salmerons home computer on february 1 sanchez emailed sweet explaining that he had not yet had an opportunity to review the proposed modification in part because of his workload but that he would do so and that he was sure we can get this worked out to the parties and courts satisfaction 10 salmerons responses to usa funds interrogatories and its request for production of documents were due on february 19 but usa funds received such responses nonetheless on march 2 usa funds made its second production of documents in the cover letter accompanying that production sweet reiterated that usa funds remains interested in seeking confidential treatment for the guarantee services agreement between usa funds and sallie mae sweet again asked sanchez to provide edits to the draft motion for entry of modified protective order he had circulated in january and he again stated that usa funds would move for confidential treatment once the order had been entered sweet also inquired about the status of salmerons overdue responses to interrogatories and discovery requests 11 on march 23 this court held previouslyscheduled status conference but sanchez failed to appear nor did sanchez submit the delinquent responses to the interrogatories untilcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 7 of 238april 30 more than two months after they were due 12 on may 18 enterprise filed motion to compel and for sanctions dkt 145 because salmeron had also failed to respond to enterprises interrogatories and requests for production which had become due on or about april 9 although sanchez had previously represented that the information would be provided before may 11 he had failed to provide any of the items this court granted enterprises motion to compel in part but denied its request for sanctions it ordered salmeron to comply with the motion to compel by may 29 dkt 147 13 on october 22 this court ordered salmeron to file response to enterprises motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on or before november 5 dkt 168 salmeron filed neither the ordered response nor request for extension waiting instead until november 14 to file motion for leave to file third amended complaint tacdkt 170 this court promptly ordered sanchez to provide copy of the proposed tac to defense counsel to determine if there were any objections scheduling status conference for november 26 dkt 171 14 at that status hearing this court granted leave to file the tac dkt 172 instructing that enterprises motion to dismiss the second amended complaint would apply to the tac and ordering salmeron to file response to the motion on or before december 10 as it had done with the other timetables thiscase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 8 of 23 with the most limited exceptions all other dates through6 the remaining findings were also during this year so that further year references to those 2008 dates will be omitted 9court scheduled status hearing for december 17 dkt 172 15 in accordance with his consistent pattern sanchez did not file either the required response or motion for an extension on or before december 10 and true to form on december 17 sanchez filed motion for leave to file response instanter once more citing his workload as the reason for the delay this time sanchez provided copy of his motion to opposing counsel and this court only minutes before the scheduled status hearing at the conclusion of the hearing this court ordered sanchez to file the tac by december 26 dkt 180 16 on december 20 sanchez filed motion for an extension of the december 26 deadline to january 4 2008 for filing the6 tac unsurprisingly sanchez cited his workload family obligations and the christmas holiday as the reasons that an extension was needed dkt 177 this court granted the motion and rescheduled the status hearing to january 29 dkt 182 17 despite this courts having granted the requested extension sanchez again submitted nothingneither the tac nor motion for an extensionby the january 4 deadline during january this courts minute clerk consequently called sanchez to inquire about the status of the filing and was told that the filing was forthcoming but sanchez neither attended thecase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 9 of 2310january 29 status hearing nor filed the tac before that hearing this court ordered salmeron to file the tac by february 5 warning that the pending motions to dismiss would be granted if that deadline was not met dkt 183 18 mirabile dictu sanchez did file the tac on february 5 adding as defendants sallie mae inc usa group guarantee services inc usa servicing corp and sallie mae servicing lp dkt 185 that pleading alleged 1 that usa servicing corp was the successor in interest to usa group guarantee services inc tac 37 2 that sallie mae servicing lp was in turn the successor in interest to usa group guarantee services inc id 38 and 3 that sallie mae servicing lp had been dissolved with sallie mae inc being the successor in interest to all three of those entities id 39 sallie mae inc hereafter simply sallie mae does not contest the allegation that it is the successor in interest to those three now nonexistent entities 19 on march 7 defendants enterprise scott nicholson and usa funds moved to dismiss the tac dkt 192204 and usa funds also sought summary judgment this court entered scheduling order that required salmerons responses to be filed by april 11 and scheduled status hearing for april 16 dkt 206 20 on april 9 sanchez filed still another motion for an extension dkt 207once again his workload and othercase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 10 of 2311obligations were cited as reasons for the delay this court once more granted the extension establishing new deadline of april 18 for the responses and continuing the status hearing until april 22 dkt 209 21 this court should have known better sanchez failed either to file the responses or to seek an extension on or before april 18 and on april 21 this court entered sua sponte order rescheduling the april 22 status hearing to may 9 dkt 219 then on may 1 despite the expiration of the april 18 deadline sanchez filed still another motion to extend the filing date for the responses until may 6 dkt 220 that motion too cited sanchez workload as one of the reasons for the missed deadline but it also added his concern over filing the responses before sallie mae filed its anticipated motion to dismiss on may 5 this court granted the requested extension to may 6 dkt 223 22 plus ça change plus cest même chose sanchez again failed to comply with this courts order referred to in finding 21 and did not file the responses before the new deadline meanwhile on may 5 sallie mae did file its motion to dismiss the tac dkt 224 in its motion sallie mae advised this court that it was in discussions with sanchez for the voluntary dismissal of the three nonexistent entities see finding 18 and that if resolution could not be reached motion would be filed on their behalf to adopt sallie maescase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 11 of 23 this is somewhat reminiscent of the old saw that the best7 way to get the proverbial mules attention is to strike it between the eyes with twobyfour see n1 12motion to dismiss 23 on may 8 sanchez communicated with this courts chambers and requested continuance of the may 9 status hearing saying that the continuance was needed so that the delinquent responses could be filed before the hearingspecifically by the afternoon of may 9 this court rescheduled the status hearing to may 16 dkt 228 24 may 9 came and went without the promised responses or even another request for an extension in candor the depressing recital to this point leaves this court astonished that it did not call halt earlier but on may 14 it entered an order dismissing this action for want of prosecution even then making it clear that it would entertain promptlyfiled motion to reopen the case under rule 59e dkt 231 on may 15 perhaps7 the first time that he acted expeditiously sanchez filed motion to alter the judgment and reopen the case dkt 233 25 on may 21 this court heard argument on sanchez motion to reopen salmerons case although this court granted the motion it did so with substantial misgivings granting enterprises motion for sanctions emphasizing that this was sanchez final warning and expressing its discontent with sanchez extensive pattern of noncompliance may 21 tr 810 tocase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 12 of 2313817 even so sanchez has still not paid those sanctions to date 26 on june 16 sanchez filed motion to compel against enterprise dkt 243 but did so without first attempting to conduct meetandconfer conference as required by rule 37a1 lr 372 and this courts case management procedures this court ultimately denied that motion based in part on sanchez failure to comply with those rules and procedures and it entered and continued enterprises motion for sanctions dkt 266 27 on june 24 usa funds sallie mae and enterprise learned that on june 20 scanned copy of the usa fundssallie mae third amended and restated guarantee services agreement had been posted on website known as wikileaksorg wikileaks wikileaks touts itself as an uncensorable version of wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis httpwikileaksorgwiki wikileaksabout along with the document itself the leaker provided purported summary of the document and posed 13 inflammatory questions about the possible criminality of the arrangement 28 just two days later on june 26 the chronicle of higher education chronicle published an online article captioned contract raises new concern over sallie maes ties to guarantor about the leaked contract that article raisedcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 13 of 2314questions about the guarantee services agreement and stated emphasis added copy of the 51page contract between sallie mae and usa funds along with some more recent letters updating its terms was posted friday to the internet by wikileaks web site that specializes in publishing documents provided by anonymous whistleblowers the chronicle had obtained the same document several days earlier and had involvement in providing the materials to wikileaks on july 2 and july 3 the chronicle published two additional articles regarding the leaked contract 29 importantly the agreement both leaked to wikileaks and provided to the chronicle bears the bates labels usaf00000001 usaf00000060 that conclusively establishes that documents source as the selfsame document that usa funds had provided to sanchez in keeping with its discovery obligations and on at least three occasions usa funds had identified the document as being confidential and advised sanchez that it intended to seek confidential treatment for the document as soon as modified protective order had been entered 30 under the terms of the agreement that had been reached at the november 13 2006 initial discovery planning conference sanchez was obligated to treat that document as being for attorneys eyes only until such time as modified protective order could be entered such restriction is of course based on the assumption unfortunately mistaken in this instance that counsel may be relied on to maintain the integrity of requiredcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 14 of 2315confidentiality while even the client to say nothing of third persons does not owe the same level of professional or other obligations to the court 31 on june 25 counsel for usa funds communicated with sanchez as to the publication of the document on wikileaks in an emailed response sanchez did not deny releasing the document but rather attempted to justify his behavior 32 on june 26 copy of the wikileaks article as well as the disclosed documents also appeared as link on the message board of yahoo finance httpmessagesfinanceyahoocom stocks_a_to_zstocks_uthreadviewmtmbn16717tid10906 mid10906tof1frt2 yahoo finance is website that reports and analyzes financial information including information regarding investing various financial markets and company finances httpfinanceyahoocom 33 on july 1 usa funds filed motion in this action to dismiss and for protective order dkt 246 on the same day sallie mae inc usa group guarantee services inc usa servicing corp and sallie mae servicing lp filed their motion to adopt usa funds motion dkt 251 motion that this court granted on july 21 dkt 266 enterprise also joined usa funds motion 34 sanchez has admitted that he released the document to reporter with the chronicle to an unnamed attorney and tocase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 15 of 2316salmeron herself dkt 257 sanchez offered several purported but totally unconvincing excuses for that truly indefensible behavior including 1 his forgetfulness as to usa funds repeated requests for modification to the protective order 2 his not keeping the document with the cover letter that specified that it was to be treated as confidential and 3 his unwise judgment dkt 257 35 on july 3 this court heard argument on the motions to dismiss sanchez argument plainly evidenced his failure to appreciate the seriousness of his actions and this court just as plainly confirmed its dissatisfaction with his attempted responses and advised him that it did not wish to hear any more excuses sanchez requested time to research what sanction short of dismissal might be appropriate and this court ordered him to do so by july 11 36 sanchez did file his submission on sanctions on july 11 dkt 257 there he acknowledged that the parties had agreed to modify the original protective order to include all parties and that he had wholly failed to comment on the proposed protective order that had long since been submitted to him by usa funds for that purpose despite those admissions sanchez once again asserted at great length his workload and family obligations as the primary reasons for the failure to honor his acknowledged agreement not to disclose confidential documentcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 16 of 231737 although it is not yet known just how wikileaks obtained copy of the specific confidential document that had been delivered only to sanchez he has expressly admitted delivering photocopy to the chronicle that conduct like most if not all of sanchez repeated violations of his responsibilities to this court and opposing counsel must be characterized as willful and with sanchez having disclaimed the wikileaks transmittal even while acknowledging the delivery to the chronicle this court has assurance that the wikileaks delivery may not be traceable back to salmeron herself an unauthorized distributee in her own right 38 moreover the unauthorized disclosures have publicized to usa funds and sallie maes competitors their trade secrets including but not limited to pricing performance incentives new and enhanced product information service level standards and the scope of the services provided under the document in addition usa funds and sallie mae have suffered significant negative publicity by virtue of the articles resulting from the unauthorized disclosures 39 as to enterprise the unauthorized disclosures of the document have coincided with its response to the education department collection request for proposal although the full effect of that is unknown at this time the appearance of the article in the chronicle may well cause further loss of businesscase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 17 of 2318for enterprise 40 nor is the damage referred to in the preceding findings though both real and serious either curable or quantifiable because the document was posted to website that is devoted to the publication of confidential information usa funds and sallie maes demands that the document be removed have been ignored indeed even if wikileaks were to remove the document the harm is done for the information is in cyberspace and cannot be pulled back 41 on collateral issue during the july 31 status hearing the counsel for sallie mae inc and the three nonexistent entities referred to in finding 18 advised this court that he had been seeking the voluntary dismissal of those entities for some time but without success sallie maes counsel further advised this court that sallie mae inc was not contesting that it is the successor in interest to the three nonexistent entities at the hearing this court admonished salmerons counsel sanchez to dismiss those entities because failure to do so with prejudice would effectively allow salmeron to circumvent this order as to sallie mae inc conclusion of law sanchezand hence salmeronspersistent flouting of court deadlines coupled with periodic noshows at scheduled status dates has both interfered with the due administration of justicecase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 18 of 23 frankly this court had not focused on just how often and8 how consistently sanchez had not followed court orders until this opinion gave it the occasion to review and recount those violations needless to say substantial number of the individual instances had produced what again reaction on this courts partbut this is after all one of couple hundred civil and criminal cases on this courts calendar so that keeping count of sanchez offenses would have been at odds with constructive budgeting of judicial time 19and imposed added costs on the defendants in the latter respect recompense might perhaps take the form of shifting of fees while in the former respect this court might well have been less patient and fired shot across salmerons bow earlier than its may 14 2008 dismissal for want of prosecution coupled as it was with an invitation to seek the lawsuits reinstatement and to more8 but it is unnecessary to decide whether sanchez repeatedalmost universalviolations that have been detailed in the findings of fact would cumulatively rise or fall to the level that would meet the caselaw standard for dismissal because the latest breach is an offense far greater in kind rather than in degree it is truly inexcusable real explanation has been offered and its damaging effect cannot be quantified in the same way that looking at defense counsels time charges and compelling salmeron to pay them might provide remedy for the earlier procedural violations salmerons justfiled relators opposition to proposed dismissal order after speaking of the stringent standardcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 19 of 23 this court has given full consideration to all other9 contentions in relators opposition none affects the analysis and result set out here 20applicable to any dismissal attributable to litigants delays something that this court has made clear is not the triggering factor here lays its principal stress on the nonexistence of an order that placed mantle of protection over the document that has inexcusably been opened to public disclosure an understatement by sanchez with all respect that contention brings to mind the hoary anecdote about the young man who having murdered both his parents asks the courts mercy on the ground that he is an orphan here the absence of protective order sought from the beginning by usa funds in request that was then expressly tied to the document later published because of sanchez misconduct is unquestionably due to sanchez failure to provide response as he had promised sanchez argument on that score is totally without merit9 there is question as to this courts authority to order the ultimate sanction of dismissal in the face of such egregious conductor as to the propriety of doing so natl hockey league v metro hockey club inc 427 us 639 1976 made that plain more than three decades ago in the context of repeated violations in the course of discovery an area less damaging to the opposing party than sanchez current misconducthere is the relevant excerpt from that per curiam opinion id at 643case 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 20 of 2321but here as in other areas of the law the most severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by statute or rule must be available to the district court in appropriate cases not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such sanction but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such deterrent far more recent cases in our own circuit have reconfirmed and applied that teaching two of them merit both citation and quotation first here is relevant excerpt from the very beginning of dotson v bravo 321 f3d 663 665 7 cir 2003th there are species of misconduct that place too high burdenfor court to allow case to continue barnhill v united states 11 f3d 1360 1368 7 cirth 1993 then after quoting from natl hockey league dotson id at 667 went on to say further it is axiomatic that the appropriateness of lesser sanctions need not be explored if the circumstances justify imposition of the ultimate penaltydismissal with prejudice finally turning to the courts inherent authority to rectify abuses to the judicial process id citing chambers v nasco inc 501 us 32 49 1991 dotson 321 f3d at 668 quoted this from barnhill 11 f3d at 1368 misconduct may exhibit such flagrant contempt for the court and its processes that to allow the offending party to continue to invoke the judicial mechanism for its own benefit would raise concerns about the integrity and credibility of the civil justice system that transcend the interests of the parties immediately before the courtcase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 21 of 2322most recently wade v soo line rr 500 f3d 559 7 cirth 2007 addressed the propriety of visiting lawyers sins upon the client in these terms id at 564 most citations omitted attorneys actions are imputed to their clients even when those actions cause substantial harm litigant bears the risk of errors made by his chosen agent sanctions for misconduct are within the discretion of district judges national hockey league v metropolitan hockey club 427 us 639 1976 and dismissing this case was not an abuse of discretion that same perspective which focuses on the impact of lawyer conduct on the justice system and on the clients adversaries rather than on the clients situation was strongly voiced as far back as link v wabash rr 370 us 626 63334 1962footnote omitted there is certainly merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioners claim because of his counsels unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyeragent and is considered to have notice of all facts notice of which can be charged upon the attorney smith v ayer 101 us 320 326 indeed that approach is even less troublesome here after all if salmerons qui tam action has ultimate merit she will have lost only the opportunity to grasp the brass ring of acase 105cv04453 document 296 filed 08182008 page 22 of 23 because the current dismissal obviates the need to deal10 with the pending dispositive motions filed by defendants this court has occasion to evaluate that possibility 23 relators share of the recovery but the united states which10 has until now declined to involve itself thus permitting salmeron to proceed as relator might seek to take up the cudgels if that were the case so that any culpable defendant would be taken to task in all events what has been set out here amply demonstrates the appropriateness of dismissal of this action with prejudice this court so orders by definition all pending meritsrelated motions are denied as moot ________________________________________ milton i
