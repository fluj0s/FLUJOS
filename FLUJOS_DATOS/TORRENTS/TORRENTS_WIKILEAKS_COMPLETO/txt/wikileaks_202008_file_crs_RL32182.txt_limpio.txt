rule and its current status summary title iv of the higher education act hea pl 89329 as amended by pl 105244 authorizes programs that provide federal student financial aid to support student attendance at institutions of higher education ihes meeting title iv eligibility requirements to participate in these programs proprietary forprofit institutions must meet requirements included in section 102 of the hea including requirements that proprietary institutions have been in existence for at least two years and derive at least 10 of school revenue from nontitle iv funds this latter requirement forms the basis for the 9010 rule the 9010 rule was put into effect by the 1998 hea amendments pl 105 244 replacing its predecessor the 8515 rule which was authorized by the 1992 hea amendments pl 102235 the 8515 rule was similar to requirement that had been placed on the veterans assistance programs administered by the then veterans administration to prevent institutions from being established solely to profit from the payments received by veterans supporters of the 8515 rule argued that the rule was necessary to stem fraudulent and abusive practices that had been identified at proprietary institutions it also was argued that implementing the rule might restore some market incentive to education as proprietary institutions would be unable to charge more than what students not receiving enough federal financial aid to pay all their institutional charges were willing to pay detractors of the new rule argued that requiring proprietary institutions to obtain at least 15 of their revenue from nontitle iv sources could limit access to lowincome students if proprietary institutions were forced to deny admission to students receiving title iv funds to meet the required percentage of nontitle iv revenues during the 1998 reauthorization process congress reduced the percentage of revenue that proprietary institutions had to obtain from nontitle iv sources to at least 10 congress declined to make changes to the formula for calculating revenue that had generated controversy since its inception following the 1992 reauthorization the us department of education however opted to modify the definition of revenue and calculation of eligibility through regulations following the 1998 reauthorization as part of its consideration of reauthorizing the hea the senate has passed bill s 1642 higher education amendments of 2007 that would eliminate the 9010 rule as condition of institutional eligibility for proprietary institutions rather the 9010 rule

programs that provide federal student financial aid to support student attendance at institutions of higher education ihes meeting title iv eligibility requirements the hea includes two definitions of institutions of higher education for the purposes of title iv eligibility hea section 101 recognizes nonprofit institutions that are among other things legally authorized by the state accredited or preaccredited by an agency or association recognized by the us department of education ed and that award bachelors degree or provide at least twoyear program that is accepted as credit toward the completion of bachelors degree hea section 102 expands the definition of an ihe for the purposes of title iv eligibility only section 102 recognizes proprietary forprofit institutions of higher education postsecondary vocational institutions and institutions outside of the united states as being eligible for title iv programs1 to participate in title iv programs in addition to other requirements proprietary institutions must have been in existence for at least two years and derive at least 10 of school revenue from nontitle iv funds this latter requirement forms the basis for the 9010 rule as part of its consideration of reauthorizing the hea the senate has passed bill s 1642 higher education amendments of 2007 that would eliminate the 9010 rule as condition of institutional eligibility for proprietary institutions rather the 9010 rule would be moved to hea section 487 program participation agreement where it would continue to affect only proprietary institutions the

participation in title iv student aid programs under the higher education act background and reauthorization issues by rebecca r skinner hereafter cited as crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility crs2 the 9010 rule and related formula the 9010 rule states that proprietary institution must derive at least 10 of its revenue from nontitle iv funds failure to comply with this requirement results in an institution losing its eligibility to participate in title iv programs the current formula2 used to calculate proprietary school compliance with the 9010 rule is stated in program regulations as follows i title iv funds used for tuition fees and other institutional charges divided by ii sum of revenues generated by the school from 1 tuition fees and other institutional charges for students enrolled in title iveligible training programs plus 2 school activities necessary for the education or training of students enrolled in those title iveligible programs3 the denominator only includes revenues generated from school activities necessary for the education or training of students to the extent that they are not included in tuition fees and other institutional charges several funds are excluded from both the numerator and denominator for determining institutional compliance with the 9010 rule leveraging educational assistance partnership leap program special leveraging educational assistance partnership sleap program and federal work study fws funds can not be included except under specific circumstances4 institutional funds used to match federal student aid funds and refunds paid to or on behalf of students that have failed to complete the period of enrollment eg withdrawn expelled may not be included finally the cost of books supplies and equipment may not be considered unless those costs are institutional charges5 in calculating revenue institutions must use the cash basis of accounting under the cash basis of accounting revenue is recognized only when it is received rather than when it is earned for the purposes of determining compliance with the 9010 rule revenue is considered an inflow or other enhancement of assets to an entity or reduction of its liabilities resulting from the delivery or production of goods or 2 information for this section was taken from us department of education office of federal student aid volume 2 school eligibility and

represents cash received from source outside of the institution thus institutional grants in the form of tuition waivers do not count as revenue because they do not represent an inflow of cash from outside the institution current regulations permit several types of nontitle iv revenue to be included in the denominator of the 9010 calculation7 revenue generated by the institution from activities that are necessary for its students education or training may be considered in the denominator8 these activities must be conducted on campus or at facility under the institutions control performed under the supervision of faculty member and required of all students in specific educational program examples of specific nontitle iv revenue that may be included in the denominator include nontitle iv funds used by students to pay tuition fees and other institutional charges loan repayments received by the institution during the fiscal year for which the determination is made and institutional scholarships if the funds were disbursed from an established restricted account and the funds in that account are funds from an outside source9 finally title iv funds must be used to pay institutional charges prior to the application of other funds unless the student receives grant funds provided by nonfederal public agencies or independent private sources funds from qualified government agency job training contracts or funds from prepaid tuition plan thus institutions are able to count all funds available from these sources toward their 10 nontitle iv funds requirement10 it should be noted that although funds from prepaid tuition plans authorized under section 529 of the internal revenue code 529 plan may be applied to institutional charges prior to title iv funds funds from tuition savings plans also authorized by section 529 may not be applied prior to title iv funds11 6 office of federal student aid volume 2 p 29 7 34 cfr 6005e4 8 revenues from auxiliary enterprises such as revenue from vending machines or the sale of equipment and supplies to students that are not necessary for their education or training may not be considered revenue for purposes of complying with the 9010 rule 9 for more information about the treatment of institutional scholarships see office of federal student aid volume 2 pp 210 10 without this provision institutions would have to consider title iv aid first which could limit the amount of funding applied from these other sources for example if student had 10000 available from prepaid tuition plan and institutional charges were 12000 the institution could apply the full 10000 toward these charges even if the student had 6000 in federal student aid without this provision the institution would have to apply the 6000 of federal student aid toward institutional charges first and then would only be able to apply 6000 from the students prepaid tuition plan toward institutional charges and compliance with the 9010 rule 11 prepaid state tuition plans established under section 529 of the internal revenue code currently are applied toward institutional charges prior to title iv aid because this mirrors how they are treated in determining eligibility for title iv aid in contrast tuition savings continued crs4 legislative history12 the 9010 rule was put into effect by the 1998 hea amendments pl 105 244 replacing its predecessor the 8515 rule which was authorized by the 1992 hea amendments pl 102235 this section provides brief overview of the impetus for developing the 8515 rule the 1992 hea amendments and the 1998 hea amendments impetus for the 8515 rule limiting the amount of revenue proprietary institutions could derive from title iv funds became topic of debate in congress for several reasons during the late 1980s and into the 1990s the government accountability office gao congress and office of the inspector general oig at the us department of education conducted investigations of student aid programs and found evidence of extensive fraud and abuse some of the worst examples of these practices were found at proprietary institutions13 according to gao for example from fy1983 to fy1993 federal payments to honor default claims on student loans across all institutions increased from 445 million to 24 billion14 when default rates peaked nationwide in 1990 default rates at proprietary institutions reached 41 compared with an overall default rate of 22 many proprietary institutions were failing to provide 11 continued plans established under section 529 are treated as family savings plans and included in the calculation of the estimated family contribution for more information about the treatment of section 529 tuition savings plans during the negotiated rulemaking process see us

issues health education and human services division gaothehs96158 june 6 1996 pp13 hereafter cited as gao testimony the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations conducted some of the investigations of fraud and abuse in title iv programs in 1990 14 gao testimony crs5 students with quality education or training in occupations with job openings focusing instead on obtaining federal student aid dollars as result students left proprietary institutions with new job skills or few prospects of employment in their field of study and burdened with substantial loan debt at the same time there was evidence that proprietary institutions were recruiting lowincome students who were not qualified to participate in postsecondary education and who had little chance of even completing program arguments were made that if proprietary institutions were providing highquality education they should be able to attract specific percentage of their revenue from nontitle iv programs thus proprietary institutions that were overly dependent on title iv revenue were considered institutions that were not providing highquality education and institutions that might be misusing federal dollars therefore it was concluded that these institutions should not be subsidized by federal dollars15 all ihes including proprietary institutions eligible for title iv funds are governed by threepart regulatory structure commonly referred to as the triad the triad consists of accreditation licensure by state agency and eligibility or certification16 in addition to concerns of fraud and abuse during the late 1980s and early 1990s there also were concerns that the triad was not providing enough oversight of the activities of proprietary institutions first there were concerns that accrediting bodies of proprietary institutions were hesitant to withdraw accreditation due to its financial implications eg an institution could potentially sue the accrediting body second studies had found that state regulation of proprietary institutions was limited in its effectiveness for example gaps in state laws allowed fraudulent practices to continue and existing laws were not adequately enforced third the oig found that eds certification procedures at the time were inadequate to protect the federal governments or students financial interests various suggestions were made prior to the 1992 hea reauthorization about how to strengthen the federal role in eligibility and certification including requiring annual financial reports from all institutions or requiring that institutions submit financial reports based on their dependence on federal aid or their default rates the idea of evaluating institutional soundness or basing the need for monitoring on institutional dependence on federal funds was already being used in veterans assistance programs veterans were not permitted to enroll in courses in which over 85 of the enrollees had all or part of their tuition or fees paid to them or for them by the then veterans administration or the institution evaluations of the veterans assistance programs found that the policy had helped prevent abuse17 15 see for example general accountability office formerly government accountability office testimony pp1011 congressional record letter from the office of the inspector general pp h5322h5334 and congressional record august 8 1994 pp s10918 s10923 hereafter cited as congressional record 16 for additional information about the triad see crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility 17 for more information about this precedent see for example congressional record letter from the office of the inspector general p h5327 crs6 thus there was precedent for implementing rule such as the 8515 rule as condition for proprietary institutions to be eligible to participate in title iv programs18 there were arguments for and against the proposal those in favor of an 8515 rule argued that it would stem abuse and might restore some market incentive to education as proprietary institutions would not be able to charge more than what students not receiving enough federal financial aid to pay all their institutional charges were willing to pay those against the proposal argued that it could limit access for lowincome students if proprietary institutions were forced to deny such students admission in order to meet the required percentage of students not receiving title iv student aid 1992 hea amendments the 1992 hea amendments contained an amendment specifically targeted at the source of revenue for proprietary institutions the definition of proprietary institution for purposes of hea title iv eligibility was changed to state that proprietary institutions must derive at least 15 of their revenue from nontitle iv funds19 the formula as stated in regulations used to determine whether proprietary institutions were in compliance with this requirement20 was similar to the formula currently used to determine compliance with the 9010 rule see previous discussion the 8515 rule generated considerable controversy the career college association representing proprietary institutions brought several unsuccessful court challenges against the provision21 in addition eds regulations implementing the 8515 rule were delayed by language in appropriations statutes also there were disputes about the formula used to calculate the percentage of funds derived from nontitle iv sources there were discussions about whether the numerator should include all title iv aid received by students or only the portion used to pay tuition and fees there also was debate about whether the denominator should include only revenues from title iveligible courses or revenues from other similar contract training or related businesses it should be noted that changes to the numerator or denominator of the formula could have substantial effects on proprietary institutions for example if the formula were changed to include more sources of revenue in the numerator proprietary institutions may require more offsetting revenue to meet the requirements of the rule if on the other hand the formula was changed to include more sources of revenue 18 the rule as it applied to veterans assistance programs was based on percentage of enrollment not revenue in part because individual programs and not institutions were approved 19 in the 1992 hea amendments the definition of proprietary institution and specific requirements that these institutions had to meet to be eligible for title iv programs were found in section 481 of the hea 20 information about the formula used to determine compliance with the 8515 rule was taken from 34 cfr 6005 revised as of july 1 1997 21 see for example education daily july 21 1994 p 5 crs7 in the denominator it would be easier for proprietary institutions to meet the requirements of the rule gao evaluation of student outcomes at proprietary institutions after the 1992 hea amendments were enacted given ongoing concerns about the performance of proprietary institutions gao was asked to examine the relationship between proprietary school performance and reliance on title iv funds22 the gao study found that proprietary institutions that were more dependent on title iv funds had poorer student outcomes in terms of student completion and placement rates and higher student default rates the researchers also concluded that requiring proprietary institutions to obtain higher proportion of their revenues from nontitle iv funds would result in substantial savings from reduction in student loan defaults however gao acknowledged that increasing the required proportion of revenue derived from nontitle iv funds could limit student access to postsecondary education as proprietary institutions might have to deny access to lowincome title iv aid recipients to comply with more stringent revenue requirements the 1998 hea amendments the most significant change made to the 8515 rule during the 1998 hea reauthorization was to alter the percentage of nontitle iv revenues proprietary institutions were required to earn the 8515 rule became the 9010 rule meaning that proprietary institutions had to earn at least 10 rather than 15 of their revenues from nontitle iv funds23 there also were discussions of altering the formula used to determine whether an institution was in compliance with the rule for example the house proposed to include revenue from nontitle iveligible programs provided on contractual basis as nontitle iv revenue in the denominator of the formula in conference the house and senate agreed to continue to define nontitle iv revenues as they were defined by ed regulations in effect at the time of enactment24 22 general accountability office proprietary schools poorer student outcomes at schools that rely more on federal student aid gaohehs97103 1997 23 in legislation passed by the house hr 6 as introduced and hrept 105481 and senate s 1882 and srept 105181 the 8515 rule remained intact however the house proposed including revenue from services provided on contractual basis in the denominator of the formula for proprietary institutions providing services on contractual basis this would have made it easier for them to meet the revenue requirements from nontitle iv funds in conference the senate did not agree to this change but both the house and senate did agree to change the percentage of nontitle iv revenues that proprietary institutions had to receive from 15 to 10 making it easier for proprietary institutions to comply with the rule 24 for example according to regulations the numerator did not include state student incentive grant ssig now called leap or federal work study program funds in addition the amount charged for books supplies and equipment was not included in the numerator or denominator unless the amount was included in tuition fees or other continued crs8 department of education changes the formula following the reauthorization of the hea in 1998 ed opted to make changes to prior regulations stating how revenue was defined and institutional eligibility calculated for example new regulations explicitly stated that proprietary institutions must use the cash basis of accounting in determining whether they met the requirements of the 9010 rule25 the new regulations also specified that scholarships could only be recognized as revenue if they represented cash received from an outside source under most circumstances institutional scholarships provided by proprietary institutions do not meet this criteria as with institutional scholarships tuition waivers were not considered revenue the regulations also stated that cash revenue from institutional loans could be recognized only when the loans were repaid the new regulations also clarified that title iv funds had to be applied to student charges before most other sources of payments such as education iras26 violations of the 9010 rule the office of federal student aid fsa at the us department of education is responsible for tracking institutional violations of title iv eligibility requirements27 based on fsa data on violations for january 1 2000 through december 31 2005 total of 530 ihes lost their eligibility to participate in title iv programs for variety of reasons28 of these ihes only three proprietary institutions lost their eligibility to participate in title iv programs due to violations of the 9010 24 continued institutional charges for more information see 34 cfr 6005 revised as of july 1 1997 25 after the 1992 hea amendments were implemented the secretary of education secretary proposed that proprietary institutions could calculate their compliance with the 8515 rule of education using the cash basis of accounting to determine title iv program revenues numerator and the accrual basis of accounting to determine total revenue denominator the cash basis of accounting recognizes revenue when it is received regardless of when payments are due the accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenue when it is incurred regardless of the actual date of collection or payment based on comments received by ed the secretary agreed that the same basis of accounting should be used for the numerator and denominator the cash basis of accounting was selected because that is the accounting method used by title iv institutions to report and account for title iv program expenditures for more information see federal register february 10 1994 59 fr 644664675 and federal register july 15 1999 64 fr

additional information about institutional eligibility requirements to participate in title iv programs see crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility 28 institutions lose title iv eligibility for reasons such as closure loss of accreditation failure to meet administrative capability or financial responsibility requirements or voluntary withdrawal data on violations of institutional eligibility requirements based on unpublished data provided by the us department of education crs9 rule two violations of the 9010 rule occurred in 2001 and one violation of the 9010 rule occurred in 200429 more specifically for example one of the two institutions was found to have derived 9030 of its revenue from title iv funds for the fiscal year ending december 31 200130 as result of this violation of the 9010 rule the institution should not have received title iv funds for the period extending from january 1 2002 through september 30 2002 as the institution was ineligible to participate in title iv programs the institution had to return title iv funds received during fy2002 the year for which it was ineligible to participate in title iv programs however the institution has asked ed whether traditional rounding rules apply to the 9010 rule that is anything below 9050 would be rounded down to 90 according to the fsa office the use of rounding rule is being considered another proprietary institution was found to have violated the 9010 rule in 200231 an examination of the institutions annual compliance audit revealed that the institution had derived 92 of its revenue from title iv funds in 2002 as result the institution was found to be ineligible to participate in title iv federal student aid programs in 2003 29 while it appears that only three proprietary institutions lost their title iv eligibility due to violations of the 9010 rule it is possible that other proprietary institutions violated the 9010 rule in conjunction with other violations eg fiscal mismanagement the specific reason for loss of title iv eligibility is determined by the us department of education thus if an institution has multiple violations the primary violation may not be attributed to violation of the 9010 rule in addition if an institution voluntarily closes or voluntarily withdraws from title iv eligibility the reason for loss of eligibility could then be recorded as closure or voluntary withdrawal rather than violation of the 9010 rule for example ed issued combined emergency action and terminationfine action against teddy ulmo institute based on allegations of misconduct and breach of fiduciary duty including violating the 9010 rule the institution voluntarily closed so eds actions were rendered moot the institutions loss of title iv eligibility was not recorded as 9010 violation for more information see httpwwwedohaorgcases200342sfpdf 30 us department of education office of the inspector general audit of american school of technologys administration of title iv hea

2002 but two violations were indicated for 2001 it appears that one of the two violations of the 9010 rule in 2001 may have actually occurred in 2002 final determination in the specific violation of the 9010 rule was issued in june 2005 the institution appealed the decision and final judgement was rendered in november 2005 us department of education office of hearings and appeals oha index of oha decisions docket number 0549sa available online at httpwwwed ohaorgohaindexhtml crs10 reauthorization of the higher education act as congress considers reauthorization of the higher education act it may consider continuing eliminating or modifying the 9010 rule this raises several questions and issues that are addressed below elimination of the 9010 rule as congress debates the reauthorization of the hea it may consider eliminating the 9010 rule one of the primary reasons offered for the elimination of the 9010 rule is that it limits proprietary institutions ability to serve lowincome students dependent on title iv aid that is because proprietary institutions must derive at least 10 of their revenue from nontitle iv funds they must enroll some students who are not solely dependent on federal student financial aid thus it is possible that some students interested in attending the institution may be denied admission proponents of the elimination of the rule also argue that in addition to being limited in their ability to serve lowincome students receiving federal student aid some proprietary institutions must change their mission or programs to be more attractive to students who will be able to pay for their own education proponents also argue that the 9010 rule provides incentives for institutions to raise their tuition and fees above the amount of funds available to students through title iv loans and pell grants in order to generate nontitle iv revenue thus making it harder for low income students to enroll32 opponents of eliminating the rule suggest that forprofit institutions are fundamentally different from notforprofit institutions based on their profitseeking motive raising questions about why these institutions should be fully supported by the federal government and taxpayer dollars in addition proprietary institutions have more flexibility than public and nonprofit institutions to develop revenue sources other than title iv due to their less restrictive missions there also are concerns that without the 9010 rule incidents of fraud and abuse by proprietary institutions may increase33 those opposed to eliminating the 9010 rule argue that the rule protects lowincome students from incurring debt to attend proprietary institutions that will not adequately prepare them for employment and potentially experiencing the multitude of problems associated with student loan default eg bad credit rating additional federal aid for higher education 32 various arguments against having the 9010 or 8515 rule have been made since congress first considered implementing the rule see for example congressional record letter from the office of the inspector general pp h5322h5334 testimony of mr david moore in us congress

access problem associated with the 9010 rule and its predecessor was acknowledged prior to the implementation of the 1992 hea amendments while there may be number of ways to resolve the access problem including the elimination of the rule in 1995 ed proposed adding mitigating circumstances section to the legislation that would allow the secretary of education secretary to waive the rule for proprietary institutions demonstrating that they serve their students well34 it was suggested that proprietary institutions might be held to the same standard as shortterm programs35 which must demonstrate 70 graduation rate and 70 job placement rate36 the impact of eliminating the 9010 rule is difficult to determine it is possible that many of the proprietary institutions that were engaged in fraudulent or abusive practices prior to the implementation of the 8515 rule and its successor the 9010 rule have already closed or altered their practices to comply with statutory language there are still questions however whether there are enough other safeguards to prevent proprietary institutions from potentially engaging in fraudulent or abusive practices and to identify those that do in addressing this issue at hearing eds deputy inspector general suggested that caution should be exercised when considering the elimination of any rule including the 9010 rule until the effects of such an action are better understood37 it should be mentioned that other measures have been implemented that also have reduced the incidence of fraud and abuse in hea title iv programs for example the hea cohort default rate rules were established to prevent institutions with high percentage of their students defaulting on loans received through the federal family education loan ffel program or ford federal direct loan dl program from participating in ffel dl or pell grant programs38 this led to 34 testimony of david longanecker assistant secretary for postsecondary education us department of education in senate committee on governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations hearing on abuses in federal student grant programs proprietary school abuses held on july 12 1995 shrg 104477 washington gpo 1996 p40 hereafter cited as senate committee on governmental affairs hearing on proprietary school abuses 35 shortterm programs are programs offered by proprietary institutions or notforprofit postsecondary vocational institutions that provide at least 300 but less than 600 hours of instruction during minimum of 10 weeks of instruction 36 in 1994 senator pell subsequently proposed similar waiver that the secretary could grant to proprietary institutions if they demonstrated graduation and job placement rates of 70 and student loan default rates of less than 25 for fy1991 and fy1992 and had not had their eligibility for title iv programs limited suspended or terminated see congressional record p s10918 neither senator pells or eds suggestions regarding the application of 70 graduation rate and 70 job placement rate have been applied 37 us house of representatives hearing before the committee on education and workforce development enforcement of federal antifraud laws in forprofit education serial 1092 march 1 2005 p 60 available at httpwwwgpogov congresshousehouse06ch109html 38 us department of education cohort default rate guide 2001 available at continued crs12 declines in cohort default rates at all institutions including proprietary institutions however cohort default rates at proprietary institutions have remained higher than those at twoyear and fouryear nonprofit institutions39 in addition during the early 1990s ed strengthened the eligibility and certification component of the triad resulting in lower percentages of institutions receiving certification for participation in title iv programs for example in 1990 17 of initial applications to participate in title iv programs were denied compared with 43 in 199540 ed also provided staff training in detecting fraud and abuse at postsecondary institutions41 finally during the 1990s accreditation organizations that worked with proprietary institutions began to accredit fewer institutions the number of proprietary institutions participating in title iv programs declined and lower proportion of title iv funds went to proprietary institutions while these measures have helped to identify and reduce incidents of fraudulent and abusive behavior at proprietary institutions it is difficult to know whether these measures alone would compensate for the elimination of the 9010 rule modifications to the 9010 rule short of eliminating the 9010 rule congress may debate several other changes to the rule first congress may reevaluate the percentage of funds proprietary institutions must derive from nontitle iv funds possibly increasing or decreasing the percentage of revenue proprietary institutions must receive from nontitle iv funds second congress may consider changes to how revenue is defined or to the formula used to calculate revenue congress also may examine the order in which funds are applied to institutional charges that affects the calculation of nontitle iv revenue for example during the 2002 negotiated rulemaking process42 instituted by ed participants suggested that distributions from irs 529 tuition savings plans should be added to the list of exceptions of nontitle iv sources of funds that can be applied toward institutional charges prior to title iv aid this change would increase the size of the denominator in the formula used to calculate the percentage of revenue 38 continued httpwwwifapedgovdrmaterialsfinalcdrghtml for more on cohort default rates also see crs report rl30656 the administration of federal student loan

students with 529 tuition savings plans to meet the 9010 rule finally congress may consider moving the 9010 rule to another section in the hea such as to the program participation agreement ppa in section 48743 this could lessen the penalties for violations of the 9010 rule while continuing to apply the rule to only proprietary institutions or the rule could be expanded to apply to all ihes44 brief overview of relevant legislation from the 110th congress this section provides brief overview of relevant provisions contained in s 1642 the higher education amendments of 2007 the primary vehicle for hea reauthorization in senate in the 110th congress s 1642 was reported by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on july 10 2007 without written report it was subsequently passed by the senate on july 24 2007 by vote of 95045 similar action has been taken by the house committee on education and labor s 1642 would eliminate the 9010 rule as specific institutional eligibility requirement for proprietary institutions it would move the 9010 rule to the ppa but continue to apply it only to proprietary institutions by making this change the penalties for violating the 9010 rule would be the same as those imposed for violating any provision of the ppa eg fine suspension termination in addition proprietary institutions could be placed on provisional certification status46 and be subject to increased monitoring and reporting requirements for violation of the 9010 rule under s 1642 proprietary institution that violated the 9010 rule for two consecutive years would lose its title iv eligibility until it is able to demonstrate that it is in compliance with the requirement the bill would require the secretary to publicly identify any institution that failed to meet the 9010 rule in any given year s 1642 would incorporate current regulatory language into statutory language regarding the use of the cash basis of accounting and several sources of allowable nontitle iv revenue while also expanding the sources of nontitle iv revenue to include sources of revenue that are currently prohibited from being counted toward the 10 requirement below is brief overview of each of the sources of nontitle iv revenue that are specifically included in the senate bill that could be counted toward the 10 requirement 43 all institutions participating in title iv federal student aid programs are required to sign ppa that governs their participation in the programs for more information see crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility 44 although both hr 609 and s 1614 considered in the 109th congress would have moved the 9010 rule to the ppa and applied it to all ihes congress could move the 9010 rule to the ppa and apply it only to proprietary institutions 45 see record vote number 275 46 for more information about provisional certification see hea section 498h crs14 funds used by students other than title iv aid used to pay their institutional charges this would codify provisions currently delineated in regulations funds used by institutions to satisfy matching requirements for title iv programs current regulations strictly prohibit institutions from counting these funds toward the 10 requirement if institutions are allowed to count these funds toward their 10 requirement they may be able to count the same funds twice once when they are initially received by the institution from an outside source of funding eg student paying tuition and again when they are used to match title iv program funds in either the same or subsequent year funds used by student from 529 plan to pay institutional charges this would codify provisions currently delineated in regulations as discussed earlier in this report however the issue related to 529 plans is whether funds from both college savings plans and prepaid tuition plans should be applied toward institutional charges prior to applying title iv to these charges current regulations allow funds from 529 prepaid tuition plans but not funds from 529 college savings plans to be applied before title iv aid funds paid by student to the institution for training program that is not eligible for title iv funds but is approved or licensed by the appropriate state agency or an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary current regulations strictly prohibit institutions from counting these funds toward the 10 requirement the 9010 rule is focused on the use of title iv funds which are awarded only to students participating in title iv eligible programs47 therefore only revenue generated by the institution that is related to title iv eligible programs is included in the 9010 rule calculation funds generated by the institution from activities that are necessary for the education and training of students that are conducted on campus or at facility under the control of the institution are performed under the supervision of faculty member and are required to be performed by all students in specific educational program this would codify provisions currently delineated in regulations for institutional loans only the amount of loan repayment received by the institution during the fiscal year for which compliance with the 9010 rule is being determined this would codify provisions currently delineated in regulations for institutional scholarships provided on the basis of academic merit or financial need funds must be distributed from an established restricted account and must represent designated 47 for more information about title iv eligible programs see crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility crs15 funds from an outside source or income earned on those funds this would codify provisions currently delineated in regulations tuition discounts provided based on academic merit or financial need tuition discounting is the use of institutionally funded grants to help reduce the price of attendance for students thus tuition discounting is similar to providing an institutional scholarship and would presumably have to meet the requirements placed on institutional scholarships to be counted toward the 10 requirement currently despite this similarity the senate bill would not require funds used for tuition discounting to come from an established restricted account that includes only designated funds from an outside source or income earned on those funds thus funds used for tuition discounting could be doublecounted toward the 10 requirement once when the institution originally receives the funds eg from student paying full tuition and again when the institution provides discount to another student either in the same or subsequent year brief overview of relevant legislation from the 109th congress this section provides brief overview of relevant provisions contained in hr 609 the college access and opportunity act of 2005 and s 1614 the higher education amendments of 2005 the primary vehicles for hea reauthorization in the 109th congress hr 609 was passed by the house on march 30 2006 by vote of 221199 hrept 10923148 s 1614 was reported by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on november 17 2005 without written report report srept 109218 was subsequently filed on february 28 2006 it was not considered on the senate floor during the 109th congress both hr 609 and s 1614 would have eliminated the 9010 rule as specific institutional eligibility requirement for proprietary institutions both bills would have moved the 9010 rule to the ppa and applied it to all institutions including public and notforprofit institutions by making this change the penalties for violating the 9010 rule would have been the same as those imposed for violating any provision of the ppa eg fine suspension termination however institutions could have been placed on provisional certification status and been subjected to increased cash monitoring for violation of the 9010 rule under hr 609 any institution that violated the 9010 rule for three consecutive years would have lost its title iv eligibility under s 1614 an institution would have lost its title iv eligibility for violating the 9010 rule for two consecutive years both bills would have required the secretary to publicly identify any institution that failed to meet the 9010 rule both bills would also have incorporated current regulatory language into statutory language regarding the use of the cash basis of accounting and sources of allowable 48 for more information see house roll call vote number 81 available online at httpclerkhousegovevs2006roll081xml crs16 nontitle iv revenue finally hr 609 and s 1614 would have expanded on the sources of allowable nontitle iv revenue to include for example funds used by institutions to match federal student aid funds and tuition discounts as previously mentioned current regulations strictly prohibit proprietary institutions from including these funds in their 9010 calculation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32182
