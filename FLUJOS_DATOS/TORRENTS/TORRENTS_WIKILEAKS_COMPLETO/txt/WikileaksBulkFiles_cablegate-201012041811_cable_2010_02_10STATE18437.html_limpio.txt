with deputy ssecc pershing and sgc ambassador fried sca as robert blake expressed appreciation to ghafoor for maldivess willingness to accept guantanamo detainee and president nasheeds strong personal effort in copenhagen to reach an accord blake also pulsed ghafoor on maldivess candidacy for the human rights council ghafoor said he was confident maldives could get one of the four asia group seats he did not think iran lacking arab support had the votes his only concern was that thailand and maldives could split their votes and that iran is working african capitals as such maldives is not only lobbying asian missions but also african missions blake offered quiet us assistance if it would be helpful ghafoor appreciated it and said maldives might take us up on it but maldives needed to be seen as earning the seat in its own right as small country he said maldives cant play other countries against each other it needs to take principled positions eg kosovo recognition 3 sbu ghafoor appreciated us efforts to help push the imf and maldives toward agreement but that the conditionality was harsh wage cuts have been politically difficult referring to the march 2829 maldives donors conference ghafoor said international assistance would help the government win over the public and implement its development program ghafoor said that promoting educational exchanges and partnerships between the us and maldives would offer an alternative to students who currently go to islamic schools in pakistan and egypt where they could become radicalized as blake suggested ghafoor reach out to us schools and offered assistance to help build publicprivate partnerships such as for example college in the hotel and restaurant management field ghafoor was also keen to pursue parliamentary exchanges and to receive codels in maldives as well as to promote usmaldives caucus or friendship association in congress we suggested he reach out to national democratic institute and international republican institute and that we would help arrange meetings for him with congressional staff ready to assist with detainee 4 s sgc ambassador daniel fried conveyed us appreciation for maldivess willingness to resettle state 00018437 002 of 003 guantanamo detainee ghafoor said maldives is ready to act quickly on the resettlement logistics remain to be worked out between the home ministry and the embassy fried detailed those logistics including finalizing transfer arrangements concluding an exchange of diplomatic notes that would include security measures and requiring gorm permission to notify the candidate fried said we would keep the information close hold until we transferred the detainee noted the offer of 85000 to assist his resettlement expenses and offered to make himself available for interviews should the gorm want help shaping any press messaging fried stressed the importance of working out more detailed security arrangements for the detainee along the lines of those applied in other countries that have accepted guantanamo detainees for resettlement embassy colombo could work directly with the maldivian government on those arrangements climate change maldives seeks concrete action 5 sbu meeting with deputy ssecc jonathan pershing ghafoor referred to copenhagen as stepping stone toward legally binding agreement maldives is prepared to accept any form of treatyaccord that would lead to concrete action he said he saw reluctance within the united states congress to take action he would like maldivian president nasheed to have the opportunity to speak before congress in order to provide sincere voice for the urgency of climate change pershing asked if ghafoor had sense of why only 105 of 192 countries had associated themselves with the accord ghafoor replied that following the commitments of the us china and india at copenhagen and despite opposition from small vocal minority of countries there had been political shift many countries from caricom the african union led by ethiopia and aosis will come to associate with copenhagen and engage on subsequent agreements these coalitions must be coaxed and not pushed into making decisions and meeting deadlines pershing noted that chairmanship of organizational meetings was vital 6 sbu ghafoor added that maldives would like to see that small countries like maldives that are at the forefront of the climate debate receive tangible assistance from the larger economies other nations would then come to realize that there are advantages to be gained by compliance pershing noted that copenhagen provides generic framework for assistance but that the next steps are procedural he asked about maldivian adaptation programs ghafoor referred to several projects including harbor deepening and strengthening sea walls that are in the development stage these projects would cost approximately 50 million pershing encouraged ghafoor to provide concrete examples and specific costs in order to increase the likelihood of bilateral assistance and congressional appropriations ghafoor proposed that president obama deliver speech on climate change from maldives when he next visits the region he said maldives would provide dramatic backdrop and draw further attention to environmental challenges the islands face strengthening security cooperation 7 sbu meeting with deputy assistant secretary for defense for south and southeast asia robert scher ghafoor expressed appreciation for the warm reception he had been receiving in washington he said that maldivian soldiers and police many now senior staff officials that were trained by the us have earned the respect of both the government and the citizens of maldives note ghafoors brother is retired director of the maldivian national defense force end note he said he looked forward to continued cooperation in this field scher asked how us training state 00018437 003 of 003 compared with that of india in terms of quantity and quality ghafoor said that both were substantive and substantial he acknowledged that maldives also interacts with bangladesh sri lanka and pakistan as one might expect of 100 percent muslim country situated in the region scher indicated that the us did not want to get in the way of maldivian relationships with its neighbors ghafoor assessed that new delhis perception of the us has evolved and that male would be able to address any concerns he stated that his government would not let relations with india impact relations with the united states reflecting maldivess attempt to show balance in the past ghafoor replied that if necessary maldives would explain that neither india nor pakistan need suspect anything untoward ghafoor also noted that young people can receive free education in islamic studies in egypt and pakistan scher asked if all of the students return to maldives after their studies ghafoor said that some had been apprehended in round ups in pakistan where they had been recruited by extremists he said he believed that such exposure led to rise in fundamentalist views within maldivess peaceful and tolerant culture it used to be simply question of faith now you must show that you are more muslim than others he said increased access to liberal western education would help to combat growing fundamentalist trends he suggested scher pointed out that that some groups would hope to exploit this lack of education and that it was good to hear that maldivian authorities were actively monitoring the situation ghafoor acknowledged that human rights must allow for freedom of expression and said maldives is looking for guidance on how to peaceably marry two often conflicting agendas freedom and internal security scher replied that hatred is better faced headon by benevolent government rather than pushed underground 8 sbu ghafoor noted that drug use in maldives has led to rise in crime that president nasheed has pledged to combat with prevention and rehabilitation in the past criminals were simply banished to different island he inquired about training assistance with management of prison facilities and the training of correctional officers scher pointed out that this would be matter better addressed by stateinl doj and usaid ghafoor noted that 99 percent of maldives is extremely vulnerable to attack from the sea more specifically he said that an attack such as by somali pirates on an island resort would cripple the countrys economy maldives is seeking additional equipment and training from the us on customs and border security scher expressed dods interest in expanding bilateral defense and security engagement continuing training and helping build the maldivess maritime security capabilities to counteract the threat from terrorism piracy and trafficking clinton
