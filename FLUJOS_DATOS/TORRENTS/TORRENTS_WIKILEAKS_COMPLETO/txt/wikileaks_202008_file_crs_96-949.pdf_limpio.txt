by pl 106554 required omb to issue guidelines for federal data quality and provided for mechanism for public correction of erroneous data this report will not be updated introduction from the beginning of federal environmental programs the costs they might impose on industry and business state and local governments and consumers and taxpayers have generated concern as result the evolution of environmental statutes has been paralleled by efforts to improve costbenefit analysis and risk assessment to help set priorities and to determine appropriate levels of regulation but these developments have not been without controversy proponents of requiring risk assessment and costbenefit analyses believe that the resulting data even if flawed can usefully inform regulatory decisions opponentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96949crs2 1 see rogelio garcia federal regulatory reform an overview crs issue brief ib95035 2 authorizations for appropriations for most environmental statutes had expired by the end of the 104th congress so those seeking change anticipated the opportunity to amend them house rule requires current authorization before an appropriation bill can be considered although requirement is often waived permanent program authorities do not expirefear that statutorily requiring such analyses can result in the environmental protection agency epa being compelled to conform its decisions to those data regardless of flaws attention has also focused on costs imposed on state and local governments unfunded mandates and on regulatory limitations affecting private property rights takings in general business interests have led support for regulatory reform measures to reduce their costs while environmental stakeholders have opposed such measures for fear they would diminish environmental protections through the 103rd congress most legislative initiatives to address these issues were unsuccessful but the white house imposed administrative requirements for costbenefit and risk analyses executive order 12866 october 4 1993 which superseded earlier eos on the subject and for analysis by agencies of takings resulting from regulatory actions eo 12630 march 15 1988 the environmental regulatory reform initiatives followed two primary channels in one environmental regulations would be subject to comprehensive regulatory reforms1 in the other environmental regulatory programs would be revised statuteby statute as each was reauthorized2 regulatory reform in the 104th congress with new republican majorities in the house and senate the 104th congress approached the reform of environmental protection regulations in several ways broadbased reforms of regulatory decisionmaking procedures the 104th congress acted on number of bills revising regulatory decisionmaking processes an unfunded mandates bill pl 1042 provides that points of order may be raised in the house or senate to ensure congressional consideration of unfunded mandates projected to impose costs of more than 50 million on states and cities it also requires agencies to prepare costbenefit analyses for regulations costing 100 million or more in effect codifying part of eo 12866 it was followed by initiatives for paperwork reduction pl 10413 and small business regulatory reform title ii of pl 104121 the latter required regulatory flexibility analyses of regulations impacting small business removed bar to judicial review of such analyses and provided for panels comprised of small business representatives to advise on the impact of epa and other agencies regulations it also included congressional review act which requires agencies to submit new regulations to the congress and the general accounting office gao assesses the agencies compliance with procedures eg regarding costbenefit analysis and congress has 60 legislative days to review and disapprove the new regulations with expedited procedures for senate action provision of the fy1997 omnibus appropriations bill pl 104208 directed the office of management and budget to submit annual reports estimating total annual costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96949crs3 and benefits of federal regulations omb published the first report to congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations on september 30 1997 other comprehensive regulatory reform bills received congressional action but were not enacted the house passed hr 9 derived from the house republicans contract with america which addressed risk assessment costbene fit analysis and regulatory takings the senate extensively debated similar bill s 343 reported by the judiciary committee regulatory reform package was attached to bill raising the debt ceiling hr 2586 which the president vetoed disagreements that stymied these efforts to change regulatory decisionmaking procedures included whether to make costbenefit analysis just one factor informing regulatory decisions as under the unfunded mandates law and eo 12866 or to impose netbenefit test benefits justify costs before regulation could go forward as required by hr 9 and s 343 whether to apply new criteria only to new regulations or also existing ones the costs and impacts of takings compensation and the extent of judicial review appropriations riders numerous regulatory reform riders were attached to fy1996 appropriations bills for epa and other agencies this effort peaked in house passage of hr 2099 the fy1996 vahudindependent agencies appropriations bill the house approved 17 major riders prohibiting epa from spending fy1996 funds on number of regulatory and enforcement activities while such riders are not unusual the number attached to hr 2099 and their content and perceived breadth of impact generated much controversy after legislative skirmishes many riders were dropped or softened in the end the white house vetoed the bill primarily because of objections to funding amounts but also cited legislative riders that were tacked onto the bill without any hearings or adequate public input epas funding ultimately came through the omnibus fy1996 appropriations act pl 104134 which included only narrowly targeted riders for fy1997 fewer riders were directed at environmental regulations corrections day calendar corrections day an innovation of the 104th congress established special procedure in the house for taking up bills to correct or repeal particularly troublesome or obsolete regulatory provisions number of bills directed at environmental regulations appeared on the corrections day calendar and several passed programspecific reforms amendments and reauthorizations the first environmental reauthorization bill considered by the 104th congress was hr 961 amendments to the clean water act cwa after contentious debate hr 961 passed the house 240185 however the senate took action on the bill with hr 961 and hr 9 and s 343 stalled in the senate and vetoes having blocked many regulatory riders momentum shifted toward negotiated reforms directed at individual programs these negotiations led to reform of the pesticide regulatory program enacted as the food quality protection act fqpa pl 104170 and to amendment and reauthorization of the safe drinking water act pl 104182 with broad agreement that the bills increased future costeffectiveness and gave epa flexibility to address highpriority risks both measures passed the house and senate by wide margins in related area congress enacted the accountable pipeline safety and partnership act of 1996 pl 104304 which requires the secretary of transportation to issue pipeline safety regulations only upon reasoned determination that the benefits of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96949crs4 3 robert meltz the property rights issues crs report 95200intended standard justify its costs environmental groups opposed the bill saying inter alia that this language set precedent for imposing netbenefit test on environmental regulations regulatory reform in the 105th congress the 105th congress continued regulatory reform efforts including comprehensive bills emphasizing risk and costbenefit analyses private property takings reforms and reauthorization and amendment of individual statutes notably superfund it also focused oversight on several environmental program activities particularly november 1996 epa proposal to tighten air quality standards for ozone and particulates comprehensive regulatory refo rm efforts to accomplish comprehensive regulatory reform centered on bipartisan senate bill s 981 the regulatory improve ment act of 1997 introduced by senators thompson and levin the bill would have required regulatory agencies to perform costbenefit analyses and risk assessments on major new rules those having an economic impact of more than 100 million per year business and industry groups supported the bill claiming that it would reduce the cost of regulation without endangering the environment or the publics health or safety labor environmental and other groups opposed the bill claiming that it would undermine existing health safety and environmental regulations s 981 was reported by the governmental affairs committee on may 111998 proposed amendments released july 15 1998 contained revised language addressing various administration and public interest group concerns with the original bill for example the proposal raised the threshold for peer review of costbenefit analyses to 500 million per year the administration gave qualified support but floor action occurred for fy1998 and fy1999 congress continued language in appropriations bills pl 10561 and pl 105277 that required omb to report to congress estimates of the annual costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs and of major rules the fy1999 language also directed omb to issue guidelines to agencies to standardize measures of costs and benefits and to issue guidance for agencies in meeting their obligations under the congressional review act the regulatory flexibility act and the unfunded mandates act in another initiative the house committees on judiciary and on government reform and oversight reported hr 1704 which would have created congressional office for regulatory analysis to help oversee activities of the office of information and regulatory affairs of omb to review agency rulemakings and agency compliance with regulatory review requirements and to prepare an annual report estimating the total cost and benefits of all existing federal regulations floor action on hr 1704 occurred private property takings reform3 private property takings concerns arise primarily from actions under the endangered species act and the wetlands protection provision 404 of the clean water act in the 105th congress initiatives to address private property takings split off from more comprehensive reform proposals the house passed bill hr 1534 that would have simplified and expedited access to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96949crs5 federal courts for parties alleging private property takings the senate judiciary committee reported hr 1534 but floor action occurred reforming environmental progr ams the success in the 104th congress in finding tradeoffs in both the sdwa amendments and the fqpa suggested that negotiations could lead to agreements on amending other environmental authorizing statutes potential tradeoffs included 1 exchanging more flexibility in few specific high cost requirements desired by states and localities industry and business for procedures to inform the public of remainin g risks desired by environmental stakeholders and 2 bringing down regulatory costs by using marketbased management incentives and disincentives which many believe achieve environmental goals more costeffectively than regulation throughout the 105th congress superfund was focal point of efforts to achieve compromise reform but negotiations among stakeholders to resolve disagreements both on which issues to address and on how to solve them proved unsuccessful oversight of implementation in november 1996 epa proposed tightening ozone and particulate standards under the clean air act which requires epa to set national ambient air quality standards on the basis of health the proposals generated much controversy opponents charged that epas decisions were not supported by adequate scientific evidence that costs would be excessive and that epa did not follow proper procedu res in proposing them by failing to comply with requirements of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act sbrefa the regulatory flexibility act and the unfunded mandates reform act during the 105th congress some 28 days of oversight hearings addressed these issues on july 18 1997 epa published its final decisions on the standard s to become effective in september this triggered the new sbrefa review authority by which congress could consider joint resolution of disapproval with special procedures in the senate to ensure floor consideration within 60 legislative days bills to delay the new standards were introduced including hr 1984 and s 1084 with hearing held on the latter neither of these bills was reported from committee however congress did include provision in the transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178 to codify implementation dates for the new ozone and particulate air quality standards and also to mesh implementation of related regional haze regulatory program proposed by the agency on july 31 1997 some appropriations riders were enacted as well for example by bipartisan agreement rider in the omnibus consolidated and emergen cy appropriations act 1999 pl 105277 extended deadline for phasing out methyl bromide pesticide regulatory reform in the 106th congress although epa administrative reforms addressed some complaints about regulatory costs and inflexibility congressional oversight of regulatory actions continued and regulatory reform efforts persisted comprehensive regulatory reform in the first session provision in pl 10658 the treasury postal and general government appropriations act for fy2000 repeated language from earlier years directing omb to assess total costs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96949crs6 benefits of federal regulations in the second session this requirement was made permanent by provision 624 of hr 5658 enacted by the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106 554 the same legislation 515 of hr 5658 directed omb to write guidelines for federal agencies to follow in ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information including statistical information disseminated by federal agencies in fulfillment of the purposes and provisions of chapter 35 of title 44 united states code commonly referred to as the paperwork reduction act the provision further requires agencies to establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the guidelines also in the second session congress passed the truth in regulating act pl 106312 114 stat 1248 which establishes 3year pilot project for the general accounting office to evaluate and send reports to congress on major rules issued by federal agencies specifically when new rule is issued the statute authorizes the chairman or ranking member of committee of jurisdiction of either house of congress to request gao to assess the benefits and costs of the rule and to evaluate the agencys analysis of alternative approaches the house passed hr 1074 the regulatory righttoknow act hr 350 amending the unfunded mandates act to require congressional budget office estimate of impacts hr 391 amending the small business paperwork reduction act to limit the authority of regulators to impose civil fines on small businesses for firsttime paperwork offenses and hr 2372 allowing private property holders to go directly to federal courts to seek compensation in land takings disputes the senate took action on these bills its comprehensive reform effort was s 746 the regulatory improvemen t act of 1999 it would have required agencies to prepare costbenefit analysis and risk assessment of major new rules s 746 was reported from committee but floor action occurred environmental programs number of narrowly drawn provisions were enacted primarily concerning water quality none of the environmental statutes was reauthorized oversight continued and in the absence of broader reforms congress passed several appropriatio ns riders addressing variety of particularly contentious regulatory issues for example one rider to epas fy2001 appropriations bill pl 106377 prohibited epa from designating areas not in attainment with the new 8hour ozone air quality standard prior to decision by the supreme court in american trucking v epa which challenged the standard or june 15 2001 whichever occurs earlier second target was epas total maximum daily load tmdl program to restore polluted waters the fy2001 military construction and emergency supplemental appropriations law pl 106246 included provision to prevent epa from spending any funds in fy2000 or fy2001 to finalize or implement the tmdl program but epa finalized the regulations before the prohibition took effect epas funding bill for fy2001 pl 106377 included report language requiring studies by the national academy of sciences and epa on the scientific basis of the tmdl rule and on the potential costs of implementing the program another target was the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases which has not been submitted to the senate for ratification language to prohibit actions that would implement or prepare for implementation of the kyoto protocol appeared in fy2000 andor fy2001appropriations bills for epa and the departments of energy agriculture interior commerce and state
