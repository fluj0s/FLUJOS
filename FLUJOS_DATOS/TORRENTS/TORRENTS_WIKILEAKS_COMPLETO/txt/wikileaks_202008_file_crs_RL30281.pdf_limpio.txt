capital crimes made punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for any term of years the suggestion that sentence of imprisonment for zero years is sentence any term of years being inconsistent with the intent of congress given the seriousness of th offense to which the sentence attaches sentencing court the refore has discretion but to impose sentence of imprisonment at

minimum sentencing provisions and related terms refer to statutory provisions requiring the imposition of at least specified minimum sentence when criteria specified in the relevant statute have been

under the system an applicable sentencing guideline has been designated for each of more14 frequently prosecuted federal c rimes the guideline begins by assigning base offense level for example the guideline for theft offenses ussg 2b11 has base offense level of 4 offense level adjustments are available to accommodate the aggravating and mitigatin g circumstances associated with particular cas the theft guideline for instance has offense level increases for the amount of money involved the amount of planning that went into the offense and the nature of the property taken among other things the final offense leve l dictates band of six sentence ranges the final range is determined by the offenders criminal history the sentencing range for theft at the base offense level 4 for first time offender is 06 that i s absent departure sentencing court might impose sentence of imprisonment at any term up to six months or simply impose fine the sentencing range for an offense level of 4 in the case of an offender with more than 4 prior felony convictions is 612 that is absent departure sentence court must impose sentence of incarceration set between six and twelve monthsthe piggyback statutes mak up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to underlying statute with mandatory minimums or otherwise 11 the final and least obvious group is comprised of statutes who violation results in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law or more precisely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencin g guidelines issued in its name12 most federal criminal laws do not mentio n mandatory minimum sentence they simply establish maximum fine and maximum term of imprisonment and indicate that subject to those maximum levels the court may sentence an offender to either fine or term of imprisonmen t or both the sentencing guidelines convert many of13 these

about abolishing or even drastically curtailing probation the commission however drafted guideline s containing presumptive sentence of imprisonment for every f elony in the united states code near the bottom of the scale of crimes it established several ranges in which court could select either prison or probation the result is that the incidence of probation since th guidelines has b een cut

previousl resulted in an acquittal in state court as well as the possibility that the police office r defendants might be at extraordinary risk of abuse if imprisoned 518 us at 11112 the frequency of these departures and thus the extent of judicial discretion remaining under the guidelines is somewhat difficul t to gauge the most recent sentencing commission statistics indicate that federal judges grant downward departure from the applicabl sentencing guideline range in about one out of every ten cases 136 in more than third 38 of these the departure was as consequence of administrative action rather than at the unbridled discretion of the court ie plea bargain or future deportation of the defendant moreover majority of the cases ordering downward dep arture and appealed were reversed and finally there is indication how many if any of the departures resulted in sentence other than imprisonment united states sentencing commission 19 98 sourcebook of federal sentencing statistics figure

to reduc disparity but see stith c abranes f ear of judging 106 1998our analysis suggests four major conclusions 1 interjudge sentence variation was not as rampant or as shameful in the federal courts under the preguidelines regime as congress apparently believed 2 thorough empirical study has monstrated reduction in the total amount of disparity under the guidelines 3 while reduction of interjudge disparity is worthwhile goal it is complex goal and myopic focus on this objective can result in system that too often ignores other equally important goals of just sentencing system 4 important

guideli nes work to reduce judicial sentencing discretion and in fact might be characterized as creating host of new members of the species f mandatory minimums the notless than mandatory minimums have been criticized as incompatible with the feder sentencing guidelines perhaps most prominent among its critics was the sentencing commission itself its report after sketching th argument s traditionally offered in support of mandatory minimums observed that43 only 4 of the 60 mandatory minimums were regularly prosecuted44 mandatory minimums induce new sentencing disparities45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30281crs12 commission report at iii since the charging and plea negotiation processes are neither46 open to public review nor generally reviewable by the courts the honesty and truth i n sentenc ing intended by the guidelines system is compromised there are two basi c responses to this critique fir st prosecutors undoubtedly do through charging decisions and plea bargains sometimes seek or agree to lower than th maximum possible sentences they have always done that w ith respect to charging decisions the guidelines themselves do not even attempt to l imit the historical practice indeed it is difficult to imagine system which could eliminate prosecutorial charging discretion nonetheless the justice departmen t recognized at the outset that unrestrained preindictment bargaining over charges would undermine the guidel ines therefore it issued internal directives that prosecutors are to charge the most serious re adily provable offense consistent with the nature of the defendants conduct as for plea bargains after indictment the primary justification of the relevant conduct guideline is to ensure that prosecutors cannot manipulate sentences by dismissin g courts as long as the judge knows all the facts the precise charge of which defendant is convicted is usually of little consequence except to set the statutory maximum sentence thus in rder to really control sentences through plea bargaining prosecutor must b willing to hide facts from the court the truth is that most prosecutors most of the time play the sentenci ng game straight down the middle to achieve plea bargains they will give defendants the benefit of close cla ss on the provability of certain facts or on the applicability of certain enhancements to the undoubte d facts of given case but they will not lie and they will not conceal evidence the conseque nce is that prosecutors too have had their discretion restrained by the guidelines bowman the quality of mercy must be restrained and other lessons in learning to love the federal sentencing guidelines 1996 w isconsin law review 679 72728 commission report at iii the disparate impact of the federal sentencing practices 47 including m andatory minimums has been the subject to extensive debate see eg wallace federal cocaine sentencing legal issues crs rep 97743a may 4 1999 second look at crack cocaine

offense dollar loss in fraud offense weapon use victim injury or death the defendants role in the offense and whether th defendant accepted responsibility for the offense or on the other hand obstructed justice mandatory minimums in contrast typically look to only one or sometimes two measurements of offense seriousness thus for example whether the defendant was periphera l participant or the drug rings kingpin whether the defendant used weapon whether the defendant accepted responsibility or on the other hand obstructed justice have bearing on the mandatory minimum to which each defendant is exposed thes arguments would seem to be most persuasive in the case of flat sentence mandator due to plea bargaining 35 of the defendants who might have been charged and sentenced under mandatory minimums were not46 dispar ate application of mandatory minimum sentences appears to b related to race47 mandatory minimums lack the capacity to consider the range of aggravatin g and mitigating circumstances that may attend the same offense and as consequence produce unwarranted sentencing uniformity48httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30281crs13 minimums in other instances the range between the mandatory minimum and the statutor maximum would seem to provide ample room for the type of distinctions just mentioned commission report at iii while mandatory minimum sentences may increase severity49 the data suggest that uneven application may dramatically reduce certainty the consequences of this bifurcated pattern is likely to thwart the deterrent value of mandatory minimums proponents might suggest that incapacitation and the prospect of minimal punishment were always the principal objectives deterrence is at best challenging to judge the fact that not all possible cases receive mandatory minimum treatment is not reason to abando n incapacitation for those that are unsnarled and the result is one more properly laid to the door of prosecutorial discretion than to mandatory minimums commiss ion report at iii since the power to determine the charge of conviction rest s50 exclusively with the prosecution for 85 percent of the cases that do not proceed to trial mandato ry minimums transfer sentencing power from the court to the prosecution to th extent that prosecutorial discretion is exercis ed with preference to some and not to others and to the extent that some are convicted of conduct ca rrying mandatory minimum penalty while others who engage in the same or similar conduct are not so convicted disparity i s reintroduced this presumes that unwarranted disparity existed before the guidelines that the guidelines have reduced or eliminated it and that mandatory minimums returned it to the system three proposit ions upon which there is consensus even if one accepts all three the question remains whether disparity produced by plea agreements that make possible the conviction of other wrongdoers is unwarranted or ap propriately laid to the door of mandatory minimums commission report at 29 the cliff effect of mandatory minimums related to th e51 proporti onality problems posed in mandatory minimums already described are the shar p differences in sentence between defendants who fall just below the threshold of mandatory minimu m compared with those whose criminal conduct just meets the criteria of th mandat ory minimum penalty just as mandatory minimums fail to distinguish amon g defendants whose conduct and prior records in fact differ markedly they distinguish far too greatly among defendants who have committed offense conduct of highly comparabl seriousne ss critics might suggest that such cliffs are natural necessary and frequentl occurring in the law eg the age of majority alcohol blood levels statutes of limitations or that few cliffs are as high as t he one that stands between crime committed the day before the effective date of the guidelines and one committed the day after commission report at iv

potential to deter49 mandatory minimums breed disparity by transferring judicial discretion to the prosecution 50 in contras t to the calibrated approach of the guidelines mandatory minimums create

in the capital punishment cases following furman v georgia 408 us 238 1972 61 when the capital punishment statutes enacted in response to furman came before the court one of the threshold questions was whether capital punishment was per violation f the cruel and unusual punishments clause for plurality of the court that question could only be answered by determining whether capita l punishment was of necessity grossly out of proportion to the severity of any crime gregg v georgi 428 us 153 173 1976 when life has been taken deliberately by the offender the court could not say that the punishment i s invariably disproportionate to the crime 428 us at 187 in coker v georgia plurality of the court found that death is indeed disproportionate penalty for the crim of raping an adult woman 433 us 583 597 1977 it did so after considering the general repudiation of the death penalty in such cases by the legislatures of other jurisdictions the infrequency with which juries i n georgia had been willing to impose the death penalty for rape of adult woman and the comparative severity georgia used to punish other equal ly or more serious crimes the court employed much the same method of analysis in later capita l punishment cases which raised the proportionality doctrine62 initial efforts to carry the proportionality doctrine to noncapital cases prove d unsuccessful shortly after coker petitioner convicted under recidivist statute which called for an automatic life sentence upon third felony conviction sought to persuade the court that the eighth amendment precluded such sentence based upon comparative analysis of the severity of the treatment of recidivism in othe r jurisdictions rummel v estelle 445 us 263 1980 t he majority of the court was not persuaded the

application of th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30281crs17 see also hutto v davis 454 us 370 37273 1982 which summarized rummel as63 follows like the respondent in this case rummel argued that the length of hi s imprisonment was so grossly disproportionate to th crime for which he was sentenced that it violated the ban on cruel and unusual punishment of the eighth and fourteenth amendments in rejecting that argument we dis tinguished between punishments such as the death penalty which by their very nature differ from all other forms f conventionally accepted punishments and punishments which differ from others onl in duration this distinction was based upon two factors first this courts eight h amendment judgments should neither be nor appear to be merely the subjective views of individual justices and second the excessiveness of one prison term as compared to another is invariably subjective determination there being clear way to mak any constitutional distinction between one term of years and shorter or longer term of years thus we concluded that one could argue without fear of contradiction by any decision of this court that for crimes concededly classified and classifiable s felonies the length of th sentence actually imposed is purely matter of legislative prerogative accordingly we held that rummels life sentence did not violate th constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment rummel with prior two nonviolent felony convictions was sentenced to life imprisonment64 for obtaining 120 under false pretenses helms the solem defendant with six prio r nonviolent felony convictions was sentenced to life imprisonment for uttering 100 n account check the court distinguished solem from rummel on at least two grounds solem was ineligible for parole while rummel enj oyed the advantage of fairly liberal early release scheme in solem the life sentence without possibility of parole was imposed as matter of judicial discretion while the life sentence in rummel was required as matter of legislative policy 463 us at 300303proportionality doctrine would constitute subjective policy making task mor appropriately left to the legislative bodies 445 us at 27563 any thoughts that the proportionality doc trine might have been abandoned were dashed almost immediately by solem v helm 463 us 277 1983 solem declared that imposition of mandatory term of life imprisonment under state recidivis t statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment the objective criteria whic h guided proportionality analysis included i the gravity of the offense and th harshness of the penalty ii the sentences imposed on the other criminals in the same jurisdiction and iii the sentences imposed for commi ssion of the same crime in other jurisdictions 463 us at 29264 individualized consideration furman found that the eighth amendments crue l and unusual punishments clause made binding upon the states by the due proces s clause of the fourteenth amendment precluded

offense in order to arrive at just and appropriate sentence has been viewed as progressive and humanizing develop ment while the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencin g determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than constitutional imperative we believe that in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the eighth amendment requires consideration of th character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of th particular offense as constitutionally indispensable part of the process f inflicting the penalty of death 428 us at 304 citations omitted65 the court regularly and consistently recognized the individual consideration s requirement in subsequent capital punishment cases although the language cite d66 above and other dicta would seem to apply with similar for ce in noncapital cases the67 court emphasized that the doctrine was limited to capital cases68httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30281crs19 ohio 438 us at 604605 four principles dictate high proportionality threshold for plurality of the court69 the first is that the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves substantive penological judgment that as general matter is properly within th province of legislatures not courts the efficacy of any sentencing system cannot be assessed absent greement on the purposes and objectives of the penal system and the responsibility for making these fundamental choi ces and implementing them lies with the legislature the second principle is that the eighth amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory the principles which have guided criminal sentencing have varied with the times the federal and state criminal systems have accorde d different weights at different times to the penological goals of retribution deterrence incapacitation and rehabilitation and competing theories of mandatory an d discretionary sentencing have been in varying degrees of ascendancy or decline since the beginning of the republic third marked divergences both in underlying theories of sentencing and in th length of prescribed prison terms are the inev itable often beneficial result of the federal structure state sentencing schemes may emb ody different penological assumptions making interstate comparison of sentences difficult and i mperfect enterprise and even assuming identical philosophies differing attitudes and perceptions of local conditions may yield different ye t rational conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prisonharmelin harmelin first time offender was convicted of possession of 67 2 grams of cocaine enough for possibly as many as 65000 individual doses under the laws of the state of michiga n the conviction carried with it mandatory sentence of

other crimes in the same jurisdiction and for the same crime i n other jurisdictions 501 us at 1004 more precisely t he plurality emphasized that the eighth amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence rather it forbids onl extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime 501 us at 100169httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30281crs20 terms for par ticular crimes thus the circumstance that state has the most sever punishm ent for particular crime does not by itself render the punishment grossl disproportionate absent consti tutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of fede ralism some state will always bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other state the fourth prin ciple is that proportionality review by federal courts should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent our decision s recognize that we lack clear objective standards to distinguish between sentences fo r different terms of years although penalty is per constitutional the relativ lack of objective standards concerning terms of imprisonment has meant that outside the context of capital punishment successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences are exceedingly rare 501 us at 9981001 citations omittedin the case of harmelin the sentence was n ot grossly disproportionate because of the severity of his crime ie the pe rnicious effects of the drug epidemic in this country demonstrate that the legislature could with reason conclude that the threa t posed to the individual and society by possession of this large an amount of cocaine in terms of violence crime and social displacement is momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and r etribution of life

this one we should do so only in the most extreme circumstance in asserting the constitutionality of this mandatory sentence i offer n judgment on its wisdom mandatory sentencing schemes can be criticized fo r depriving judges of the power to exercise individual discreti on when remorse and acknowledgment of guilt or other extenuating facts present what might seem compelling case for departure from the maximum on the other hand broad and unreviewed discretion exercised by sentencing judges leads to the perception that clear standards are being ap plied and that the rule of law is imperiled by sentences i mposed for discernible reason other than the subjective reactions of the sen tencing judge the debate illustrates that as noted at the outset arguments for and against particular sentencing schemes are for legislatures to resolve 501 us at 10061007 after harmelin since harmelin the lower federal courts have regularly an d uniformly rejected eighth amendmen t

offend both the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses they are contrary to double jeopardy it is said because by using first conviction to justif an increased penalty for second conviction they are in effect punishing the first offense twice they contravene ex post fact proscript ion when they are used to sentence defendant whose first convictio n predates the recidivist statute or so it is contended the courts have rejected both arguments as the supreme court explained when it rejected the double jeopardy challenge to the california three strikes statute historically we have found double jeopardy protections inapplicable t sentencing proceedings because the determinations at issue do not place defendant in jeopardy for an offense see eg nichols v united states 511 us 738 7 47 1994noting that repeatoffender laws penalize only the last offense committed by the defendant nor have sentence enhancements bene construed s additional punishment for the previous offense rather they act to increase sentence bec ause of the manner in which the defendant committed the crime of conviction an enhanced sentence imposed on persisten t offender thus is not to be viewed s either new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes but as stiffened penalty for the latest crime which i s considered to be an aggravated offense because repetitive one monge v california 118 sct
