captured in afghanistan and is alleged to have worked for osama bin laden as body guard and driver brought this challenge to the lawfulness of the secretary of defenses plan to try him for alleged war crimes before military commission4 arguing that the military commission rules and procedures were inconsistent with the ucmj5 and that he had the right to be treated as prisoner of war under the geneva conventions6 us district judge r obertson agreed finding inherent authority in the president as comma nderinchief of the armed forces to create such tribunals outside of the existing st atutory authority with which the military commission rules did not comply he also c oncluded that the gene va conventions apply to the whole of the conflict in afghanista n including under their protections all persons detained in connection with the hostilities there7 and that hamdan was thus entitled to be treated as prisoner of war until his status was determined to be otherwise by competent tribunal in accordance with article 5 of the third geneva conventi on prisoners of war the dc circuit court of appeals reverse d ruling that the geneva conventions are not judicially enforceable judge williams wrote concurring opinion construing common article 3 to apply to an conflict with nonstate actor8 without regard to the geographical confinement of such conflict within the borders of signatory state the circuit court interpreted the ucmj language to mean that military commission rules have only to be consistent with those articles of the ucmj that refer specifically to military commissions and therefore need not be uniform with the rules that apply to courts martial the supreme court granted review and reversed jurisdiction before reaching the merits of the case the supreme court declined

whose petitions had already been filed10 the court also declined to dismiss the appeal as urged by the government on the basis that federal courts should abstain from intervening in cases before military tribunals that have not been finally decided11 noting the dissimilarities between military commission trials and ordinary courtsmartial of service members pursuant to procedures established by congress12 the governments argument that the petitioner had rights conferred by the geneva conventions that coul d be adjudicated in federal court likewise did not persuade the court to dismiss the case regardless of whether the geneva conventions provide rights enforceable in article iii courts the court f ound that congress by incorporating the law of war into ucmj article 2113 brought the geneva conventions within the scope of law to be applied by courts justice scalia joined by justices thomas and alito dissented arguing that the dta should be in terpreted to preclude the courts review presidential authority with respect to the authority to create the military commissions the court held that any power to create them must flow from the constitution and must be among those powers granted jointly to the president and congress in time of war14 it disagreed with the governments position that congress had authorized the commissions either when it passed the authorization to use military force aumf15 or the dta although the court assumed that the aumf activated the presidents war powers it did not view the aumf as expanding the presidents powers be yond the authorization set forth in the ucmj the court also noted that the dta while recognizing the existence of military commissions does not specifically authorize them at most these statutes acknowledge general presidential author ity to convene military commissi ons in circumstances where justified under the constitution and ws including the law of war16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22466crs4 17 the government took the position that the ry to or consistent with language applies only with respect to parts of the ucmj that make specific reference to military commissions 18 the term military tribunal in the ucmj shoul d be interpreted to cover all forms of military courts encompassing courtsmartial as well as military commissions 19 hamdan slip op at 59 20 id at 61 regarding the defendants right to be

offenders and offenses that are by statute or by the law of war consigned to such tribunals the ucmj provides limitations with respect to the procedural rules that may be employed article 36 10 usc 836 authorizes the president to prescr ibe rules for pretrial trial and posttrial procedures including modes of proof for cases arising under this chapter triable in courtsmartial military commissions and ot her military tribunals such rules are to apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts insofar as the president considers practicable but which may not be contrary to or inc onsistent with the ucmj in addition rules made pursuant to this authority shall be uni form insofar as practicable the president had determined with respect to the military commissions that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts but made determination with respect to the practicability of applying rules different from those that apply in courtsmartial17 the court interpreted article 36 to provide the president discretion to determine which federal court rules need not be applied by various military tribunals18 due to their impracticability however the court read the uniformity requirement as according less discretion to the president to determine what is practicable when providing different rules for courtsmartial military commissi ons and other milita ry tribunals19 unlike the requirement for rules to track closely with federal court rules which the president need follow only insofar as he deems practicable the court reasoned the uniformity requirement applies unl ess its application is demonstrably impracticable thus less deference was found owing and the court found that the government had failed to demonstrate that circumstances make any courtsmartial rules impracticable for use in military co mmissions further the court f ound that some of the rules provided in the defense department rules set forth in military commission order 1 mco 1 in particular the provision allowing the excl usion of the defendant from attending portions of his trial or hearing some of the evidence against him deviated substantially from the procedures that apply in courtsmar tial in violation of ucmj article 3620 the geneva conventions and the law of war rejecting the dc circuits view that th geneva conventions are never enforceable in federal courts21 the supreme court found the conventions to be part of the law of warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22466crs5 22 hamdan slip op at 63 23 gpw art 3 1d the identical provision is included in each of the four geneva conventions and applies to any conflict not of an internati onal character the majority declined to accept the presidents interpretation of common article 3 as inapplicable to the conflict with qaeda and interpreted the phrase in contradistinction to conflict between nations which the geneva conventions designate conflict of international character hamdan slip op at 67 24 id at 70 plurality opinion id kennedy j concurring at

opinionciting art 21 ucmj 10 usc 821and thus relevant to the in terpretation of ucmj article 21 because compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the aut hority set forth in ar ticle 21 is granted22 in response to the alternative holding by the court below that hamdan as putative member of qaeda was not entitled to an of the protections accorded by the geneva conventions the court concluded that co mmon article 3 of th geneva conventions applies even to members of qaeda according to them minimum baseline of protections including protection from the pa ssing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pr onounced by regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples23 while recognizing that common article 3 obviously tolerates great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during armed conflict and that its requirements are general ones crafted to acco mmodate wide variety of legal systems the court found that the military commissions under mco 1 do not meet these criteria in particular th military commissions are not r egularly constituted because they deviate too far in the courts view from the rules that apply to courtsmartial without satisfactory explanation of the need for such deviation24 justice stevens joined by justices ginsburg breyer and souter explored the history of military commission practice in the united states and internationally to conclude that conspiracy the only charge l odged against the defendant is not universally recognized as war crime and thus does not conform to the ucmj requirement in article 21 that permits jurisdiction only over offenses that by the law of war may be tried by military commission25 justice kennedy did not join in this part of the opinion finding the discussion unnecessary in light of the courts determination that the military commissions do not conform to the ucmj jus tice alito joined by justices scalia and thomas dissented arguing that the court is bound to defer to the presidents plausible interpretation of the treaty language analysis while the hamdan court declared the military commissions as currently constituted to be illegal it left open the possibility that changes to the military commission rules could cure any defects by bringing them within the law of war and conformity with the ucmj the court also suggested as emphasi zed in concurrence by justice ginsburg that the president retains the option of asking congress to authorize or craft rules

constitutional scrutiny 29 youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 343 us 579 1952to the global war on terrorism gwot howe ver the court did not resolve the extent to which the constitution restricts congresss authority to establish rules that is whether the detainees as aliens held outside of us territory have constitutional rights enforceable in federal court if congress wishes to exempt the commissions from compliance with treaty obligations the court may require it to do so clearly the decision may affect the treatment of detainees outside of their criminal trials for example in interrogations for intelligence purposes common article 3 of the geneva conventions mandates that all persons taking active part in hostilities including those who have laid down their arms or been incapac itated by capture or injury are to be treated humanely and protected from violence to lif and person torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment insofar as these protections are incorporated in the ucmj and other laws it would seem the court is ready to interpret and adjudicate them to the extent it retains jurisdiction to do so it is not clear how the court views the scope of the gwot however because its decisions on the merits have been limited to cases arising out of hostilities in afghanistan the opinion reaffirms the holding in rasul v bush26 that the gwot does not provide the president bla nk check and by finding in favor of noncitizen held overseas seems to have expanded the hamdi comment that whatever power the united states constitution envisions for the executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict it most assuredly envisions role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake27 the dissenting views also relied in good meas ure on actions taken by congress seemingly repudiating the view expressed earlier by th executive that any efforts by congress to legislate with respect to persons captured tained and possibly tr ied in connection with the gwot would be an unconstitutional intrusion into powers held exclusively by the president28 expressly or implicitly all eight participating justices applied the framework set forth by justice jackson in his famous concurrence in the steel seizures case29 which accords greater deference to the president in cases involving national security where he acts with express congressional authority than when he acts alone the differing views among the justices seems to have been f unction of their interpretation of the aumf and other acts of congress as condoning or limiting executive actions for information about relevant legislation see crs report rl31600 the department of defense rules
