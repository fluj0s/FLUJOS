may 1962r revised 5 september 1978 remimeo this bulletin has been revised to correct the definition of dirty needle revision in this type style arc breaks missed withholds how to use this bulletin when an auditor or student has trouble with an arc breaky pc or gain or when an auditor is found to be using freak control methods or processes to keep pc in session the hco sec d of t or d of p should just hand copy of this bulletin to the auditor and make him or her study it and take an hco exam on it after some months of careful observation and tests i can state conclusively that all arc breaks stem from missed withholds this is vital technology vital to the auditor and to anyone who wants to live conversely there are arc breaks when missed withholds have been cleaned up by withhold is meant an undisclosed contrasurvival act by missed withhold is meant an undisclosed contrasurvival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed this is far more important in an auditing session than most auditors have yet realized even when some auditors are told about this and shown it they still seem to miss its importance and fail to use it instead they continue to use strange methods of controlling the pc and oddball processes on arc breaks this is so bad that one auditor let pc die rather than pick up the missed withholds so allergy to picking up missed withholds can be so great that an auditor has been known to fail utterly rather than do so only constant hammering can drive this point home when it is driven home only then can auditing begin to happen across the world the datum is that important an auditing session is 50 technology and 50 application i am responsible for the technology the auditor is wholly responsible for the application only when an auditor realizes this can he or she begin to obtain uniformly marvellous results every where auditor now needs something else some odd mechanism to keep pcs in session picking up missed withholds keeps pcs in session there is need for rough angry arc breaky session if there is one it is not the fault of the pc it is the fault of the auditor the auditor has failed to pick up missed withholds as of now it is not the pc that sets the tone of the session it is the auditor and the auditor who has difficult session providing he or she has used standard technology 2model session and can run an emeter has one only because he or she failed to ask for missed withholds what is called dirty needle an erratic agitation of the needlenot limited in size which is ragged jerky ticking not sweeping and tends to be persistent is caused by missed withholds not withholds technology today is so powerful that it must be flawlessly applied one does his cchs in excellent 2way comm with the pc one has his trs model session and emeter operation completely perfect and one follows exact technology and one keeps the missed withholds picked up there is an exact and precise auditor action and response for every auditing situa tion and for every case we are not today beset by variable approaches the less variable the auditors actions and responses the greater gain in the pc it is terribly precise there is room for flubs further every pc action has an exact auditor response and each of these has its own drill by which it can be learned auditing today is not an art either in technology or procedure it is an exact science this removes scientology from every one of the past practices of the mind medicine advanced only to the degree that its responses by the practitioner were standardized and the practitioner had professional attitude toward the public scientology is far ahead of that today what joy it is to preclear to receive completely standard session to receive textbook session and what gains the pc makes and how easy it is on the auditor it isnt how interesting or clever the auditor is that makes the session its how stan dard the auditor is therein lies pc confidence part of that standard technology is asking for missed withholds any time the pc starts to give any trouble this is to pc totally acceptable control factor and it totally smooths the session you have need for and must not use any arc break process just ask for missed withholds here are some of the manifestations cured by asking for missed withholds 1 pc failing to make progress 2 pc critical of or angry at auditor 3 pc refusing to talk to auditor 4 pc attempting to leave session s pc not desirous of being audited or anybody not desirous of being audited 6 pc boiling off 7 pc exhausted 8 pc feeling foggy at session end 9 dropped havingness 10 pc telling others the auditor is good 11 pc demanding redress of wrongs 12 pc critical of organizations or people of scientology 13 people critical of scientology 14 lack of auditing results 15 dissemination failures 3now i think you will agree that in the above list we have every ill we suffer from in the activities of auditing now please believe when i tell you there is one cure for the lot and only that one there are other cures the cure is contained in the simple question or its variations have i missed withhold on you the commands in case of any of the conditions 1 to 15 above ask the pc one of the following com mands and clean the needle of all instant read ask the exact question you asked the first time as final test the needle must be clean of all instant reaction before you can go on to anything else it helps the pc if each time the needle twitches the auditor says that or there quietly but only to help the pc see what is twitching one doesnt interrupt the pc if he or she is already giving it this prompting is the only use of latent reads in scientologyto help the pc spot what reacted in the first place the commonest questions in this session have i missed withhold on you in this session have i failed to find out something in this session is there something i dont know about you the best beginning rudiments withhold question since the last session is there something you have done that i dont know about prepcheck zero questions follow has somebody failed to find out about you who should have has anyone ever failed to find out something about you is there something i failed to find out about you have you ever successfully hidden something from an auditor have you ever done something somebody failed to discover have you ever evaded discovery in this lifetime have you ever hidden successfully has anyone ever failed to locate you these zeros do not produce what questions until the auditor has located specific overt when prepchecking when running any process but the cchs if any one of the auditing circumstances in 1 to 15 above occurs ask for missed withholds before leaving any chain of overts in prepchecking or during prepchecking ask frequently for missed withholds have i missed any withhold on you or as above do not conclude intensives on any process without cleaning up missed withholds asking for missed withholds does not upset the dictum of using ow processes in rudiments most missed withholds clean up at once on twoway comm providing the auditor doesnt ask leading questions about what the pc is saying twoway comm consists of asking for what the meter showed acknowledging what the pc said and checking the meter again with the missed withhold question if pc says i was mad at my wife as an answer just 4ack and check the meter with the missed withhold question dont say what was she doing in cleaning missed withholds do not use the prepcheck system unless you are prep checking and even in prepchecking if the zero is not missed withhold question and you are only checking for missed withholds amid other activities do it simply as above by twoway comm not by the prepcheck system to get auditing into state of perfection to get clearing general all we have to do is 1 know our basics axioms scales codes the fundamental theory about the thetan and the mind 2 know our practical trs model session emeter cchs prepchecking and clearing routines in actual fact this is not much to ask for the return is smooth results and far far better world an hpahca can learn the data in 1 above and all but clearing routines in the material in 2 an hpahca should know these things to perfection they are not hard to learn additives and interpretations are hard to get around not the actual data and performance __________ knowing these things one also needs to know that all one has to do is clean the emeter of missed withholds to make any pc sit up and get audited smoothly and all is as happy as summer dream __________ we are making all our own trouble our trouble is lack of precise application of scientology we fail to apply it in our lives or sessions and try something bizarre and then we fail too and with our trs model session and meters we are most of all failing to pick up and clean up missed withholds __________ we dont have to clean up all the withholds if we keep the missed withholds cleaned up give new auditor the order to clean up missed withholds and he or she in variably will start asking the pc for withholds thats mistake you ask the pc for missed withholds why stir up new ones to be missed when you havent cleaned up those already missed instead of putting out the fire we pour on gunpowder why find more you can then miss when you havent found those that have been missed dont be so confounded reasonable about the pcs complaints sure they may all be true but hes complaining only because withholds have been missed only then does the pc complain bitterly __________ whatever else you learn learn and understand this please your auditing future hangs on it the fate of scientology hangs on it ask for missed withholds when sessions go wrong get the missed withholds when life goes wrong pick up the missed withholds when staffs go wrong only then can we win and grow were waiting for you to become technically perfect with trs model session and the emeter to be able to do cchs and prepchecking and clearing techniques and to learn to spot and pick up missed withholds if pcs organizations and even scientology vanish from mans view it will be because you did not learn and use these things lrhjwrdmf l ron hubbard copyright 1962 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 5hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

whose needle is jerky random gives many prior and latent reads and goes into small scratchy patterns such needle is hard to readand such pc is long way out of session lot of the time an auditor seeing such needle and faced with the task of reading the instant read through all these prior and latents and scratchy patterns tends to think in terms of heroic measures it is obvious that this pc has whs missed whs overts and secrets to end all reactive banks and that the thing one ought to do is pick each one of these random needle reactions up as soon as possible but when you try to do this you find the needle gets even more confused it reads something all the time an extreme case of dirty random needle is not solved by any fish and fumble or heroic measures the pcs needle reacts that way because of confidence which induces sort of autocontrol in session which induces dirty needle ability to predict equals fidence the thing to do is give this pc about 3 sessions of rudiments and havingness just model session severely with q and or added chitchat the sessions should be each one about one hour long all one does is do model session getting the rudiments in carefully exactly by the textbook use model session hco bulletin 23 june 1962 use instant reads only as per hco bulletin 25th may 1962 and avoid any q and as per hco bulletin 24 may 1962 section on double questioning use middle rudiments somewhere during the havingness session by doing this perfect predictable textbook auditing session three times on the pc most of these prior and latent reads will drop out and the needle will look much cleaner why because the pc is off auto or in session you can make pcs needle get dirty and react to many odd thoughts by the pc by doing the following 1 try to clean off prior reads and avoid instant reads in getting ruds in going against hco bulletin 25 may 1962 2 use scruffy and ragged session pattern going against hco bulletin 23 june 1962 3 double question any rudiments question as per hco bulletin 24 may 1962 the pcs needle even if very clean at the start and loose will tighten up develop patterns and dirt if an auditor fails to use textbook session this includes raw meat 6that never heard of textbook session raw meat particularly requires severely textbook session dont think because theyre new they wont know and too much coffee shop type auditing can rough needle pc who has become unwilling to be audited is best cured by three textbook flawless sessions of havingness as above dont plunge for what is wrong just establish standard of excellence the pc can predict and up will come the pcs confidence after the three sessions you can prepcheck or fish and fumble and get things really clean and providing you continue to use textbook session the pc will get better and better if pc still has dirty needle with many prior reads after an auditor has audited that pc three sessions then we can conclude that that auditor 1 is not using hco bulletin 25 may 1962 in reading meter 2 is not handling questions as per hco bulletin 24 may 1962 and 3 is not using model session hco bulletin 23 june 1962 there are difficult pcs now there are only auditors who do not give

ad12r revised 5 september 1978 remimeo revisions in this type style only revision is the correction of the definition of rock slam and dirty needle security checks again with the advent of dynamic assessment new method of security checking far better than any previous security checking has emerged nothing in this bulletin of course detracts in any way from the value of missed withholds pulling missed withholds or handling missed withholds on preclears or other persons in the organization if the following questions are asked of person on meter it can be at once established whether or not this person will inadvertently covertly or unknowingly attempt to ruin wreck stop and otherwise interfere with an organization scientology or an auditor the questions are as follows consider committing overts against scientology consider committing overts against ron consider committing overts against the organization consider committing overts against the auditor it will be found that such person has goal which the person considers to be impossible to achieve so long as any one of the above four exist therefore destructive actions will at all times be manifested matter how constructive they appear the rock slam produced must be decisive by rock slam is meant the crazy irregular leftright slashing motion of the needle on the emeter dial rses repeat left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of an rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth the action which should be taken if this condition is found to exist is to suspend the person or otherwise put the person away from communication lines until such time as the persons dynamic item and goal are found sometimes it is almost enough merely to find the item as the foolishness of the conclusion that scientology stands immediately and directly in their road will appear to the preclear at that time by goal which is an overt against scientology is meant something which the pc considers to be goal which is an overt against when you finally see such goals appear they will not be apparent to the auditor as overts however the pc so interprets them for instance pc may have fixed idea against any spiritual activity interpreting it as harsh activity which forbids dancing and the pc may have goal to dance however the persons item lying above the goal to dance will be found to be spiritual group and this of course would make scientology appear to the person to be highly antipathetic to the goal to dance i cannot too strongly urge the fact that when the above occurs possible good will result until the dynamic item and goal are found therefore this should be expedited all care should be taken not to punish the person unduly but to carry on because often the person is unaware of the destructiveness of his or her own actions in marriage if the husband were to place the wife on an emeter and ask the question consider committing overts against and find wide rock slam imme 8diately results he will be then in total possession of what has been wrong with his marriage similarly wife finding this manifestation on husband would also be informed the remedy in such case is not to sack somebody to shoot somebody to divorce somebody or take some drastic final action because we now have all the answer we need to resolve this and it will be found that as soon as the persons goal has been found the condition of hostility will cease the rock slam produced must be at sensitivity 16 on the meter if dirty needle occurs it is necessary to pull the persons missed withholds because these obviously exist this should not be neglected by dirty needle is meant an erratic agitation of the needle which is ragged jerky ticking not sweeping and tends to be persistent it is not limited in size this is the new security programme any person responsible for maintaining security in an organization or home should perform the above tests and take the remedial action i cannot too strongly urge that while this is absolute or near as it can be and positive in its diagnosis it is not permanent because we can now clear and clearing consists of doing away with the rock slam and not the offending person l ron hubbard founder lrhjb cden mdf copyright 1962 1978 by l

revisions in this type style reissued to correct typos somatics how to tell terminals and opposition terminals it is important that clearing auditor be able to distinguish pain from sensation terminals from opposition terminals and to have the data at the level of instant knowledge to understand it less is to invite serious errors in clearing failure to sort terminals from opposition terminals can confuse the pc or even degrade the case all pcs somatics deformities and distortions proceed from terminals opposition terminals and combination terminals thus they are of vast importance to the pc and the auditor definitions somatics this is general word for uncomfortable physical perceptions coming from the reactive mind its genus is early dianetics and it is general common package word used by scientologists to denote pain or sensation with differ ence made between them to understand the source of these feelings one should have knowledge of engrams ridges and other parts of the reactive bank to the scientologist anything is somatic if it emanates from the various parts of the reactive mind and produces an awareness of reactivity symbol som pain pain is composed of heat cold electrical and the combined effect of sharp hurting if one stuck fork in his arm he would experience pain when one uses pain in connection with clearing one means awareness of heat cold electrical or hurting stemming from the reactive mind cording to experiments done at harvard if one were to make grid with heated tubes going vertical and chilled tubes going horizontal and were to place small current of electricity through the lot the device touched to body would produce the feeling of pain it need not be composed of anything very hot or cold or of any high voltage to produce very intense feeling of pain therefore what we call pain is itself heat cold and electrical if pc experiences one or more of these from his reactive mind we say he is experiencing pain electrical is the bridge between sensation and pain and is difficult to classify as either pain or sensation when it exists alone symbol pn sensation all other uncomfortable perceptions stemming from the reactive mind are called sensation these are basically pressure motion dizziness sexual sensation and emotion and misemotion there are others definite in themselves but definable in these five general categories if one took the fork in the pain definition above and pressed it against the arm that would be pressure motion is just that feeling of being in motion when one is not motion includes the winds of space feeling of being blown upon especially from in front of the face dizziness is feeling of disorientation and includes spinniness as well as an outofbalance feel ing sexual sensation means any feeling pleasant or unpleasant commonly experienced during sexual restimulation or action emotion and misemotion include all levels of the complete tone scale except pain emotion and misemotion are closely allied to motion being only finer particle action bank solidity is form of pres sure and when the sensation of increasing solidity of masses in the mind occurs we say the bank is beefing up all these are classified as sensation symbol sen terminal an item or identity the pc has actually been sometime in the past or present is called terminal it is the pcs own valence at that time in the goals problem mass the black masses of the reactive mind those identities which when contacted produce pain tell us at once that they are terminals the person could feel 10pain only as himself thetan plus body and therefore identities he has been produce pain when their mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing symbol term opposition terminal an item or identity the pc has actually opposed fought been an enemy of sometime in the past or present is called an opposition terminal as the person identified himself as not it he could experience from it only sensation an opposition terminal when its mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing produces only sensation never pain symbol oppterm combined terminal an item or identity the pc has both been and opposed produces therefore both pain and sensation when it is late on the track which is to say after the fact of many terminals and opposition terminals the combination terminal is the closure between terminal and opposition terminal lines which possesses attributes of both and the clarity of neither it signifies period toward the end of game it is found most commonly when the pcs case is only shallowly entered they exist on all cases but are fewer than terminals and opposition terminals symbol coterm item any terminal opposition terminal combination terminal significance or idea but not doingness which is called level appearing on list derived from the pc symbol it reliable item any item that rock slams well on being found and at session end and which was the last item still in after assessing the list can be terminal an op position terminal combination terminal or significance provided only that it was the item found on list and rock slammed symbol ri rock slam the crazy irregular leftright slashing motion of the needle on the emeter dial rses repeat left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of an rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth rock slam is the response of an emeter to the conflict between terminals and op position terminals it indicates fight an effort to individuate an extreme games condition which in the absence of auditing would seek unsuccessfully to separate while at tacking rock slam means hidden evil intention on the subject or question under auditing or discussion as the pcs attention is guided to the items involved the games condition activates and is expressed on the meter as ragged frantic response the wider the response the more recognizable to the pc is the reality of the games condition and the violence of the conflict the rock slam channel is that hypothetical course between series of pairs sisting of terminals and opposition terminals if the conflict is too great for the pcs reality rock slam results later in auditing as the pcs confronting rises items which did not react earlier in auditing now begin to be real and so express themselves on meter as rock slam the pc with the lowest reality level is the hardest to attain rock slam on but in contradiction pc who has the least control over himself in certain zones of life has the largest rock slams the rock slam vanishes under suppression and activates on invalidate or withhold or on other prehav levels this is the most difficult needle response to find or attain or preserve and it is the most valuable in clearing all rock slams result from pair of items in opposition one of which is terminal the other being an opposition terminal it can exist in present time where the pc is the terminal and what the pc is faced with is the opposition terminal symbol rs instant rock slam that rock slam which begins at the end of the major thought of any item symbol irs valid rses are not always instant reads an rs can read prior or latently 11dirty needle an erratic agitation of the needle which is ragged jerky ticking not sweeping and tends to be persistent t is not limited in size symbol dn dirty read an instant agitation of the needle in response to major thought it is ragged jerky ticking not sweeping and is not limited in size unlike the dirty needle it does not persist symbol dr testing the method of testing for the character of an item whether term oppterm or coterm is extremely simple if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on pain in the pcs body it is terminal if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on sensation around or in the pcs body it is an opposition terminal if the item when said to the pc in any way turns on both pain and sensation in or around the pets body it is combination terminal ways of asking the rule is give the terminal cause the opposition terminal effect in any listing working or use the simplest form is of course just chanting the item at the pc few times this is not always workable the simplest but not always workable form is for terminalwould ________ commit overts for an opposition terminalconsider committing overts against _________ using ph level instead of committing overts the prehav level by which the reliable item was found is normally used for terminalwould _____ item _____ ph level or consider _____ item _____ ing ph level for an opposition terminalconsider _____ ing ph level _____item using td buttons the above sentences may also be used or their rough approximation with tiger drill or prepcheck button and if rock slam is present it may develop __________ matter what method is being used in saying the item being tested to find out if it is terminal opposition terminal or combination terminal the rules of sensation and pain apply sensation means oppterm pain means terminal __________ it is important to know if an item is term oppterm or coterm as its character as one of the three determines the listing question the same rule for testing applies in listing if it is terminal it prehav levels if it is an opposition terminal it is prehav leveled example for terminal waterbuck prehav level snort proper listing question who or what would waterbuck snort at 12example for an oppterm tiger prehav level snort who or what would snort at tiger of course the reverse can be listed but is rarely necessary except to get longer list when the pc stalls the line plot line plot must be made up for any pc for his 3gaxx or the listing the goal steps of routine 321 steps 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 of 21 steps this consists of heavy blue 13 foolscap or legal sheet of paper kept in the pcs folder and kept up to date every time reliable item or even last item in is found on this line plot one column the lefthand one is reserved for oppterms the righthand column is reserved for terms and lines indicate whenever terms or oppterms are derived from each other reliable item is designated as such on this line plot with the symbol ri non reliable items are not designated the date each line plot item was found is added after the item so it can be found again in the auditors reports without scramble the full behaviour and character of any item found is written into the auditors report of that session in which it was found the width of the instant rock slam in inches whether the slam turned on every time the item was read what wording turned it on and whether it would still rs by session end are all made part of the auditors report __________ about 20 or 25 of the cases that appear for clearing can have reliable items found on them at once by exploring the words scientology scientology organization an auditor the auditor ron or the head of the local scientology organization by name these are considered to be oppterms by any pc whose realization of his goal would be interfered with he or she feels by scientology it does not matter what wording see above turns on the rs so long as it can be consistently turned on for bit if it is at first only dirty read it is tiger drilled to try to make it rock slam only in this peculiar instance is the person called rock slammer or is considered security risk everyone alive rses on something in any event if items such as those in this paragraph turn on rock slam they are put on the line plot as reliable items and used in handling the case the above material is in actual fact partial anatomy of the goals problems mass its identification in auditing and the behaviour of an emeter towards it as it has never before been viewed by any practice mental science or religion it has to have special terminology the terminology has been stably in use for quite some time in scientology i have made the definitions more precise in this hco bulletin anyone working in clearing should have this hco bulletin data at his instant call without referral to the hco bulletin with very few additions this is the track one walks in clearing and going clear know it l ron hubbard founder lrhglrdmdf copyright 1962 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 13hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 30 december ad12r revised 5 september 1978 remimeo revisions in this type style revised to correct the definition of dirty needle urgent important routines 212 210 case errors points of greatest importance the errors in doing routine 210 and routine 212 are divided into two broad divisions those of auditing itself b those deriving from errors in doing the exact skills of routines 210 and 212 auditing errors this bulletin touches only briefly on the errors of auditing errors these consist of sloppy form bad trs inability to read meter auditor code breaks q and aing missing missed whs doing bad mid ruds or tiger drilling and using auditing form to hold up results one remedies bad auditing as different from bad 210 or 212 by following this prescription the poorer the auditor the more supervisor or instructor takes away from him the tools of auditing in short if an auditor makes bad auditing errors one simplifies the auditing to prevent the errors dont let him or her do 212 make such an auditor use only 210 then as the auditors skill in basic auditing improves the more he or she can be trusted with 212 do not let an auditor who cant do any kind of job of basic auditing do 212 let such an auditor do only 210 and then as that auditors case improves on 210 or 212 and as training drills are passed let the auditor graduate up to 212 remember this 212 works all by itself with auditing niceties and it can be prevented from working but only to some degree by bad auditing form or intention strip off model session mid ruds tiger drilling and twoway comm demand it be run muzzled muzzled muzzled use the meter only to find rock slams and modern routine 2 works like dream dream dream even for an auditor whose auditing skill is terrible let q and artist clean cleans on meter muck up the mid ruds yap at the pc and routine 2 wont work because it never gets done so the training stress and the use stress of routine 2 is just on routine 2 its rules and how its done and when the auditor has case gains and wins auditing form is then entered upon 14the backwards way is to insist on good hard study of form before training on routine 2 always hammer routine 2 home first and get it done not fooled with by the mixedup kid from mid rud gulch your main trouble will come from not teaching routine 2 hard just as itself before entering upon the niceties of auditing you have to show the wild man its house before you teach him to serve french pastry partie of course nothing in this hco bulletin should be used to degrade the value of good auditing form good metering smooth command of the trs grip on the basics and fine knowledge of fundamentals are vital in an auditor you cant get all there is to get out of routine 212 with rough auditing auditing skill is not just something to acquire its the only thing that gets real auditing done and good auditors are scarce and i appreciate them ive had my share of rough auditing and i know the diamonds and gold of smooth flawless auditor but routine 2 at the time of this writing and for always in some area of the world as we expand will be handled with rough auditor skill therefore for the purposes of this hco bulletin we will consider the auditing skill to be rough and show what routines 210 and 212 can do in unpolished hands and never fear when their cases are better and the training can be stepped up theyll become polished never fear and appreciate being so its my brag i can get pc out of anything with just auditing skill that makes pretty brave as an auditor but this bring on your lions attitude is born out of auditing skills taught not native i use the same pattern and patter as you do if you audit textbook but i dont clean cleans often or miss reads ever and i dont q and you can audit just as well as i can with practice and study why do i know this well auditing is not my main forte not even close to my appointments and goals were probably all rock slammers somewhere on list one and this is man pulling himself out of the mud indeed so dont run down pure auditing skill its more precious than anything in this universe but you can acquire it as you do routine 2 and after meanwhile dont overrate the power of routine 2 to work with rough auditing so long as the routine 2 is done right the errors of routine 2 routine 2 by which is meant 210 212 has its own rules and these must be learned first and learned well routine 2 today is powerful process and if it can straighten up pc so fast it can also cave him in fast however such caveins while dramatic are very easy to remedy even though they must be remedied with accuracy the remedies are all contained in this hco bulletin remember in doing routine 2 the primary pc upset is from badly done routine 2 not badly done auditing to repair car dont look for paint scratches when some body has removed the engine auditing form is paint scratches the removed engine is flubbed routine 2 15routine 2 must be taught hard not just as version of auditing but as itself it is its own technical package and it doesnt even infringe on the basics of auditing auditor responsibility routine 2 has several hills to climb one of them is auditor responsibility this process has the peculiarity of handing all responsibility for case gain or worsening to the auditor you will hear people who havent clue on routine 2 crying about bad pcs bad d of ping bad ron and blaming everyone but themselves investigate and youll find only an auditor flub on routine 2 all routine 2 auditor flubs consist of not knowing routine 2 b not doing routine 2 there are other routine 2 auditor flubs in routine 2 all gain or lack of gain is assignable directly and only to the auditor frightening isnt it but encouraging too for it puts the auditor at cause wholly and completely over the pcs case you might have known that would happen with the first allcase fast gain process duration of process routine 2 is here to stay youve been used to the changing face of processing that discouraged learning any process very well and setting up to get it done by one and all well routine 2 is here to stay it isnt going to change you can invest great amount of time and effort on learning it its here to stay because where it doesnt get results the auditor didnt know it or didnt do it and we can always remedy that it only produces mediocre or worsening results when it either isnt known or isnt done further it is quite easy to do and it produces fast stable results very startling to even raw meat there is more miracle in 50 hours of well done routine 2 than in the entire history of the church further it has to be done on every case before goal can easily or reliably be found or even if found before it can be run so there it is learn it auditing the first and greatest error of routine 2 is auditing yes the auditor may be sitting there like oneman band busy as free beer at the boiler works and yet not be auditing routine 2 16example eat up twothirds of every session with needless beginning middle and end rudiments example spend two hours prepchecking the mid ruds and then find the reason the needle is dirty is an incomplete list example spend three sessions full of general ow trying to calm an arc breaky pc when in actual fact the auditor has been opposing an item off an incomplete list its not just audit the pc in front of you thats vital enough but audit the pc in front of you with correct routine 2 auditors have been known to spend hours days running old processes to get the pc up to running 212 when five minutes of 212 would have had the pc sailing auditing means while seeming to deliver auditing actually get nothing done its the greatest crime in routine 2 or routine 3 auditing can be reduced to the finest art doing wrong list redoing dead horse these arent auditing auditing may have been wasted or may be slow but its still auditing auditing means going through endless useless motions perhaps in top form perhaps perfectly none of which are calculated to advance the pcs case one inch doing havingness every half page endlessly tiger drilling doing mid ruds just be cause its good form all these and thousand more add up to auditing absolute essentials bare bone and bounteous correct 2 12 are auditing mid ruds tiger drilling are necessary to good auditing but using them an inch beyond necessity is auditing failure to save records almost the only way to completely bar the door on the pc is to lose his case folder or fail to put all lists and reports in it every sheet of every list must have on it the pcs name date of the list and the question from which the list comes this is the biggest must in routine 2 preserve the records and make them identifiable and usable failing to find rses on list one failing to find and utilize an rs on list one is the most common but not the most destructive to the pcs health error in routine 2 example auditor has three dead horses abandons case another auditor as sesses list one tiger drills the rses out represents tick gets another dead horse abandons case pc now known as tough pc third auditor gets cunning looks over the original assessment sees auditor rsed once long ago it doesnt now having been tiger drilled to death opposes it gets beautiful rsing list case starts to fly this error has been done over and over and over and is the source of all dead horses rule oppose every rs found on list one or ia or pt consists of list oppose them even when they only rsed on tiger drill buttons take the rsing item most intimate to the actual session as the first one to use if in further doubt take the rsing item closest to the session the pc is interested in 17list one 1a or pt consists of lists do not have to be ris to be opposed they are locks on ris they only need to briefly rs or to have been seen to rs at some time to be opposed if they rsed at any time they must be opposed according to whether they are terms or oppterms i have seen case fail to give more than dead horses until somebody recalled that on sec check test year before the case had rsed on scientology orgs now not even tick when that was opposed dial wide rs turned on for 55 consecutive pages of items high record one remedy is to tiger drill on list one but it isnt infallible representing an rsing item one of the three most destructive actions to the pc is representing an rsing item the other two are opposing an rsing item taken from an incomplete list both included below representing an rsing item puts terrible strain on the pcs attention the list may even rs probably will but the opposing item now hidden wreaks havoc on the pc all the time its companion is being listed on represent list real calm pc can turn into screamer if an rsing item is listed with represent list whether it has been opposed or not note this is contrary to 3gaxx action which could be done only because detested person wasnt vital oppterm it should not be done even in 3gaxx rule only do opposition lists on rsing items never represent them oppose ris always oppose an ri and continue to oppose ris until you get satisfactory package never leave bypassed item to do so is destructive to the preclear this is not the greatest source of destruc tiveness and not every ri bypassed will ruin the preclear but once out of three times the pc will be upset example scientology rses reliable item slavemaster is found on the opposition list it is not then itself opposed pc is upset by presence of hidden item that opposes slavemaster pc stays upset until slavemaster is opposed and its ri companion item freedom fighter is found slavery shows up on the opp scientology list as the thing that actually fronted up to scientology when the whole thing was packaged rule when first list rsing item is opposed and an ri is found then routine 2 steps are incomplete until the found ri is itself opposed it goes representopposeoppose or oppose oppose it will be seen that first list rsing items are usually locks into pt on actual ris it will also be seen that the rock slams on the first list the first opposing ri and the ri that opposes that all match they have the same width and speed and pattern they seldom all rs at the same time but in sequence of when first found rule all items found must be completely packaged rule all rses in package must match in character and vanish when fully packaged 18leaving bypassed item is also possible because of incomplete lists see below incomplete lists if after nulling you have several rock slamming items remaining your list is always incomplete bonus packages vanish as soon as spotted they occur once in while they can be ignored in this rule rule if you find more than one rs in nulling list that list is incomplete and must be completed example preclear pn once rsed so it is opposed the who or what would preclear oppose list is listed and dozen rses were seen on listing ok so far the list tested without reaction on the question the auditor starts to null the list some of the items that rsed while being listed rs now on nulling list is nulled down to 3 rsing items auditor chooses one it rses nicely this is control device sen auditor now lists who or what would oppose control device list rses well however masses tend to close in on pc havingness drops pc possibly arc breaky auditor continues on listing and on and on finally gets to nulling very hard job pc cutting up auditor tries to pull missed withholds after much blood auditor finds four rsing items left on list chooses wild man and tries to package pc glum very little cognition two items have been bypassed how auditing supervisor sees that several items on the who or what would pc oppose list rsed on nulling assumes rightly list was incomplete directs it to be completed pc smiles brightly and with suddenly clean needle lists 80 more items several of which rs on listing masses fall away from pc again arc breaks this time only one item rsed on nulling controller sen only new list is nulled of course you never renull in 212 rs has mysteriously and correctly vanished off every other rsing item on that list the list who or what would oppose control device is wholly scrubbed being wrong the auditor now lists who or what would oppose controller the pc happily lists 2q0 items many rsing the needle goes clean the auditor starts nulling finds he has two items on the first three pages that rs has learned his lesson and leaving off nulling for the moment gets pc to add 50 items auditor goes on nulling nulls down to one rsing item an insane idiot the rs on preclear controller and an insane idiot all matched when seen each in turn but preclear doesnt rs any more pc cogniting like mad very happy masses all moved off and havingness up rule if in nulling more than one rs is seen on list that list is incomplete and must be completed there are exceptions to this rule bonus packages blow off on completed list also to clarify keep in mind this rule rule if list does not rs now and then or at least once when being listed it will become dead horse that some list items rsed when the pc said them during listing is natural if with suppress clean more than one of them rses during nulling that list is incomplete also in passing dont finish nulling list before adding to it as general prac tice add to it when the pcs needle is dirty or when you see more than one rs on it during nulling the pc arc breaks if you keep completing the nulling of the existing list and then adding 19wrong way oppose pcs are not always right when telling you its terminal pn or oppterm sen they even sometimes lie to try to save their face to keep from looking bad in an auditors eyes or the world or to seem even more villainous than they are the only real test of right way oppose is whether or not the list lists easily with improved skin tone in the pc and improved cheerfulness and if it produces one rsing item that packages later if you just cant tell which way to oppose oppose both ways and then decide on pcs appearance which way was right and continue it wrong way opposition is not usual usually the pc tells the truth and all is well but when list is listed wrong way to on opposition its long horrible and deadly the pc goes faintly grey green yellow or blackish looks worse and the list gets endless wrong way list will rs so its only pc appearance that tells the story routine 2 is beneficial pcs that are listed with right way opposition look brighter younger with more translucent skin tone you wont make mistake if you can tell the difference between young boy and an old man its that distinct remember pc will also look worse as above if you took an item from an incomplete list or committed any of the other r2 errors in this hco bulletin lists that wont complete the only reasons list will not complete are wrong source b wrong way to oppose in either case there is something wrong with the source of the list that list is listing rses is guarantee of rightness of source wrong way to list will rs some lists taken from wrong source cycle rs dr clean needle rs dr clean needle wrong sources are 1 first list item is opposed that didnt ever rs 2 an ri grabbed off an incomplete list that must be completed 3 an item that was terminal being opposed as though it were an oppterm and vice versa 4 on represent list the item being represented actually was an rsing item 5 on represent list the item being represented was badly chosen and of interest to the pc there are other wrong sources and thus other r2 way to get list that wont complete but when you do get list that wont complete be very careful to look over the above 5 reasons and pick out the right one you may have to complete an earlier list first and scrub the one youre on incompleting lists are usually abandoned without further patchup how long is an incomplete list how long is piece of string 20long long lists dont ever be afraid to have long list only be afraid of short ones but when list is running up toward thousands something is wrong endless lists stem basically from wrong source as above or from the auditors failure to understand what indicates complete list if on close study of the case folder and pc routine 2 errors seem to be absent the source is right and not something taken from another list itself incomplete if the oppose is right way to then look for the following pc is not answering auditing question or b pc has decided something was his item and is representing it or is otherwise operating on decision the remedies are to get decide in well and to make sure without upsetting him that the pc is answering the auditing question and if that is all ok then its just long list so complete it rule list is complete when it can be nulled and when it produces just one ri that rses on tiger drilling and stays in list can be nulled only when needle is clean except in 210 the definition of clean needle is one which flows producing pattern or erratic motions of the smallest kind with the auditor sitting looking at it and doing nothing clean needle is not just something that doesnt react to particular question its lovely slow flow usually rise most beautifully expressed on mark v at 64 sensitivity list has to be listed until this needle flow is observed with mid ruds put in but ruds or ruds clean needle always appears when list is complete dirty needle is an erratic agitation of the needle which is ragged jerky ticking not sweeping and tends to be persistent it is not limited in size there are the auditing methods of converting dirty needle to clean needle both as defined above these are all the skills of auditing used with big mid rud buttons now entirely and distinctly separate from auditing skills for cleaning needle there are the routine 2 methods for converting dirty needle to clean needle usually both auditing and routine 2 methods are used to clean needle so that one can null the former briefly the latter abundantly however do not overlook the demonstrable fact that routine 2 methods for cleaning needle are very beneficial and lasting in results whereas purely auditing methods like mid ruds have value only for the moment and even though auditing methods are desirable in this operation when the routine 2 is in error the clean needle is really impossible to achieve longer than seconds with auditing methods the obvious solution to cleaning needle is to first have routine 2 as perfect as possible the errors outlined in this hco bulletin uncommitted or being rapidly corrected and then use auditing methods try it in reverse auditing methods first and then using corrections of routine 2 and you will not only fail to get needle clean longer than seconds you may also waste the better part of an intensive trying to do it 21so spend hours straightening up routine 2 errors and doing it right and brief minutes with auditing methods when necessary and dont revile pc for having dirty needle its the auditor who dirties it up with incorrect or inaccurate routine 2 not the pc now clean needle is vital in order to null list dont ever try to null list with the needle dirty if the routine 2 is right the needle will clean up with two minutes work of big mid ruds if routine 2 errors wrong list source list incomplete wrong way oppose etc as per this hco bulletin exist and routine 2 is being done wrong then two hours worth of big mid ruds will not clean dirty needle any of the routine 2 errors taken up in this hco bulletin will create dirty needle and keep it dirty and leave the auditor sweating over mid ruds and the pc going mad trying to answer the questions yes the mid ruds are out but why because one or more serious routine 2 errors as described in this hco bulletin are present so see the light if you sweat on mid ruds as an auditor curse them as pc or see coauditor dripping exasperation over mid ruds and the needle wont stay clean look at the routine 2 not the difficulty with mid ruds look for the errors here described check them off on the case one by one and dont even be satisfied that its only auditing check all the errors off section by section youll be startled so in general difficult mid ruds and dirty needle indicate wrong routine 2 not bad auditing somebody has flubbed the routine 2 before the auditing was flubbed once the routine 2 is in error auditing becomes impossible this gives excuse for bad metering cleaning cleans trying to look like an auditor but ignoring results auditing errors do exist and can be serious but pc running on right routine 2 would forgive the pope for having forked tail you almost cant muddy up pc running on right routine 2 heres trick dont try to null list until youve seen clean flowing needle for lot of items maybe 50 then get in fast mid ruds on the list and do it without cleaning any cleans then start nulling if the needle dirties up after 3040 items skip mid ruds just show the pc the page and have him spot any big thoughts he had on it then immediately get back to nulling if the needle is dirty still resume listing until its clean just do those actions and given errorfree routine 2 as per this hco bulletin youll have smooth smooth happy time of it in nulling do anything you dont have to do in auditing routine 2 and youre in trouble in the auditing department bang out almost total routine 2 and youre in clover give 110th of the session over to goals mid ruds and other auditing actions and 910ths of the session to pure routine 2 actions and youll really win and that 110th includes any mid ruds on the list as well give half the session to auditing and half to routine 2 and youll be in continuous trouble the righter the routine 2 the less auditing youll have to do so how long is list can you null it with needle that requires only pc inspec tion of page to keep it clean are all but one of the rses that happened in auditing dead when you nulled are your pages long streams of xs did you have to use suppress only once per page fast check to keep it clean wells thats complete list if it gave you an ri just one so how long is list but if all the above is true and pcs lists are still very long another thing can be wrong 22that wrongness usually is the pcs confronting ability being driven down by auditor unconfrontability but also can be caused by wrong ri or other errors gone before it as covered in this hco bulletin the auditor qs and as yap yaps nags the pc blames gets in endless mid ruds cleans cleans misses reads or does something else the length of an auditors pcs lists is to some degree proportional to the rough auditing or auditing done by the auditor and also by failure to use mid ruds and td in the right places when necessary we have known since 55 that rough auditing reduces havingness heres why rough auditing lowers the pcs ability to confront in the session the pcs havingness is proportional to his ability to confront in the session if pcs havingness by can squeeze test is lower at session end than at beginning on routine 2 then theres something wrong with the auditing or with the way routine 2 is being applied one of the above routine 2 errors is being made the remedy for the bad auditing is to make the auditor only acknowledge anything and everything the pc says or put it on the list tear out all rudiments tiger drills twoway comm and forbid any chance to comment or act on an origin by the pc and get only routine 2 done the remedy for routine 2 errors and the errors themselves are given above in this hco bulletin conclusion routine 2 does not have an endless parade of donots they are basically just those above simple really and ive not seen one session on routine 2 that was going really wrong go wrong on auditing errors alone routine 2 sessions go wrong on bad routine 2 the auditing form and meter errors start to pile up after routine 2 has been balled up one or more of the above routine 2 errors has been done and overlooked the reason why routine 2 errors are more deadly than purely auditing errors is that routine 2 is handling the pc by batches of lifetimes all the stress and gore and agony of generations exist on the lists of any one package an auditing error can be gross and get by unless it is sitting on routine 2 error then the tiniest auditing flub can produce reaction like an earthquake the charge is all coming from routine 2 mishandling and is evident on the surface only by the auditing error case remedy routine 2 case patchup is elementary done with knowledge of the above errors just find out which one of the above sections is being violated and get it done the error will only be one of the above to cause case nonprogress or worsening the sections are given in order of importance i will shortly work up series of actual case history case repairs so save the records and you save all summary routine 210 and 212 are their own technology and must be learned as such 23routine 2 errors are more shaking to case than errors in form and meter except where the auditor cant even see rock slam and where case is not winning on routine 2 auditing it is the routine 2 that must be reviewedand fast the elements to be reviewed are all listed above by sections in order of importance of course many other smaller fantastic errors can be done and will be invented but they will be junior in value to those listed above and will be reported when found routine 2 will be with us long long time and it is worth learning well it takes the toughest case apart and is the only process that can start the actual clearing of 80 or more of all cases i have done or reviewed thousands of hours of auditing in forming and organizing and testing routine 2 it is the most gratifying and sometimes hairraising auditing i have ever done or viewed you cant oversell routine 2 you just cant for it is the first

the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track although finding and curtailing the development of the time track at genus is not improbable the ability of the preclear to attain it early on is questionable without reducing the charge on the existing track therefore any system which reduces the charged condition of the time track without reducing but increasing the awareness and decisionability of the preclear is valid processing any system which seeks to handle the charge but reduces the preclears awareness and decisionability is not valid processing but is degrading according to early axioms the single source of aberration is time therefore any system which further confuses or overwhelms the preclears sense of time will not be beneficial thus the first task of the student of engram running is to master the handling of time on the preclears time track it must be handled without question uncertainty or confusion failing to handle the time in the pcs time track with confidence certainty and without error will result in grouping or denying the time track to the pc the prime source of arc break in engram running sessions is bypassing charge by time mishandling by the auditor as subhead under this taking and trying to run incidents which are not basic on chain constitute an error in time and react on the pc like bypassed ris or gpms an arc breakless session requires gentle accurate time scouting the selection of the earliest timed incident available and the accurate time handling of the incident as it is run there are only few reasons why some cannot run engrams on pcs these are 1 q and with the pain and unconsciousness of incidents 2 failing to handle the time track of the pc for the pc 3 failure to understand and handle time 2 and 3 are much the same however there are three ways to move time track about by significance the moment something was considered 25b by location the moment the pc was located somewhere c by time alone the date or years before an event or years ago you will see all three have time in common the moment when you thought______ the moment you were on the cliff two years before you put your foot on the bottom step of the scaffold are all dependent on time each designates an instant on the time track of which there can be mistake by either auditor or pc the whole handling of the time track can be done by any one of these three methods significance location time therefore all projectionist work is done by the time of significance the time of location or time alone the track responds those auditors who have trouble cannot grasp the totality and accuracy and speed of that response the idiotic and wonderful precision of the time track defeats the sloppy and careless they wonder if it went they question the pcs being there they fumble about until they destroy their command over the time track go to 47983678283736 years 2 months 4 days i hour and six minutes ago well clear statement of it unfumbled will cause just that to happen the tiniest quiver of doubt fumble over the millions and nothing happens fumbled dating gets dates one must date boldly with throat catches or hesitations more than 40000 less than 40000 get it the first read dont go on peering myopically at the meter asking the same question the rest of the session accurate bold rapid those are the watchwords of dating and time track handling in moving time track about move only the track dont mix it and also move the pc you can say move to you dont have to say but you can the somatic strip will move to but never say you will move to and this also applies to present time the pc wont come to present time hes here but the time track will move to the date of present time unless the pc is really stuck in getting pc to present time unimportant in modern engram running say move to date month and year of pt in scouting you always use to move to in running an engram or whatever you always use through move through the incident if an auditor hasnt ruddy clue about the time track and its composition he or she wont ever be able to run engrams so obviously the first thing to teach and have passed in engram running is time track composition when the auditor learns that he or she will be able to run engrams if the auditor does not know the subject of the time track well then he or she cant be taught to run engrams for rote commands that cover all cases can exist you couldnt teach the handling of motion picture projector by rote commands if the operator had never imagined the existence of film an auditor sitting there thinking the pc is doing this or that and being in general fuddle about it will soon have film all over the floor and wrapped about his ears his plea for rote command will just tangle up more film so long as he doesnt know it is film and that he not the preclear is handling it if an auditor can learn this he will then be able to learn to run those small parts of the time track called engrams if an auditor cant run pc through some pleasant time track flawlessly he or she sure cant run pc through the living lightning parts of that track called engrams an auditor who cannot handle the time track smoothly can scarcely call himself an auditor as thats all there is to audit besides postulates matter what process you are using matter what process you invent and even if you tried what is laughingly called biochemical approach to the mind theres only time track for the bios to affect 26theres thetan theres time track the thetan gets caught in the time track the job of the auditor is to free the theta n by digging him out of his time track so if you cant handle what youre digging thetan out of youre going to have an awful lot of landslides and lot of auditing loses for both you and preclears invent games devices charts and training aids galore and teach with them and youll have auditors who can handle the time track and run engrams charge and the time track charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track when this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track this is the state of case scale all levels given are major levels minor levels exist between them level 1 track charge level 2 full visible time track some charge level 3 sporadic visibility of track some heavily charged areas level 4 invisible track very heavily charged areas black or invisible field exist level 5 dubin some areas of track so heav ily charged pc is below consciousness in them level 6 dubin of dubin many areas of track so heavily charged the dubin is submerged level 7 only aware of own track too heavily charged evaluations to be viewed at all level 8 unaware pc dull often in coma on this new scale the very good easy to run cases are at level 3 skilled engram running can handle down to level 4 engram running is useless from level 4 down level 4 is questionable level 1 is of course an ot level 2 is the clearest clear anybody ever heard of level 3 can run engrams level 4 can run early track engrams if the running is skilled level 4 includes the black v case level 5 has to be run on general arc processes level 6 has to be run carefully on special arc processes with lots of havingness level 7 responds to the cchs level 8 responds only to reach and withdraw cchs predianetic and prescientology mental studies were observations from level 7 which considered levels 5 and 6 and 8 the only states of case and oddly enough overlooked level 7 entirely all states of case were considered either neurotic or insane with sanity either slightly glimpsed or decried in actuality on some portion of every time track in every case you will find each of the levels except i momentarily expressed the above scale is devoted to chronic case level and is useful in programming case but any case for brief moments or 27longer will hit these levels in being processed this is the temporary case level found only in sessions on chronically higher level cases when they go through tough bit thus engram running can be seen to be limited to higher level cases other processing notably modern arc processes moves the case up to engram running now what makes these levels of case it is entirely charge the more heavily charged the case the lower it falls on the above scale it is charge that prevents the pc from confronting the time track and submerges the time track from view charge is stored energy or stored or recreatable potentials of energy the emeter registers charge very high or low tone arm sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge the chronic meter of case is an index of chronic charge the fluctuations of meter during session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pcs time track more valuably the meter registers released charge you can see it blowing on the meter the disintegrating rr the blowing down of the ta the heavy falls the loos ening needle all show charge being released the meter registers charge found and then charge released it registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight by dn by climbing ta or ta going far below the clear read then as this cleans up the charge is seen to blow charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to charge up in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc the whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing when prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown we get arc breaks the state of case the chronic level as given on the above scale is the totality of charge on the case level 1 has charge on it level 8 is total charge the day to day condition of case its temper reaction to things brightness depends upon two factors the totality of charge on the case and b the amount of charge in restimulation thus case being processed varies in tone by the totality of charge remaining on the case b the amount of charge in restimulation and the amount of charge blown by processing charge is held in place by the basic on chain when only later than basic incidents are run charge can be restimulated and then bottled up again with very small amount blown this is known as grinding out an incident an engram is getting run but as it is not basic on chain adequate amount of charge is being released later than basic incidents are run either to uncover more basic earlier incidents or b to clean up the chain after basic has been found and erased full erasure of incidents later than basic is possible but charge can be removed from them providing they are not ground out but only run lightly time or two and then an earlier incident on the chain found and similarly run when the basic is found it is erased by many passes over it basic is the only one which can be run many times the later the incident is the further from basic the more lightly it is run there is difference in the technology required to run basic or later incident it is only the number of times through that differs basic is run through many times somewhat later engram is run through couple of times an engram very late on the chain is gone through once otherwise all engrams whether basic or not are run exactly the same 28engrams are run to release charge from ease charge is not released to cure the body or to cure anything physical and the meter cures nothing charge is released entirely to return to thetan his causation over the time track to restore his power of choice and to free him of his most intimate trap his own time track you cannot have decent honest or capable beings as long as they are trapped and overwhelmed while this philosophy may be contrary to the intentions of slavemaster or degrader it is nevertheless demonstrably true the universe is not itself trap capable only of degradation but beings exist who beaten and overwhelmed themselves can utilize this universe to degrade others the mission of engram running is to free the charge which has accumulated in being and so restore that being to appreciated life all eases sooner or later have to be run on engrams matter what else has to be done for it is in engrams that the bulk of the charge on the time track lies and it is therefore those parts of the time track called engrams which overwhelm the thetan these contain pain and unconsciousness and are therefore the record of moments when thetan was most at effect and least at cause in these moments then the thetan is least able to confront or to be causative the engram also contains moments when it was necessary to have moved and most degrading to have held position in space and the engram contains the heaviest arc break with thetans environment and other beings and all these things add up to charge an impulse to withdraw from that which cant be withdrawn from or to approach that which cant be approached and this like two pole battery generates current this constantly generated current is chronic charge the principal actions are when the attention of the thetan is directed broadly in the direction of such track record the current increases b when the attention is more closely but not forcefully and accurately directed the current is discharged c when the basic on the chain is found and erased that which composes the poles themselves is erased and later incidents eased for further generation is possi ble by that chain and it becomes incapable of producing further charge to be restimulated the above are the actions which occur during auditing if these actions do not occur despite auditing then there is case betterment so it is the auditors responsibility to make sure they do occur as the time track is created by an involuntary response of the thetan it is and exists as real thing composed of space matter energy time and significance on level 8 case the time track is completely submerged by charge even down to total unawareness of thought itself at level 7 awareness of the track is confined by extant charge to opinions about it at level 6 charge on the track is such that pictures of pictures of the track are gratuitously furnished causing delusive copies of inaccurate copies of the track at level 5 charge is sufficient to cause only inaccurate copies of the track to be viewable at level 4 charge is sufficient to obscure the track at level 3 charge is sufficient to wipe out portions of the track at level 2 there is only enough charge to maintain the existence of the track at level 1 there is charge and track to create it all charge from level 1 and up into higher states that is generated is knowingly generated by the thetan whose ability to hold locations in space and poles apart results in charge as needful this would degenerate again as he put such matters on automatic or began once more to make time track but these actions alone are not capable of aberrating thetan until he encounters further violent degradation and entrapment in the form of implants 29aberration itself must be calculated to occur the existence of time track only makes it possible for it to occur and be retained thus thetans first real mistake is to consider his own pictures and their recorded events important and his second mistake is in not obliterating entrapment activities in such way as not to become entrapped or aberrated in doing so all of which can be done and should be engram running is step necessary to get at the more fundamental causes of time track and handle them so it is skill which must be done and done well l ron hubbard revision assisted

6 invalidate button out but invalidate will read 7 meter somewhere not connected to pc 8 meter battery flat 9 auditor on the wrong track probably the commonest source of dead looking meter that wont rr or fall hard 10 meter locked up on wrong goal happens mostly on running items in wrong goal 11 overlisting goal or item list 12 getting into gpm in an earlier series but of all the reasons the one least suspected is 13 pc flinch after pc has been knocked around with creaks or pain by actual gpms the pc decides lot of things like go easy on it and just sit here and keep away from it and even i cant take it and bang checkout reads are you flinching is question that will rr on flat meter if the pc is dont overuse it usually youre just on wrong track you may even waste time with new prepcheck on the meter only to find your first prepcheck on it is flat the truth is the pc is rabbiting dont blame the pc too much the pain can be horrible from gpms but remember thisthe only things that turn on pain are invalidating or suppressing right goal wrong goal can have its but tons out mile and just make the pc little dizzy only right goal can make the pc hurt or turn on chroniclooking somatic b right goal in the wrong series which is to say skip of gpms only and b can make the pc hurt 31so if the pc hurts ask or b if its get the suppress invalidate buttons in fast if b get the right goal series or find whats skipped and b can be in combination and then get off any of the considerations pc may have had about not going near gpms and youll avoid future flinch the invalidation read of gpm can be dated and the invalidated gpm can be looked up or otherwise relocated only right goals handled wrong hurt and only this makes pc flinch by the way if the pain of suppressed or invalidated gpm doesnt vanish when the buttons are put in then theres another right goal suppressed or invalidated also or maybe more pc who is consistently flinching needs the subjects of goals etc cleaned up lrhdr

done with good trs exact grade processes and exact actions green form is done by handling every read not by uhuh or nulling it or doing it after the gf is all done observe the auditors code in every line and do the usual and solve the case standard action in handling green form arc brks ptp and mwh itsa b if not cleared on itsa get the basic on the chain all gf and l and ruds follow this rule process is not used except arc break arcu cdei always do list like l1 l4 or gf etc by handling each read as its found random auditing on pcs and preots should not be done knock off these arbitrary somebody else thinks he needs a_____ this is evaluative and break of the auditors code pcs can be stopped by overrepairs they just need to get on with it do standard gf and remedy actions and let pc or preot get on with the next cycle of section or grade its the grade processes and ot levels that improve cases the process the pc should be on is always the next grade if ta rises between sessions get it down with ruds and if that doesnt get it down green form this is standing order tas that wont come down with routine rudiments come down with gf true of all rehabbing actions is you dont rehab on high ta at session start only when it is just then overrun then you rehab it back to fn in ruds all you know when you see read is that the meter read and the question you asked the meter read is not uniformly what you asked and can be protest or repeating false read usually one goes right along auditing but when pc shows any sign of protest or bafflement on rud read you routinely trace it for an earlier false read find and clean it if an rs wont clean up on pc clean up have you ever been accused of things you havent done as process as the rs may be from invalidation can also clean up protest rs on child may be dont tell somebody told him not to b crime c accusationsaid you did something you didnt do you set up case with fn before you undertake major new actions always set up case to be run end off an action at fn its not safe to begin session without an arc br check when theres been time between sessions 38with pcs in sad effect you should always check arc break of long duration you treble time in session every time you take any breaks to economize in auditing time session time you should cut out breaks as they get the pc in trouble when hes out of the room then you have to clean it up and so time is lost ta on sec check means pc tends to be out of valence anybody has few ta goes high and low when pc is going into and to pt from heavy past life never tell pc he will have another session in session as it continues the session and doesnt end it an old old old rule you never let pc off cans in standard tech persistent item that doesnt blow is usually wrong item

when to cut preclears comm with regard to an fn phenomena of pc occurs after phenomena of meter skill to be learnt by the class viii auditor is the precise instant to tell the pc its an fn criticism of auditors trs actually stemmed from the auditors inability to see when cycle of action is complete and cut the pcs comm off at precisely the right instant so it doesnt cut the pcs cycle of action and so it doesnt turn off the fn if the pcs comm is cut wrong the pc tries to conclude it to everyone they meet and so overruns the process that is why pcs dont come back into session with an fn this

session arc breaks then for missed arc break then for falsely called arc brks or suppressed arc brks if this doesnt clean it then ask for an arc brk long duration what has happened is that the pc has gone into secondary or an engram it is not job for rudiments to run it it is only to be keyedout it is q and to date and run secondary in rudiments because of an arc brk needle the auditor is to key it out by session or life itsa and earlier similar incident with itsa each arc break with arcu cdei the cs can have it run as secondary it will be too heavy to run if it is not keyedout first it is handled by keyout in rudiments it is quite usual that pc has just mentioned grief when the arc br needle turns on or some gloomy idea real fn means the pc is out the top an arc br needle means hes out the bottom he ceases to mock up through grief it is very serious thing for pc to get audited over an arc br needle it must be spotted and handled keyedout when it occurs it occurs most often with ta

end phenomena for any process or action with the pc on two cans it is one of the most important rediscoveries made in years it was known but lost by auditors it is the idle uninfluenced movement of the needle on the dial without any patterns or reactions in it it can be as small as 1 or as large as dial wide it does not fall or drop to the right of the dial it moves to the left at the same speed as it moves to the right it is observed on mark v emeter calibrated with the ta between 20 and 30 with gis in on the pc it can occur after cognition blowdown of the ta or just moves into floating the pc may or may not voice the cognition it by the nature of the emeter reading below the awareness of the thetan occurs just before the pc is aware of it so to give thats it on the occurrence of the fn can prevent the pc from getting the cognition floating needle occurring above 30 or below 20 on calibrated mark v meter with the pc on 2 cans is an arc broken needle watch for the pcs indicators an arc broken needle can occur between 20 and 30 where bad indicators are apparent pcs and preots often signal an fn with pop to the left and the needle can actually even describe pattern much like rock slam meters with lighter movements do pop to the left one does not sit and study and be sure of an fn it swings or pops he lets the pc cognite and then indicates the fn to the pc preventing overrun when one overruns an fn or misses one the ta will start to climb the thing to do is briefly rehabilitate it rehab it by indicating it has been bypassed and so regains it the fn does not last very long in releasing the thing to do is end the process off now dont give another command it coincides with other end phenomena of processes but is senior to them an fn can be in normal range and still be an arc break needle the thing which determines real fn is good indicators bad indicators always accompany an arc break needle on an arc break needle check for an arc break if the ta then climbs it was real fn so you rehab it quickly onehand electrode sometimes obscures an fn and gives false ta if used use higher sensitivity and get the ta from 2 cans when needed l ron hubbard founder revised by

others or their beingness persons possessions or dynamics motivator is called motivator because it tends to prompt an overt it gives person motive or reason or justification for an overt when person commits an overt or overt of omission with motivator he tends to believe or pretends that he has received motivator which does not in fact exist this is false motivator beings suffering from this are said to have motivator hunger and are often aggrieved over nothing cases which cave in hard suffer from false motivators and resolve on being asked for overts done for reason cases which do not resolve on actual motivators have overts that have to be handled there is also the case with false overts the person has been hit hard for reason so they dream up reasons they were hit cases that go

environmental menace that keeps something continually keyedin this can be constant recurring somatic or continual recurring pressure or mass the menace in the environment is not imaginary in such extreme cases the action can be taken to key it out but if the environmental menace is actual and persists it will just keyin again this gives recurring pressure unrelieved by usual processing in this event one can compare the environmental menace by finding it listing 2way comm etc and one will then find the incident or incidents being keyedin are exactly similar in all respects or are thought so these can be run out as secondaries or engrams theoretically an environmental continual overt would do the same thing in which case the secondary or engram would match it this is in fact the only engrams that will run and erase on pts case personal rollercoaster has this as its source the person does not see or associate the two this is why the pts case does not respond to processing and gives way for it to respond this is also why the sick and insane do not respond it is the same mech anism l ron hubbard founder lrhbw copyright 1968 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 50hubbard

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 2 april 1969ra revised 28 july 1978 remimeo revisions in this type style dianetic assists include in medical series the use of dianetics to the medical doctor there is everything to be said for correct medical treatment in the handling of the sick and insane insanity is most often the suppressed agony of actual physical illness and injury to treat this agony with shock and brain operations is nuremberg type offense and is indictable as mayhem or manslaughter the medical treatment of insanity requires sure awareness by the patient of his whereabouts and present time these are usually quite unbearable so he has sunk into the past to escape the agony of the present the touch assist given to such injured persons permits healing to occur by restoring the person to the present and his whereabouts to some degree healing after medical treatment might not occur rapidly if the insane or chronically ill person remains in the past unable to confront the present thus the touch assist speeds and often permits healing after medical treatment and sometimes in minor injuries and illness permits the doctor to accomplish healing without further treatment there is the touch assist the contact assist and the auditing assist the touch assist done as described elsewhere brings the patients attention to injured or affected body areas when attention is withdrawn from them so is circula tion nerve flows and energy which for one thing limits nutrition to the area and for another prevents the drain of waste products some ancient healers attributed re markable flows and qualities to the laying on of hands probably the workable element in this was simply heightening awareness of the affected area and restoring the physical communication factors the contact assist is remarkable when it can be done the patient is taken to the area where the injury occurred and makes the injured member gently contact it several times sudden pain will fly off and the injury if minor lessens or vanishes this is again physical communication factor the body member seems to have with drawn from that exact spot in the physical universe the restoration of awareness is often necessary before healing can occur the prolongation of chronic injury occurs in the absence of physical communi cation with the affected area or with the location of the spot of injury in the physical universe the auditing assist is done by trained auditor using an emeter 55it consists of running out the physically painful experience the person has just undergone accident illness operation or emotional shock this erases the psychic trauma and speeds healing to remarkable degree if done properly in addition to assists there is dianetic auditing of an acutely ill person which handles the current and past illnesses and injuries by erasing the physical trauma the last is skilled activity practitioners who have the idea such things do not have causes will of course fail to locate the causes sickness can be composed let us say of headache nausea apathy and weariness such sickness may be bizarre without medical reason by first getting the patient to find and say what shock occurred when the sickness began getting when and getting it recounted the illness will lessen the emotional state will altercalled release of affect by then finding an earlier similar instance and getting that one dated and re counted further release of affect may occur if the good indicators smiles etc do not occur in the patient one again asks for an earlier incident dates it and gets it recounted physically sick persons divide into two classes acutely ill and chronically ill person who is acutely ill is temporarily or momentarily ill and person who is chronically ill is simply ill all the time you do not run heavy engram processes on an acutely ill pa you do touch assists and get scientology auditor to deliver processes given in cs series 9 hcob 21 june 1970 fourth section sick pcs tech bulletin volume vii page 89 you try not to run heavy engram chains on acutely ill pus as they are physically not up to it cannot stand sessions long enough to get anywhere with chain and usually all that happens is the pa feels spinny and left in restimmed condition you can run touch assists and light objective processes on chronically ill pa you can begin exactly as you would with an acutely ill pa with the difference that when he improves you can run out the physically painful experience the person has just undergone with narrative r3ra after this you can proceed with regular new era dianetics needless to say all this requires skilled auditor but the skill can be acquired in dianetic training course the important thing is not to tell the patient what caused it but to let him tell you otherwise the symptom suppresses the approach in any of these assists is quiet gentle permissive never forcing the patient speaking only the words required to do the process the temporarily insane by reason of emotional shock where medical illness exists should be permitted rest and should then be handled by an assist as above or normal dianetic auditing most often rest and further harassment result in return to sanity in short time such as few days but not in terror atmosphere such as psychiatric asylum where the patient is in the risk of being hurt or killed electric shock prolongs the condition and brain surgery is of course not treatment but murder as at best it deprives the person of his coordination and at worst shortens his life the occasional and rare brain tumor is of course an exception but this is medical not psychiatric matter matter what manifestations the person exhibits 56most medically ill people do exhibit symptoms of mental derangement at some stage of their illness the acceleration of healing of medical illness or injury such as broken bones or the after effects of delivery or operations can be accomplished by the dianetic auditing of the resulting trauma soon after full medical treatment or attention the improvement factor is about 13 the normal time of recovery by some thousands of test cases such auditing is done by usual dianetic procedure in addition to the above assists there is regular dianetic auditing which handles chronic discomforts and prevents future illness as well as improving the state of well being of person the mechanisms of the mind revealed in dianetics are of great use to the field of medicine they are easy and quick to apply about one months training is all that is necessary to acquaint an otherwise educated and intelligent person with the fundamentals and skills necessary to assists considerably more time of course is necessary to train skilled scientology audi tor but this is not the subject of this paper there is conflict of interest between any healing profession and dianetics dianetic materials and papers are fully available there is conflict between dianetics and political practices such as psychiatry since electric shock brain operations and general degradation of the person may prevent the patients recovery by dianetics as answers exist now for insanity there is reason to continue medieval or fascist solutions to the problem of the psychosomatically ill or the insane and we are doing everything in our power against fantastic opposition to end the torture and killing of the insane regardless of the politically desirable ends envisioned by some groups dianetics like any other true treatment like aspirin or penicillin was originally designed to handle the apparent basic cause of psychosomatic illness the first research was intended to help allied prisoners of war degraded by the japanese and chinese prison camps and who after vj day were transferred to oak knoll naval hospital later in 1954 in much more advanced state of development dianetics was successfully employed to eradicate the results of allied prisoners of the korean war who had been subjected to russian brainwashing the subject has been improved made easier to teach and apply and its results bettered continually over total period of 29 years it was in 1969 fully updated as standard dianetics in 1978 it has again been upgraded as new era dianetics it is very successful and is in very broad use over the world l ron hubbard founder lrhcib copyright 1969 1978 by

knowledge and skill above and beyond the training level of the new era dianetics course is not to be expected of the new era dianetics auditor there are also things in book one we longer use such as repeater technique looking for phrases to explain conditions we use dianetics as it was reworked in the early 60s and as currently being presented in the new era dianetics series if it isnt on the

this review all scientology skills but grades can be done in review he can get in his rudiments etc it is very worthy of note that in reviewing dianetics or in doing dianetic auditing one can run out bad sessions as an auditor or pc by using r3ra on auditing sessions or therapy if we keep dianetics to dianetics we will again achieve the miracles of which it is capable dianetics has been refined greatly but it is all there on the checksheets now there is hidden data line it is far less complex today than it was in 1953 for instance and much more effective but it is still dianetics it is

sick is lock on is locked to the incident unseen at the moment of getting sick eating cake when one finds lock it can be run like any other mental image picture secondary is mental image picture of moment of severe and shocking loss or threat of loss which contains misemotion such as anger fear grief apathy or deathfulness it is mental image recording of time of severe mental stress it may contain unconsciousness when it is restimulated by similar but lighter experience another mental image picture is recorded which becomes lock on the secondary and serves to keep the secondary alive secondary is called secondary because it itself depends upon an earlier engram with similar data but real pain etc an engram is mental image picture which is recording of time of physical pain and unconsciousness it must by definition have impact or injury as part of its content it is of the very greatest importance that dianetic auditor really grasp what these things are otherwise he wont know what he is doing or to what now because he isnt seeing his preclears pictures an auditor can become very careless about them and not handle them correctly if an auditor doesnt really know what these things are erasure locks secon daries engrams he cannot of course hope to handle them for the preclear the basic dianetic errors are just not knowing what these are and that they are there to be handled and that these and these alone cause psychosomatic ills once one has full grip on these definitions he can then and only then hope to do anything with them for the preclear if the auditor is going to handle the aches pains unwanted sensations and psy chosomatic illnesses of the preclear it requires that he fully grasp these basic defini tions literally millions of complications can stem from the simple fact that preclear records experiences in mental image pictures and that these thereafter can affect his body adversely 59once one really understands that mental image pictures are all there is in the preclears mind one has understood the total of aberration there is not something else there id ego there are only mental image pictures these if you use the exact procedures of dianetics can be found and erased when the unwanted locks secondaries and engrams are erased the preclear will be rid of the physical disabilities of which he complains and will be well physically somaticmeans essentially body sensation illness or pain or discomfort soma means body hence psycho somatic or pains stemming from the mind misemotionanything that is unpleasant emotion such as antagonism anger fear grief apathy or death feeling this is the entire breadth of dianetics today in scientology we deal with the thetan the being who is the individual and who handles and lives in the body this is beyond the scope of todays dianetics if preclear is well physically made so by dianetics and any required physical medication or nutrition he can then embark on scientology the increase of his abilities and spiritual freedom if preclear who is being audited or has been audited on scientology grades becomes ill one does not try to make him well by giving him new higher grades that has been an error of great magnitude instead one reverts to dianetic auditing until the pc is well and only then continues with scientology this is correct procedure because it works people come into scientology to cure their headaches somebody starts them off on grade auditing several grades later they still have their headache it is continual present time problem to them and the auditor it sometimes vanishes during grade processing this gives an unfortunate win the right thing to have done was give the person dianetic auditing until he or she longer had headaches and then begin to audit the person on grades so as to put them well above ever again getting headaches continual headaches come from mental image pictures retained by the pc of having head crushed or shot off or hit that is an engram it actually had to happen it is not imaginary or delusion the proof is that when the auditor finally erases the engram the recording of the injury is gone and the headaches will not again occur the preclear often is unable to confront the actual engram at once he offers one lock time when he had headache one runs this lock one always runs whatever is offered you dont force the pc and finds after putting the preclear through it couple of times that it is getting more solid or it simply isnt erasing one finds an earlier recording this possibly turns out to be secondary the pc had moment of loss and cried and also had headache this secondary may or may not erase if it does one leaves it of course as fin ished but if it goes more solid shown by ta rising at the end of run through the incidentor if the pa says it is going more solid one then asks for an earlier incident one probably would then get the actual engram recording of time when the head was actually injured the auditor runs this through and as soon as he has completed run through the incident and discovered from the rising ta or the pc that the incident is going more solid he asks for an earlier incident 60this one erases when it erases the whole chain of headaches also erases and that is the end of the pcs headaches period one then inquires after other somatics or sensations and handles them the same way it is all done by using the technique called r3ra without variation since these recordings contain mainly otherdeterminedness pictures of others doing things the auditor always has more control over the preclears mental image pictures than the preclear does thus the pictures do what the auditor says this point too must be grasped by an auditor or he will be waiting on the preclear to act or move in time the time track is the consecutive record of mental image pictures which accumulates through the preclears life or lives it is very exactly dated pleasure moments are mental image pictures containing pleasure sensa tions they respond to r3ra one seldom addresses them unless the preclear is fixated on some type of pleasure to point where it has become highly aberrated black field is just some part of mental image picture where the preclear is looking at blackness it is part of some lock secondary or engram in scientology it can occur rarely when the pc is exterior looking at something black it responds to r3ra invisible field is just part of some lock secondary or engram that is invisible it like black field responds to r3ra pressure somatic is in dianetics considered to be symptom in lock secondary or engram simply part of the content whatever the symptom pain sensation whatever it is from either the body directly such as broken bone gallstone or immediate physical cause or is part of the content of mental image picturelock secondary or engram the dianetic auditor does not audit ideas or think he is handling mental record ings ideas are in them ideas come out of them but think is longer part of dia netics in dianetics we handle locks secondaries and engrams keyin is the action of recording lock on secondary or engram keyout is an action of the engram or secondary dropping away without being erased dianetic fns are handled differently than scientology fns an fn seen by the auditor in running r3ra is not called until the full dianetic ep is reached an auditor running r3ra is not looking for fns he is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running the ep of dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off the postulate is what holds the chain in its place release the postulate and the chain blows thats it 61the auditor must recognize the postulate when the pa gives it note the vgis call the fn and end off auditing that chain an fn seen as the incident is erasing is not called the pa does not have to state that the incident has erased once he has given up the postulate the erasure has occurred the auditor will see an fn and vgis now the fn is called fns are not indicated until the ep of postulate off fn and vgis is reached its the postulatenot the fn that we are going for in new era dianetics multiple illnessmeans the preclear is physically uncomfortable or ill from several engrams of different types all restimulated one runs one somatic chain at time running each new symptom that is assessed or stated by the preclear chain means series of recordings of similar experiences chain has engrams secondaries and locks examplehead injury chain in the sequence encountered by an auditor and run by r3rasporting goods display window seeing it lock losing bat secondary hit in the head with bat engram the engram is the earliest date the secondary later date the lock the most recent by using somatics to trace back meaning discomforts complaints sensations aches pains and by staying on the chain of only one somatic ie headaches you get back down the single chain without dispersing all over the place into different chains thus one runs the chain of one particular somatic or discomfort or complaint down to keyout or erasure before doing the next somatic or discomfort or complaint automatic bankwhen pc gets picture after picture after picture all out of control this occurs when one isnt following an assessed somatic or complaint or has chosen the wrong one or one which the pc is not ready to confront or by overwhelming the pc with rough trs or going very nonstandard some pcs turn up in their first session with automatic banks the thing to do is carefully assess the physical complaint for longest or best read and gently handle that chain well basicthis is the first experience recorded in mental image pictures of the type of pain sensation discomfort etc every chain has its basic it is pecu liarity and fact that when one gets down to the basic on chain the postulate made at the time of the incident comes off and b the whole chain vanishes for good basic is simply earliest unburdeningas basic is not at once available on any chain one usually unburdens it by running later engrams secondaries and locks the act of unburdening would be digging off the top to get at the bottom as in moving sand as you run off later incidents the ability of the preclear to confront it also increases and basic is easy to run when finally contacted basic basicthis belongs in scientology it is wholly beyond the scope of dianetics it means the most basic basic of all basics and results in clearing it is found on the clearing course if contacted or run before the pc was brought up through the scientology grades he wouldnt be able to handle it anyway as experience has shown so this is part of scientology not dianetics valence is the form and identity of the preclear or another the beingness allya person from whom one had sympathy and was dependent upon assess in dianetics means choose from list or statements which item or thing has the longest read or the pcs interest the longest read will also have the pcs interest oddly enough if you know these definitions cold so you dont have to mutter them or memo 62rize them but just know them you will really get results with dianetics the biggest failure in training auditors was their faulty grasp of what they were addressing and their additive think the discoveries of dianetics were basic and vital and opened wide new explored frontier these words were assigned to things arbitrarily they had to be man had not had any notion of these things before so they had names and had to be assigned names the names were chosen because they didnt also mean something else in another field of science the terms are therefore important and what they mean and the things they name must be grasped before success can attend any auditing any failures of dianetic auditors were not the failures of dianetics the persons attempting to audit others didnt know what these things were essentially the lock the secondary the engram erasure and keyout so these are essential to any training or use of dianetics l ron hubbard founder lrh jceirdrblfgnckjm copyright 1969 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 63hubbard

mainly the us it was illegal to heal or cure anything there was even law in california giving 25 illnesses that were against the law to cure the better business bureau in the us even issues pamphlets that state that you can always tell fake healer because he says he can cure something why civilization would make it illegal to cure illness can only be explained by some vested interest making more money out of people being sick than getting people well there existed continual threat to anyone who helped their fellows the ability of scientology to bring about spiritual freedom therefore received the concentration of effort by organizations lately public opinion has turned heavily against these suppressive groups and the public discovery that illegal seizure torture and murder was the hidden activity of political psychiatric groups has lost these people their support it was overlooked that spiritual healing of the body has not been illegal and that dianetics used for pastoral counseling is completely legal it is sobering thought that the only effective technology of psychosomatic heal ingdianeticscould be suppressed out of full usage one is handling the effect of the spirit on the body therefore even dianetics is spiritual healing and as such is far from illegal man should not be kept ill just to let few have monopoly in almost all other countries than the us there is restriction on healing despite monopolistic efforts to make one 64another reason dianetics was for some time out of use was that it was believed it had been superseded by scientology which it never was in fact dianetics can be done with reference whatever to scientology or its techniques people who have given up through illness are also prone to want to leave instead of confronting their illness it is easier to try to get away from it thus such people are in hurry to be free and prefer scientology but if they have sick body it is present time problem and inhibits attaining the spiritual freedom they seek the correct procedure is to make them well wherever possible with medical treat ment and to handle their psychosomatic illnesses with dianetics and then before any further abuses by life can occur to raise their ability and secure their freedom with scientology this is the correct use of dianetics it is the remedy for psychosomatic illness the basic use of dianetics is to make well body and to augment physical treatment any injurious experience can be erased by dianetics it is very easy to use and if one wants people well and happy it should be used at every occasion person has an operation this should be followed soon after by touch assists and other handlings from the full assist checklist 28 may 1974ra revised 1i july 1978 including erasure of the engram of the

healing will occur where relapse might have followed woman has child the engram of delivery should be run out soon after the result of doing so is very spectacular there is postpartum psychosis or dislike of the child and permanent injury to the mother it is in fact best to audit the mother both before and after the delivery which gives one fast relatively painless childbirth and quick recovery recovery from disease under treatment is speeded by dianetic auditing where the incident of the break is with any chain run out broken limb will heal by xray evidence in two instead of six weeks some patients who are not responding to medical treatment who are then given as little as touch assist will then be found responsive to the medical treatment an auditor giving the person dianetic session will more or less ensure that the medical treatment will now work person who is accident prone when audited usually loses this unwanted charac teristic many insane recover from their symptoms when given proper medical treat ment rest harassment and then good mild dianetic processing they become and remain normal people without relapse chronic which is to say longterm illnesses cease when audited by dianetics and then medical treatment which was earlier ineffective whole classes of mentally retarded children have been made more normal by teachers in london county council schools using relatively unskilled dianetics tiredness unwanted sensations bizarre pains and aches bad hearing or sight also routinely respond to dianetic processing the sickness and death rate of persons who are part of dianetic groups is only small fraction of that of other groups 65pilots audited with dianetics by test involving whole squadron went without single even minor accident for the following year scientists audited with dianetics have greatly improved intelligence dianetics raises iq as side product to usual auditing at rate of about one point of iq per hour of processing withered limbs skin blotches and rashes and even blindness and deafness have all responded to dianetics possibly the point which counted most against dianetics in the early attacks on it was that it did vast array of things the truth was it actually did them when you have the answer to the human mind as in dianetics of course anything caused by the mind can be remedied it is very much easier to train dianetic auditor than scientology auditor it requires only about month to make dianetic auditor who is sufficiently conversant with the subject to get results this too was used against dianetics as the psychiatrist of that day claimed he himself needed twelve years of study to do psychiatry of course when the public found out that the product of these twelve years of study was killing the insane and increasing their number the argument became silly the spectacular personal gains which were available in scientology were so great they tended to obscure the very real use and value of dianetics further scientology executive trained and processed beyond the need of body help tended to forget that much of the public out there first had to be helped out of their physical misery before they could attempt anything like personal gain you use dianetics much the way you would use any remedy when fellow is burned you audit out the burn when woman loses loved one you audit out the loss when young man cant finish his schooling you audit out his unhappy school experiences dianetics is for use there is not lot of admin about it it isnt something you use after bowing down three times to chicago you just use it dianetic auditor who sees someone sick and who doesnt get him treatment and then audit him is just not humane woman going to have babyget out the meter and audit her into shape for it when shes had it run out the delivery fellow burns his hand break out the meter dianetics is the answer to human suffering use it ideas build up which halt the use of dianetics such as once you have floating needle on engrams you dont run them anymore thats silly the dianetic end phenomena is postulate off fn and vgis this means that the chain has blown that full ep can then be called the end of that chain but not the end of dianetics on the case ref hcob 16 sep 78 postulate off equals erasure i am not trying to make anyone wrong by reintroducing the real use of dianetics i myself had not realized how separate and vital it was as technology until recently i was engaged for many years researching and completing scientology i had not noticed and had not said that dianetics must be preserved and used in all cases of 66psychosomatic illness or in physical suffering yet during all this time when i had to handle illness i did not use scientology i used good old dianetics now i have refined it and made better statement of it and made it easier to use and i trust it will be used for what it was intended and that scientology grades will be relieved of the burden of attempting to heal physical illness use for which it was never designed scientology is vital practice in itself it places person above any further illness or suffering but he has to be made well first people will ask deafness now what special process is needed in curing deaf ness this is one of the modern refinements of dianetics one runs whatever is assessed on the preclear with preclear interest he doesnt decide to cure somebody of deafness he handles the illness or disability the pc offers up that reads on the meter and has pc interest maybe it will be deafness you have one single body of tech covering all cases and that is now new era dianetics and the steps of hcob 22 june 1978r new era dianetics series 2r new era dianetics full pc program outline the whole of the persons com plaints should eventually vanish if you just keep on going with the full pc program outline applying new era dianetics standardly and fully completing each part of the program having gotten the pc well by medical care and dianetic auditing then start out with scientology if he gets sick again before many grades revert to dianetics handle it and then when he is well resume scientology where you left off never run scientology grade to make pc well or cure something its application by using dianetics as readily as you use shoes you can make and keep people well you dont worry about overruns rudiments or anything else you just use r3ra even to correct arc breaks and ptps and bad auditing by then correctly using scientology we can make the person far better being we have had standard dianetics for some time we now have even further im proved dianetic technology with the new era dianetics series we have developed scientology standard tech both are now valid as themselves they do not cross

while you get scientology result while running dianetics also sometimes you get dianetic result while auditing scientology this tends to keep the two distinctly different subjects confused with each other preclear after dianetic auditing tells the examiner he is exterior and feeling fantastically bright this is scientology result sometimes scientology preclear after attaining grade will state that it has healed his terror stomach this is dianetic result there is nothing whatever wrong with this except that it gives an auditor an invitation to confuse the subjects and think they are the same the clue is consistency dianetics only rarely exteriorizes preclear scientology only occasionally handles terror stomach in fact person whose terror stomach wasnt handled by dianetics and its r3ra can go all the way to ot vi sometimes with it he doesnt get rid of the terror stomach and he doesnt since he had present time problem all the way make ot vi either if it is body pain sensation somatic illness disability the subject to use is dianetics if it is gain in ability and beingness that is the purpose the subject to use is scientology after many years of handling cases this emerged as very factual fact dianetics is dianetics scientology is scientology if you mix them they attain limited results this is so true that when you use all the prohibitives and never nevers of scien tology in doing dianetics dianetics also fails see these two subjects as clearly separate they each have their own case supervision orders you dont use scientology case supervision orders in case supervising dianetics and you dont use the dianetic rules on scientology one addresses the body the other the thetan they both go by their own rules there is also new era dianetics the rules of which are rigidly adhered to so dianetics is not scientology downgrade either dianetic results are well body and being happy with it scientology results are free powerful and immortal being they can and do

dis covery chains are not held together by narratives or personnel or locations they are held together by awarenesses thus when running r3ra not narrative r3ra we ask for and follow down only awarenesses contained in the preassessment list there are thousand different descriptive words that could add up to an awareness pains aches dizziness sadness these are all awarenesses awareness pleasant or unpleasant of thetan plus body is what we are trying to run in dianetics this brings to light further discovery one never assesses medical terms or symptoms an engram contains pain and unconsciousness all right then its basic would be physical duress not symptom resulting from that duress example the pc says headache you assess headache you try to run head aches and all you ever get is times pc had headache well the headache is symptom caused by head injury the engram must have contained shot in the head or crushed skull or some actual injury the word headache would describe only how the head feels later when the engram occasionally goes into restimulation so you would get only locks and secondaries to audit and only by chance and an alteration by the pc of the command to find an earlier headache would you ever get to an engram in which the head was crushed or injured headache is the result of head injury and it doesnt describe the injury which in engram form is now giving the pc headaches take the medical term arthritis you could ask for arthritis and get only visits to the doctor or times in wheel chair the physical injury contained in the engram causing the arthritis is not described alcoholism would present the same problem if the pc listed and the auditor assessed alcoholism we would only get times when he was drunk not the engram causing the symptom which might contain feeling very dry therefore we have the preassessment procedure of new era dianetics after getting from the pa the original item the drug alcohol condition illness etc to be handled we preassess to get the awarenesses connected to it 69 and we will land the real engram every time not only its locks or secondaries it is quite all right to run locks and secondaries as it is necessary to unburden the chain and increase the pcs confront but chains always end up in basic engram at the bottom and if you dont get and erase that then the chain will key in again in asking for list items one puts down only what the pc says thats an invariable rule but when the pc says some symptom like headache or medical term like arthritis the auditor writes it down if it reads and has pa interest he first runs it narrative to full ep narrative r3ra quad then he does preassessment on arthritis to get all the somatics connected with the item example pc says complaint is sinusitis the auditor writes it down and if it has read and pc is interested he runs it narrative r3ra quad he then does preassessment on it lists from the preassessment item found and ends up with running item burning sensation in the nose and runs it r3ra quad to full ep sinusitis can of course be preassessed many times and the items run if the auditor took and assessed only sinusitis and then asked for incidents of sinusitis he would get only locks and secondariestimes when the engram was in restimulation and he would rarely get the real basic and engram that causes the symptom this discovery opens the door to swift cures but one is obviously not treating sinusitis he is looking for an incident in which there was burning sensation in the nose and after few locks and upper engrams hed find and run the real injury in which the nose was burned l ron hubbard founder lrhjcldmeirdlfg copyright 1969 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 70hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

dianetics it means an engram too late on the chain to erase is in restimulation scientology auditor rehabs overruns dianetic auditor cures high ta by finding what engram lock or secondary is in restimulation active this will show up as pain sensation misemotion or other present time feeling the pc has in short just by finding the somatic by list and assessing for longest read and running r3ra you can cure high ta you handle ta that goes up during session by completing the chain exactly as in r3ra the same action you do for r3ra also cures the high ta by running pa on an incident late on the chain without going earlier you drive the ta high by ending off before the pc has given the postulate he made at the time of the incident hence not getting complete erasure you can leave the picture partially there and capable of affecting the pc there can be an infinity of wrong ways but only one right way and the right way is r3ra by the book high ta 4 or above is simply the emeters reaction to increased mass mental image pictures have mass the mass has what is called resistance to electricity the emeter measures electrical resistance mass resists electricity thus in the pres ence of mental mass as contained in mental image pictures the tone arm of the emeter rises when you restimulate an engram the emeter current flow has more trouble getting through the pc and the ta rises when the engram or lock or secondary is keyedout moved away the ta comes down and the meter needle will float if you find long chain with many engrams on it and run late engram the ta goes up as you go earlier and eventually find basic the ta comes down and when you get the postulate and erase the basic engram the ta will come down to between 2 and 3 and the needle will float old disproved theory predianetics was that the emeter reacted to sweat on the hands but of course person would have to sweat and unsweat to make the meter behave as it does and the idea of unsweating would be ridiculous palms of the hand do not go wetdry with enough rapidity to account for meter reaction up and down 71when you run several engrams through once or several somatic chains without erasing any you pile up too much mass and the ta will go high and stick even if nothing is done to repair this the pc will destimulate the pictures will drop away in from 3 to 10 days it is very poor show of auditing to do r3ra other than exactly by the book it is very easy to do it exactly right the drill is simple if done exactly right the result is good and invariable lrhcicrdkjm l ron hubbard

this would save nearly all work required of case supervisor when the auditor is in fumbly state regarding the procedure and has not drilled it until he could do it with the house caving in the preclear does not get good results that is really all there is to it if the auditor simply observes the auditors code handles trs and the meter fairly well and does the assessments and r3ra exactly as laid out the results will be found to be astonishingly good even miraculous __________ to correct bad session the normal action of the cs is to order the offbeat actions done correctly 75example auditor assessed by interest only not by read and the session bogged down cs actionreassess by longest read b medical terms were put on the running item list one was chosen and case bogged cs action order such be taken off list and proper preassessment procedure applied to it to get running items c basic was found and auditor told it was erasing but sent pc earlier but pc could find nothing so left it cs orders the last incident found fully erased d auditor tells pc he wont run it because it isnt an engram cs action order auditor to retrain on auditors code and do invalidation and evaluation in clay orders pc to scientology auditor green form pc very nattery to auditor cs orders pc to scientology auditor and be sure to pull all withholds f cs finds his orders to complete chain left undone with high ta were not donefolder mislaid or pc not routed pc has become ill order the pc to medical treatment and the chain completed and the auditor to ethics you see how it is each time the auditor violated normal simple procedure the cs orders that the normal simple procedure be completed either by first giving pc scientology green form and then completing the new era dianetics action or omitting gf when pc not out rud just getting the real standard action done this is really all there is to case supervising new era dianetics case folders the more you try to do something else than the above the further the case will go wrong the hubbard new era dianetics auditor does not have to know how to do green forms or rudiments when they have to be done you get scientology auditor to do them it is serious error to mix up dianetics and scientology the potential errors of out ruds and all the rest are present of course in any new era dianetics session but do not usually happen when exact new era dianetics proce dure is used when they do happen you send the pc to scientology auditor this is case supervision new era dianetics it has been fully worked out by my case supervising great many dianetic sessions to launch this new view of dianetics and the above is what i found it drives home also the necessity of training new era dianetics auditors as precision technologists and the risk of letting people audit before they are fully grooved in on exactly whats done in new era dianetics session l ron hubbard founder lrhcsrdlfgkjm copyright 1969 1978 by l ron

the somatic auditor says is it erasing pc cant feel somatic so he says its gone auditor puzzled by full end phenomena but buys it what you want to know as an auditor is is the picture erasing you can use that line to check but not habitually erasure depends on the pc getting to the beginning of the incident sometimes the pc keeps starting bit late in the incident and so does not get an erasure if you assess an item like dizziness after an operation and try to run it the pc will bog utterly as the whole operation precedes the somatic called for and not only wont erase but also wont show as

somatic chains ref new era dianetics series bulletins now and then it is necessary to audit out the last session or an auditing session one does this by using narrative r3ra wording when asking the pc to go earlier one asks for an earlier similar incident is there an earlier similar incident session when audited does not always erase instead it has become part of chain therefore one has to run narrative r3ra on it and get an earlier similar incident the chain may go back vast amounts of time whereas the pc may only have been in scientology 3 days before scientology there were other types of sessions such as psychoanalysis and before that in rome and greece dream therapy in which one was visited by god and before thatwell the chain can have very far back basic one does not of course suggest ever what the earlier incident may be there is telling what the pc may confuse with session if one asked the pc to locate an earlier incident with similar feeling one would be on another chain entirely hence one asks simply is there an earlier similar incident when running session out running session out has the liability that one is running narrative chain similar experience rather than similar somatic one of the major 1969 breakthroughs was that chains are held together mainly by somatics the body condition or somatic is what keeps the chain in association one does of course run narrative incidents by which one means similar experiences see hcob 25 june 78 new era dianetics series 8 dianetics beginning pc on locate an earlier time your mother spanked you locate an earlier wreck these will run and erase but they must be done properly this is by running the incident over and over to erasure asking after each run through for earlier beginning and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind badly running only narrative incidents is what made early dianetics run up such fabulous numbers of hours in processing the commands for running narrative incidents and further data on running narratives are to be found in hcob 26 june 1978 issue ii new era dianetics series 6 routine 3ra engram running by chains somatic chains go quickly to basic and are the important chains thus when we erase chain of sessions we sometimes run into very long session sometimes the ta goes up to 4 or 5 particularly if the auditor grinds using wrong goearlier command is primary reason for trouble usually if you ask simply for an earlier beginning or an earlier similar incident the pc goes back to something that will erase and it blows but remember asking for similar types of experience can get very long and erasure may not occur for some time running out sessions can be worthwhile action but the best thing to do is goof assessments or sessions in the first place

equals erasure there are two extremes dianetic student can go to on the subject of erasure he can grind and grind and grind def def def def on and on with the ta going up up up and never once tell the pc to go earlier b he can watch the ta come down to between 2 and 3 and go loose on the last incident run ask the pc erase or solid get noncommittal answer and send the pc earlier he can keep sending the pc earlier and earlier on another chain without ever noticing hes finished the first chain these are the two extreme cases in case it is obvious from ta rise that the chain has an earlier incident or the incident being run has an earlier beginning in case b it is obvious from the ta that the chain erased in the student is preventing the pc from going earlier when he should in b the student is forcing the pc to go earlier when he shouldnt in both cases the student hasnt clue of what an engram chain is it is marvelous how students demand the exact phrase to use as an effort to avoid having to really understand what they are doing in auditing if student hasnt clue about what he is doing then thousand goofy outnesses will keep cropping up each one requiring supervisor thinks special instruction after while you get course text weighing one ton and all because the student didnt grab the basic definitions in the first place student who will do either or b above has not grasped the most basic facts concerning erasure 1 an engram chain is held in place by the basic for that chain and the postulate made at the time of that incident 2 the basic is the first time 3 the clue to erasure is unburdening down to the first time and getting the postulate made at the time of the incident 4 that all picture chains are there because the first time and the postulate made at that time are there the student assumes one always asks solid or erasing or that one always does only what the pa says or some such consideration i would damned well never ask solid or erasing if i saw the ta start to climb i would know the ta measured mental mass and that it was accumulating and wouldnt erase i would immediately send the pa earlier as soon as he had completed his pass through the incident honest its awful easy 80a very odd outness student will encounter when he is so dedicated to the exact words is the fast pc who erases before he can tell about it along about 3 of r3ra the ta blows down and the needle fns student who knew his business by understanding would ask did it erase of course the pc would say it vanished and vgis would come in fast running pc on light chain can occasionally blow an engram by inspection if it was basic for that chain one would be committing the crime described in b above the pc is likely to go into another chain or heavy protest so you see theres substitution for actually understanding whats going on theres the pc theres the bank theres the meter needle theres the meter tone arm and theres the auditor theres the procedure theres the report thats all the parts there are to session when one understands each one one can audit when one doesnt understand some part of any of the above he will require unusual solutions anything truly powerful is truly simple so student who goofs is being complex and hasnt understood something about one of the major parts named above i just saw goofedup session that went like this pc it the engram happened every day for three days auditor def flunk the auditor was so deficient in knowing about chains and first time that he didnt tell the pc to go to the first days engram but let the poor pc flounder in day 3 and so the chain did not erase and the pc hung up in it if the rule of first time is really understood one would realize lot of things even that the pc was beginning an incident halfway through it and hadnt begun to run the beginning of it so of course erasure if this happened on basic theres earlier incident ta high is there an earlier beginning to this incident hey yes there is go to the new beginning of that incident and tell when you are there yoicks an erasure this is invitation to depart from procedure its an invitation to see procedure as an action very precise capable of being understood and done not rote chant im sure some students are exmedicine men who did their spells with exactly worded chants its time they understood the brew in the pot thats the

dianetics series 2r hcob 22 june 78r new era dianetics full pc program outline one just follows it there is very little to new era dianetics cs work the case supervisor must be hubbard new era dianetics graduate there is substitute for that one who isnt would hopelessly snarl up real new era dianetics auditors or students aspiring to that cert the new era dianetics cs should really be new era dianetics graduate and class viii even so he has to keep these techs completely separate one never asks new era dianetics auditor in dianetic session to do any thing except new era dianetics there are other actions the cs in correcting an auditor should do it positively and refer to the dianetic hcob negative criticism i have found undermines auditors one can as easily say the same thing in positive way instead of you broke the auditors code one can as easily say pcs must be rested before session see auditors code one never gets inventive in doing new era dianetics cs it is all very straightforward the cs point of view in new era dianetics csing is that one is trying to get new era dianetics done one isnt in new era dianetics csing torturously laboring to solve some difficult case therefore there are only four possible actions for new era dianetics cs to take the case that makes gains is given more new era dianetics b the case that has had all possible new era dianetics gain and that is considerable is sent on to scientology c the case that makes gain due to case oddity is sent to scientology auditor d the session that is nonstandard in auditing requires the pc be sent to scientology auditor 82it is the fantastic fact that the pc will only get dianetic wins when receiving standard new era dianetics nonstandardness only once in hundred will give case gain and that is fluke the case supervisor must have good subjective and objective reality on this fact he must therefore be the ultimate in dictatorial martinet precision in requiring standard auditing and assigning standard cses there are two types of cases only that come up 1 the case as in above who just goes on getting wins 2 the case who in life is usually chronically ill even if up and about that requires cs to play adept scientology auditing against new era dianetics auditing such case is solved by now being sent to scientology auditor now being sent to dianetics back and forth in d above the pc who gets nonstandard session and is bogged at the examiners is simply given scientology green form to fn heshe is then returned to new era dianetics auditing this is very usual easy action in c above the oddity case is easily recognizable in the folder the oddity consists mainly of getting new era dianetics auditing getting sick or in getting auditing but not being able to follow good standard commands such case also has history of being ill this case also cant make any real headway in study and messes up pcs as an auditor and cant seem to do standard auditing this c case at first glance seems to be hopelessly difficult and invites many to squirrel the case is more prevalent than one would think it runs as high as 5070 of voluntary pcs it could run much higher in the wog world one spots the case only by the cases reaction to good new era dianetics auditing not by any opinion or test but this case isnt any real challenge to the cs or scientology auditor underlying all this illness and inability to concentrate or study or audit or hold case gains there is heavily burdened chain that makes things seem very different than they are there is trick to resolving the c case the cs having seen that the person rollercoasters after new era dianetics auditing or cant study or cant audit orders the person to scientology session for gf to fn assess exgf 40rd and handle the scientology auditor in review does this exgf 40rd is the 7 resistive cases then the cs sends the pc back to new era dianetics auditing for routine assess ments and r3ra it is saddening event to cs when the scientology auditor lets him down so an accomplished class viii on that spot is worth his weight in blessings lucky is the cs who has fine class viii when he doesnt have he orders only one action done between cses and watches like hawk reviewing reviews is horrible waste of time even though it has to be done when necessary 83this c type pc will now sail along for awhile in new era dianetics but dont be amazed to have the pc rollercoaster again when the c type pc does you simply order again scientology session and gf to fn and exgf 40 rd and handle and it will all come out differently this time and then the pc is sent back for more new era dianetics this is what is meant by interplaying new era dianetics with scientology reviews for c type case you will just be amazed at the eventual result in the pc really cracked case man very sick pcs are sent directly to medico of course and new era dianetics auditing is given along with medical treatment to get the pc off stuck points this is all covered in hcobs on medical uses of dianetics and includes touch assists the insane pc is given absolute rest secure environment and any needful medical treatment but never shock or surgery of the brain or nerves of course since thats only depersonalization treatment when in better physical health the insane pc is given just routine new era dianetics but the sessions must be flubless and thoroughly within the auditors code as the insane cant stand up to any goofs or overwhelm these insane pcs are most often simple cases of medically ill people gallstones malnutrition deficiencies in certain vitamins broken backsthe usual to undertake to audit an insane pc to sanity without complete attention to the above paragraphs is adventurous in our experience but with these things given atten tion the insane pc often responds amazingly but do not be surprised to find that the insane pc turns into c type as he comes up the scale the main trouble with the insane is that too many people around them are completely devoted to making them even more insane and they almost never respond to any treatment medical or dianetic while kept in their same environment associating with the same people also we could say that hell hath fury to match that of cured psychotics associates usually the real crazy one is an associate not the insane one cs procedure in doing cs on new era dianetics folder i usually inspect the following in the following order 1 the examiners report to see if the pc thought it was okay and if the examiners ta needle and indicator observation is all right 2 the presession cs to see what was previously ordered done 3 the session to see if the cs was done 4 the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sequence and aeye to see if it is standard i seldom read text if the session was okay at examiners unless the session did not go well 5 the fn postulate and gis or vgis erasure of the chain and gis at session end if all that is okay i give it well done 84if it isnt all okay i look for the 1 2 3 etc that was not followed by an abc but by new 1 2 3 4 etc instead i try to find where the session went off standard and point out the standard actions that should have been done if the pc came out of it okay i order more new era dianetics auditing if the pc didnt i send the pc to scientology auditor if it had lots of defs and ground to high ta session end i check to see if the auditor asked for an earlier beginning if the dianetics folder is getting fat and the session was unsuccessful i look for possible c type pc and handle accordingly if the pc is reported ill i order medical an assist and treat the pc thereafter as c type the value of cs whether new era dianetics or scientology depends on his unfailing adherence to standard actions cs that dreams things up to try to solve case by squirrel processes is worse than case supervisor at all the gain of cases depends on the standard unswerving adherence to new era dianetics to csing in complete standardness and scientology auditor who really is flawless standard tech man the result is the result of team to that team one also adds the admin team of the rest of the group doing their jobs given all that one can straighten up whole population areas and activities and get the job done on the goal lines of well and happy human beings and well and happy society both with greatly increased survival potential csing is happy job itself and blessed is cs who has good standard new era dianetics auditors and good scientology auditors on his lines and good new era dianetics course supervisor making new good new era dianetics auditors and good ao somewhere making good new viiis all backed with orgs whose staffs know their org exec course and policy the css job only becomes unhappy and impossible when the auditors are non standard or the admin people never heard of lines or policy and he himself departs from the straight and narrow of new era dianetics and standard tech

commands despite any distraction training coach calls for commands at random by stating the letter or number stress of the command or the situation by saying solid erasing solid but nothing earlier the student addresses the right command or action to the doll handles meter and admin the coach also uses pc responses such as thats all i cant find one etc these are called for in quick succession and in any order coach starts in on gradient gradually getting the drill faster and becoming sharper on flunks for any comm lags uncertainties groping for commands or breaks in tr 04 if the student becomes too confused the coach has probably proceeded with too steep gradient and given the student too many losses in such instances have the student go through the commands in proper sequence few times and then continue with random commands building up the drill on gradient the use of the correct command including those for handling boun cers checking for erasure and checking for postulates as well as correct narrative procedure is required at the appropriate point tr 104 name r3ra coached and bullbaited commands all r3ra commands and procedures position as for auditing on doll tr 102 with

session additives of any kind despite distractions training the drill is the same as for auditing on doll except that the pc stress coach bullbaits the student auditor during the session in an attempt to throw the student off session while the second coach calls the numbers as on tr 103 flunks are given for any improper com mands procedure comm lags breaks in trs or improper session admin the second coach does the start the flunking or thats it if the student is not making the grade he is returned to the earlier tr that is out this drill is coached tough and only passed when the student is totally competent exact and correct in all com 89mands procedures auditing actions and session admin with excellent trs and slightest variation from or additives to new era dianetics coach ensures the student has total certainty on the application of all r3ra commands and sequences including handling bouncers checking for erasure checking for postulates and handling narrative incidents preassessment procedure must also be correctly applied exactly as in session these drills were developed by in july 1969 when it was found that all failed sessions resulted from nonstandard auditing the main goofs being auditors failure to give the next command forgetting the commands in session or giving wrong command new drills were added and existing drills were revised to include drilling for

better or even absent for few days then we have the preclear back again saying it didnt cure my bronchitis enough cases are handled successfully by running one chain on somatic that people get stuck in the win here is another example the pc says he has migraine headaches the auditor assesses head pain quite correctly and then runs out the chain the migraine does not occur for week after then heres the pc again saying ive still got headache all this is invalidative of the tech and the auditing registrar or public division hearing this tends to lose faith in the powers of the tech the fact is that the illness was not properly handled or csed or audited in the first place pc trying to get cured of bronchitis or migraineor any one of dozen other illnessesshould be sent for medical examination how do you know the bronchitis isnt tuberculosis or the migraine headache isnt fractured skull continual side pain may be gallstone in short something which continually hurts or disables may be structural or physical so when you omit the first action medical in handling an illness you set up an auditor for possible failure many of these things can be cured medically without too much heroic action 91if it is medical and can be cured medically without destructive consequences then it should be also it should be audited this lets the medical treatment work many incurable illnesses

dianetics series 4r assessment and how to get the item hcob 26 jun 78ra ii new era dianetics series 6ra routine 3ra engram running by chains this includes running the item by narrative incident and then using preassess ment full procedure to find all the somatics sensations feelings emotions or even attitudes in the area affected getting exact feelings from theseas running items and running their chains to full dianetic ep it takes more than one chain of engrams to build up an ill area having found and run the deflated feeling of bronchitis which was the first best read the cs should order and the auditor find and run the next somatic sensation feeling emotion or attitude in that area it is sometimes necessary to add to the list for that area of the body seeing continual or recurring illness on the original assessment sheet or sub sequent assessments of it the cs and auditor should dig out of that area every somatic sensation feeling emotion attitude etc that can be made to read using the preassessment procedure and run those chains each one to basic and erasure see new era dianetics series that is the way you handle any illness whether continual or temporary the maxim is that it takes more than one chain of engrams to make body ill continual reassessing and adding to general lists will get there eventually pro viding it is done long enough but this general approach will find certain number of pcs saying to registrars public officers and friends ive still got my it is in fact false report they didnt still have all of it it is one chain less and therefore better but auditing gives gains by deletion pc does not suffer from what has been erased he suffers only from that which has not yet been handled with new era dianetics tech you handle all the chains that are making the body ill some persons tried years ago to get their trouble handled somebody or some practice failed and after that they dont mention it at all they dont support the technology anymore either so in handling illness give the handling of the structural disease side of it to the medical doctor and thoroughly handle all the mental side of it with auditing and everyone wins 92any registrar or public division personnel colliding with my lumbosis was not handled should call this hcob to the attention of the person the case supervisor and the auditors only then can you have 100

the pc what the auditor did after any failed session and get it corrected in the auditor speed is the main factor behind the mystery of failed session the better an auditor knows his trs his processes his meter and admin the faster he can operate if you train auditors only up to slow comm laggy handling of session you will get lot of mysteriously failed sessions ending with the ta high and the pc very low somewhat slow auditor auditing new pc may be fast enough to get away with it put him on person whose dianetics is finished and some grades in he begins to have few case failures the remedy is to speed the auditor up with trs 101 102 103 104 in assigning auditors you only dare assign fast ones to fast pcs for 19 years this hidden speed factor has lain behind the vast majority of our failed sessions as it never appeared on the session reports except as excessive admin for which the pc must have had to wait anyone doing d of p work or cs work was in mystery and tended to get desperate and even squirrel change and invent processes the only other source of failure was the physically ill aspect this has just been verified in series of over one hundred cases dianetics combined with scientology reviews progressed splendidly on all but about seven and these who were then physically examined thoroughly were found to have serious and current physical illness speed and accuracy then is the stress of all training and the lack of it is the source of all auditing failures on pcs who are not severely ill even the latter respond once their purely physical illness is properly handled l

person who is out of valence experiences when run on lx1 lists and now the others above lx2 and lx3 and 220h remarkable valence shift if he is run on enough items in one fashion or another he comments on this in session this is the end phenomena of out of valence processes the lx items and 220h it is always attained if enough items are run quite ordinary cases are out of valence if their folder gets too fat you can assume they are out of valence 96perverts suppressives and critical snide ruthless arrogant or contemptuous per sonalities are always out of valence person who is in treason on the 1st dynamic is always out of valence so whether gf 40 h out of valence reads or not if the folder is fat you play safe and assess and run lx items until the person has the valence cognition without being coached person who is out of valence always has the cognition if he is run on enough items and 220h use of lists one begins with lx3 he assesses it method 5 and takes the item that read best handles it then the item that read next best and so on down the list if ep lx2 is taken up and handled in the same manner then lx1 220h is the last step of out of valence handling if the ep has not yet been reached today you can assume safely that anyone out of valence can be put in valence quietly and efficiently with lx items and 220h if he is audited and if the auditing is standard this is quite worthwhile development as it resolves the heavily overcharged case symptom of heavily charged case is fning too quickly to be processed well using these lists on pc is not critical action

new era dianetics there are only nine things that can go wrong in new era dianetics session these are the only reasons chains do not erase and the session does not complete with very good indicators the first eight come under the head of auditing skill or knowledge they are listed in order of frequency 1 auditor comm lag lack of speed in giving commands 2 flubbed commands in which the commands are used incorrectly 3 trs out either being inaudible or overwhelming or tr 4 not handled 4 auditor additives 5 failure to call for an earlier beginning of the incident when the pa can find earlier incidentresults in grinding and high ta 6 failure to call for an earlier incident when there is one 7 demanding pc goes earlier when the last incident was basic making pc jump into another chain 8 misassessment selecting narrative item and running it by regular r3ra instead of by narrative r3ra or choosing multiple item or an after the fact item to run or taking an item that doesnt read or in which the pc has interest 9 pc has out rudiments note that the first four are beyond the view of the case super visor the largest number of session failures come under these first four therefore it is routine for the case supervisor to have the pc asked what the auditor did it is usually surprising it will be one of the first four listed above it requires retrain the next four are also auditor flubs but are detectable if the case supervisor reads the worksheets of the session therefore the case supervisor must know 5 6 7 and 8 above very well indeed and be able to look for them in all of these the ta goes high or very low and the session ends up as bust you can easily see 5 the pc is still on the same chain but begins to grind def def def def def the ta goes way up or down below 2 and the auditor command 100h is there an earlier beginning to this incident is spectacularly absent so the cs tells the next auditor to get the earlier beginning of the same incident and run the incident from its earlier beginning then go earlier as necessary to complete the chain it will eventually go to ep with an fn and the postulate coming off and vgis obtained 6 is very easy for the cs to spot the pc has been given def def def def def etc and has been asked for an earlier beginning to the same incident but hasnt been asked for an earlier incident so the cs tells the next auditor to get an earlier incident 7 is also easy for cs to detect from the worksheet of that session before the pc jumped to another chain by being forced to go earlier below basic the ta was dropping and the incident was erasing but the auditor failed to ask after each run through the incident has it erased the pc may have even given up postulate but the auditor missed the ep and pushed the pc earlier also the pc protested or had trouble when the auditor tried to go earlier than basic and also may mention another somatic in 8 misassessment you can tell just by looking at the item that it is multiple such as burning pain in my hair and feeling of tension on my hand that it is narrative getting my feet wet wheres the feeling in that or after the fact of the engram dizziness after car wreck real classic would be stomach ache when i was thrown from horse the cs hardly has to look at the end of the session to know it will be erasure high or low ta and bad indicators at the examiner as auditors who do these last four things have their metering or basic definitions madly out such as i never did understand what somatic was and as in the first four the approach to the pc trs and additives need ironing out the cs sends the auditor for retrain from the cs point of view and fact the technology applied gets uniform good results thus the cs never gets reasonable the auditor will on retrain settle down 100 sessions will occur regularly when he really can audit pc repair the commonest cs for pc after dianetic session that ends with high ta or below 2 ta andor bad indicators at examiner is l3rf method 5 and handle if the l3rf properly assessed and handled doesnt resolve it to scientology auditor for gf to fn assess auditors auditing dianetics scientology sessions reviews gains or whatever you care to add prepcheck out ruds in number 9 we get several manifestations the pc has good looking session yet complains to the examiner that is to say vgis fn cog at session end but sour grapes ten minutes later at the examiners pc who gets sad at session end and is or has been sad long time and is sad and moping or despondent is of course suffering from an arc brk and is being audited over one and probably has had it for long duration the proper cs action is to scientology auditor for gf to fn check arc brk long duration ld this last is done with itsa earlier itsa and arcu cdeinr by the auditor the pc who is being audited over ptp wont be making any gains they quickly evaporate the cs orders to scientology auditor for gf to fn check problems and being audited over problems 101when pc is bit nasty to the auditor or examiner he is of course being audited over withholds the cs is to scientology auditor for gf to fn then check and pull all withholds and check if the pc has been audited over withholds physically ill pcs when pc is ill or has history of illness you get himher medical attention and apply hcob 24 july 69r seriously ill pcs when pc gets ill after auditing but the sessions look alright you can be pretty sure that the pc is being audited over out ruds so cs orders to scientology auditor for gf to fn assess gf 40 and handle any out ruds found in that assessment first special cases there may be some special versions of out ruds but they are all one variety or another of out rud the pc himself can generate out ruds by lying to his new era dianetics auditor it still shows up as out ruds withholds one pc out of hundred said uniformly that it was getting more solid to escape each incident got himself into jump chain situation continually and became very ill indeed this also operated as withhold in session it was not detectable in the worksheets except that the pc became ill it came out while flying ruds in review session but generally pcs dont act up in sessions if the auditing is straightforward and many get better even when audited over all kinds of out ruds when cs begins to be mystified concerning some pc why betterment isnt occurringwhy the pcs manifestations and remarks never changeor the pc becomes ill then only three things need to be done and all three should be ordered by the cs 1 medical exam and any treatment 2 review to straighten up all out ruds 3 new era dianetics auditing using both narrative r3ra quad and full preassessment procedure on troubled areas original assessment form there is one other flub bit maddening to cs when the cs says assess existing lists or add and the auditor says items it is quite often an auditor flub special kind of 8 abovemisassessment one green auditor took 3 pcs in row and could find item concluding that each of the 3 pcs were done with dianetics it turned out that the auditors tr i was so bad the pcs couldnt hear her another auditor didnt have his meter plugged in and another one was found never to have done any meter drills aside from getting the pc asked what the auditor did which also should be done when its obvious there should have been an item and wasnt the cs should order do new original assessment form when the old list fns or draws blank even when properly assessed 102the pc can also be sent to the examiner to be asked if there is anything not handled the pc may give an area of interest if there is one but it hasnt read the cs should send the pc to scientology auditor for gf to fn and probably gf 40rd expanded and handle then one can get the area asked about in review and suppress and protest put in on it and back to dianetics exterior some pcs go exterior and the auditor may have missed it and continued auditing over it auditing past exterior can drive the ta high or low and the pc may become very upset andor ill cs for an l3rf to be done to determine if the pc has gone exterior if so and the pc has never had an int rd the cs would order an interiorization rundown the int rundown stabilizes the exteriorization and makes it possible to audit the pc further additionally the pc could have had an int rd that was messed up this would be determined by an l3rf and if found the cs would be for an int rd correction list if int had been done and previously corrected the cs would order an end of endless int repair rd hcob 24 sep 78 after first having the pays folders fesed to ensure there were unhandled int errors present the int rd and its correction must be turned over to trained scientology auditor when any int actions the int rd int rd correction or the end of endless int repair rd as needed has been successfully completed put the pc back on dianetics i have personally csed vast number of dianetic sessions and the above is all i had to do or know to keep them all going well if you look for tricky processes in dianetics to solve some case you will make bad error as cs they all come under the above data good luck l ron

on the action of painkillers known as aspirin tranquilizers hypnotics soporifics it has never been known in chemistry or medicine exactly how or why these things worked such compositions are derived by accidental discoveries that such and so depresses pain the effects of existing compounds are not uniform in result and often have very bad side effects as the reason they worked was unknown very little advance has been made in biochemistry if the reason they worked were known and accepted possibly chemists could develop some actual ones which had minimal side effects we will leave the fact that this could be the medical biochemical discovery of the century and let the nobel prizes continue to go to the inventors of nose drops and new ways to kill and simply ourselves use it biochemical tech is not up to the point at this time that it can utilize it pain or discomfort of psychosomatic nature comes from mental image pictures these are created by the thetan or living beings and impinge or press against the body by actual clinical test the actions of aspirin and other pain depressants are to inhibit the ability of the thetan to create mental image pictures and also b to impede the electrical conductivity of nerve channels both of these facts have vital effect on processing if you process someone who has lately been on drugs including aspirin you will not be able to run out the dianetic engram chains properly because they are not being fully created if you process someone immediately after taking aspirin for instance you probably will not be able to find or assess the somatics that need to be run out to handle the condition for the next day after taking the aspirin or drug the mental image pictures may not be fully available 104in the case of chronic drug taking the drugs must be wholly worn off and out of the system and the engrams of drug taking must be run out in their entirety triple or quad flow if this is not done auditing will be trying to handle chains that arent being fully created by the thetan in the case of auditing someone who has taken drugsaspirin etcwithin the last few hours or two or three days the chains of engrams definitely will be found not fully created and therefore not available this would all be fine except for three things 1 auditing under these conditions is very difficult the ta may be high and will not come down one gets erasures at ta 40 with an fn auditing errors become easy to make the bank chains is jammed 2 the thetan is rendered stupid blank forgetful delusive irresponsible thetan gets into wooden sort of state unfeeling insensitive unable and definitely not trustworthy menace to his fellows actually 3 when the drugs wear off or start to wear off the ability to create starts to return and turns on somatics much harder one of the answers person has for this is more drugs to say nothing of heroin there are you know aspirin addicts the compulsion stems from desire to get rid of the somatics and unwanted sensations again there is also something of dramatization of the engrams already gotten from earlier drug taking the being gets more and more wooden requiring more and more quantity and more frequent use sexually it is common for someone on drugs to be very stimulated at first this is the procreate before death impulse as drugs are poison but after the original sexual kicks the stimulation of sexual sensation becomes harder and harder to achieve the effort to achieve it becomes obsessive while it itself is less and less satisfying the cycle of drug restimulation of pictures or creation in general can be at first to increase creation and then eventually to inhibit it totally if one were working on this biochemically the least harmful pain depressant would be one that inhibited the creation of mental image pictures with minimal resulting woodenness or stupidity and which was body soluble so that it passed rapidly out of the nerves and system there are such biochemical preparations at this time these tests and experiments tend to prove that the majority of pain and discomfort does come from mental image pictures and that these are immediately created erasure of mental image picture by standard dianetic processing removes the compulsion to create it drugs chemically inhibit the creation but inhibit as well the erasure when the drug has worn off the picture audited while it was in force can return the emeter tone arm under drugs or on drug case can go very highta 40 ta 50 it can also be dropped to dead thetan false clear read auditing person on drugs can obtain an erasure and fn at ta 40 but the erasure is only apparent and must be rehabbed verified or redone when the person is off drugs any habitual drug taker applying for auditing while still on drugs is handled per new era dianetics series 2r new era dianetics full pc program outline and new era dianetics series 9r drug handling 105a full drug handling program as the very first action would be done on the case this includes objective processes sweat out program if lsd or angel dust have been taken hard trs course narrative r3ra running of each reading drug medicine or alcohol the preassessment of each reading drug medicine or alcohol and the prior assessment followed by additional objective processes trs and objective processing will ease the withdrawal symptoms of the habitual drug user this includes alcohol even though drug handling steps are in progress do not consider the drug has worn off until 6 weeks have passed person who has taken aspirin or other drugs within the past 24 hours or the past week should be given week to dry out before more auditing is given auditing assists can and should be given whenever needed despite the pcs having taken drugs the erasure of any engram chains run would then be verified after the drug has worn off this can be up to 6 weeks for certain drugs and medications such as anesthetics alcohol may be consumed within 24 hours before an auditing session and where alcohol consumption has been excessive the drying out period would be extended to several days or week it is not fatal to audit over drugs it is just difficult the results may not be lasting and need to be verified afterwards chronic drug takers who have not had drugs specifically handled may go back to drugs after auditing as they were too drugged during auditing to get rid of what was bothering them and which drove them to drugs with the enemies of various countries using widespread drug addiction as defeatist mechanism with painkillers so easily available and so ineffective drugs is serious auditing problem it can be handled but when aspirin that innocent seeming painkiller can produce havoc in auditing if not detected the subject needs care and knowledge the above data will keep the auditor clear of the pitfalls of this hazard to paraphrase an old quote we used to have iron men and wooden ships we now have drug society and wooden citizens ive been studying this for over year and half and have made the breakthrough drug companies would be advised to do better research and auditors are advised to ask any pc have you been taking any drugs or aspirin the medical aspect is an understandable wish to handle pain doctors should press for better drugs to do this that do not have such lamentable side effects the formula of

auditing and results the whole secret of producing high case gain and total results with new era dianetics and scientology auditing lies in the following new era dianetics results when an auditor can produce exact auditing on new era dianetics you know he can audit new era dianetics is very simple precise procedure the major errors are misassessment inability to use meter usually but out trs can do it b taking narrative items and running them as somatic chains c forcing pc toward earlier incident when it required earlier beginning making the pc jump chains d fumbling commands out trs an auditors poor trs and corny errors such as above will prevent new era dianetics results but the new era dianetics auditing is so simple that it demonstrates cleanly whether the person can audit or not this is not true of scientology auditing particularly vi vii and viii here the procedure is more complex the errors of the auditor are obscured in the possibility of wrong cs or complex pc thus whether the auditor can audit or not just as an auditor is obscured thus with the auditor as variable factor the tech can look variable therefore you can lay down this rule as truth and it will be truth until the end of time if iv v vi vii or viii cannot produce invariably excellent results his basic auditing is deficient but obscured by the complexity of material therefore it is vital that an auditor be proven resultgetting new era dianetics auditor before any result can be expected of him in hisher scientology auditing 108we have now had several dark mysteries cleared up on this subject with many examples for instance in 1969 when standard dianetics was introduced one auditor who had been thought competent vi and had been auditing for years was found to be getting too many failed pcs he was trained up as standard dianetic auditor and on his first sessions it was found that he could not produce standard dianetic results he was vigorously groomed on his trs which were wildly out and always had been and made to do the very exact businesslike procedure of standard dianetics he then got excellent standard dianetic results session after session on his pc and could be designated as very good dianetic auditor he was briefly retreaded on his scientology materials and at once could get terrific results with upper level scientology from this we can state without any fear of contradiction by your future experience that an viii who is not proven dianetic auditor as well is not dependable as an auditor matter who trained him the practice of loosely certifying hnedas without total proof that they get excellent uniform session results on dianetic pcs can foul up the whole field and jeopardize the entire auditing future of the student to certify new era dianetics auditor who doesnt get provenly excellent dianetic results is an act of treason against all that persons future pcs and all the rest of us if tech is out in an area it will be because some of the auditors whatever their class are not capable of delivering simple dianetic sessions regardless of the level at which they are auditing and out tech will be compounded if the case supervisor is not also an excellent new era dianetics auditor for he wont know the errors for which to look when you can really dig this and know it and get it in practice the bulk of out tech and failed pcs in an area will vanish i know it is sometimes hard to achieve simplicity as simple as new era dianetics but when it is done tech worries from there on up are over l ron hubbard founder lrhrseirdlfg copyright 1969

base order 9 which removed hdc as prerequisite of r6ew solo the problems of person on solo not knowing how to audit gives us great deal of trouble in aos as well as shs the r6ew checksheet has been several times revised and at one time incorrectly has included all kinds of implants to study also the materials to be audited have in the past erroneously been issued as part of the r6ew study pack in all such solo courses the person is not issued what he will eventually audit on until he has completed the study pack he then attests or is examined and having passed he is given review session to mainly fly his ruds he is then issued the auditing materials and gets on with his solo where this sequence is violated trouble occurs we have also had people glance at the materials to be audited pick out something that strikes their interest and then go and attest leaving an out grade the troubles on solo courses are 1 has real training as an auditor 2 is given unnecessary or unhelpful materials to study 3 is issued the auditing materials he will solo audit before he attests to the study materials 4 wasnt ready for the grade and will use it to cure an arc break or ingrown eyelids these not having been handled in earlier auditing 5 doesnt actually audit the solo materials but attests leaving an out grade the above are by experience general rundown of the problems having to do with all solo grades they begin with r6ew when this is out they have trouble from there on the essence of this course is that one is trying to make solo auditor not person who can audit others in 1969 i ordered the hdc materials to go on the r6ew checksheet someone reinterpreted this as the dianetics course is requisite for r6ew solo which is wild people enrolling on this course are going the solo route there are 2 routes called the solo and the professional 112solo auditors must have meter lessons and other theory so they know about mental image pictures they must also do actual solo sessions well before going near the materials of the grade thus the solo course r6ew breaks down into these requisites 1 the person as case to have had all grades up to the level including dianetics triples any other scn auditing like class vi auditors use scientology triples accel eration and power if the student hasnt got all these hell never make it as case on solo thus 1 is get grades done below r6ew 2 the solo student must be trained on the meter about the time track mental image pictures and any other theory needful without trying to teach him full academy course or b denying him vital data needed in solo he must for instance be able to fly his ruds so 2 is get theory in and adequately learned 3 the student must be able to do solo auditing drills which would begin with drills such as the emeter book drills done solo these include keeping the admin properly so 3 is practical solo drills 4 the student needs to do actual auditing solo which help him and his case these would include running light lock cleaning up an arc break handling ptp doing clean up on overts rather than whs such sessions would have to go to super visor each one for csing when he can actually handle himself solo he is then and only then finished with his training if he still cant solo audit require full hdc course be taken so 4 is prove he can solo audit 5 the student is now issued his auditing materials for the grade these must not be included in the study pack as he will selfaudit on them and not get trained so 5 is only issue the grade material when all study is complete 6 when the auditing is done or session by session as cs is available and the student is seen to have actually done it by folder he is permitted to attest so 6 is dont permit attestation without confirmation of actual auditing the checksheets and actions of r6ew and any other solo course or grade must be in keeping with these stipulations or there will be adequate result from solo grades l ron hubbard founder lrhrs

9 april 1977 remimeo cs series 13ra viii actions gf 40 iv rundown viii case supervision inevitably when any new approach or process is released some will instantly assume that all older actually more basic data has been cancelled there is statement to that effect it is not guessed that this will be assumed and so we could lose an entire subject we did in fact lose dianetics for decade and all but lost scientology in the following ten years subject can be reorganized and made more workable that was done in 1969 for dianetics but it had never been unworkable the 1969 dianetics reorganization refined the 196263 discoveries of r3r better communication was made to the user and the preclear amazingly the reissue of dianetics as standard dianetics caused about dozen people even in high places unfortunately to at once assume that dianetics wiped out any need for power scientology clearing or anything else even an unauthorized policy letter not signed by and an hcob also not signed by gave this impression they were of course cancelled the instant they were discovered to have been sent out this idea that the old is always cancelled by anything new has its root in the idea that later order cancels earlier orders which is true but orders are one thing and tech basics another what if in the science of physics book by professor glumph came out omitting the three laws of motion and gravity it is assumed then that newtons laws are longer valid because they are old newton lived between 1642 and 1727 so some young student engineer is baffled because bridges have weight and cant work out gravity or motion and he and his fellows begin to build without knowing these laws and there goes the whole of engineering and the culture itself this is fantasy as college student in upper math i was utterly baffled by calculus i couldnt find out what it was for then i discovered it had been developed by sir isaac newton examined the basics and got the idea my college text omitted all the basic explanations and even the authorship of the subject calculus today is really not enough used because it isnt understood anyway heres the main surprise until 1970 the whole of scientology was never in use in processing students had ridden along with the research line up into the ot sections discarding the ladder behind them for nearly 3 years an increasing proportion of preclears were not actually making it the gradient to get them onto the bridge had been neglected as old when in fact they were not old but basic the amazement of auditors and their delight when the hcob on auditors rights cs series 1 was released indicated that they had become process oriented with all the why gone 118viii auditing the 1968 viii standardization aimed actually at good trs auditing presence and basics in auditor performance viii auditing was developed to handle the or band it is entirely valid its only omission was detailed actions now developed as to how to handle pc or preot who had been pulled up the line and had fallen on his head out grades was spotted and discussed in detail in viii auditing giving lower grades fast was the only error it was not realized in 1968 that end phenomena of lower grades was not being required the rerelease of the entire band of academy and saint hill materials in 1970 is reemphasis on the validity and necessity of using it all on pcs and in understanding the mind and life and all this is quite welcome and very successful not noticed is that this whole band was never before presented for full use on all pcs as i say 19501969 auditors had been riding with the newest and latest because it was popular only few wise oldtimers continued to use the most basic actions but just as viii auditing was an unauthorized signal to suppress all that had been known before so now with the full release for use of expanded lower grades few began to say that viii auditing was now old one assumes then that some like to be able to say that something is now old has superior sort of ring to it i guess anyway wed better disregard this tendency to retire basics it is more amusing than otherwise so lets get on with the job resistive cases the resistive case rundown is an viii development to handle those who cannot make the grades it was put into the green form as gf 40 so as to preserve it to it could now be added overwhelmed this would indicate need of repair progress and return advance programs but many other indicators exist already so when do you use gf 40 let us say the pc has been run on grade zero and at the examiner cannot or does not attest one would first look for simple auditing errors in recent sessions these would get reviewed and corrected one would then look for lower actions than grade zero that had been missed if it still seemed hard to figure out one would use gf 40 resistive cases in essence if one adds overwhelm to the gf 40 list you have on it all the reasons pc wont advance if he has been run on all processes up to that point overwhelm would indicate need of repair and return grade i problems is the usual ordinary reason for case advance problems shows up as an out rud in gf 40 and is simply put in as rud not as grade 119but if grade ii or above has problem that means grade i is out gf 40 remains even more plainly as when all else fails it is used that way when pc doesnt attest and all has been done for him otherwise you use gf 40 this was its proper use in the first place all such materials except rapid or quickie grades are valid and joke these remarks on gf 40 resistive cases does not wipe out repair and return programs iv rundown the socalled iv rundown as taught on the viii course is of course quite valid originally developed to catch cases that had somehow gotten up to ot iii and were falling on their heads it is collection of actions it salvaged many cases the missing datum was that in recent times these cases were falsely reported to have had their lower grades they the cases themselves said they had had lower grades this made mystery the fact is with multiple declare declaring 0 to iv to the examiner all at one time mostly without any mention of end phenomena of the grade these cases were out grade in the extreme the iv rundown was an effort to catch it all up to make real ot out grades didnt read as it didnt mean anything to the pc and besides theyd all been rehabbed dozen times anyway but nobody mentioned never having attained any end phenomena and the class chart was never really gotten in in in in the first place you will find many pcs have had various parts of the iv rundown run earlier for awhile it was the fashion to use the iv rundown or part of it on any balky case at any level at ot iv which was an audited step and none of it really confidential the cs simply ordered run whatever was left of it not already run somewhere on the case all of the iv rundown still should be run but of course that would now be on return advance program and well up the line if repairreturn doesnt get grade made this is the time to do iv rundown on 3 valence shifter lx1 lx2 lx3 lists can be done in triple recall secondary engram earlier practices former therapy can also be triple recall secondary engram this is on page 28 not 23 of the original viii case supervisor manual and part of it is also now gf 40 if case really needs this he wont be making lower grade really so the gf 40 or its slightly wider ot iv rundown can be used to both overwhelmed by auditing should be added in any future issue to indi cate needed repair action 120case supervisor actions hcob 10 dec 1968 case supervisor actions confidential viiis only is still valid it remains confidential as it mentions some ot phenomena that would spin grade va however some viii cs is going to be told that expanded lower grades changes all that it doesnt listen in the next to last paragraph of the cover page of this manual hcob 10 dec 68 it says standard grades are not part of this setup as it is understood that the auditor knows these directions to do standard grades are written on blank sheet i have added the block letters for emphasis here at the time this was written i had not discovered that lower grades were gone out of use and i let be published triple grades which seemed to condense all lower grades the major process or major grade process may not be enough to make pc make lower grade i am sorry i gave any support at all to such an idea by not examining the whole scene when it began to show up i did find it and did correct it however when auditing statistics over the world showed the fault 28 hours was the total weekly delivery of orgs if you add the dozens and dozens of lower grade processes as given in expanded lower grades to the viii cs hcob of 10 dec 68 and included this cs series and its new development of repair progress and return advance programs you would have the whole package of csing so the viii actions are all valid auditor classes below viii have this cs series the ao cs course adds in the viii actions as well any cs who does not know well the original thesis dianetics the evolution of science dianetics the modern science of mental health scientology 880 and scientology 88008 will go badly astray it is vital to know these books and others in this area to know what one is trying to handle class vi shsbc tapes and bulletins are all valid and vital to lower grade auditing and csing i trust this gives the cs some idea of what is still in it all is l ron hubbard founder revised by cs45 approved by l ron hubbard founder

does not resolve on dianetics there are two reasons for this 1 not enough auditing on enough chains sooner or later the exact small piece of an engram already run shows up on another chain later example pain in an area of an operation occurs now and then again weeks months or years after the operation has been run out as an engram sooner or later just on general auditing the missing bit of the operation shows up blows voila pain gone forever this is peculiar especially to abdominal operations like an appendectomy the operation was run out the scar stays puffy the pc is occasionally ill from it pcs clusion is that dianetics hasnt worked on it more auditing on other somatics just general dianetics is given one day the remaining bit of the operation hidden from view apparently erased shows up blows pc now fine reason for this is overburden in that the incident was too charged in one place to be confronted as the whole case is unburdened confront comes up the piece that was missing and giving the pain blows there is way of forcing it in fact it would be fatal to try the other reason for it is that the missing bit causing the pain is different somatic like chest compression this bit of the operation had another basic than the one run the answer to persistent or recurring somatic in an injured area is always more dianetic auditing persistent chronic and recurring somatics are

the left leg somatic in vain if you do start auditing somatics in the op posite side of the body toothache the mystery of toothache is resolved in both 1 and 2 above especially 2 the pain is concentrated on the left upper molar you audit it in vain toothache persists look at the pcs mouth has the right upper molar ever been pulled or injured yes thats how the left molar began to decay the right upper molar was pulled the pain especially under the painkiller on the right side only backed up and stopped on the opposite side eventually the left upper molar under that stress year or ten later caves in and aches mysterious as it wasnt injured mysterious as the opposite molar is long gone doesnt hurt anymore when toothache does not resolve in auditing audit the opposite tooth on the other side you can actually do it by count of teeth its sort of auditing somatic pc in misery with right upper molar pain on left side audit an injury he had on the left side it will read on the meter also voila the toothache that wouldnt go away eases up the fellow who has the exact opposite teeth pulled upper right wisdom upper left wisdom is in for it as there is constant crossplay makes the mouth odd and pressury both sides are reacting to the other side dentists often note the strange pressure bursting feelings patient has when tooth needs pulling this is the stress in the nerves from an injury which occurred on the opposite side an auditor can audit right side tooth in vain unless he knows enough to audit the other side for pc with toothache on the right side you can list for feelings on the left side of the mouth and get numbness feeling etc audit that list and suddenly magically the toothache on the opposite side not being audited eases up full preassessment of the troubled area and r3ra quad is used when the tooth trouble persists as toothaches sometimes give dianetic auditor failure he should know about the sympathetic factor as above the failure becomes

afflicted with unflat engram chains all high tas depend on unflat or restimulated engram chains tas go high on overrun because the overrun restimulates engram chains not yet run engram or secondary or lock chains can be keyedout this does not mean they stay out in few minutes or hours or days or years they can key back in pc will also destimulate in from 3 to 10 days usually this means he settles out thus pc can be overrun into new engram chains by life or an auditor ta goes up 3 to 10 days later the ta comes down when pc is audited to fn vgis and then few minutes later has high ta the usual reasons are 1 has had his comm chopped or full dianetic or scientology end phenomena not reached or 2 has been run on an unreading item or subject or 3 is overwhelmed or 4 has lot of engrams keying in or 5 has been run in the past without full erasure of engrams or attaining end phenomena 6 lists badly done or other misauditing cause pc to feel bad and keyin chains also 7 pc can be audited when too tired or too late at night the solution to any of these is easyon 1 always see that the pc attains full ep particularly on engram chains on 2 make auditors check for read even in twoway comm subjects list questions or dianetic items before running them on 3 see also 2 and get the pc proper progress repair program on 4 repair or isolate pc so his pt isnt so ferocious looking meaning repair progress pgm him well or let him change his environment and then audit him or 5 look into his folder to see who 124audited him on so many chains when with real erasure or ep 6 you use repair lists like l4bra l1c etc and other usual action on 7 you make the pc get some rest and if he cant make him go for walk away until he is tired and then walk back and get some sleep all these really add up to keyedin or unflat engram chains whether the pc can handle them depends on repair and the usual of all these the past auditing without attaining ep on engram chains whether done in dianetics or scientology is usual reason for much audited pc to have high ta the answers to any high ta that wont come down and to any pc who continually arrives at examiner after an fn vgi session end with his ta up are faulty auditing not letting pc go to full dn ep when running engrams b false auditing report pr type report meaning promoting instead of auditing c too many engram chains in past restim by life or auditing d false ta or inoperable meter it is usual to do picture and masses remedy to find and handle restimulated engram chains which are causing the ta to be high this is done after the pc has had drug

flubs in the repair step errors such as running unreading items or firefights caused by out trs or false auditing reports or dn ep not reached at session end or pc needing ruds put in at session starts would prevent this pattern from happening at the examiners so if the pattern doesnt happen you know the auditing is goofy or something is out which had better be found one pc for instance had huge wh of having disease and was audited over it for 2 years auditing over wh and ptp case gain silly pc but also very dull cs not to alert to some outness there and find it another pc had high ta and the fault was just that she never got any auditing at all so they kept operating on her somebody didnt know dianetics and auditing was for use high ta and illness pcs with high tas feel ill and get ill use to elaborate on that its just fact and is the fact about pcs who get ill so maybe you see why this hcob is important low ta at exam pcs with low tas are more or less in apathy if it fn vgis at session end and is low at exam like 19 or if it went low in session and didnt fn then the pc is overwhelmed and needs auditing and life repair b can have been run on flat or unreading item

march 1971ra remimeo revised 25 july 1978 rerevised 21 september 1978 revisions in this type style ellipses indicate deletions dianetic erasure there are several corny stunts that can occur in dianetics any of which will add up to erasure 1 trying to run an item that didnt read on being given or when being called as the chain is not charged it will be hard if not impossible to run instant fn and bd items are of course the very best and almost always erase very easily 2 starting new session with new item with the ta way way up to play it safe in dianetic auditing it can be handled in scientology the dianetic auditor who starts session and new action at the same time with the ta high is very foolish it may not be high on what the auditor is now newly trying to run the correct action is not to start the session just end off with auditing done the pc is ill or is having trouble in life if you were running chain in the last session and continue it in the next disregard the high ta way to get around this is get some new items from the high ta pc and take one that blows down well and you can probably bring it off safest is dont audit high ta pc unless to repair an unflat chain or to run interiorization rd this rule is variable but you should know it is risky to audit new item taken from an earlier list when the pc comes into session with high ta as it may not be high on what you are about to run and so you may get fn and erasure the only remedy is to get new items and choose bd one or to turn the pc over to scientology auditor to assess hilo ta list and handle 3 narratives are too often just run through once or twice and abandoned this leaves the incident still charged and affecting the pc narrative item describes only one possible incident ie dropping an ironing board on my foot chain narrative needs to be run and run and run on that one incident you run the incident narrative to erasure and only go earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly you run the incident to ep 4 running pc who has exteriorized in auditing on something other than an in teriorization rd will produce high ta and fn and erasure in the session after int rd has been run anything can be run 5 probably the worst blunder is failing to ask for def again when the pc says its erased but the ta is still high this is really corny error ta 49 pc says its erased all blank now and the auditor fails to ask def once more there is moment when the pcs notis of the picture squeezes it into invisibility the mass of it is still there it takes just one or two more passes through to get the bd fn postulate and vgis which is the erasure its up to the auditor not to let the pc go without that additional def which will then bring the bd fn postulate off and vgis this error is more common than one would think 1306 of course not asking for an earlier incident mentioning the same item will also cause grind and erasure when the item isnt also mentioned in the command the pc can jump chains and if the earlier beginning is not asked for at all on basic when there is one or on narratives of course there will be erasure 7 auditing pc under protest will cause the ta to stay up and fn and erasure 8 ending off chain or engram at the first sight of an fn and then wondering why postulate came off the skilled dianetic auditor knows these things cold and does not make these errors thus he gets his end of session erasure and fn regularly and gets fn at the examiner as well when the case has had few sessions l ron hubbard founder lrh mesrdrb kjm copyright 1971 1978 by l

1976 cses cs series 33ra1 triple and quad reruns law when one or more of the four flows of an item or grade are left unrun when used in later processes the earlier unrun ones restimulate and make mass this tells you that high tas heavy pressures and even illness can come from bypassed flows bypassed flows example dianetic singles have been run on 7 items now the auditor begins to run new items triple without running triple on the already run items the result will be 7 unrun flow 2s and 7 unrun flow 3s these will restimulate and form mass and bypassed charge example now let us say all 7 previous items have been run triple and the auditor now runs new item quadruple this leaves 7 unrun zero chains these can restimulate and form mass and bypassed charge example now let us say that dianetics was all run single and grades were run triple this will restimulate the dn chains f2 and f3 example let us say that dianetics and scientology grades were all run triple an interiorization rundown is now run quad this will throw all dianetic and scientology unrun flow zeros into restimulation and give bypassed charge any later grade run with more flows than used in earlier actions can throw the earlier unflat flows into restim pile up mass giving high ta and bpc giving arc breaks repair the more the condition is repaired by l1c l4br etc etc the worse the mass gets source of high ta thus high tas have three principal sources 1 overruns 2 auditing past exterior 3 earlier unrun flows restimulated by those flows used in later actions there are other minor ones such as drug background illness etc as per hilo ta assessment rehabs one must not recklessly or continuously rehab past major action this causes overrun the thetan is placed at the end of the incidents not yet in restimulation or run and the bank gets more solid massy thetans the whole trick of this universe is contained in thetans copying or picturing incidents and then getting stuck in the later portion of them incidents is the keynote thetan is incident hungry 132this is what traps him for some reason he has to be at the earliest end of incidents to erase them the later he is in incidents and the later he is on the track the more solid he is this also applies to the auditing time track by omitting things like flows on the auditing time track the thetan thus becomes massy the whole theory of the interiorization remedy is based on having gone out later after he went in earlier so exteriorizing can stick him people buy the int rd to exteriorize but the remedy is only done to permit further auditing they ext of course when the bank is handled when flows of items are bypassed and then later restimulated by auditing them mass occurs getting in all flows when doing additional flows on earlier items or processes one must also check or rehab those flows marked as run to fn in worksheets this again will leave unflat flows and bpc unless it is lone and if it is overdone it will raise the ta by overrun so if one had case that had single dianetics and was later run on triple for new items but the singles not done into triple one would have to run first the missing unrun flow or flows if they read and then check the first single f1 for flatness then check other previously run flows the rule is run the previously unrun one or ones first if they read to get charge off then verify or run the ones listed as run already then one would do the same for the next item run the previously unrun flow or flows if they read and then verify or run those listed as already run to be sure they fn all items in chronological sequence and all processes would have to be run quad it would be waste of time now to run in only triples whether you have the quad commands or not they are easy to figure out as you are only missing the zero flow self to self so all cses and auditing actions are rehab or run f1 f2 f3 f0 if they read when getting in all flows on things run to date high ta when you are sure an int rd has been done correctly and its 2wc went fn and the ta later goes high you check the int rd that is the most usual reason this simple action is amazingly subject to flubs if the ta goes high later you can do cs series 53 or hilo ta assessment and handle if the ta is still high or low you had better check the state of flows were more flows run on later actions than were run on earlier actions if so your pc has felt massy sometimes even ill the right action is to get in all flows from the beginning and do it quad bring all his auditing up to quad if his folder is not available he has kind of had it i know of way at this writing to recover lost dn items but will have to work something out not in trouble if the pc is not in trouble his best bet is to get on up the grades to expanded ot iii 133in trouble if he is massy and is having trouble the best bet is to 1 be totally sure of his int rd 2 check ors particularly of major grade twice or bypassed fns locate and indicate them 3 fes list the items and grades and do full flow action from the beginning of his auditing raising them all to quadruple running zero flows the zero flow in dianetics is bit strange it can be done by full r3r but it often depends on the decision the pc made and may fn very suddenly it is easily overrun and can be very fast pc can be gotten into trouble on zero flows if the auditor is slow and is not alert to his meter and misses the fn and gives r3r commands after the flow has blown rehab or run the auditor getting in zero flows can also arc brk the pc by failing to verify if the previously run flows are flat all the auditor wants is to see them fn on the command if they dont he runs them sometimes when he has run them again he finds they are being overrun or run twice and has to rehab them by finding this out the pc sometimes doesnt know until he actually starts to run them then he finds they are already run the clue to this is climbing ta if the ta goes up get off that flow and rehab it example pc at first thinks pain in shoulder f2 was never run starts to run it ta goes up auditor must pull him off of it by finding out if it is being run twice and rehab it to fn the moral in all these reruns is dont firefight keep an l1c list and an l3rd list handy and use them results the results of straightening up the intext rd rehabbing ors and putting in all flows on pc are fantastic getting an all flows rundown done correctly gives one all the latent gain the pc has been begging for so send to cramming all cses and auditors who flub program it right cs it right

session an auditor can miss by calling fns with high or low ta and one never feeds meter data to the pc that read that didnt read that blew down just must not exist in session patter thank you that fned is as far as an auditor goes and thats the end of the cycle and says so erasure can be overlooked by an auditor in dianetics this fault is fatal auditors code must be in on all points and particularly invalidation pc says thats so and so an auditor who says im sorry you are wrong or any other invalidation is going to wreck pcs case full knowledge of the auditors code and actually applying it saves endless troubles it is an auditing tool not just nice idea rehabbing chains one rehabs dianetic chain that according to previous worksheet erased by saying according to session records flow direction item erased thats all one does not say did the chain giving others headache erase one does not run it again to find out one does not run single command to see if it fns again one can say do you agree that the chain giving another headache erased but the more you ask the pc to look for an erased chain the more messed up things will get it isnt there but the auditor by his action can imply it should be there or might be there totally wrong 141approach would be look around your bank and see if what isnt there any more isnt there dianetics is not scientology dianetic chain is not release if you try to use scientology rehab tech on dianetic chain you have had it it isnt release which is keyout dianetic chain is an erasure you cant rehab erasures with how many times etc the test of this is the doing if you try to use scn rehab on dianetic chains the pc might try to find something this causes him to keyin other unrun or similar items it is dangerous action at best to try to handle old erased chains the best you can do is to tell the pc what the old ws said if ws exists leave the already erased flows alone flubbed chains many times folder error summary will give flubbed chain and then fail to note it was repaired in the next session cs and auditor would have been pretty irresponsible to just go on auditing past flubbed chains the only safe way to handle some previous flubbed chain is to verify in the folder if it was repaired b if still unrepaired assess the l3re on it and handle according to the l3re l3re using the new l3re hcob 11 apr 71 rb is dianetic

you cant say tell about the earlier beginning the pc will go up the wall therell be erasure you have to use r3m and get him to the earlier beginning and then run it and if it still doesnt erase get

after new ffd action it begins to ride at 25 and fns something is being overrun find it and indicate it and cease to stir the bank up so much the fault is going over items already run in doing full flow table you often find that the same or similar have been run in the past sometimes you find that previous attempt to run the item second or third time has resulted in an arc break the reason for which was never detected the right action is to note the session date it was first run and just tell the pc feeling surprised was run three times on first date it was erased it was erased when later run it was an overrun this tends to blow the later charge laid in by trying to run the same item again it sounds so strange that erased chains can be overrun but it is true what happens is that pcs try to cooperate and put something there firefights the action of quarrel between an auditor and pc is called firefight restimulating earlier unrun engrams or overrunning chains upsets pc the best action as soon as pc is disturbed is to do an l3re fast and handle what reads the way it should be handled according to the l3re the wrong way is to argue or try to go on the pc does not know what it is he just feels awful he tries to guess he will arc brk or get sad if the auditor continues the correct action is an l3re l1c is not of great use in dianetic arc brk l3re is if the pc remains arc

responsibility any trouble cs is running into comes from the factors of trs metering code and incomplete or false auditors reports if when i am csing i ever find an auditor has omitted key session actions or has falsified report i order that auditor not to cramming but full retrain of the hubbard new era dianetics course right on up cs does not see these points he can get the pc asked what the auditor is doing or did he can get sessions monitored this helps him fill this gap in his data its what isnt in the auditors report that is often the trouble auditors omit what they said omit the firefight omit session alteris in their worksheets all this sticks the css neck out for the axe of failure so particularly in ffd intext and other such actions cs has to act to obtain confidence in the auditors trs metering code use and accurate worksheets risk in ffd intext rd and power experience has proven that if the auditor is not top grade if the cs is not alert we put pc at risk the usual is what keeps the pc safe thorough study of his case looking for obvious bugs such as intext rd done twice the case druggie but drug engrams never run int done but its 2wc flubbed to name few serious ones sending auditors to cramming for the slightest flub insisting on standard trs used in session good metering use of the code accurate and complete worksheets use of standard tech all guarantee the safety and progress of the pc introducing ffd ffd like the intext rd requires flawless csing and auditing or the case goes wrong when these actions were introduced they showed up any flaws in case studying trs metering code and worksheets there are two ways to handle cancel ffd and intext as actions obviously that is going backwards and is impossible b begin and continue serious effective campaign in the org to 1 train auditors better 2 cram expertly on every flub 3 raise quality of trs and metering as you can see my approach is to improve quality of training cramming and delivery

his own bank he is not likely to asis or cognite recently on flag we have taken failed ot iiis and put them back through full heavy retrain on r6ew and then pushed them back up the line with good success when solo auditor is also rabbit runs from everything including his bank he has chance to overcome it if he is all thumbs with his tools requiring arduous perfect drills on solo metering and auditing actions at r6ew level should occur before the pc sees any materials he must first and foremost be solo auditor familiar with his meters and papers to such degree that they do not in any way distract him only then can you add bank to the scene poor solo auditor does not cognite as his attention is on the tools not his bank where the solo auditor fails he has not learned his tools the remedy is to make him learn them the bridge between ot ii and iii is sometimes hard one it may be that an hdc course is vital before the preot can make this bridge the solo auditor who attests rather than confront his bank probably never learned to use his auditing tools in the first place then adding the bank as something to confront results in confusion cognitions in solo auditing depend upon

their metering checked for meter position on auditing table can they see meter pc and write without shifting eyes and can they see pcs hands on the cans and was the meter turned on and charged and can an auditor work the tone arm smoothly with his thumb c does the auditor discount reads gotten on clearing commands they are the reads d can the auditor read out list and see the meter reads as coordinated action cramming send auditors to cramming on all flubs insist they go to cramming insist cramming calls them in and crams them and insist on carbon copy of the fact that cramming has been done all the hard work of csing comes in when auditors are flubby it takes weeks to make an auditor after he has had course and its only done by cramcramcram rfactors 146never order an rfactor that takes pc into future or past as he then wont be in session example cses rfactor we are setting you up for dianetics promptly the pc is up ahead not in this session mixing starts there are many ways to start session dont mix them its 2wc what do you have your attention on fly rud if fn fly all ruds 2wc the ta down fly rud or gf 40 method 5 and handle its not mixture of frantic efforts to get ta down if the auditor cant on what the cs says the auditor ends off interiorization is undone or out there may be list errors there may be overruns but for sure its case for folder study not for an auditor csing in the chair high ta arc brks train your auditors never try to get ta down from above 30 on arc breaks low ta quits some auditors see ta sink below 20 and then wont continue the 2wc or process to get the ta back up the ta sank so i quit is common auditor note compare this the ta rose above 30 so i quit see doesnt make sense if ta sinks below 20and the auditors trs are goodthe same action will usually bring it up to 20 and fn come down hard on auditors who do this get their trs checked make them continue exam fns after flubs pcs whose tas are high in session or low in session get fn at the exams put the finger on the auditor they are protesting or being overwhelmed always cs examiner ask pc what auditor did in session then you know its the auditor or the case the pc will say the auditor was okay so its case but usually when cases are puzzles theres weird things going on with trs 147also the auditor may be noisy or laugh hard or is boisterous and being inter esting cs via the cs is handling cases on the via of an auditor if the auditor is perfect the cs can handle the work out of the case if the auditor is not perfect in trs metering code reports and doing the cs then the cs is solving factor unknown to him not the pcs case so be perfect cs demand perfect auditing cases fly higher levels cs who assesses pc to higher levels to solve lower ones is really asking for wreck its always the earlier actions that are out trying to cheat case up to grade ii when he wont run on grade i is like trying to run the whole grade chart to cure cold pc can always be solved in or below where he is oh well put him up grade and cure his high ta is like he cant pass kindergarten so well enroll him in college cs expertise cs has to know his auditing materials hcobs and texts much better than an auditor if cs is not being successful get retread on vi and viii materials cs also must be confident he could crack the case as an auditor when cs is shaky on his materials then the world of auditing looks very unstable the tech is very exact very effective if any errors existed in it theyve been corrected so the variables are the knowledge of the cs his discipline and demands of auditors and the actions of the auditor if these are stable then the cases that come along are easy as can be the successful cs knows his materials if he wants to be even more successful he keeps his study up

dianetics series tech regarding valence handling on oca graphs the plotted test score of pc you find sometimes case that read high on the graph will drop and read lower after auditing this is caused by the fact that the person was out of valence in the first place social machinery was what the first registered now after auditing the graph expresses something closer to the actual being even though it dropped we have known about this since 57 or 58 but i do not think it was fully written up further we now know more about it if you look into suppressive person tech you will find an sp has to be out of valence to be sp he does not know that he is because he is himself in nonself valence he is somebody else and is denying that he himself exists which is to say denying himself as self now this doesnt mean all persons whose graphs dropped were active sps but it does mean they werent being themselves after some auditing they became themselves somewhat and this self isnt the social cheery self the first graph said but the dropped graph is nearer truth now how to get the graph up again the person with the dropped graph is closer to being himself but is not yet fully restored not yet fully into his own valence while class xi would handle this bit differently class viii rundown already has an answer the class viii out of valence lists lx1 lx2 and lx3 and the recall secondary and engram

uses start and thats it as in earlier trs the coach is not bound after starting to answer the students question but may comm lag or give commenting type answer to throw the student off often the coach should answer somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student into q and or upset the student example student do fish swim coach yes student good student do fish swim coach arent you hungry student yes coach flunk when the question is not answered the student must say gently ill repeat the auditing question and do so until he gets an answer anything except commands acknowledgement and as needed the repeat statement is flunked unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked poor command is flunked poor acknowledgement is flunked q and is flunked as in example student misemotion or confusion is flunked student failure to utter the next command without long comm lag is flunked choppy or premature acknowledgement is flunked lack of an acknowledgement or with distinct comm lag is flunked any words from the coach except an answer to the question start flunk good or thats it should have influence on the student except to get him to give repeat statement and the command again by repeat statement is meant ill repeat the auditing command start flunk good and thats it may not be used to fluster or trap the student any other statement under the sun may be the coach may try to leave his chair in this tr if he succeeds it is flunk the coach should not use introverted statements such as i just had cognition coach divertive statements should all concern the student and should be designed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing the students job is to keep session going in spite of anything using only command the repeat statement or the acknowledgement the student may use his or her hands to prevent blow leaving of the coach if the student does anything else than the above it is flunk and the coach must say so history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions revised 1961 by l ron hubbard the old tr has comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in model session and is longer needed at this level auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered this tr was redesigned to improve that frailty number tr 4 revised 1961 name preclear originations purpose to teach the student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination commands the student runs do fish swim or do birds fly on coach coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from prepared list given by supervisor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach 161position student and coach sit facing each other at comfortable distance apart training stress the student is taught to hear origination and do three things 1 understand it 2 acknowledge it and 3 return preclear to session if the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension he corrects the student into better handling patter all originations concern the coach his ideas reactions or difficulties none concern the auditor otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier trs the students patter is governed by 1 clarifying and understanding the origin 2 acknowledging the origin 3 giving the repeat statement ill repeat the auditing command and then giving it anything else is flunk the auditor must be taught to prevent arc breaks and differentiate between vital problem that concerns the pc and mere effort to blow session tr 3 revised flunks are given if the student does more than 1 understand 2 acknowledge 3 return pc to session coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on tr 3 students failure to differentiate between these by trying to handle them and coachs remarks about self as pc is flunk students failure to persist is always flunk in any tr but here more so coach should not always read from list to originate and not always look at student when about to comment by originate is meant statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case by comment is meant statement or remark aimed only at student or room originations are handled comments are disregarded by the student history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out revised by l ron hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing arc breaks as tr 5 is also part of the cchs it can be disregarded in the comm course trs despite its appearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors training note it is better to go through these trs several times getting tougher each time than to hang on one tr forever or to be so tough at start student goes into

september 1971r revised 20 may 1975 note this is revised issue for class viii class viii only hsst courses the power and upper level class viii cses cses will be issued as additions for class class viii auditors vii solo cs courses class viii checksheets hsst course case supervisor actions this is the revised issue of the class viii hcob case supervisor actions several cses have been brought up to date from the original cs booklet of 10 dec 68 the following are basic case supervisor actions it is to be noted symptoms are double lettered aa bb and the directions to auditors are numbered 1 2 3 when more than one direction applies to symptom letter is added 1a 1b in the future if related symptom is added it will go to triple letter for the same class bbb jjj in the future for triple letter direction will be numbered as hundreds bbb 200 bbb 200 thus we have system which can expand and be refined which can be charted and boxed chart can be drawn up of symptoms this chart gives the numbers for direc tions to save himself from writing the case supervisor can get the slips run off sep arately in quantity these slips can be packaged in envelopes or go into covered wooden box with 80100 pigeon holes the door closes over the holes the chart is on the inside of the door the whole thing can be padlocked the pattern is that of flag locker in which signal flags are kept each pigeon hole is numbered the cs then simply looks on his chart deals out of the cs locker number of slips staples them puts on auditor and pc uses timedate stamp and he is very much in business the cs does not issue the symptoms in folders only the directions his comments to the auditor can be made on blank sheet stapled in front of the separate slips he then has his locker he has his independent copy of this hcob for separate reference he will have his chart his only real problem is how to keep himself supplied with slips of directions it is probably best to cut these all of piece on mimeo stencils and get them run off in batches standard grades are not part of this setup as it is understood that the auditor knows these directions to do standard grades are written on the blank sheet good luck

in this type style chkshts references to footplates have been deleted false ta some pcs have very difficult time in auditing due solely to can electrode out nesses some auditors have heavy losses because they do not realize the troubles that can come from electrodes and thus remedy them ta use the ta must be between 2 and 3 for correct fn when the ta is reading falsely pc can be butchered example auditor talking the ta down it gets to 31 by his meter so he gets the pc to talk bit more to get the ta between 2 and 3 and fn the ta suddenly rises to 38 pc and auditor go desperate what has happened is that the ta was false read it was really reading 29 and fning but for reasons given below it read 31 thus the auditor overran the fn and by keeping on invalidated the release pulled the pcs attention out of session and demanded more than the pc had to give example auditor twoway communicating with pc to get the ta up from 18 the ta suddenly sinks to 16 pc goes into apathy what happened was missed fn for reasons covered below the ta at 18 was false and was really at 21 and fning example pc being asked for an earlier similar incident because ta is at 40 pc cant get one gets desperate ta goes to 50 for reasons given below the ta was at 30 but was reading falsely at 40 some cases get upset at the very idea of fn when these mistakes are made more than one case has missed all his wins for year because of false ta so it is very important to know how false ta comes about and how to avoid it properly set up meter with cans electrodes fitted to pc who is holding them properly is wa ys correct however totally false tone arm readings can exist and an auditor must know how these come about trim meter can be improperly trimmed not set at 20 with the trim knob and can give false ta position further when meter is not left on minute or two before trimming it can drift in the session and give slightly false ta the trim can be quietly checked in midsession by snapping out the jack where the cord goes into the box and putting the ta on 2 seeing if the needle is now on set if 194not the trim knob can be moved to adjust it the jack is quietly slipped back in all without distracting the pc discharged cadmium cell meter discharges very suddenly when it does go flat in midsession the meter can run out of battery the ta will cease to act well and may go very false the remedy is to keep meter charged at least one hour for every 10 of auditing for 240 ac volt charging current or 2 hours for every 10 of auditing on 110 ac volt charging current meter lasts much longer than this in practice but the above is very safe before each session snap the knob over to test the needle should hit hard on the right side of the face it can even bounce this guarantees lots of charge in the battery and chance of meter going flat in session if the needle doesnt snap to the right hard or if it doesnt quite get there on test then that meter will go flat in midsession and give false ta and reads or ta on hot subjects onehand electrode single hand electrode with two terminals separated by rubber works but it always gives falsely high ta solo auditor who does not know this can get release point and go half mad wondering why he is fning at 40 the answer is to make single hand electrode out of two small cans about 3 34 inches by 2 18 inches or 9 12 cm by 5 12 cm or even smaller for very small handed pc glue thin circle of foam rubber solidly to the bottom of one can so it reaches out slightly around the bottom dont glue it up the sides put the alligator jaw clips one to each can now put the can bottoms together and hold them in one hand mark the ta 1meaning one hand such as 375 1 now take the cans one in each hand and mark the ta 2meaning two hands such as 30 2 audit with them in one hand keep your worksheets with 1 marks such as 35 1 check at start and middle and end by taking can in each hand and putting down the 2 can read such as 25 2 it is too much trouble to totally change cans and the distraction can change the ta read this two small can arrangement is not quite accurate it gives lower ta than big cans but the difference is slight it can scare you with 19 when trim is 20 and real ta is 20 if this happens check with big cans as an added tip solo auditor usually keeps the back of his hand on his leg while solo auditing the small 7 12 volt current gives tingle to the leg that is distracting when ones hand is moist put piece of foam rubber in plastic sack lay the sack on the leg put your hand on this pad it insulates the area and is very comfortable moist hands when pcs hands sweat lot you will get low ta contrary to 19th century superstition the meter does not work on sweat very sweaty hands as found on nervous persons gives false ta it goes low many low ta cases are just sweaty hand cases 195paper handkerchiefs kleenex are standard item for an auditing roomfor grief charges and burning eyes etc these should be available if the ta is low check if the pcs hands are wet if so have him wipe them and get new read it is usually found that the 16 was really 20 or the 16 was really 18 and the trim was 18 20 have the pc wipe hands check and correct trim before you bypass all low tas fns tas can go low invalidation of the pc lousy trs can drive one low if so the ta comes back up on repair but dont brand case low ta case until you make sure his hands are dried and the meter trimmed also very small cans or cans too small for the pc can give slightly low reading dry hands some pcs have extremely dry hands usually from industrial chemicals such as chlorine in dishwater or skin scale this can give wildly high ta the pc can be worried to death with high ta repairs when in fact he just doesnt have contact with the electrode quick test is have the pc put the cans under his armpits and youll see if its his calloused or chemically dried out hands arthritic hands rare pc is so crippled with arthritis that he doesnt make contact fully with the cans this gives high ta use wide wrist straps and youll get right read slack grip sometimes rare pc lets his hands go slack on the cans particularly if they are the wrong size cans too big this gives mysterious high ta it is false the ta will come down only to 32 and fn and of course an overrun then really gives high ta and the pc goes bit frantic and begins to believe things dont erase or release keep the pcs hands in sight check the pcs grip get smaller cans can size the most common fault is wrong can size for normal or large handed pc the can size is about 4 78ths inches by 2 58ths inches or 12 12 cm by 7 cm this can be altered as big as 4 12 inches by 3 inches diameter or 11 cm by 8 cm this is standard this can is too large for people with small hands these should use can 3 34 inches by 2 18th inches or 9 cm by 5 cm diameter or thereabouts small child would be lost even with that can so small 35 mm film can could be used this is 2 inches long by 1 316ths diameter or 5 cm by 3 cm this works but watch it as these cans are aluminum they do work but test for true read with slightly larger can and then trim to adjust for the aluminum if any different cans of course should be steel with thin tin plating regular soup cans 196can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack giving the auditor 32 fns and trouble cold pc pc who is too cold sometimes has falsely high ta wrap him in blanket or get warmer auditing room the auditing environment is the responsibility of the auditor late at night between 2 and 3 am or late at night pcs ta may be very high the time depends on when he sleeps usually this ta will be found normal in regular hours rings rings on the pcs hands must always be removed they dont influence ta but they give false rock slam floating ta many an auditor before now has gone bit mad trying to handle floating ta they are not very common and are startling what happens is the pc is so released the needle cant be gotten onto the dial the needle is swinging wider than the meter dial both ways from center and appears to lay first on one side then the other the ta cant be moved fast enough to keep the extreme floating needle on the dial this gives false ta of sorts as it cant be read some auditors seeing it for the first time have even sent the pc out of the room so they could adjust the meter or get another one thus the very highest state of release can be invalidated as where is the ta rusty corroded cans youd think soup was very expensive the way some auditors hold onto old cans corroded cans can falsify ta get new ones now and then tight shoes and then there was the vain lady who wore shoes too small for her feet she removed them every session the session went well each time then she put on her agonizing shoes and went to the examiner and the cses and auditors all went mad trying to find out why every exam had high ta tight shoes the emeter is accurate it is

and adds to hcob 24 oct 1971r false ta cold cans regardless of can size cold emeter electrodes tend to give much higher tone arm reading particularly on some pcs until the cans warm up the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high chilled pc almost always has high ta until he or she gets warm just throw ing coat over the pcs shoulders can bring down ta in cool room but some pcs are cool blooded and the shock of ice cold cans can drive the ta up and it takes while to drift down this has great effect on examinations where the cans are used very briefly practice which gets around this is for the auditor or examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc variation is for the auditor or examiner to put the cans under his armpits while setting up this warms them there are probably many other ways to warm up cans to body temperature footplates tests show that footplates do not read on the meter the use of footplates is thereby cancelled pcs who falsify some pcs rare take mistaken pride in being able to push the ta up by straining or tensing by just moving into the body the ta can be sent up by an otherwise exterior pc some pcs also take road out by getting an fn at will they have various tricks that do this the main one being to think of something else and get an fn any of these rare pcs are manifesting outofsessionness they arent in session the definition of in session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor remedy that and they cease such tricks usually they arent being run on what they are

twice as much water had flowed and then sit around and wonder all week why the swimming pool never filled up the accuracy of meter depends upon its being honestly set up and honestly used the honesty of the auditor determines his results the whole field of psychotherapy was dishonest from the days of witch doctors to psychiatry falsified data came from lack of knowledge of the mind this made its practitioners dishonest we do not and must not follow that fatal road the technology we have works to definite positive predictable results results are obtained if the auditor has honestly studied and understood his materials and honestly applies them falsifying study leads to falsifying meters and this gives bad results on pcs honest use of the materials and the meter gives an honest result one who does not know his materials and who cannot do his drills then thinks he has to make meter cheat honest use of the meter by an honest auditor is the route to good results low tas bad practice has arisen to beat the low ta 200this is to have the pc wipe his hands every few minutes to get the ta up above 20 not only does this distract the pc and yank him out of session but it is by infer ence putting his attention on the meter thing good auditor does not do in formal session the pcs attention must be on his own case in session not on the meter or his hands but the best answer is to get the pc up scale so he doesnt have perspiring hands overwhelming trs is the commonest reason for low tas not all the hand wiping in the world will cure poor trs some auditors spook leap off the road like horse frightened by something blowing along at the very thought of high or low tas this is because they havent got the trs to handle low ta nor the tech to handle high one making meter read falsely low with cream or falsely high with talcum powder or wiping hands continually will not handle the pcs case that is what the auditor is there to do not make his session look good the funniest one i have ever heard was solo auditor who had high ta trouble so he used to fill up bathtub with scalding water fill the bathroom full of clouds of steam and then sit in the bath holding onto his electrodes solo auditing it gave him lower ta but it sure didnt give him any case result we maybe ought to have contest as to who can come up with the most comical actual instances of falsifying meter reads one auditor solved it by just calling fns whenever she got tired of the pc regardless of ta position after year or more of this she saw the light and put herself in ethics the funny part is that

tech that includes misunderstood word tech thus if study tech is not in people on staffs see nothing wrong with hearing or reading orders containing words they do not understand and have urge to look them up further they often feel they do know words that they in fact do not know when this situation exists it is next to impossible to get study tech and word clearing tech in for the orders seeking to get in study tech may contain words the person does not understand thus he doesnt really comply with the orders and study tech does not get in thus the ability to hear or read and understand continues to be missing therefore these ethics actions become part of standard ethics 1 person may be summoned to court of ethics or execu tive court of ethics if it be found that he has gone past word he does not understand when receiving hearing or reading an order hcob policy letter or tape any and all lrh written or printed materials including books pabs despatches telexes and mimeo issues which resulted in failure to do duties of his post without his at once making an effective effort to clear the words on himself whether he knew he was missing them or not as the source of his inaction or damaging actions the charge is neglecting to clarify words not understood 2 staff member who does not use study tech or get it known while studying or instructing may be summoned to court of ethics or an executive court of ethics the charge is failure to employ study tech 3 student alterising or misadvising others on the use of study tech may be summoned before court of ethics the charge is advocating misuse or neglect of proper study tech 2034 an auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned before court of ethics the charge is out tech 5 any public division person staff member or scientologist found using terms circumstances or data on raw public in public lectures or promotion or in pr beyond the public ability to grasp without stressing study tech or at once taking effective measures to clarify or releasing materials broadly to wrong public may be summoned to court of ethics if any flap or upset results the charge is failure to apply study tech in dissemination suppressive furthermore as study tech is our primary bridge to society and the basic pre vention of out tech and out admin if any offense as above found guilty in court of ethics is repeated and the person has had two such courts on this offense the person may be summoned before committee of evidence on charge of com mitting an act or omission undertaken to knowingly sup press reduce or impede scientology or scientologists and if found guilty beyond reasonable doubt may be declared suppressive person and expelled with full penalties axiom 28 failures to teach or use study tech or alterations of study tech are actually offenses against axiom 28 as it is applied internally in an org on admin and tech and from the org to society study tech including its technology of word clearing is in fact the technology of axiom 28 the axiom amended follows axiom 28 communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from sourcepoint across distance to receiptpoint with the intention of bringing into being at the receiptpoint duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the sourcepoint the formula of communication is cause distance effect with intention attention and duplication with understanding the component parts of communication are consideration intention attention cause sourcepoint distance effect receiptpoint duplication understand ing the velocity of the impulse or particle nothingness or somethingness noncommunication consists of barriers barriers consist of space interpositions such as walls and screens of fastmoving particles and time communication by definition does not need to be twoway when communication is returned the formula is repeated with the receiptpoint now becoming sourcepoint and the former sourcepoint now becoming receiptpoint lrhldv l ron hubbard copyright 1972 1975 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 204l ron hubbard executive directive lrh ed 176

holding an executive post head of department or above is deemed an executive evaluation has revealed that the breakdown in many orgs is failure on the part of executives to wear their ethics and justice hats it has been found that below administrative whys there is usually an ethics situation as well which unhandled causes the administrative why not to function or raise stats in an area which is downstat it is the duty of an executive to investigate and find any outethics situation and get it corrected ethics is personal thing in relation to group unethical people are those who do not have ethics in on themselves personally it is the responsibility of the executive to see to it that persons under his control and in his area get their personal ethics in and keep them in dishonesty false reports an outethics personal life should be looked for and by persuasion should be corrected when an executive sees such things he or she must do all he can to get the person to get his own ethics in when an area is downstat the executive must at once suspect an outethics scene with one or more of the personnel and must investigate and persuade the person to be more honest and ethical and correct the outethics condition found if this does not correct and if the person or area remains downstat the executive must declare the person or area in danger and apply hco pl 9 apr 72 correct danger condition handling the situation if it does not correct thereafter becomes matter of full group justice with courts and comm evs persons whose ethics have remained out must be replaced the seniors of an executive are bound to enforce this policy and to use it on any executives whose personal ethics are out and who fail to apply it it will be found that those who do not apply this policy letter have themselves certain dishonesties or outethics situations it is vital to any organization to be strong and effective to be ethical the most important zone of ethical conduct in an organi zation is at or near the top 207ethical failure at the top or just below it can destroy an organization and make it downstat historical examples are many therefore it is policy that an executive must keep ethics in on himself and those below him or be disciplined or comm eved and removed from any post of authority and someone found who is himself ethical and can keep ethics in on those under his authority the charge in any such case for staff member or executive is failure to uphold or set an example of high ethical standards such offenses are composed of 1 dishonesty 2 use of false statements to cover up situation 3 representing scene to be different than it actually is to cover up crimes and escape discipline 4 irregular 2d connections and practices 5 drug or alcoholic addiction 6 encouraging outethics 7 condoning or failing to effectively handle an outethics situation in self or others as an incharge officer or executive technical people with outethics withholds cannot see this is proven by the brilliant return of perception of the environment in people audited effectively and at length on such processes such people also seek to place false environment there and actually see false environment people whose ethics are low will enturbulate and upset group as they are seeking to justify their harmful acts against the group and this leads to more harmful acts outethics people go rapidly into treason against the group person whose ethics have been out over long period goes out of valence they are not themselves happiness is only attained by those who are honest with themselves and others group prospers only when each member in it has his own personal ethics in even in pts potential trouble source person there must have been outethics conduct toward the suppressive personality he or she is connected with for the person to have become pts in the first place people who are physically ill are pts and are outethics toward the person or thing they are pts to 208thus group to be happy and well and for the group to prosper and endure its individual members must have their own ethics in it is up to the executive or officer to see that this is the case and to do the actions necessary to make it come about and the group an ethical group exec or officers steps for getting in ethics on staff member step one inform the person personally he is in danger condition by reason of acts or omissions downstate false reports or absence or 2d or whatever the circumstances are he is in fact in danger because somebody is going to act sooner or later to hit him he may be involved already in some other assignment of condition but this is between you and him he is in danger because you are having to bypass him to get his ethics in thing he should do himself if he cooperates and completes this rundown and it comes out all right you will help him if he doesnt cooperate you will have to use group justice procedures this is his chance to get ethics in on himself with your help before he really crashes when he accepts this fact step 1 is done go to step 2 step 2 ethics is gotten in by definition on the person get in the definitions fully understood the following words must be method 4 word cleared on all the words and the words in their definitions on the person being handled ethics the study of the general nature of morals morals plural noun the principles of right and wrong conduct and the specific moral choices to be made by the individual in his relationship with others the rules or standards governing the conduct of the members of profession justice 1 moral rightness equity 2 honor fairness 3 good reason 4 fair handling due reward or treatment 5 the administration and procedure of the law false contrary to fact or truth without grounds incorrect without meaning or sincerity deceiving not keeping faith treacherous resembling and being identi fied as similar or related entity dishonest disposed to lie cheat defraud or deceive pretense false reason or excuse mere show without reality 209betray to be disloyal or faithless to outethics an action or situation in which an individual is involved contrary to the ideals and best interests of his group an act or situation or relationship contrary to the ethics standards codes or ideals of the group or other members of the group an act of omission or commission by an individual that could or has reduced the general effectiveness of group or its other members an individual act of omission or commission which impedes the general wellbeing of group or impedes it in achieving its goals do not go to step 3 of this until all the above words are cleared by method 4 word clearing step 3 ask the person what outethics situation he or she is involved in it may take the person some time to think of it or he may suppress it and be afraid to say it for fear of consequences reassure him that you are only trying to help him he may have brought it up in session but did not apply it as outethics coax him through this if his conduct and actions are poor or downstat he for sure will be able to come up with an outethics personal scene sometimes the person is secretly pts and is connected to suppressive or antagonistic person or group or thing in such an instance he will rollercoaster as case or on post or have accidents or be ill frequently see pts tech for material on this and for future handling checksheet bpl 31 may 1971rf issue iv pts and sp detection routing and handling checksheet but go on handling with these steps sometimes the person just uses pr brags it up and wont come clean in this case an auditing session is required if the person gets involved in selflisting get him audited on hcob 20 apr 72 cs series 78 which gives the auditing session procedure person can become very upset over wrong item it is easily repaired but it must be repaired if this happens by your own 2wc or whatever means or repair get this step 3 to clearcut outethics situation clearly stated do not forget to go on with this eventually if there is delay in completing it gis will be in if correct step 4 have the person work out how the outethics situation in which he or she is involved would be betrayal of the group or make them false to the group or its ideals do not make the person guilty just get them to see it themselves when they have seen this clearly and have cognited on it completely go to next step step 5 the person is now ready to apply the first dynamic danger formula to himself give him this formula and explain it to him 210first dynamic formula the formula is converted for the first dynamic to 1st 1 bypass habits or normal routines 1st 2 handle the situation and any danger in it 1st 3 assign self danger condition 1st 4 get in your own personal ethics by finding what you are doing that is outethics and use selfdiscipline to correct it and get honest and straight 1st 5 reorganize your life so that the dangerous situation is not continually happening to you 1st 6 formulate and adopt firm policy that will hereafter detect and prevent the same situation from continuing to occur now usually the person is already involved in another group situation of down stats or overt products or bad appearance or low conditions courts comm evs for something it does not matter what other condition he was in from you he is in danger so 1st 1 and 1st 2 above apply to the group situation he finds himself in he has to assign himself danger condition as he recognizes now he has been in danger from himself 1st 4 has been begun by this rundown it is up to him or her to finish off 1st 4 by applying the material in steps 2 and 3 he or she has to use selfdiscipline to correct his own outethics scene and get it honest and straight with himself and the group 1st 5 is obvious if he doesnt he will just crash again 1st 6 in formulating and adopting firm policy he must be sure it aligns with the group endeavor when he has worked all this out and demonstrated it in life he has completed the personal danger rundown he can then assign himself emergency and follow the emergency formula hco pl 23 sep 67 pg 189190 vol 0 oec emergency step 6 review the person and his stats and appearance and personal life satisfy yourself that the steps above and the outethics found were all of it that wrong item has been found that the person is not pts handle what you find but if you find that the person did not improve and gave it all brushoff you must now take the groups point of view and administer group justice your protection of the person is at end because he had his chance and is appar ently one of those people who depend on others to keep his ethics in for him and cant keep them in himself so use group justice procedures thereafter 211if the person made it and didnt fall on his head and is moving on up now as shown by honest stats and condition of his post you have had nice win and things will go much much better and thats win for

happens that an hgcs line stops and programs do not get finished and pcs go unaudited or sent to ethics or cramming instead of getting their programs completed it also happens that d of p becomes incapable of getting auditors to audit per the schedule he writes 12 12 hour intensives drop out auditing falls back to the bit and piece game the cs finds all his work in programming wasted as the programs staledate or just get abandoned hours fall lines tangle tech services cannot get assignments done the major why of this and many such confusions can be traced to an abuse of auditors rights in picking and choos ing pcs on the grounds of feeling they cannot help the pc this right is also abused by auditors seeking pcs who fn easily at the exam iner see hcob 15 june 72 cs series 80 dog pcs the refusal to audit is in fact an admission in most cases of feared inability to audit therefore an auditor may only refuse to audit pc if direct personal relationship exists such as husband and wife or some friends wife or familial relationship an auditor advising others about this or that dog case or seeking to exclude pcs from auditing by abusing his right to choose pcs is subject to comm ev and suspension of certificates until retreaded for the real why of it is his inability to handle trs meter use the code or apply tech nearly every dog pc has out lists or incomplete chains or is not being run on what needs to be handled in other words they are simply problems in repair which modern tech handles easily the drug case who is audited on grades but has had drug rundown is an example

dianetics assists may be done as usual whenever needed by preclears medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed and where treatment is routinely successful medical treatment should be obtained as an assist can at 215times cover up an actual injury or broken bone chances should be taken especially if the condition does not easily respond in other words where something is merely thought to be slight sprain to be on the safe side an xray should be obtained particularly if it does not at once respond an assist is not substitute for medical treatment but is complementary to it it is even doubtful if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds recovery in short one should realize that physical healing does not take into account the being and the repercussion on the spiritual beingness of the person injury and illness are predisposed by the spiritual state of the person they are precipitated by the being himself as manifestation of his current spiritual condi tion and they are prolonged by any failure to fully handle the spiritual factors associated with them the causes of predisposition precipitation and prolongation are basically the following 1 postulates 2 engrams 3 secondaries 4 arc breaks with the environment situations others or the body part 5 problems 6 overt acts 7 withholds 8 out of communicationness the purely physical facts of injuries illnesses and stresses are themselves in capacitating and do themselves often require physical analysis and treatment by doctor or nutritionist these could be briefly catalogued as physical damage to structure b disease of pathological nature c inadequacies of structure d excessive structure nutritional errors f nutritional inadequacies g vitamin and biocompound excesses h vitamin and biocompound deficiencies i mineral excesses j mineral deficiencies k structural malfunction l erroneous examination m erroneous diagnosis n erroneous structural treatment erroneous medication there is another group which belongs to both the spiritual and physical divisions these are i allergies ii addictions iii habits iv neglect v decay any of these things in any of the three groups can be cause of nonoptimum per sonal existence we are not discussing here the full handling of any of these groups or what op timum state can be attained or maintained but it should be obvious that there is level below which life is not very tolerable how well person can be or how efficient or how active is another subject entirely certainly life is not very tolerable to person who has been injured or ill to woman who has just delivered baby to person who has just suffered heavy emotional shock and there is reason person should remain in such low state particularly for weeks months or years when he or she could be remarkably assisted to recover in hours days or weeks 216it is in fact sort of practiced cruelty to insist by neglect that person continue on in such state when one can learn and practice and obtain relief for such person we are mainly concerned with the first group 18 the group is not listed in the order that it is done but in the order that it has influence upon the being the idea has grown that one handles injuries with touch assists only this is true for someone who as an auditor has only smattering of scientology it is true for some one in such pain or state of case which would have to be pretty bad that he cannot re spond to actual auditing but scientologist really has business having only smattering of auditing skills that could save his or the lives of others and the case is very rare who cannot experience proper auditing the actual cause of not handling such conditions is then to be found as iv neglect and where there is neglect v decay is very likely to follow one does not have to be medical doctor to take someone to medical doctor and one does not have to be medical doctor to observe that medical treatment may not be helping the patient and one does not have to be medical doctor to handle things caused spiritually by the being himself just as there are two sides to healingthe spiritual and the structural or physical there are also two states that can be spiritually attained the first of these states might be classified as humanly tolerable assists come under this heading the second is spiritually improved grade auditing comes under this second heading any minister and this has been true as long as there has been subject called religion is bound to relieve his fellow being of anguish there are many ways minister can do this an assist is not engaging in healing it is certainly not engaging in treatment what it is doing is assisting the individual to heal himself or be healed by another agency by removing his reasons for precipitating and prolonging his condition and lessening his predisposition to further injure himself or remain in an intolerable condition this is entirely outside the field of healing as envisioned by the medical doctor and by actual records of results is very very far beyond the capability of psychology psychiatry and mental treatment as practiced by them in short the assist is strictly and entirely in the field of the spirit and is the tradi tional province of religion minister should realize the power which lies in his hands and his potential skills when trained he has this to give in the presence of suffering he can make life tolerable he can also shorten term of recovery and may even make recovery possible when it might not be otherwise when minister confronts someone who has been injured or ill operated upon or who has suffered grave emotional shock he should be equipped to do and should do the following contact assist

twoway comm this is twoway comm on the subject of any decision to be hurt or some such wording this is done only if the person has not already discovered that he had decisions connected to the incident it is carried to fn one must be careful not to invalidate the person where person is injured given contact or touch assist and then medical ex amination and treatment he is given the remainder as soon as he is able to be audited the drug five days does not need to apply but where the person has been given an assist over drugs one must later come back to the case when he is off drugs and run the drug part out or at least make sure that nothing was submerged by the drugs it is not uncommon for person to be oblivious of certain parts of treatment or operation at the time of initial auditing only to have missing piece of the incident pop up days months or even years later this is the reason injuries or operations occasionally seem to persist despite full assist piece of it was left unhandled due to drugged condition during the operation such bits may come off unexpectedly in routine auditing on some other apparently disrelated chain ref hcob 27 june 78ra new era dianetics series 9r drug handling and hcob 19 may 69ra drug and alcohol cases prior assessing it can happen that person is in the midst of some grade auditing at the time of an injury or illness or receiving an emotional shock the question arises as to whether or not to disrupt the grade auditing to handle the situation it is difficult question but certainly the person cannot go on with grade auditing while upset or ill the usual answer is to give full assist and repair the ease to bridge it back into the grade auditing the question however may be complicated in that some error in the grade auditing is also sitting there not to cause the illness or accident but to complicate the assist this question is handled fully only by study of the case by competent case supervisor the point is not to let the person go on suffering while time is consumed making decision prior confusion fixed ideas follow period of confusion this is also true of engrams that hang up as physical injury slow recovery after an engram has been run can be caused by the prior confusion mechanism the engram of accident or injury can be stable item in confusion by 2way comm see if confusion existed prior to the accident injury or illness if so it may be 2wced earlier similar to fn mystery point often there is some part of an incident which is mysterious to preclear the engram itself may hang up on mystery

accidents or injuries occur in the presence of suppression one wants to know if any such suppressive influence or factor existed just prior to the incident being handled this could be the area it occurred in or persons the preclear had just spoken to 2wc any suppressive or invalidative presence that may have caused mistake to be made or the accident to occur 2wc to fn cog vgis agreement get

by getting him to talk about that further losses person who has just experienced loss may become ill this is par ticularly true of colds 2wc anything the pc may have lost to fn present time an injured

then handled out interiorization bad lists missed whs arc breaks and incomplete or flubbed engrams are the commonest errors beforeafter where an injured or ill pc is so stuck that he has fixed picture that does not move one can jar it loose by asking him to recall time before the incident and then asking him to recall time after it this will jar the engram loose and change the stuck point unconsciousness pc can be audited even if in coma the processes are objective not significance processes one process is to use his hand to reach and withdraw from an object such as pillow or blanket one makes the hand do it while giving the commands one can even arrange signal system where the pc is in coma and cannot talk by holding his hand and telling him to squeeze ones hand once for yes twice for it is astonishing that the pc will often respond and he can be questioned this way temperature assists there is an hcob hcob 23 jut 71r assists on how to do assists that bring down the temperature holding objects still repetitively is the basic process quite often an injury or illness will miraculously clear up before one has run all the steps possible if this is the case one should end off any further assist all auditing of injured or ill people must be kept fairly light errors in trs such as bad tr 4 errors in tech rebound on them very heavily an ill or injured person can easily be audited into mess if the processes are too heavy for him to handle and if the auditor is goofing very exact in tech good trs good metering sessions are all that should be tolerated in assists summary religion exists in small part to handle the upsets and anguish of life these in clude spiritual duress by reason of physical conditions 219ministers long before the apostles had as part of their duties the ministering to the spiritual anguish of their people they have concentrated upon spiritual uplift and betterment but where physical suffering impeded this course they have acted to devote themselves only to the alleviation of physical duress is of course to attest that the physical body is more important than the spiritual beingness of the person which of course it is not but physical anguish can so distract being that he deserts any aspirations of betterment and begins to seek some cessation of his suffering the specialty of the medical doctor is the curing of physical disease or nonoptimum physical conditions in some instances he can do so it is invasion of his province to assist the patient to greater healing potential and ills that are solely spiritual in nature are not medical the psychiatrist and psychologist on the other hand took their very names from religion since psyche means soul they by actual statistics are not as successful as priests in relieving mental anguish but they modernly seek to do so by using drugs or hypnotism or physical means they damage more than they help the minister has responsibility to his people and those about him to relieve suf fering he has many ways to do this he is quite successful in doing so and he does not need or use drugs or hypnotism or shock or surgery or violence until his people are at level where they have need of physical things he has as duty preventing their spiritual or physical decay by relieving where he can their suffering his primary method of doing so is the assist as the knowledge of how to do them exists and as the skill is easily acquired he ac tually has right to neglect those for whose wellbeing he is responsible as only then can he lead them to higher levels of spiritual attainment an auditor has it in his power to make pcs recover spectacularly that power is in direct proportion to his flawlessness as an auditor only the most exact and proper tech will produce the desired result if you truly want to help your fellows that exact skill and those results are very well worth having l ron hubbard founder lrhntrdlfgdr copyright 1973 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights

checksheets references to footplates have been deleted dry and wet hands make false ta couple of years ago some auditors were solving high ta problems by putting hand cream on the pcs hands when they were calloused and talcum powder on pcs hands when they were too wet since research had been done they were censured research has now been done on this matter of dry and wet hands apparently when person has taken certain medicines or chemicals or uses detergent soaps or is in contact with certain chemicals such as those in some furniture polishes the ordinary skin oils vanish these oils are needed to make an electrical contact with the cans when these oils are absent there is adequate electrical contact and the ta is high when person is deficient in certain minerals or vitamins such as magnesium or b complex his hands can be excessively wet either of these two conditions in hands can produce an incorrect ta position the dry condition produces false high ta the overly wet condition produces false low ta the ta depends on normally moist hands this does not mean the meter works on sweat it does mean the meter works only when there is correct electrical contact too much and too greasy hand cream could produce too low ta vanishing creams dont work as they are found to actually dry out the skin after repeated application and so produce falsely high ta too much powder or drier could produce too high ta therefore one must not go to extremes dry hands the excessively dry hand is seen as shiny or polished looking it feels very dry the correct treatment is to use hand cream such as vaseline intensive care lotion obtainable from any cosmetics store not greasy hand cream or vanishing good hand cream rubs all the way into the skin and leaves excess grease this restores normal electrical contact such hand cream would only have to be applied once per sessionat session startas it lasts for long while hand cream is never applied during session 222if cream leaves smears on can it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed hand cream is usually smeared on rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wiped off the hands will usually produce then normal ta and meter response wet hands antiperspirants can be applied to too wet hands there are many brands of these often powder or spray it can be wiped off after application and should work for two or three hours if the ta then goes too high use hand cream on top of it summary while much work could be done still the above is enough for practical result warning hi tas and tas do not widely fn if you are getting wide persistent fn with the ta too high above 3 or too low below 2 you have pc whose hands are too dry or too wet using this hcob should correct it and in future sessions you should continue the remedy on

this type style css ellipsis indicates deletion hco dept 3 hats ptssp detection crs rock slams and rock slammers reference hcob 3 september 1978 definition of rock slam lot of controversy has shown up this year on the subject of rses and rsers therefore the following bulletin was compiled from my materials to clarify the matter my research on this was actually done years ago and remains very valid indeed rses an rs or rock slam is defined as the crazy irregular leftright slashing motion of the needle on the emeter dial rses repeat left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of an rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth it is actually quite startling to see one it is very different from other meter phenomena recently auditors arriving on flag were found not to know what an rs was but were calling dirty needles dirty reads rocket reads body motion and even ticks as rses that comes from never having been trained on what an rs is and never having seen one rses are unique in appearance on the other hand far more serious is the fact that auditors have many times seen rses didnt mark them down and didnt report them this is high crime as it injures society the org and the person himself see hcob 10 aug 76r rses what they mean actually this is quite serious matter because pcs get labelled as rsers and get run on evil purposes connected with this rs that isnt one you can really foul up pc that way meter also sometimes goes crazy on an rser you see it work then it doesnt read etc while this is rare it does happen auditors have changed their meters just to find the new one was also crazy but the rs will show up through all this an inoperational meter does not mean you have an rseryou might have just forgotten to charge it or have faulty leads rock slammers in normal group of 400 the actual percentage of rsers is low its about 8 in 400 or 2 2 12 those figures should seem familiar they are the same percentage for sps and that gives you clue to the identification of an rser where requirements for scn or so orgs have been established for rses they apply to the 2 2 12 of real rsers as these are high risks for staff purposes these people can of course be salvaged as pcs using expanded dianetics letting them on staff could be disastrous however handled rser can be expected to eventually wind up in the same category as cleared cannibal his experiential track is too educated in evil and too uneducated in anything else so even when cleaned up will need lot of living 229rsers are also very expensive people to keep around they waste the available resources and produce overt products they cost fortune in waste repairs lost business they also cost heartbreaking number of damaged people checklist to assist you in the identification of rsers checklist of characteristics and their reference has been done this checklist is to be used whenever cs is called upon to inspect folder to determine whether person is an rser that he rses is the main thing the other points simply help investigate whether he rses he doesnt have to have all

full coverage bulletin which gave the full story on this the earliest was getting the pc to locate and run imaginary incidents this is fully covered in science of survival especially book two chapter nine imaginary inci dents the auditor clears the idea of imaginary incidents and running them then persuades the pc to run them without forcing him delusion tends to run off but the real incidents move into view as well these imaginary incidents can be run r3ra narrative quad full preassessment procedure per new era dianetics series tech of the somatics emotions etc of the imaginary incident can be incorporated in the past life remedy as part of the action of grooving in the pc see hcob 18 june 78 new era dianetics series 4 assessment and how to get the item and hcob 28 june 78 new era dianetics series 7 r3ra commands for narrative and r3ra quad commands another past life remedy would be for the auditor to assess the following list on the pc earlier existences abandoned pictures previous existences past life experiences past lives memory earlier lives amnesia unreal pictures forgetting other times leaving bodies past deaths past bodies going backtrack new bodies imaginary incidents lost possessions invalidated pictures forgotten pictures other identities death imaginary beingnesses losing body pretended injuries forgotten memories pretended illnesses invalidated

beingness forgotten lives abandoned deaths notised existence notised existences invalidated pictures invalidated memories 232invalidated imagination notised imagination invalidated perception abandoned perceptions things you dont want to find out about any item can be added to the above by the pc you then take the largest reading item found in the above and ask the pc to describe it briefly ask him in your own words briefly describe item that read use the exact wording the pa gave you treat that wording as an original item exactly as though it had been obtained on the original assessment list new era dianetics series 5 handle the items the pa gives you exactly as you would handle any original item or items in new era dianetics series 4 preassessment etc exhaust all reading items in the above prepared list reassess the prepared list and do each of the above steps when the pa is able to go earlier than this life with good reality then the remedy is complete often the pc wont go backtrack because hes druggie what has happened here is that he restimulated past lives with drugs got into frightening pictures that he didnt understand and now backs off from any bank content except drugs that is handled with full drug rd including full battery of objectives and all reading items run including interest items the standard approach on any pc is to get full drug handling done first see hcob 27 june 78 new era dianetics series 9 drug handling another reason could be the pc is in recent shock of having died such case is overburdened and is destimulated with general auditing and then gets past life remedy if he hasnt gone backtrack you could even do prior assessment to this life the subject of invalidation of past lives and people talking about them out of session or claiming to be famous people invalidates past lives for pc and is actually related to suppression and pts phenomena if you suspect this you could ask has anyone been talking to you about past lives or famous people from this question possible suppression in the environment can be located and used in pts rd hcob 9 dec 71r revised 21 oct 74 children children are usually very burdened cases and can be hard to cs on dianetics if it hits this life only which will leave the pc wide open to keyin and at the age of 20 be found all keyedin with all grades run i find they are jammed into fiction stories education books and movies and run these like engrams these children speak of remembering all the time they say they cant go backtrack because they dont remember they dont seem to take it from pictures contrary to psychology theories and popular belief i find children in very rough case shape nervous frightened griefy etc they get stuck in the books and movies they see i have handled this in various ways the easiest way to unburden cases is by objectives contact processes and recall arc sw self analysis that is the general approach you can list for mental image pictures pc has seen in life in movies or books take the best reading one and do full preassessment procedure on it handling the running item obtained with r3ra quad then repeat the preassessment steps until you get reads on the preassessment list you have assessed for that original item 233return to the mental image pictures list take the next largest reading item and do full preassessment etc follow hcob 18 june 1978 assessment and how to get the item new era dianetics series 4 exacty preassessment can also be done on unwanted attitudes emotions pains etc the preassessment list one had as child these would then be fully handled as above to unburden the case direct approach is to ask what book or movie were you particularly interested in youll usually find that the person had stuck picture on it then ask did you ever have anything to do with that sort of thing then they go into it because youre asking for an you could then run out the earlier incident narrative r3ra quad and youd be away where the pc is stuck in upsetting incidents from movies or books you can list for bad incidents youve seen or read about take the best reading one with pc interest and run it out r3ra narrative quad then handle with preassessment procedure per above be sure to accept stories tv movies or books as these are fully valid to run review scientology review action that can be done is to assess auditors auditing past lives dianetics scientology time preclears and erasure then prepcheck in order of reads reassess and prepcheck this is valuable action to do before arc sw triple and often by itself will handle those unable to go past track further scientology approach would be to assess the past memory pictures past lives and prepcheck in order of reads then ln who or what would have future then ln who or what would it have been awful to have been these items can be checked and used in pts rd or can have their intentions listed and run as part of ex dn handling summary the technology on past lives is important for cs to know especially the dianetics cs the subject usually resolves with drug rd and general auditing but when it doesnt you have these remedies to use use them well l ron

ref hcob 3 sep 78 all meter definition of rock slam operators rses what they mean handling of confessionals checksheets pts processing checksheets expanded dianetics checksheets meter operation checksheets various rundown checksheets the crazy irregular leftright slashing motion of the needle in the emeter dial is called rock slam or rs it repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of an rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth the term was taken from process in the 50s which sought to locate rock on the pcs early time track the slam is description of the needle violence meaning it slams back and forth for time all leftright motions of the needle were considered and called rock slams until it was found that smooth leftright flow was symptom of release or keyout and this became the floating needle there is yet another leftright motion of the needle called the theta bop this occurs when the person has or is trying to exteriorize theta is the symbol for the person as spirit or goodness bop is an electronic term for slight hitch in the sweep of needle theta bop hitches evenly at each end of the sweep left and right and is very even in the middle of the sweep neither the floating needle nor the theta bop can be confused with rock slam the difference of the rock slam is uneven frantic slashing left and right even the distances traveled left and right are likely to be different in each swing from the last rock slam can be caused sometimes by leaving rings on the pcs fingers or by short circuit in the meter or by the cans electrodes touching something like dress these are the mechanical considerations and must be ruled out before the pc can be considered to have rock slammed if the pc is not wearing rings and if the meter needle is calm with the lead unplugged if the lead is okay and if the pc is not jiggling the ends of the cans against his clothes then the pcs rock slam is caused by the pcs bank one has to be very careful about the correctness of the pc actually having rock slammed while on the meter that it was actually observed that it was not mechanically caused as above one puts the rs down on the worksheet and also gives exactly what was asked and also that the mechanical points were checked without distracting the pc one must always report rock slam in the auditing report note it with session date and page inside the left cover of the pcs folder and report it to ethics including the question or subject which rock slammed phrased exactly 238why because the rock slam is the most important needle manifestation it gives the clue to the pcs case in 1970 i began fullscale research project into the subject of insanity and its relationship to cases and case gains and suppression it was only then that the full significance of the rock slam was unearthed this research developed into what is now called expanded dianetics series of special processes and actions with their drills and training which permits the auditor to handle specific case type this was by the way mans first system of positive detection and handling of psychosis and the first full understanding of what psychosis is while this bulletin is not in any way twominute course in or substitute for full training in expanded dianetics any auditor who audits sec checks or handles people on meter has to know what rock slam is and how it behaves and what he should do about it the first thing is to be able to recognize one and to quickly with the scan of the eye and unplug of the meter cord without any distraction of or notice by the pc make the checks for mechanical rock slam as given above you can make meter rock slam with pc or cord connected to it by turning it on b put the sensitivity at perhaps 2 put the needle at set d rapidly very rapidly move the ta back and forth maybe quarter of an inch and do it unevenly that if you did it very fast and unevenly would be something that resembled rock slam but matter how fast you made your fingers move real rs is trifle faster if you do that you will see what an rs looks like the needle in this experiment is not made to hit the sides of the meter now if you take the same setup and smoothly slowly move the tone arm back and forth about 2 times second without any roughness and the same distance right and left you will have floating needle note it very well as this comes at time of release and is the thing good auditor hopes to see and gives him the endoff signal for process it has to be well known as you never bypass one in session and to do so makes an uncomfortable pc the pc will often cogniteget realization about himself or life at this point and one does not stop him from doing this this is the thing you indicate to the pc you dont ever indicate rock slams or theta bops when you see it and without stopping or interrupting the pcs cognition you always say your needle is floating now the theta bop can also be shown to yourself by you set up the meter as above only this time you smoothly swing it to the right and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then you smoothly at once swing it to the left and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then do it to the right and so on this is theta bop it is different than floating needle only in that it hitches at each end of the swing so learn to recognize it there is vicious smooth right direction slash that occurs when pc hits certain area of the bank that is called rocket read and there is of course the small fall long fall which both go to the right and indicate charged question or reaction and there is the gradual rise to the left but these do not repeat back and forth which is the characteristic of the rock slam floating needle and theta bop all right so we know exactly what it looks like when we talk about rock slam as read of the meter we know how it can be mechanically caused and we know what we have to record and report when it is seen but exactly what does rock slam mean with regards to the pc if you dont know this you can miss on the pc on the case on the org and humanity 239a rock slam means hidden evil intention on the subject or question under discussion or auditing two things underlie insanity or to be more specific there are two causes and conditions both of which have been lumped together by man and called insanity he could not of course define it as he didnt know what caused it the first of these two things does not concern us overly much here and is the subject of separate checksheet and training and is called pts or potential trouble source handling pts is person who has been or is connected with somebody who has evil intentions pts can feel uncomfortable in life or be neurotic or go insane because of the actions upon him of person with evil intentions most of the people in institutions are probable ptses the second of these two things is insanity caused to the individual himself let alone others by hidden evil intentions the extent of these intentions and what the person will do and hide in order to carry them out is quite shocking these people are covert or overt criminals and many of them are insanemeaning beyond all rationality in their acts because their evil intentions are hidden and because they are often very plausible such individuals are what make behavior so mysterious and man look so evil when you see what mankind does and all sorts of fallacies it is this last type the chronic heavy rock slammer which expanded dianetics handles one rock slam doesnt make psychotic or total menace to everyone but it does mean there could be more and it might in rare cases mean you have seeing enough of these rses very dangerous person on your hands and in your vicinity and that person must be handled by expanded dianetics you wont see great many rock slams in auditing people so you could be totally thrown off by surprise when you see one and mess it all up because you are surprised so know what it is and dont get all quivery and make mistakes and blow your confront just carry on if you dont note the exact question that was asked and the exactly worded statement the pc made when the rs was seen you can muck it up for the expanded dianetics guys they wont be able to get it turned back on again easily and will lose lot of time so you have to be sure your auditing report is accurate that the rs is written big on the column and circled and matter what else you do in the session you have to get it recorded in the left front cover of the folder giving the date and page of the session and you have to report it to ethics and also you dont third party the pc and give him bad time in the session because of it now rses most easily turn on during sec checks or integrity processing or when pulling withholds or trying to investigate something so the people who see these most often are those engaged in that activity and not routine auditing when they can also but more rarely turn on further the most likely person to collide with needing to be sec checked is an rser which again increases the numbers of rses seen in these activities compared to routine auditing but very heavy rser will also turn them on in routine auditing it is the exact point of the rs in the session the exact question that was asked and the exact subject or phrase where the rs turned on that are important and these are very important as then the person can be fully handled with full expanded dianetics rundown by qualified expanded dianetics specialist when of course the person gets to that point on his grade chart the grade chart points are after dianetics like drug rds etc but before grades after grades but before power after power but before solo and after ot iii or after any single grade above ot iii these are the only 240points where expanded dianetics can be delivered and the rs fully and completely handled now here is how you can turn off an rs and mistakenly think it is handled 1 the overtmotivator sequence has two sides one is what the person has done overt and what is done to the person motivator you can ask when the person rses on something if anyone has ever invalidated him on that subject or action he will find some and the rs will turn off and wont even be faintly handled but only submerged one can believe he has handled the rs not true he has just turned it off and maybe made it harder to find next time one can ask what the person has done to the subject mentioned and while this may unburden the case and make the person bit better the rs is not handled only turned off or submerged its almost as if there are so many overts and motivators on this subject or in this area that the pushpull of it makes the needle go wild rs and indeed this may be the energy cause in the bank of the needle reaction but neither overt nor motivator handles an rs finally because the cause of the rs is an intention to harm and it isnt all that likely the basic intention will be reached 2 another apparent way the rs can get handled and isnt is to take the rser earlier similar on the subject of the rs the rs will probably cease go clean but in actual fact it is still there hidden 3 the third way an rs can be falsely handled is to direct the persons attention to something else if when this is done the exact subject of the rs is not noted by the auditor it will be difficult to find it again when the person goes into expanded dianetic auditing 4 yet another and probably the last way to falsely handle an rs is to abuse the person about his conduct or behavior or the rs or to educate him to do better or to modify his behavior with shocks or surgery or other tortures like the psychiatrists do in other words one can seek to suppress the rs in numerous ways maybe the rs wont occur being too overburdened now but it is still there buried very deep and possibly beyond reach now so if you understand the above four points you will see that although you can ease off the rs you have not handled it it has merely gone out of sight all right what then does handle an rs i warned you that this isnt twominute course on expanded dianetics and it isnt an rs is handled by fully qualified expanded dianetics auditor delivering full expanded dianetics to the person at that point on the grade chart where expanded dianetics is supposed to be delivered if anyone thinks it can be done effectively any other way or if he cses it to be done and the auditor is stupid enough to try to do that cs then its committees of evidence and suspended certificates all around with that warning and only with that warning i can briefly state what has to be done with the case this is not what you do if you are not delivering full expanded dianetics at the right point on the grade chart it is brief statement so that you can understand what lies under that rs the pc with an rs on any given subject and who rses while discussing that or related subjects has an evil intention toward the subject discussed or some closely related subject the pc intends that subject or area of life nothing but calculating covert underhanded harm which will be at all times carefully hidden from that subject thus the expanded dianetics specialist in handling that case at the proper point on the grade chart has to be able to locate each and every subject and question and rs in that persons folder as noted by sec checkers and previous auditors or 241cramming officers or why finders he has to have the complete list of rs subjects if they are noted as to session date and page and if all sec checking papers and cramming papers are in that persons folder then the expanded dianetics specialist can do full and complete job otherwise he has to do lot of other time wasting actions to get the rses found and turned on again what the expanded dianetics specialist actually does is locate exactly the actual evil intention for every rs on the case and handle each one to total conclusion when he is finished if he has done his job well the persons behavior will be magically improved and as to his social presence menace and conduct well that will be toward survival when you see an rs if you are not an expanded dianetic specialist doing expanded dianetics at the correct point on the grade chart you dont say hey youve got an evil intention and you dont ask say whats that evil intention or do corny things like that because youll get the pc selflisting you may get wrong item you wont know what to do with it and youre just likely to get the auditing room wrapped around your neck right there you quietly note it make sure it isnt mechanical fault write it big on the worksheet write down everything the pc is saying swiftly note what question you were asking and let the pc talk and ack him and go on with what you are doing with the pc at the time and after session you note it in the lefthand cover of the folder and send report to ethics and some day when hes done his drug rundown or gotten to one of the points on the grade chart where full xdn can be done why then it will be handled and good cs will program or tip the case for that to be done so thats the knowhow you have to know about rses to really help the guy and the society and your group were not in the business of curing psychos the governments at this writing pay the psychiatrists billions year to torture and kill because of rses they dont know anything about the crime in the society out there is caused by people who rs stalin hitler napoleon and caesar were probably the most loaded rsers of all time unless it was jack the ripper or your local friendly psychiatrist so know what you are seeing when you see it and know what to do about it and dont kid yourself or vilify or mow down people who rs were not in that business and the expanded dianetic specialist and the pc

i hear of pts handlings that didnt work or still pts or some such or ill come across such extremes as pts is virtually an incurable leper to be shunned and kept isolated or almost everyone is pts to some degree so what can you really do about it the basic thing to realize is that ptsness like any other case condition afflicting man responds to plain old standard tech but one has to have studied and understood that tech to apply it naturally i recall years ago in handling ptses that none of them at first knew what pts really meant or what it was all about even when they used the term freely so i recently called for pilot to see what would be the effect of study method of curing ptses first pilot before the final pilot was done an earlier pilot was attempted by an aide which was not conducted as laid down cs5 reviewed the failed pilot to find why so many failed on it 4 out of 6 were never completed and the 2 that did failed cs5 reported what i found on these was that they uniformly were not pts in the first place or were pts but that was not the major trouble with the person three of the cases 2 on auditing and i on study were outethics rsing exp dn cases who were trying to use pts as the reason for their behavior thus handling their ptsness would not resolve anything the most interesting case here was the study one who realized that he was not pts and that that had been wrong indication and that what was really wrong with him was that he had bad intentions and was committing overts one of the audited cases had similar realization but has not done as well on post and did get very sick 2 months or so later of the other 3 pilot cases in this first batch one could only come up with intheorg terminals so is another exp dn case and the other 2 assigned to study were severely bugged students so never got off the ground one has now finished the course 4 months later so thats what happened to the original pilot the second pilot was then ordered to determine the original possibility that people could study their way out of being pts second pilot three were put onto the ptssp checksheet to study and three were handled by internes who had done the ptssp checksheet themselves the cases handled by auditinginterview steps completed their handlings within 10 hours the study cases averaged 46 weeks of parttime study two studiers from the original pilot also com pleted the course all were then watched for bad originations to the examiner medical reports ethics trouble or trouble on post in all cases including those not yet complete on study none of these indicators showed up one case originated case troubles but this turned out to be one of the exp dn cases not ptsness on the study pilot the daily reports and success stories on completion uniformly mention more certainty more stability and being more at cause with the data of particular interest is that three of the participants cogged they were not actually pts yet evidence of real pts sits had gotten them on the project but while they were studying they would align past pts handlings they didnt fully understand at the time spot why past pts terminals were correct or incorrect spot terminals who gave them hard time in the past and see why certain people behaved the way they did in short it 246appears the studiers were blowing charge on their past pts handlings and on terminals in their life almost like an auditing session and while they were saying not pts longer pts now that they had the data is probably closer to the truth all are reported to be doing well on post with illness rollercoaster or ethics trouble the pts handlers who had done the ptssp pack were of particular use where the person had study bug that needed handling before study could be done and assisting in working out the handlings for pts sits that were uncovered also sds and 10 aug hcob handlings and pts interviews are not solo actions and it takes hours not intensives to handle false pts as noted from the first pilot false ptsness must be watched for as unhattedness ignorance of scientology basics for handling life past bad auditing uncorrected as well as unhandled bad intentions and personal outethics can be mistaken for ptsness and wont resolve as ptsness this should be suspected when your ptses start going above 20 of staff and public summary we have had the tech of ptsness for years but it wasnt being fully used and then got mixed in with exp dn ptsness can be handled routinely when the tech is fully known and applied pts person can be brought to cause over his situation through study of the pts tech this is vitally important for staff we can handle and the person himself can handle there is substitute for understanding lrhjent l ron hubbard copyright 1976 founder by

prepared lists have become very thorough who can use the only reason ever found for prepared lists not working was an auditors weak tr 1 and inability to read meter even this difficulty has been

further protest on the subject word lists for prepared lists nearly every prepared list has all its words on separate sheet ready for word clearing on the pc all the words on list are cleared on pc without repeating the same word or asking the list question such lists are issued for auditor convenience list of these word lists is being issued as hcob i dec 74 so that you can match them to the prepared lists in this bulletin other lists from time to time when need for prepared list is found new ones will be issued on different subjects one can repair pc or student or staff member one can also forward case into new areas with other prepared lists mimeo some orgs backlog their mimeos the availability of lists to auditors is something which should not be neglected it is highly uneconomical as one loses resigns and students and staff when prepared lists are in nonexistence in an org or even short supply tech is the atomic fuel an org runs on keep prepared lists in supply for use 252translated issues in nonenglish speaking orgs lists must be very carefully translated and mimeoed for use in such orgs more than any others great care must be taken to have and use lists as they keep tech straight where it tends to go hearsay and verbal so thats quite an array of prepared lists isnt it if they are not in full use in your org dont wonder about your delivery stats why or your org and cf problems its lack of full use of this tech hidden in these prepared lists is wealth of tech that explodes into wins for your org your cf your pcs and students l ron hubbard founder

auditing reports falsifying of probably the most covert and vicious crime in auditing is falsifying an auditing report at first glance to someone who is trying to pr himself as an auditor or to escape consequences of session goofs this might not seem to be the huge crime that it is when an auditing report is falsified means of repairing the pc are denied out tech and need for restudy or redrilling of materials is covered up out tech is spread about and the repute of the org and scientology are at risk there are many ways of falsifying an auditing report chief amongst them is omission of vital data in the report another is faking the things run or the pcs actions or reactions to the person doing this it may seem that he has covered up his incompetence but in actual fact it is eventually detected twice declared person recently messed up the cases of several vips by simply omitting some of their disagreements with what was being done three sps now declared some years ago had mutual understanding that they would not put down each others withholds these three also falsified auditing reports to the effect that they had run certain things on pcs and there was nothing on them when in fact they either had not run them or there was reaction which they did not put into the report they messed up about dozen people before they were caught and it took many many hours of careful csing and auditing to salvage those cases and it also took about two years they made several hundred serious enemies for themselves and today i doubt any scientologist would even speak to them and their names are remembered with scathing contempt it is not only easy to detect falsified auditing report it is also inevitable that it will be detected the person whose auditing reports have been falsified is easy to spot in folders and records the auditor marks vgis fn and the examiner notes bypassed charge and bad indicators an auditor seeking to prevent this being detected has been known to take the examiner report from the folder but that there is examiner report would be the first thing cs would notice examiner reports have been forged and exchanged with the actual one but this too is very visible lack of proper success story points directly to out tech and if it is not visible in the folder then that folder contains falsified auditing reports the pc in the midst of his auditing refuses to resign for more an inspection of folder either finds the out tech in the auditing reports or it doesnt if the folder error summary finds out tech the next thing that is looked for is falsified auditing reports and this is extended to looking at the other cases this auditor has handled to see if there is any similarity of reaction 254a d of p interview with the pc will reveal falsified auditing reports it will contain data that does not appear in the auditing reports the first thing suspect is the auditing reports basically correct tech applied by competent auditor who has been trained and interned works and works every time when it doesnt work cs begins to look for the real scene there are many ways he can ascertain the actual scene amongst these are outsidethedoor session taping monitors interviews lack of success stories failures to declare failures to resign examiner reports at variances with the session reports personal checkup into the case and many others the only thing which temporarily misleads cs is falsified auditing report but in all our experience with these the detection of such reports is inevitable even if it occurs long time afterwards the person who would falsify an auditing report is usually found to be suppres sive with abundant rses and evil intentions who never should have been trained in the first place therefore the penalty for knowingly falsifying an auditing report in order to make oneself seem more competent than one is or to hide departures from the cs or to omit vital data necessary to csing resulting in upsets to case and time spent in investigation by seniors is actionable by committee of evidence and if the matter is proven beyond reasonable doubt cancellation of all certificates and awards declare and an expulsion order are mandatory should the person perpetrating the falsification of auditing reports run away blow before action can be taken the result is the same and is enforceable even if the person is not present green auditor may look upon the offense as slight if he is too untrained to realize that proper application of tech works every time and that improper application is gross overt act he may not realize the seriousness of his action this however cannot be pleaded as defense it is not light thing to end the hopes and close the door on pc just because one is trying to cover up his blunders the blundering auditor can be repaired by cramming and retraining but only if it is known how he has blundered that in itself is nowhere near as serious as hiding the fact honesty is the road to truth l

folders and complete loss of folders is very serious matter case supervisor as well as folder error summary auditor and the auditor himself can be impeded greatly by folder omissions loss of folders entirely is much greater catastrophe while cases and even folders can be reconstructed and eventually handled at enormous trouble and time to the pc and technical people this does not minimize the offense usuallyfolder pages are regarded too lightly as post and are subject to much transfer even when posted the director of tech services is often far too lax in posting folder archives ic even as double hat space restrictions often impede the careful preservation of folders in orgs but all these posts and spaces are vital to smooth delivery of auditing and should not be lightly looked upon the commonest and most senseless omissions from folders are 1 word clearing worksheets these are done in academies or training or interne areas as well as the hgc and it is often an omitted action to forward them to the persons pc folder often the lines to do so are unknown or completely missing yet every metered word clearing action should not only be the subject of worksheet but also must be included in the persons pc folder in date order word clearers can fail to fn chain or even fail to clear word as chain when it doesnt fn such goofs can mess up cases and leave cs perplexed as to how the pc was running well one day and badly the nextyet there is word clearing worksheet there so the fact of another auditor on the case is hidden 2 qual why finding actions as why finding also includes listing possibly the most vicious omission is the failure to include why finding worksheets in the persons folder or even do worksheet on it yet at least one org has been temporarily wrecked by indiscriminate why finding in qual that resulted in wrong items and wrong lists and messed up the cases of whole staffs this poor why finding has led at times to why finding becoming restricted or forbidden practice qual worksheets of why finding must be included in the persons folder along with any list made which itself must include the question asked 3 hco why finding these actions must also be the subject of worksheets and must also be included in the persons folder 4 all sec checks and integrity process lists and actions it doesnt matter who or what is doing the sec check the resulting

falsify worksheets giving ta as in range when it actually was not when calling an fn because they might get in trouble for calling an fn in the wrong range such as 18 or 32 the correct procedure for

resistance to electrical current in the palms leads and meter as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them to simply tell some interne always disregard an fn not in correct range is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes the correct information is that an fn which isnt in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an fn or not and indicates you better get the false ta handled fast as soon as it wont 260interrupt the current cycle and you always note where it fned so the cs can cs for false ta handling where an arc break needle which looks like an fn is observed whether it is in range or out of range 20 to 30 or below 20 or above 30 you look at the pc and establish the pcs indicators before falsely calling an fn pc

the postulate is what holds the chain in its place release the postulate and the chain blows thats it the auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it note the vgis call the fn and end off auditing that chain an fn seen as the incident is erasing is not called the pc does not have to state that the incident has erased once he has given up the postulate the erasure has occurred the

application of the tech word clearers can obtain much higher results and wins several recent examples have come up where some top tech and admin per sonnel were not duplicating issues and instructions yet they had been word cleared on these materials with mus found when word cleared again by someone who really knew his business the mus came off for hours with resurgence of activity at the end in number of the cases success stories were written about never having found misunderstood word before all of the examples cited had the following common denominators 1 the word clearer could really handle meter and make question read 2 the word clearers had personal certainty on the workability of word clearing and could apply it exactly and find mus to rave results trs and metering the fact that most word clearing starts off with the phrase i am not auditing you does not mean that trs and metering do not apply quite the contrary they are vital skills that need to be kept sharp by daily trs just like any auditor and weekly or monthly qual check on tr 1 and the ability to make question read the reason is quite simple word clearer must grasp that all forms of word clearing that he can apply either metered or unmetered were developed to help the individual find the mus he was unable to find himself one must assume that the person has already looked up all the mus he could find it is after all an ethics offense to fail to clarify words not understood and is now putting himself in the hands of the word clearer to find any mus that may be just beyond his awareness any lack of impingement on metered word clearing or reasonableness about slips and slurs or missed definitions on nonmetered word clearing will leave person knowing he has mus but wondering why he still has difficulty with the subject or post it may just be that people who find themselves resistive to word clearing have not grasped these points either and wonder why they need word clearing when they dont think they have mus personal certainty word clearing works there is shortage of people who can attest to that the only times word clearing would seem to fail would be if there were errors such as reads or missed reads b ignored slips and flubs in nonmetered word clearing c getting off into considerations or confusions without getting to the mus that always exist at the bottom and then getting the mus fully defined the remedy is simple if one has been word cleared on an area without reso lution of the original difficulty then mus have been missed and one need only report right back to word clearer and say i want my mus found in some cases wccl may be required but more often than not its just find the missed mus for anyone who has not yet experienced what its like to find real mu then just report to word clearer and pick any subject or area of difficulty and start getting the 263mus found until the subject or area now makes sense continue this on as many subjects as needed to leave doubt as to the workability of word clearing the case gain from real mu found can sometimes rival the biggest wins in auditing any word clearer must have this certainty and pass it on to those he word clears the wins and gains are there for the taking better functioning org with highly productive staff and public is the reward you deserve it just follow the tech as laid out in the word clearing

discovered that auditors have been mishandling false ta by assessing with the meter to find what the cause of the false ta is instead of directly checking the pc themselves recent example of this is the false ta checklist hcob 29 feb 72ra revised 23 april 75 was being used by assessment on the meter to try to find the pcs false ta cause the false ta was not remedied as the auditor never even felt the pcs hands never even checked the pcs grip never felt what the pcs hands felt like with cream on them the auditor just checked the lines on the meter and when read was obtained the pc was asked and nothing came of it the false ta now being unhandled due to the auditors confusion caused the pc to be audited over further false ta and drove the pc into desperation i had to jump in and handle this one all i did was check the grip and i found that the can size was way too big and part of the pcs hand the palm cup was not touching the can thus causing the ta to read higher false ta the cans had to be reduced to 1 14 inch diameter aluminum tubing this particular pc was also misapplying hand cream the quantity was incorrect and the way the pc was putting it on was not handling the false ta this pc needed to put vaseline intensive care on extensively then wipe off the hands with kleenex and then put bit more on and rub it all over the hands and ensure that the thumbs were being covered one more factor that messed up the case was the sensitivity was set too high and consequently fns were missed and the ta shot up another example of this was we had pc who constantly had low ta fns upon checking his grip we discovered that he held the cans so tight that it caused his hands to sweat and part of the hand was actually off the cans adjusting the grip handled the false ta this pc then started to cognite that he was really fast pc after all and there was nothing wrong with him we had another interesting one this particular pc crossed her legs and had cans that were too big by having her uncross her legs and recognizing that the can size was off and needed changing to 1 34 diameter aluminum tubing remedied her false ta so you have to watch it make sure that the sensitivity is set correctly for that pc so you dont miss the fns none of this was done by auditor assessing list it was done by observing the pcs handling of cans and positions and seeing what it did to ta position 265the main point here was the auditor thought that false ta was think and would register on the meter that is as silly as asking the meter if you should buy ice cream today or not the meter cant answer when the answer is required of the preclear how the hell would the meter know if the pcs hands were dry or cold the auditor has to feel them touch them check for dryness by feeling them do they feel dry do they feel cold are the pcs feet so cold that circulation gets through do you know without feeling them does the hand cream you are using dry up how do you know without feeling the pcs hands i have known pc to say it hasnt dried up because the pc hated wearing cream and didnt want to put more on so feel the hands dont just ask the pc and then assume that that is it you will mess up cases and wont handle the false ta false ta is in the physical universe it is something that really exists when you start checking for meter reads you are violating this law it is in the physical universe not the pcs think or bank it can badly mess up case to not find the cause of false tas and then carry on with auditing understanding the meter and what the meter reads on and understanding false ta and what causes it are the basics behind finding false ta and remedying it so that the pc can happily continue on with auditing and advance if you think that you have solved false ta yet the pc still has high or low ta fns then you havent solved it at all and you had better roll up your sleeves and get bright and go in there and find it and the way you do this is to check the pc what do the hands feel like what type of clothing is the pc wearing feel for tight clothes dont just take the pcs word maybe they like wearing tight shoes but look at that 45 fn let them wear tight shoes out of session but get rid of those tight shoes in session so you can get an accurate reading meter dont use this to hassle pcs and interject it into sessions whenever you please when you see false ta phenomena note it down and the cs will include it in the program to be handled this is covered in hcob 10 dec 76 fn and ta position there is pc on this planet or any planet that wants to experience overrepair and misery due to false tas you will be doing them great service to handle it for them so they can happily be audited after that dont qa with the pcs considerations just find what in the

pc this bulletin reinstates the false ta checklist with specific handlings that are directly from the issues that i wrote on false ta the following are the items to be checked by an auditor on any pc it need only be done once unless the check itself is suspected false or if conditions of the pcs hands etc change the checklist is kept in the pc folder and is entered on the folder summary as an action done the value of operating with correct can size should not be underestimated the reference hcobs state why the auditor signs and answers the following points on the checklist the auditor must obtain information by checking the pcs hands himself or herself to see if the hands are dry or wet the cause of false ta is in the physical universe and that is where the check is done it is not done by asking the pc or checking the questions on the pc for meter reads so the auditor would feel the hands of the pc to establish if they are dry or wet would feel the pcs hands with cream on them to

can size cold emeter electrodes tend to give much higher tone arm reading particularly on some pcs until the cans warm up the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high some pcs are cool blooded and the shock of ice cold cans can drive the ta up and it takes awhile to drift down practice which gets around this is for the auditor or examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc variation is for the auditor or examiner to put the cans under his armpits while setting up this warms them there are probably many other ways to warm up cans to body temperature lrh hcob 12 nov 71ra revised 26 jan 77 16 are the pcs hands dry or calloused handling covered above under pcs hands excessively dry requiring hand cream there are ways to apply the

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 january 1977 remimeo all auditors all supervisors all interneships urgent and important tech correction roundup auditors and scientologists for 27 years have tended to be suspicious of hcobs and policy letters not written by myself until few months ago my opinion was that this while flattering was not tirely justified however these last few months have sharply changed my belief into total agree ment with all those who have expressed some fear of reinterpretations of bulletins by others i have been engaged for some months now in roundup of out tech issues and i have found i am sorry to say that mice have been gnawing at the pillars of the bridge putting up traffic barriers and false detour signs i have been finding serious out tech issues and correcting them whether because of misunderstood words the commonest cause of out tech alter ations or other reasons there have been staggering number of tech sectors that have been corrupted by issues by others that alterised the corrections i have been doing have been are being or will be issued shortly however not all auditors and scientologists keep pace with current issues and so i am here giving you rapid summary of the gross departures from standard tech which have occurred in the past 3 or 4 years and their corrections so you were right very few people 3 or 4 have wittingly or unwittingly brought about outnesses which could easily make the difference between successful case handling and failed cases action has been taken to handle them and there are great many good people at work now in compiling and reissuing the workable tech which i developed in the first place it is now forbidden to write an hcob or an hco pl and sign my name to it if anyone helped compile it or wrote it my name is followed by assisted by_____ the person who helped get it back together at my directions also board technical bulletin may cancel an hcob so from here on you are relatively safe i am always the first to tell you and this is exception tech corrections 274there follows here long list of incorrect procedures or data found to have been issued also brief rundown of the correct procedure will be found which is the correct and standard tech what makes tech correct when it doesnt get results it is incorrect when it gets the expected result it is correct my own writings and researches are based wholly upon things that got and get results when another through misunderstood words or other reasons interprets or changes the original tech it has been the general experience that results are not ob tained by studying this list you may very well find some alterised points which caused you to have trouble or which caused confusion therefore the subjects themselves are described in summary form not all issues are out yet which accomplish full correction their hcob numbers therefore cannot be given some of the issues are not yet released but will be soon however there is reason to deny you the essence of the material and so i am giving you the full list to date i trust this list and hcob restore some stability i hope that any failures you may have had due to alterised materials will be spotted by you and that you will be able to apply some of these right now and get the full materials later i like results you like results and the following may include some of the reasons you may have had hard time with some sessions i am sorry for that i have come back on tech lines especially to correct it and have spent seven months spotting areas where there has been trouble or failures evaluating them and discovering the alteris of original materials and issues in many cases the alteris sure was hidden this completes 7 months of search for tech out nesses here is the list pts handling the first shock which actually began this current search for out tech issues was the discovery that pts conditions were going unhandled across the world and had been for some time pts means potential trouble source and means the person is affected adversely by suppressive in his life pts person can be lot of trouble to himself and to others the condition is not too difficult to handle and to find that all the tech of handling it was in disuse explained why there had been lot of trouble and upset on various lines after great deal of search it was found that pts handling and another rundown the vital information rundown had been restricted only to expanded dianetics thus one would find on pcs programs that they were supposed to go all the way through dianetics and their grades before their pts condition was handled in actual fact person who is pts cannot be audited on anything else until the ptsness has been straightened out this was operating as an effective barrier to cases 275fortunately the technical bulletin volumes were not quite off the press and this one was caught with hcob 27 july 1976 which will be found on page 428 of volume viii the first thing you do for pc in any grade or without grades is handle his ptsness as long as the subject was hot i decided to look further into it to make sure that the actual tech was still available and to get pilot done to verify its use in actual practice since few had had any pts handling for couple of years i initiated pilot project and it was well executed by cs5 the results of this project are found in hcob 20 oct 1976 the outcome of this further research as contained in that hcob was that the person for full handling should be gotten through his ptsness and then should study the complete pack of ptssp checksheet bpl 31 may 71rc so that he knows the full mechanics that had been wrecking his life this is contained in hco pl of 20 oct 1976 while the above named checksheet is quite adequate project is now in progress to collect up all original lrh case supervisor notes cses and handwritten materials on ptsness so that additional issues may be brought out and the checksheet extended the reason for this is that there is sector of nonaudited handling of ptsness which has never been fully released this comes under the heading of additional material and the existing pts material is not only workable but is vital so this scene was rounded up and ptsness is again being handled successfully over the world as an additional note cassette is now being made for general distribution and sale which will soon be released so that pts people can get one and send it or play it to persons antagonistic to their leading better life b org delivery auditing is technical situation the ability to procure auditing has siderable bearing on peoples case progressnaturally it was found that some organizations were slow in delivery and were backlogging which tends to create auditing situation amongst pcs to remedy this backlog the technical secretary of every org was given new statistic value of services delivered this gives an index of the delivery of the org and brings backlogs into view and will serve as means of alleviating auditing situation in the field where it exists as it calls the fact spectacularly to the attention of all management local and international this is hco pl 12 nov 76 along with this another situation came to view which again was matter of other people writing hcobs the director of processing had been given in hcob 16 june 1972r statistic which encouraged him to simply route pcs out of the org once they had completed small part of their processing accordingly the statistic of the director of processing in an org was revised in hcob 16 june 1972ra to the number of pcs routed back into the lines the director of tech services was given stat of getting actions completed on pcs 276with these two stats operating one after the other auditing situation in an area is further alleviated people do not sufficiently consider auditing as the most basic failure of cases it seems so of course that it gets entirely overlooked yet it can cause great deal of trouble c hsdc redo the first inkling that the hubbard standard dianetics course curriculum had gone adrift was noticing that two key drills had been omitted and even cancelled by others even though they were vital to an auditors skill in handling dianetic session these drills were dianetic training drills 101 102 103 and 104 these have to do with student auditors remembering their commands in session making him practiced in using commands while handling his meter and admin training him to use the right command in the right place according to what the pc does and finally training him to use commands and handle the session in spite of any and all distractions or reactions from pc obviously if dianetic auditor cannot do these things he cannot run dianetic session these drills now have been emphatically reinstated in hcob 19 july 1969r reissued 9 dec 1976 they are for use in all dianetic training looking into this further i found that there was new unauthorized dianetics course which supposedly was based on dianetics today being issued which would be sort of competitive course to an hsdc in following this further it was found that even the most fundamental formats of the hsdc which i personally developed and piloted had been grossly alterised that number of persons had been writing hcobs on the subject and that the format had been lost the original hsdc is being gathered together at this time with all instructions cses and drills in the pattern and format which was originally developed and which did make great auditors so you can expect considerable resurgence in the quality of dianetic auditing some time in the future at the same time new course which makes senior dianetic auditor is being put together which is postgraduate step after person has become an hsdc this will take in all the materials found in dianetics today and should cover areas of special dianetic application d rock slams rock slam rs is defined as crazy irregular slashing motion of the needle this particular meter reaction was found to be relatively unknown to auditors on an examination i made of some worksheets they were calling dirty needles dirty reads rocket reads body motion and even ticks as rses they were also missing real rses as the rs is probably the single most important and dangerous read on the meter clarifications of this were in order accordingly i wrote hcob 10 aug 1976 rses what they mean and caused to be written from my notes hcob 1 nov 1974r rock slams and rock slammers for pc to be branded as an rser is very serious thing also for real rser to be overlooked by an auditor is catastrophe both to the pc and to those around that particular person therefore this is very dangerous ground to have wrong 277these issues will help to clarify that at the same time im currently at work on video tape which will be available in academies some time in the future which gives all meter reads meanwhile dont make any mistakes on rses read those bulletins another confusion in this sector was how to define and identify list 1 rser all characteristics given in list issued as hcob 1 nov 74 and signed by another with my name were stated to have to be present before person was list 1 rser the incorrect hcob is on page 344 vol viii of the hcob volumes and will be corrected in later editions list 1 refers to scientology related terminals as found on page 57 of the book of emeter drills the additional characteristics on this list only help to look for list 1 rs i issued hcob 1 nov 1974r revised 30 dec 1976 which now corrects this error list 1 rser is simply one who rses on list 1 sec checking and integrity processing following down the trail of auditors missing rses it was found that sec check ing had become nearly lost art sec checking means unfortunately security checking that it was so named in its origins obscures the fact that confessionals have been part and parcel of religion nearly as long as religion has existed in actual fact the meter simply gets pastor or minister over the very dangerous situation of missing withhold on his parishioner person with missed withhold can become very upset with the person who misses it the meter properly operated makes sure that none are missed in an effort to get around what was thought to be public relations scene the name security checking was changed to integrity processing this was also pr error because the actual truth of the matter is it originated as confessional and should have simply been changed back to handling of confessions this administrative demand of name alteration threw the original issues on sec checking into disuse additionally integrity processing did not include all the tech of sec checking and some even thought they were different subjects the loss of sec checking more properly called confessionals and the failure to use meter to verify withholds resulted in many student blows dropouts and has permitted the continuance of great deal of natter and upset which are simply the result of missing withholds on people when you realize that lot of the trouble of the roman catholic church probably arose through not having meter to verify the completeness of confessionals you can see what the loss of sec checking would do to our own churches and organizations in other words we were about to repeat history all this original sec checking properly confessional tech is being rounded up again and will be issued in checksheet form and there will be courses in the handling of confessionals but even before you receive these you should resume the use of 278this metered tech as it will save you having people mad at you simply because you have missed withholds on them it is highly selfprotective both from the viewpoint of the auditor and the organi zation to have the proper metered handling of confessionals fully in btb 31 aug 1972ra hco confessional procedure clarified the matter but this bulletin was on very limited distribution and is not known it contains the tech i developed on sec checking in the autumn of 72 there should be further confusion in this matter sec checking integrity processing and confessionals are all the exact same procedure and any materials on these subjects is interchangeable under these titles the materials when all recollected and consolidated and reissued will be under the title of confessionals but even before that reaches you you had better determine to become an expert in it since an auditors inability to handle this is fast route to how to win enemies and wrongly influence people f expanded dianetics overhaul expanded dianetics began in development in 1970 it is very fully developed subject however for some reason or another the total materials of expanded dia netics were never packaged and exported even when it was reported that they had been thus auditors who have been trained as expanded dianetics auditors had been denied considerable key materials and have even lost the reason for expanded dianetics contributing to this was the removal of sec checking confessionals materials from the expanded dianetics course to make up the integrity processing rundown thus the course was stripped even further for an expanded dianetics auditor has to be very expert in the handling of confessionals the actual extent of expanded dianetics can be described as follows ex dn consists of all the work i did on psychos and very difficult cases from 1970 forward my cses case histories any tape lectures or notes which includes as well all data known to date on confessionals and all data on ptses the product of the course is an auditor who can handle psychos rsers and any persons evil intentions as well as any ptses that would be the full extent and skill of an expanded dianetics auditor there is considerable data connected with the subject and it is the only data proven workable data man has on the subject of neurosis and psychosis and is the first breakthrough made in this field as to its actual cause this also embraces criminality while we are very far from being in the business of handling psychos not all psychos are in institutions or classified as psychos in this society furthermore pts persons become pts to people who are usually psycho thus this whole scope and breadth of expanded dianetics has to be and is being recompiled and issued furthermore the position of expanded dianetics on the grade and class chart was muddied up actually expanded dianetics can be given after drug rundown after standard dianetics after scientology grades after power after ot iii and at any point upwards after completion of grade ot iii pts rundown can be given without regard to whether the person had had expanded dianetics or not pts rundown can be given anywhere and better had be an auditor is trained on expanded dianetics after he has become an hsdc class iv auditor 279an auditor does not have to be an expanded dianetics auditor in order to deliver pts rundown all he has to do is complete the pts checksheet and should be class iv in order to audit it there are even some portions of the pts checksheet particularly as it would be revised which can be delivered by person who is not trained as an auditor at all but this would be nonaudited handling which consists mainly of coaching the person as to how to handle his scene the complete expanded dianetics tech is as i have said being recompiled issued and gotten back in g word clearing having discovered an executive who had been word cleared by word clearer but who then required more than 4 12 hours to clear the first two pages of the same material when handled by higher classed auditor i investigated the extent of word clearing training and use being out study of the word clearing series was ordered and it was found that there was little concentration on metering and trs these seem to have been slighted because word clearing starts with the phrase i am not auditing you and this apparently has been taken to mean that one didnt have to know his meter and trs in order to word clear hcob 10 january 1977 word clearing series 55 how to win with word clearing is result of this investigation and should be given particular importance another factor was spotted and is handled in board technical bulletin 12 january 1977 revised 16 january 1977 which was issued as result of my having found that word clearers had wrong stat the stat of well done auditing hours would not apply to word clearer their stat is now number of misunderstood words honestly found and fully handled in applicable materials another action is found in hco policy letter 10 january 1977 ethics and word clearing wherein any word clearer who word cleared materials on which misunderstoods have been found at later date shall be summoned to court of ethics the phrase i am not auditing you does not excuse ignorance on the word clearers part of meter or poor command of trs of course this must also include his knowledge of word clearing tech his trs and metering must be excellent the marvelous wins that can be gotten with word clearing had been lost and with this should now be recovered h fn ta position the subject of missing fns floating needles on pcs is very important as pc who has had an fn missed becomes overrun and can be very upset and his case can even be stalled the first instance i ran into of this some years ago had to do with the sensitivity setting on the meter most auditors apparently simply would set sensitivity knob on 5 and leave it there regardless of how the pc advanced and regardless of who they were auditing this would give them extremely wide fns which would hit the pin on one or both sides and hang up as they were unable to keep the needle on set the correct way to go about this is to always set the sensitivity knob by pc can squeeze when the pc squeezes the cans the sensitivity knob should give about third of dial drop more less only in that way can you keep needle on the set mark on the dial otherwise fns get missed some pcs have to go up to 128 32 which is front face meter setting to get such fall on can squeeze and i have just noted pc who had such wide fn swing that the sensitivity had to be set at 1 32 which is about as low as the meter can go without turning off and even then this pc got half dial can squeeze 280fall and so had to be watched very carefully so that fns were not missed i mention this in case it has dropped out again the current discovery which just dropped with clang was that in one interne ship an interne supervisor was using verbal tech which had then spread all over the world to the effect that you must not call an fn an fn unless it were between 2 and 3 on the tone arm dial and that any fn type motion which occurred with the ta above 3 or below 2 could not possibly be called an fn this was his own craziness and he wished it off with bunch of verbal tech on an awful lot of auditors and caused an enormous amount of pcs subsequently to be very unhappy the result and remedy of this is contained in hcob 10 december 1976 which is marked urgent and important it is marked that way because apparently there are very few pcs around right now who havent had fns missed on them this hcob should be very carefully studied however in brief the correct pro cedure for out of range above 3 or below 2 fns is 1 look at the pcs indicators 2 call the fn regardless of its range if the indicators are alright 3 mark down the actual ta position when the fn is indicated 4 handle the false ta at the earliest opportunity when it will not intrude into the current cycle of auditing 5 on any pc you suspect has had his fns disregarded because of false ta you cs for and get run repair and rehab of points in his auditing when fns were missed on him in other words have your sensitivity correct and when an fn occurs outside of the range between 2 and 3 know that it is an fn by the needle motion and by the pc s indicators and call it indicate it and put it down on the worksheet note the actual ta position then before the next session or after you have finished crucial cycle of auditing on the pc in the next several sessions go into the whole subject of his false ta and handle it missing an fn is very cruel on pc because it invalidates his having released the charge on the subject on which he is being audited and tends to tell him that he is not better even though he feels better there is one historic case of an auditor having gotten an fn in the first ten minutes of auditing and then because it occurred slightly above 3 auditing the pc for an additional three hours with the ta climbing the pc unhappy and results being obtained from the processing this sort of thing is pretty gruesome verbal tech is substitute for hcobs i false ta having written the hcob just above telling auditors that they call the fn regardless of where it was providing the pcs indicators were ok and then handle the ta on the pc i found that issues on correcting false ta had been messed up in both hcob 29 feb 1972r revised 23 nov 1973 and its successor hcob 29 feb 1972ra revised 23 apr 1975 careless reading could imply that the false ta checklist was audited on the pc like any other prepared list in other words this idiocy set in that the meter reads were going to be used to divine whether or not the meter knew whether or not the pc was responding properly the list actually is list of things the auditor manually mechanically checks on the pc he does not consult reads and he does not assess anything on the pc he simply personally does checklist and 281this was the checklist it was not assessed to find reading item therefore an auditor trying to correct false ta and get the ta to read between 2 and 3 by using meter to assess the list would never find out what was going on and would be unable to get the meter into that position accordingly hcob 13 jan 1977 was directed to be written and the full and entire checklist to be done by the auditor on the pc recompiled and updated it is being issued as hcob 21 jan 1977 therefore it will now be very easy for an auditor to correct the false ta on pc and he will be able to get the meter tone arm properly between 2 and 3 you know dont you that ta goes up more than division when you start using onehand electrode this is not false ta that you can correct solo auditors using just one hand have their tas riding around 37 and 45 on the tone arm this is not case of false ta it is always checked by using both hands on the cans at the start and end of session but here again false ta can occur if the hands are too dry or too wet or the can size is wrong you shouldnt have very much trouble with this actually its very simple matter but the outnesses in this sector have caused an awful lot of trouble and i was very happy to be able to find the erroneous issues and get it straight for you video which will eventually become available in academies will also cover false ta handling j incomplete auditing folders for some time word clearers sec checkers ethics officers and cramming officers have neglected to include their worksheets in the pcs actual folder this causes considerable difficulty for case supervisor since the person may have wrong lists in why finding may have rsed on sec check may have had incomplete or incorrect word clearing and other tech outnesses in between regular sessions where these folder omissions occur an feser folder error summary maker is often prevented from finding where the case went wrong then there is the matter of folders at all somebody has lost them or mislaid them yet some auditor needs them desperately to find out lists or to actually verify grades attained the preservation and availability of auditing folders to the next auditor or case supervisor years up the track is of very great importance accordingly hco pl 28 oct 1976 and hcob 28 oct 1976 cs series 98 which are both the same equal texts were written by to remedy these very dangerous tech outnesses k falsifying auditor reports along with missing reports it was found that there had been some difficult situa tions created by the falsification of auditing reports from the small matter of saying that the ta was at 30 when actually is at 45 when the fn occurred thus obscuring the fact that false ta had to be handled up to the very large crime of faking the fact that certain processes had been run when they had not just to get completion or bonus and up to falsifying the data or text which the pc gave this matter of false auditor reports can cause enormous amounts of trouble the consequences and detection of the falsification of auditing reports is now contained in hco policy letter 26 oct 1976 issue 1 the same text issued as hcob 26 oct 1976 issue 1 cs series 97 this makes even the minor falsification of an auditing 282report matter of comm ev and if the crime is proven beyond reasonable doubt there can result cancellation of all certificates and awards declare and an expulsion order if you think this is unnecessarily harsh think of the poor pc l checklist for fesers it can happen that pc is taken up into new grades without having completed earlier more basic grades and without being set up for the later grade this can result in somebody going through several grades just to cure mild somatic or ptp it can also throw pc in over his head for long time there have been checklists showing the requirements for most major grades recent instance of pc going all the way through to ot 111 who had not com pleted anything caused to investigate the reasons behind this it was discovered that very few case supervisors ever check folder to find out if the pc has actually made the grades lower than the one that he is about to be put on further check showed that few cses ever looked up the earlier history of the case and this resulted in pcs being put up through levels for which they have not been set up and past levels they have not made further investigation showed that these checklists were not in existence for every grade and action it became obvious that the people who should be using these checklists would be the folder error summary auditors these fesers are the only ones who thoroughly go through the folders and case supervisors depend on them thus if the feser is not required to verify whether the pc has properly attained the level he is about to go onto and if he has been set up for the level then nobody is going to check this over and great many pcs are going to be audited on skipped gradients without setups and will get into difficulty i have ordered that checklists be made up for fesers to use for each major grade so that they can check off the requisites for each grade and thus handle this out gradient situation these checklists are being worked on at this time and will be issued in the near future in the meantime it is the duty of the feser to indicate whether or not the pc has actually reached each grade to which he has attested and whether or not he is properly set up for the grade he is about to be embarked upon m auditor recovery it can happen here and there that an auditor who has been auditing eases off and ceases to audit there are various reasons for this one of the common ones is skipped gradient in his training another one is misunderstood words and the commonest one is overts of omission or commission on the subject of auditing or pcs which have not been handled an lrh ed 176rb int originally issued on 24 april 1972 was unfortunately revised 2 or 3 times by other people and lost its punch i reworked this and restored it to its earlier form on 7 nov 1976 and this is avail able as lrh ed 176rb int the investigation and reissue being assisted by cs7 283it is available in this form and in the near future will be issued as an hcob n study tech during an investigation of pricing i discovered that the student hat had dis appeared from use and in its place had been put an optional basic study manual the fact is that the basic study manual has its own uses and is very valuable but it does not begin to replace the student hat this meant actually that study tech had more or less disappeared in academies and was not in general use the actions taken were to make the student hat mandatory on onetime basis before the next major course person took and to include it free as bonus to the person taking that course the student hat has been restored in totality as requisite for study tech this will make study much more positive and much faster the basic study manual was put forward sometime ago as means of getting staffs hatted on their hat materials and as fast method of getting people reading the materials of their posts i suppose that is how it drifted over onto major courses where it has business thus the student hat is back full force and if there are any blown students around you should realize that the reason for their blow is either lack of study tech or undisclosed overts the thing to do is to get them back and push them through the student hat so they can win at their studies and get their overts off so they can look their fellow man in the eye there has been another training outness found which i will mention in passing in some interneships the entire qual staff of the org has been employed in checking out students actually such checkouts are done by the students themselves on each other where starrates are required in interneships it has also been found that twinning on theory occasionally creeps back in people have not noticed that twinning on theory meaning two students always study together went out many years ago and has been cancelled it makes noisy classroom and prevents students from getting through their courses rapidly twinning on theory sets up too many difficulties such as the loss of ones twin by reason of graduation or transfer being sent to cramming an odd number of people on the course so that one is without twin and so on practical is another matter in practical drilling is done on the twin basis the theory and practical are never in the same room they must be in different rooms the theory room must be very very quiet where student can concentrate and the practical room must be so situated as to allow students to make noise if any academy has noisy theory classroom or if the academy is difficult to study in this is probably what is in violation probably the twinning is going on in theory or the theory rooms are noisy only practical room can be made noisy the two issues putting twinning in on theory have now been revised and can celled they are hcob 26 nov 71 tape course series 10 wcing series 26 handling misunderstood words on

professional rates it was found in some cases that pcs would enroll on courses and then never take them just so they could have professional rates in their auditing this not only denied them the training they paid for but it was also making organizations short of auditors accordingly hco pl 13 nov 1976 was issued which clarified professional rates which makes it necessary for an auditor to be fully classed in the class of that org from which he is seeking service in order to qualify for 50 professional discount in auditing this does not apply to his family whats the matter with becoming an auditor there are 2 or 3 billion pcs out there and only few of us auditors have heart and also lend hand furthermore how do you know what good auditing is unless youre trained p senior case supervisor line it was recently found that the senior case supervisor in at least one large org spent most of his time giving advice to executives on personnel case requirements for the crew this is so far from the duties of snr cs that the hco pl outlining their duties has been rewritten and has become hco pl of 26 sept 1974r revised and reissued 21 jan 1977 which tells snr cs in effect to look after the tech quality in his org there is another modification on snr case supervisors previously it was necessary for someone to go to distant org and become class viii before he could be qualified as the snr case supervisor of an org this is longer necessary hco pl 24 oct 76 issue iii modifies these requirements so that snr case supervisor can be trained by his local org in this same policy letter the award of dean of technology is outlined these would be gold certificate case supervisors they are saint hill special briefing course class viii course auditors who have attained the case level to the class of his org and has uniform record of case supervision this general overhaul of the snr case supervisor and his lines and duties is in effort to correct out tech and establish excellent tech in any org and its area q interneships it was found that very few interneships were now being taught and an investiga tion undertaken by the action aide flag bureau at my orders finally uncovered that interneship checksheets had been added to and added to and stirred about until they had become checksheets within checksheets thus making interneships interminable as result of this special mission was put on the job of reforming interneship checksheets these checksheets have now been issued and exist for every level as board policy letters issued from 10 nov 76 up through bpl 25 nov 76 issue 1 they have been greatly simplified and have made interneships into very worthwhile actions these new simplified interneship checksheets are in full use at this time 285along with this interneship program hco policy letter of 25 oct 1976 has been issued which requires that all past provisional certificates which have not been validated by an interneship and which are one year or more old from the date of course completion are cancelled it states such students should be notified and should be enrolled on the interneship for the class if properly conducted interneship is satis factorily completed their permanent certificate may be reissued all of this is in an effort to get auditors straightened out getting wins and making them really proficient and professional in all areas of the world r illegal pcs it has occasionally happened that an auditor has had pushed off on him by persuasion or pressure cases who should not have been accepted by the org hcob 6 dec 1976 also hco pl 6

22 may 1976 was issued which established the post of staff section officer who was responsible for the training and the processing of staff mem bers to further enforce this the qual divisions of orgs were given new gross divi sional statistic in hco pl of 4 nov 1976 this gave the dominant qual divisional statistic as fully qualified and trained staff members in the org cumulative additionally in hco pl of 10 nov 1976 certain staff courses were made manda tory in orgs so as not to neglect staff cases even when auditors were absent whole new project has been released concerning coaudits this is actually recovery of lost tech there used to be coaudits very successful ones and they had their own special technology tech mission to the uk reassembled the tech and got staff coaudits going with rave wins all of this technology and how it is done has been issued as board technical bulletins dated around early december 1976 under the title of coaudit series both the coaudit tech and group processing fell under the category of lost tech but have been restored polished up and are being issued for full use w unissued rundowns it came to my attention in july of 76 that about 5 years worth of my developments on flag had never been fully packaged up or issued for use the reason for this is that the tech compilations units which had previously worked on this were disbanded in 1972 by the then cs4 and was not reestablished several years worth of intensive research and development are therefore back logged in being issued only one of these areas of development is restricted to flag as it is the famous l series of rundowns which require such technical accuracy that they can only be audited by class xii the rest of the rundowns however are fully capable of being fully compiled from the notes lectures issues and my case supervision notes and released including the repackaging necessary for the hsdc expanded dianetics and reissue of expanded grades all mentioned above there were 9 rundowns in all which were never compiled or exported for that matter the much earlier class vial course was added to and varied and it also is being repackaged in its original form and exported and is now being taught again in advanced orgs the remaining rundowns are being worked on for issue as never having seen the light of day in class iv saint hill and advanced orgs all this is now being done so soon this important new tech will appear and be available in orgs 287x advanced grades for number of years people have wondered when ot viii would be released well to tell you the honest truth ot viii has been in existence all those several years and to it has been added very large number of ot grades none of them have been issued notes for all these grades are in existence what i have been waiting for is 2 or 3 months of free time to go over these materials and write them up and make them available through advanced organizations now i will make bargain with you if you get all the tech straightened out and the orgs and flaps and emergencies off my lines and get your training in and your word clearing in and everything flying and this civilization even more thoroughly pointed in civilized direction you will buy those 3 months worth of time so i will be able to afford the time to write up all these advanced levels i have researched do your job well and buy these three months

section officers jokers and degraders it is an old principle that people who do not understand something occasionally make fun of it recent investigation however into the backgrounds and case condition of small handful of people who were joking about their posts and those around them showed somewhat more sinister scene each of these persons fell into one or more of the following categories 1 were rock slammers some list 1 2 were institutional type cases 3 were ncg meaning case gain the only cause of which is continuous present time overts 4 were severely pts potential trouble source connected to rock slammers it might be supposed that misunderstood word phenomena could also be part of this the rebellious student in universities is usually handled by clearing up his understoods or curing his hopelessness for his future however the investigation did not find that any of these jokers or degraders were acting that way solely because of misunderstood words but the possibility cannot be ruled out the four categories above were however fully verified all the persons investigated were found to be the subject of declining statistics both having them and causing them their areas were enturbulated at least one of the jokers was physically driving basic course students out of an org in some cultural areas wit and humor are looked upon as healthy release however in the case of orgs this was not found to be the case intentional destruction of the org or fellow staff members was the direct purpose therefore all executives hco personnel and case supervisors as well as qual personnel and staff section officers have valuable indicator where they have joker or degrader on their hands they also have one or more of the above four conditions in that person this opens the door to handling such people properly assigned and then fully done conditions are the correct ethics handlings correctly done expanded dianetics which includes confessionals and fully done pts handlings are the case remedies 291where ethics tech itself is not known or neglected and where there are hcos one can of course not expect the matter to be handled and this would be too bad because the case gain and life improvement available in proper ethics handlings when fully followed through can be quite miraculous where rock slammers have been undermining the tech and it is not fully known or used or is altered into unworkability one cannot expect confessionals to be properly done or expanded dianetics to be known and properly applied the joker is advertising his symptoms he is also advertising an area of the org where there is enturbulation and down statistics as well as staff members being vic timized therefore this is an administrative and technical indicator which cannot be overlooked and should be followed up spotted investigated and handled this can be the beginning of an upward spiral for an organization where someone is driving ethics out tech is not likely to go in you have to get in ethics and tech before you can begin to get in admin the next time you as an executive wonder why you are working so hard look for the joker in the deck humor is one thing destroyed

more things than ow although we carelessly call them withholds were asking person to straighten out their interpersonal relationships with another terminal our normal confessional is addressed to the individual versus the society or his family its what people would consider reprehensible that makes withhold in catholic society not having kept mass would be reprehensible action in noncatholic society nobody would think twice about it so most of our confessionals are aimed at transgressions against the mores of the group that is the basic center line of the confessional you can have special mores between the and the mother special mores between the husband and the wife just as you have special mores of course between the auditor and the preclear its moral code that you are processing in one way or the other you are straightening out somebody on moral code the now im supposed tos theyve transgressed on series of now im supposed tos having so trans gressed they are now individuated if their individuation is too obsessive they snap in and become the terminal all of these cycles exist around the idea of the transgression against the now im supposed tos that is what confessional clears up and that is all it clears up its great deal more than withhold you would go straight to persons handling of masses and changes of space on lacking clue in that direction you would go into his most confused motional areas not emotional this fellow has been recluse ever since he was twenty he has not done anything since he was twenty he has never been anyplace since he was twenty his hidden standard is he would get about more could he find himself getting about more he would know that scientology was working you find what area he was in before he was twenty staying in the house is cure for something so you put him on an emeter you cant find areas of moving heavy masses or changes in spaces before he was twenty because he wasnt working it probably lies in the zone of maybe he was in the service maybe he was in boarding school so all of sudden you hit the jackpot and you find an area of considerable activity youre looking for the area of considerable activity which lies prior to the difficulty then you run confessional on that area of activity 297you trace it back to boarding school theres one boarding school that he abso lutely detests he suddenly remembers thats what you do the confessional on every question you ask has to do with this boarding school just add up the factors how many things can go on in boarding school how many people are present what is there in boarding school there are students boys instructors coaches headmasters buildings athletic equipment and probably transport from there to home etc find out all the types of crimes that he might have been able to commit against these items you can dream up whole form one of the ways of doing it is taking an existing confessional form and just moving it over to the zone of the school that is not as satisfactory as just putting down all the things he really did in this school that he is never going to tell anybody it inevitably is going to be an area of tight mores he has cut up against those mores so has individuated himself against the school so he cannot asis any part of the track hes trapped in that particular zone and activity any set of cut sensory perception will operate as overt bait forget is version of not know so that any sensory perceptive cut off is an effort not to know and you have target take everything that youve worked up to right there and now do confessional on it eventually youll get what do you know hes too in the thing to see it you can see it because youre outside of it you write up every noun you could possibly think of on the subject of the zone or dynamic that he is having difficulty with and which he fails to cognite on in any way shape or form you can immediately assume that if he doesnt cognite on that zone or area that hes really pinned down and that he has withholds from you and from the area on the subject of the area that not even he knows cognition is totally dependent upon the freedom to know overts and withholds are dedicated to another thing these are dedicated to not knowingness so if the person doesnt cognite you can immediately assume that he has large area of not knowingness on the subject that he doesnt even suspect you as an outsider to his case can suspect where this fellow is having trouble you dream up confessional to match it the formula for making up confessional is just make up list of all the items you can think of which have anything to do with that target lets say his family hes always had family trouble you can get this from pcs ptps if you look at the type of ptp that the pc has youll know that it is present time problem of long duration if it adds up to three or four times in row of ptps with his family it must be problem of long duration the hottest way to get rid of that particular zone is to do confessional on it again the way to do confessional is to make list of all the nouns and all the doingnesses which you can think of and just ask the person if he has overts against any of them has he done anything to has he interfered with anything about eg have you ever interfered with schooling have you ever done anything to schooling have you ever prevented schooling its little by little that this cognition will take place its not all going to take place in one bang in the long run it will be bang but the bang only took place because you took the pebbles off the top when youve finally got the thing uncoveredhe can look at it and blow it this is the rule any zone or activity with which person is having difficulty in life or has had difficulty with in life is fruitful area for confessional 298you will find out every time hes got withholds in that zone or area one of the indicators of that is present time problem therefore you know its problem of long duration three problems of short duration equals one problem of long duration its good detector mechanism the rule in confessionals is break the problem down to its most fundamental expression then write down those nouns associated with it and those basic doingnesses associated with the fundamental expression and then just phrase your confessional questions on the basis have you ever and any other verb you want to put in have you ever done anything to have you ever prevented you dont have to be fancy as the needles going to fall every time you come close to it any area where person is having difficulty in he is stupid in stupidity is not knowingness this is through overts but the overt has to be hidden so it must be an overt that is withheld so these withholds then add up to stupidity and he of course has trouble there isnt anything complicated in it at all compiled from lrh taped lecture teaching the field sec checks shsbc 6109c26 sh spec 58 approved by l ron hubbard

anyway getting off overts is nothing to such people because they are not there and take responsibility for them everything else is responsiblenot them thus you have to find the trail to the rses on

cease to audit the case at cause and if pts handling is then done you would switch the case over to effect this would be valence shift and would worsen the case this is one of the consequences of not

with expanded dianetics and be home perfectly safe if one sec checked case began expanded dianetics failed to complete it and switched to pts handling the case would be audited out of sequence and

confusion in the field as it apparently has never been written up in an issue it really is simple if you know your laws of l n verifying list the correct procedure for verifyingcorrecting past l ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct then do an l4bra on each list where the item is found to be incorrect you would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item you do not direct the question to see if it read and dont just do an l4bra and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such nulling list one nulls list when he doesnt get bd fn item on listing the laws of l n strictly apply an l4bra would be used if the action bogs with still item found one would also null lists the pc made where item had been found such as 2wc which turned into listing action with the pc giving off items or list the pc somehow made while not on meter in these cases there is item to verify with the pc as correct just cull the items into list work out with the pc what the question was if its not already noted and null the list reconstructing list sometimes you just dont have the list and cant get it or its an old why finding or pts interview for which there are worksheets in this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item probably was already on the list and you dont want the pc to get into newly listing the question in pt and then getting into an overlisting situation just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get bd fn item if you dont get the item that way then you can extend the list selflisting watch it on these as every random stray thought person has about why this or that does not mean its selflist but do look for it on person who is manifesting the horrendous bpc an out list can generate who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the ethics officer just dont get into trying to make list out of some nonstandard listing question that wont give you an item and actually the usual reason for selflisting is prior wrong l n item or an item not found people will selflist to try to find the right item so find and correct the earlier out list list correction blowup when you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get big pc blowup and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you probably are not correcting the list that is out and youd better find out which list 308it is there is usually an earlier out list to be found if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset lists not reading when you start getting key lists such as grades iii and iv not reading and items found its time for that auditor to get thorough overhaul on his metering eyesight and to get off all his mus on l n you also could be setting the pc up for selflisting situation as he has been given the listing question but item has been found so be very sure the question did not read even with suppress and inval and trs were in before getting off key l n process use of l4bra the prepared list l4bra corrects l n lists it can be run on old lists current lists general listing when pc is ill after listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after always suspect that listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the laws of listing and nulling for example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted if this didnt go then an l4bra would be done on the list handling an l4bra you handle reading questions on the l4bra by the directions under the question that read you dont just 2wc these questions for example say question 4 read on the l4bra is list incomplete sf you then ask the pc what list is incomplete locate it and get it completed to bd fn item you dont just 2wc incomplete lists to an fn and leave it at that by the way the l4bra is missing line which is was it the first item on the list this is being added as its quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed do it right an out list can create more concentrated hell with pc than any other single auditing error so its imperative that listing errors get properly corrected the best thing to do is to have the laws of listing and nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later l ron hubbard founder assisted

obtained here from the american heritage dictionary and the scientology tech dictionary before recurring withhold or overt can be handled it must be understood what one is it is simply withhold or overt that has already been gotten off and comes up again as an answer to an apparent reading withhold or overt question the pc may also become exasperated at having to get off an overt or withhold that has already been gotten off the pc may become upset seem resigned or even protest recurring overt or withhold these are just couple of the signs of recurring withhold or overt methods and handlings 1 when pc gets upset with withhold being demanded that they already got off and they get into protest then there is obviously false read as the pc is getting off overts already gotten off handling check for false reads on overts by asking the pc what overt he or she has gotten off more than once and tracing it back with the pc to what auditor or person said something read when it didnt

as some people who give themselves trouble or have trouble dianetics as early as 1950 and 1951 had its successes in this field twenty years of research and experience isolated in 1970 what psychosis really was when expanded dianetics was first issued those who compiled the case histories left many of them out and those they included were not shown as completed this omission gave the impression that one did not finish an expanded dianetics case in the current checksheets this has been repaired upper level auditors in 1973 were using fragments of expanded dianetics along with other processes this has been smoothed out in the present organization of the materials such cases as those who can only be solved by expanded dianetics live difficult lives and are often difficult to manage thus the auditor must be very knowledgeable on these materials and very skilled we can solve such cases but only where people know their business there are far more such cases around than one would suspect the destructiveness of man and his apparent general tendency toward 4th dynamic suicide stems entirely from few of these types in his midst so expanded dianetics actually begins taking form with the first

this one must understand the most severe aberration which is psychosis the actual basis of all psychosis is motive it is not competence or incompetence below all psychotic conduct lies an evil purpose because psychiatry and psychology did not have this single technical fact they defined psychosis as incompetence had the wrong target and so could not and never did understand psychosis and were thereby led into atrocities such as shocks and brain surgery and in the country where these subjects originated germany slaughtered 300000 insane in gas chambers some time before hitler came to power true psychotic can be brilliant or stupid competent or incompetent it is his general motive or purpose that determines whether or not he is insane or sane famous psychotics like napoleon ivan the terrible stalin and hitler were all quite brilliant yet wound up destroying everything in sight including their own people they had destructive basic purpose every psychotic has one it is usually covert hidden but in full play against his unsuspecting friends the sole difference in motive is whether it is destructive or constructive everyone has basic purpose the psychotic has destructive one the test of personality then is whether the result of persons activity is destructive or constructive man is basically good when he finds he is being too destructive he recognizes he is bad for others and seeks to leave he will also try to become less powerful ill or to kill himself the progress of psychosis then begins with belief something is evil this is followed with an effort to stop it this stop becomes general basic purpose is then formed which contains an evil intent the being then goes on from disaster to disaster seeking overtly or covertly to destroy everything around him 313at guess about 15 to 25 of living human beings are psychotic and bring covert disaster to those around them and themselves the evil purpose is expressed by committing harmful acts and withholding them

communication art hcob 3 when work of painting music or other form attains twoway communication it is truly art one occasionally hears an artist being criticized on the basis that his work is too literal or too common but one has rarely if ever heard any definition of literal or common and there are many artists simply hung up on this protesting it also some avantgarde schools go completely over the cliff in avoiding anything literal or commonand indeed go completely out of communication the return flow from the person viewing work would be contribution true art always elicits contribution from those who view or hear or experience it by contribu tion is meant adding to it an illustration is literal in that it tells everything there is to know let us say the illustration is picture of tiger approaching chained girl it does not really matter how well the painting is executed it remains an illustration and it is literal but now let us take small portion out of the scene and enlarge it let us take say the head of the tiger with its baleful eye and snarl suddenly we longer have an illustration it is longer literal and the reason lies in the fact that the viewer can fit this expression into his own concepts ideas or experience he can supply the why of the snarl he can compare the head to someone he knows in short he can contribute to the head the skill with which the head is executed determines the degree of response because the viewer can contribute to the picture it is art in music the hearer can contribute his own emotion or motion and even if the music is only single drum if it elicits contribution of emotion or motion it is truly art that work which delivers everything and gets little or nothing in return is not art the common or overused melody the expected shape or form gets little or contribution from the hearer or viewer that work which is too unclear or too poorly executed may get contribution incidental to this one can ask if photograph can ever be art controversy which has been raging for century or more one could say that it is only difficult to decide because one has to establish how much the photographer has contributed to the reality or literalness in front of his camera how he has interpreted it but really the point is whether or not that photograph elicits contribution from its viewer if it does it is art innovation plays large role in all works which may become art but even this can be overdone originality can be overdone to the point where it is longer within any possible understanding by those viewing or hearing it one can be so original one goes entirely outside the most distant perimeter of agreement with his viewers or listeners sometimes this is done one suspects when one has not spent the labor necessary to execute the work various excuses are assigned such an action the most faulty of which is selfsatisfaction of the artist while it is quite all right to commune with oneself one cannot also then claim that it is art if it communicates with one else and others communication is possible 319the third flow of people talking to one another about work can also be sidered communication and where it occurs is valid contribution as it makes the work known destructive attitudes about work can be considered as refusal to contribute works that are shocking or bizarre to point of eliciting protest may bring to them selves notoriety thereby and may shake things up but when the refusal to contribute is too widespread such works tend to disqualify as art there is also the matter of divided opinion about work some contribute to it some refuse to contribute to it in such cases one must examine who is contributing and who is refusing one can then say that it is work of art to those who contribute to it and that it is not to those who refuse to contribute to it criticism is some sort of index of degree of contribution there are roughly two types of criticism one can be called invalidative criticism the other constructive criticism invalidative criticism is all too prevalent in the arts for there exist such things as individual taste contemporary standards and unfortunately even envy or jealousy too often criticism is simply an individual refusal to contribute one could also state that those who destructively criticize cant do constructive criticism is term which is often used but seldom defined but it has use it could probably be best defined as criticism which indicates better way to do at least in the opinion of the critic those who simply find fault and never suggest practical means of doing it better rather forfeit their right to criticize art is probably the most uncodified and least organized of all fields it therefore acquires to itself the most authorities usually nothing is required of an authority except to say what is right wrong good bad acceptable or unacceptable too often the sole qualification of the authority as in poor teaching of some subjects is memorized list of objects and their creators and dates with some hazy idea of what the work was an authority could considerably improve his status by using rather precise definitions of his terms the modern trend of seeking the significance in what the artist meant is of course not likely to advance the arts very much viewing and experiencing art on the basis of what one is contributing to it and what others contribute to it is workable approach and it would result in improved art and improved appreciation such viewpoint interestingly also includes some things into the field of art not previously so viewed l ron hubbard founder lrhpat copyright 1977 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 320have you lived before this life by l ron hubbard published october 1977 have

new chapters includes rons lecture entitled death originally given on 30 july 1957 both dianetics and scientology were researched by l ron hubbard american writer and philosopher one of the more startling discoveries of dianetics and scientology was that if persons awareness and memory were adequately improved past life memories could be contacted the memories were there in person after person case after case incredible past lives are incredible only to those who dare not confront them says hubbard in others the fact of former existence can be quickly established subjectively thousands and thousands of case histories have proven this out in over quarter of century of research doubters and believers skeptics and scoffers have all discovered hidden memories they never knew existed this discovery has sparked off tremendous amount of public interest over the last 25 years today more and more people are wondering about past and future lives have you lived before this life presents the original discoveries that started it all if past and future lives are reality it calls for reevaluation of many of our current views values and lifestyles this is book which vitally

nov 74 drugs more about it has come to my attention that clarification is needed on hcob lsd years after they have come off of lsd outlined program has been issued on handling the lsd case for purpose of clarification an lsd case is anyone who has ever had lsd and not sweated it out and had full drug rundown including objectives when you are dealing with an lsd case or anyone who has ever taken lsd you cannot and must not consider their drug rundown complete until they have been sweated and given liquids and exercised for months as well as heavily audited they can recover with auditing and this handling but it wont be very fast the sweat program came about because the restim people who have been on lsd experience appears to act like they had just taken more lsd when you audit out any other drug thats the end of it but this isnt true of lsd as it only takes 1millionth of an ounce of lsd to produce drugged condition and because it is basically wheat rust which simply cuts off circulation my original thinking on this over the years was that lsd sticks around in the body that basically is the idea that underlies the sweat program lsd is killer drug and should be labelled as such it was recently found that many exec trainees who were offloaded were lsd cases dont hold somebody off objectives and drug rundown just because he has not had sweat program they can have their objectives and drug rundown and then go on the sweat program that was the way it was originally designed sweat program would be for somebody who couldnt run objectives or drug rundown because of lsd or for use after objectives and drug rundown to get rid of the residual lsd it is the residual lsd were trying to get rid oflsd that may still be in the body its substitute for objectives and drug rundown you must not consider their drug rundown complete until they have completed the sweat program and been heavily audited as the sweat program can be strenuous anyone not in good physical condition is required to see medical doctor in liaison with the medical liaison officer and cs to obtain permission to exercise and do jogging where exercise and jogging would be detrimental to the individuals health this program should not be done and more basic nutritional medical and auditing program done doing this gradiently is very important as you are not only working lsd out of the system but other bodily poisons will also be flushed out if the program is done out gradient the individual can become ill from body changes that he is not able to keep up with 324as sweating depletes the bodys mineral supply extra salt needs to be taken during this program indicators of salt depletion can be clammy skin tiredness weakness headacheperhaps cramps nauseadizziness possible vomiting or possibly fainting at the first sign of any one of these some salt should be taken you can carry salt shaker with you while running too on this program person has to be watched because he will be getting out crystals and could go on tripa real lsd trip from the crystals coming out it is advised that the running jogging portion of this program be done with another person vitamins and minerals the drug bomb in hcob 25 october 71 drugs drying out should be taken three times day in addition the calmag formula in hcob 5 november 74 drugs more about should be taken 2 times day plus teaspoon of salt should be taken daily diet quite reduced food intake is important here to get body fat or just mass of the body decreased so that the residual crystals of lsd that have accumulated can come out if person keeps eating lot the body is going to keep building layers of muscles and be busy with metabolizing new food and chemicals for body energy as opposed to using the fat which has been accumulated this is especially important with the person who has fat as fat has few blood vessels in it circulation in fat is poor so lsd in it will not come out until that actual fat is burnt off the body in addition to reduced food intake it is important to increase liquid intake as it actually flushes the wastes out of the body in this way lsd and other accumulated drugs when released from the cells pass through the body pretty quickly so are not as likely to be reabsorbed natural juices sugar or chemicals added preferably freshly made is the desirable liquid to take and you can take as much as you want two quarts of fluid day is the minimum quantity to take fresh fruits can be eaten to get rid of the hunger feelings one may experience but should not be consumed in excess for example 4 nectarines 12 lb of grapes pear and banana for the day in addition to the fruits satisfying the hunger they also give the body minerals lost through sweating besides fruit and juices some protein should be taken the best source being predigested liquid protein these must be gotten from good health food store as opposed to department store for example progest which is made in new york is very good exercise it is very essential to exercise the major exercise being done is jogging or running exercise increases the circulation throughout the whole body thus carries out cell waste more rapidly and b causes the circulation to go deeper into the muscles and tissues so those areas which have been stagnant can now get rid of the residual crystals which have accumulated in addition to increased circulation exercise especially running causes the body to sweat which will cause the crystals and toxic products in the body to come out through the body pores rubberized nylon sweat suit is essential in running as it will aid sweating this should not be started until the second to third week so that the body can gradiently get used to profuse sweating 325the sweat program 1 the cs in liaison with the medical liaison officer starts the person off on this program 2 as necessary the cs in liaison with the medical liaison officer orders the person to medical exam by medical doctor 3 the medical liaison officer informs the person of the vitamins he or she is to take daily this includes the drug bomb three times day and calmag formula two times day plus at least teaspoon of salt 4 the diet is fruit heavy juices and water and two ounces of liquid protein daily 2 oz of liquid protein daily is the minimum dose 5 the joggingrunning is now started on gradient the minimum exercise time should be an hour day the more time that is put in the more sweating will be done and the program completed all the faster person can gradiently build up joggingwalking until he is solidly up to joggingrunning for the entire hour it is important to set daily goals and try to make them to establish game and purpose to the daily exercise 6 once the drug rundown which is objectives plus dianetics is done the pc may be audited on other actions while continuing with the sweat program lack of sweat program doesnt stop other auditing actions it is factual that drug handling cannot be considered complete on pa who has taken lsd until the sweat program is completed the drug rundown is specific rundown as given in hcobs and is finished as an auditing action when the pc has done all its steps what is not finished apparently is the possible residual lsd and this is handled by sweat out program the lsd and the body are part of the physical universe so do not stop pays auditing after hes done the hcobs steps of drug rundown just because he still has to do sweat out program go on auditing him on other actions but be sure he also completes sweat program sweat program can be done before drd or even objectives but should not hold these up either results the final result is to get the lsd residual crystals out of the body the phenomena that can occur are many on this program one has to be watched because he will be getting out crystals and could go on trip the reactions that one can undergo on this program can vary from anything like actual tripping heavy misemotion somatics turning off and on etc as the program progresses the individual will become more causative in his or her environment confront and responsibility will definitely increase and have lasting effects the individual will become easier to work with and will like and feel more comfortable with himself he will be healthier and more in tune with his body 326at first the individual may feel otherdeterminism about doing this program but that will gradually change and he or she will want to do it for their own welfare their responsibility will come up for themselves and others emotions that have been shut off may start to reappear they can blow through stupidity and become more aware they can do actions more easily consequences start to take on meaning to them and they are aware of the effects that their own actions have on themselves and others the above will vary from individual to individual but in each case there will be great change for the better l ron hubbard founder assisted by paulette cohen

two separate and distinct activities when you confuse the two by failure to fully comprehend their actions and products you end up with overlong courses and overlong interneships fast courses wellrun course is where the student gets the theory through word clearing demos drills and actual practical application of the materials per his checksheet the student is quickly gotten to point where he grasps the simplicity of the fundamentals of the level and can apply them then from the viewpoint of experience with the basics he then rapidly studies the rest of the techniques that comprise the level he can produce competent result this is course graduate fast interneships interneships are not where you learn theory that belongs on the course interne ships are there to add polish to professional level internes by definition train on thejob under skilled supervision they acquire skills by doing not by reading their theory again they audit they cs they supervise they get their errors corrected and they audit cs and supervise some more when they have done this in volume and polished up their rough edges so they can think with their materials without hesitation on what to do they become professionals this is an interneship graduate existing scene all too often it is being found that interneships are being used to teach the course again weeks are being spent restudying the materials for checkouts high crime checkouts which have been done before are being done again high crime checkouts have become everything on level rather than the basics which is not lot of issues for any level the purposes expressed in the 5 qual ok to audit series plus polishing to professional standards the level just studied is the true purpose of interneships any course grad who wore his hat as student should be able to sit down and check out his materials straight off as it is assumed he got it the first time so any attempt to turn an interneship into redo of the original course must be solution to quickied or badly supervised courses the right handling would be to reform your courses and get them straight and require retreads on that course for any who show they missed the materials when on the course 328the remedy the interneships will be streamlined on theory following hcob 28 april 71 okays to audit in hgcs will make good auditors to prevent the interneships from becoming long haul on theory it will now be required that the student pass an exam on the course materials before routing on to the interneship passing grade will be 85 missed questions are handled in cramming any who do not get passing grade must retread the course before being allowed on the interneship should there be too many flunks then comm ev must be requested by the org kot or lrh comm on the orgs executives for neglect and failure to handle the courses summary the theory and routine practical belong on the course if an interneship gets heavily into theory then there must be poor courses and

doing so the pcs thoughts and postulates which were buried in the charge will come off in the form of cognitions when the charge is removed the pc is then able to evaluate and discard these postulates in pt as he sees fit it is also an indicator of full ep as pc who has not gotten the force off an incident is very unlikely to recover the thoughts in the form of cognitions where pc reaches the basic on chain and apparently flattens this but without all parts of full dianetic ep in evidence the auditor can ask the pc if he postulated anything in the basic incident this should complete the full dianetic ep if not the incident hasnt had all the force taken off and should be run through again and continued per standard dianetic tech to full ep in the case of an assist one can ask for the postulate made just prior to the illness or injury where you have full dianetic ep of fn erasure cog and vgis there is need to ask for anything further one does not list for anything one doesnt use

word clearing series 59r word clearing definitions ref word clearing series 54 the question has recently come up of whether you clear each and every definition of word for that word to be word cleared some words have definitions that lead into technical definitions specialized definitions or obsolete definitions so what do you clear when clearing definition of word there is reason under the sun to look up every definition or to even read specialized definitions for word the rule actually is to know the definition of the word as given for the context for which it is being used and thats it you have to look over full definition to find out which definition applies to the text you have been reading there are some words that have 30 or 40 definitionsmost of them highly specialized and of real use in vocabulary so you dont need to look up definitions of word that dont apply you want the definition which applies to the text you have been read ing of course if you are clearing word with word clearing method 1 or method 8 or when the context of the word is not given you would clear each definition excepting technical and specialized definitions which do not apply then you use it in sentences until you have it as concept cleared word has been defined as follows word which has been cleared to the point of full conceptual understanding also you dont look up every word in that definition either you look up words in definition only if you find in the definition another word you dont understand hope this helps to make your word clearing more simple and pleasant task l ron

and erasure i recently took over the csing of case on dianetic assist and found that fns were being neglected as reads this pc had dianetic list listed out that gave an fning item all the other reading items were handled with the exception of this fning item an fning item is reading item an fn is only read when an item fns at the end of you calling it the fn would occur instantly upon calling the item so what does this mean that an fn is read read means theres charge there to handle it means there is force connected with that significance that is available to the pc to view and run an fning item means theres charge there as the fn means something just keyedout so there must be charge there for there to be keyout after all what is keying out you can get four fns off the same item the first one is in finding the item the second one in running recalls the third one is in running secondaries and the fourth one is in running the engrams the basic mechanics of keyout keyin and erasure have to be understood before you can understand why an fn is read and when it would be read an fn also means stop that is it end of process end of rud or end of action being handled to confuse this with an fn being read could be fatal for pc there is substitute to understanding basics when it comes to understanding what an fn is when it means go and when it means stop for that process or action an fning assessment does not mean that the assessment is now all reading this means that the actions have been done and the charge is off that area at least temporarily an instant fn on an item means this item is keying out some charge that can be keyedin again and run which is really what any other read is saying theres charge there to handle this piece of tech can make the difference in

very effective program recent research has given us more data for the program which you should know about overweight people it is important that fat on the body be removed as this is one of the main places that lsd can lodge compared to the rest of the body fat tissue has little circulation in it lsd lodged in fat can stay there for long time underweight people underweight people on strict diet and running can lose more weight than they can afford to lose this could be detrimental to their health on the lsd sweat program regular balanced diet is okay for the thin person the weight should be maintained however refined sugar or flour and their products should not be taken see hcob 3 august 73 pep in this program the increased circulation and exercise is as important as the sweating normal weight people those who start at normal weight and continue to lose weight to the point that their health can be affected should go back to eating wellbalanced meals omitting refined sugar and flour products this should stop the continued weight loss trips if person is having trips during the program he should take lot of extra vitamin b complex and vitamin c as these aid the body especially the liver in getting rid of the lsd which is in the system normally the vitamins in the program are sufficient for the body to handle the lsd which comes out vitamins pure natural plain yoghurt taken with the vitamins will help prevent stomach upsets from taking too many vitamins at once please ensure that your vitamins are not taken on an empty stomach for they can cause stomach burn enteric vitamins are not essential as long as the bomb is taken with food 339shoes the best type of shoes to use for jogging are the ones which are well cushioned in the heel and toe these are quite popular right now for jogging they are available in all different colors and stripes they should be of good quality give arch support be comfortable and be well cushioned especially in the heel this cushioning absorbs the shocks to the body as the heel hits the ground running and jogging go much better with these shoes calmag calcium and magnesium supplements can be taken as substitute for the calmag formula in hcob 5 nov 74 drugs more about just ensure that the full daily requirement of each is taken daily this will prevent muscle soreness from the exercising vegetables green vegetables are okay during the program to get the most benefit from them they should be taken raw or steamed different lettuces tomatoes and cucumbers are fine to take the majority of the food eaten should still be fruit vegetable juices are ok variety should be used throughout the program so that different nutrients and minerals can be gotten from the different vegetable sources protein predigested protein is not the only protein that need be taken it was used on the original program to good effect however there are several good powdered protein supplements on the market check your health food store for data on these be sure to get one with high protein very low carbohydrate content which has all 8 of the essential amino acids the label should state or show that all of the essential amino acids are present salt and potassium salt sodium chloride is not mandatory on the program it is only necessary as treatment if the symptoms of salt depletion heat exhaustion occur these are clammy skin tiredness weakness headache sometimes cramps nausea dizziness sometimes vomiting and fainting as potassium is also lost in sweating some of the above symptoms can come from potassium depletion so if salt does not handle the above symptoms then try either potassium gluconate tablets or salt substitute which is mainly potassium in the program few of the above symptoms occurred when heavy fruit intake was occurring this is due to the fact that there is sodium and potassium in fruit and vegetables consequently supplementing these minerals is not usually necessary if lot of fruit and vegetables are consumed health if person does not feel better during this program after 3 to 4 weeks doctor can be consulted to check for endocrine problems or organ malfunctions as these can sometimes hinder persons progress on the program 340people with known heart conditions and high blood pressure or kidney conditions must do program which is of much lower gradient an exercise program and diet must be worked out with doctor gradient doing this program gradiently is very important here is typical program sequence first of all start jogging wearing the proper shoes the first couple of days just jog 10 minutes dont worry about diet or vitamins or sweat suit just get out and jog the next couple of days jog 15 minutes continue increasing the jogging time gradiently until after 4 weeks you are up to 1 hour if you can get up to one hour running sooner all the better if you can run more than an hour day regularly that is even better the more running and sweating the better if you are so breathless that you cant speak to another while you are running then you are straining too much cut the gradient back you can start taking vitamins anywhere in the first couple of weeks but the best results occur if the vitamins and minerals are taken from the start during the first month of build up you should cut out all sweets especially refined sugars and flours and their products if you are overweight cut down on food quantity in this time at the end of the month meat should be eliminated and fruit and vegetables should be the source of food after 1 month you can start running with the sweat suit you should be running full hour pretty comfortably before you start with the sweat suit sweating when wearing the sweat suit will increase markedly so watch for salt depletion program oddity very occasionally you will come across someone who has undergone extensive exercise and sweating for months and gotten rid of residual lsd when starting on the lsd program further changes occur but there were earlier changes during the earlier sweating and exercise it is not just sweating that is necessary but also the increased circulation from the intensive exercise lsd also has the effect of reducing circulation the point is the case was sweated exercised earlier and did get rid of the lsd this is very occasional phenomenon but has been known to occur ep the evidence that there is more lsd there is that points 1 through 9 in hcob 31 may 77 lsd are longer present the final adjudication of the completion of the lsd sweat program lies with the cs in liaison with the medical liaison officer l ron

engram running by chains it came to my attention the other day that dianetics is being run using the wrong commands and even has some omitted procedure this was quite breakthrough to find as it explains some of the trouble that has been showing up with dianetics throughout the world moving through the incident when pc is first made to run an incident he is given the command to move through the incident to some certain time later on the second run through the pc has been given the command scan through to the end of the incident this second command is incorrect the pc should be made to move through the incident with each run through scanning an incident is another tech entirely and is covered in the early pabs under scanning but when you scan pc during engram running you dont get them back into the incident and couldnt possibly discharge that incident as early as book one i found that you had to return the pc to the incident and move them through and if they bounced then you would command them to return to the incident as that is what you are after so r3r command c is changed to move through the incident returning the pc to the incident it will happen in dianetic running that something in the incident that the pc is running will command them off the incident this is called bouncer the pc just bounces right off the incident the way to handle this is quite simple you simply command the pc to return to the beginning of the incident and to move through the incident commanding the pc to return to the incident will enable you to get the pc to move through it and the force of the incident will come off this is quite an interesting piece of tech that has been known and worked since the advent of book one it unfortunately fell out somewhere along the line and wasnt being used it is now being reinstituted and in fact its use is making tremendous difference in dianetics running right this very minute getting the postulates in the basic incident now and again pc will run dianetics whereby they fn on the basic incident and have vgis but cognition has come off the pc has not fully viewed the postulates in the incident here to obtain full end phenomena when this occurs and you have your fn vgis yet cognition is voiced ask the pc was there something that you postulated in that incident the results will be quite astonishing and the pc will have his or her full end phenomena and that will be it for that chain to not allow pc to fully view the incident that is basic and get all the charge and postulates out of it will leave the case charged up and sooner or later the case will go sour on dianetics 343there may be more than one postulate in the basic incident you as the auditor want to get off the postulates in the basic incident accompanied by fn and vgis this is your dianetic end phenomena when the pc voices the postulate and has the full end phenomena there is need to check further the auditor has to know his hcobs on end phenomenas narrative handling of incidents we just had pc the other day that ran for 25 hours on one incident and when that pc was finished with the incident the results were miraculousa changed person with changed activities in life the old rule applies of it takes as long as it takes is really true with dianetics narrative running or any other dianetics for that matter narrative running can take long time to get the pc through and what you are interested in here is running the incident narrative to erasure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly failure to properly run narrative incident will give the auditor and cs the idea that things dont seem to handle on this case it also gives the pc losses on handling things for himself all that is needed is sufficient running of the narrative incident to its full end phenomena and this will longer be the case as dianetics does work except when it is not applied correctly part of the application of narrative running is to ensure that enough run throughs have occurred so that the incident is fully discharged urgent emphasis emphasis on the proper running of dianetics cannot be stressed enough as it can make the difference between well and happy preclear or one with losses in auditing things not being handled and dianetics getting bad name when in fact it is the only technology ever known to handle the mind dianetics

to repair it resulting in nearly total crash to remedy this i developed the following cramming repair list in subsequent use of it including people who had been miscrammed elsewhere the usage appeared quite miraculous it has been found that faulty quickie or miscramming can result in continual goofs or an apparency of outethics as the person isnt correcting this list covers the basic errors that can occur in cramming it has also been found that cramming officer who has consistent overt products will mess up an area this list is used to correct such cramming this list can be used by an auditor in session who finds the pc has bypassed charge on his past cramming it is also used when bog or impasse occurs during or following cramming action its main use is to clear up an org or area where it is found that one or more cramming officers have been messing it up in such an instance it is applied to every past or present staff member in such an instance particularly its use can result in miraculous resurge of the org or area needless to say it can produce remarkable resurgence in person who has history of being miscrammed the list is done in session by an auditor who has qual ok to

material has existed about assessment of the preclear in new era dianetics dianetic assessment has been summarized and simplified and added to these new era dianetics assessment steps are precise and they will detect and isolate the things that have to be handled to make pc well and happy being it is important to understand what assessment is and what you are attempting to accomplish when doing an assessment if you simply understand that you are trying to find an item that reads well brings in the pcs indicators in which the pc is interested an item which was usefully worded and would run you would have it in new era dianetics several different kinds of assessment are used to get items to run out r3ra on the pc the new era dianetics original assessment items this is the first assessment done in new era dianetics it has been known by various names health form preclear assessment sheet and is now reissued with only minor changes as hcob 24 june 78r new era dianetics series 5r original assessment sheet it contains the pcs physical history and background and gives the auditor and cs picture of the case it is an assessment as it is done on the meter and enables the auditor and cs to see what needs to be handled original item the original item is condition illness accident drug alcohol or medicine etc that has been given by the pc to the auditor this will come from the original assess ment sheet from another new era dianetics rundown or may simply be offered by the pc original items tend to be general in character such as lame or medical condition and are either lacking things you will find on the preassessment list or are too broad to be audited pcs normally give items this way when asked for them on the new era dianetics original assessment sheet ned series 5r preassessment preassessment is new procedure in new era dianetics it is done with prepared preassessment list and determines what categories of somatics are connected to the original item and which of these is the most highly charged it is called the preassessment because it comes before the assessment of the actual item to run out r3ra the item to be run out is now called the running item preassessment is done on the original item with the preassessment list preassessment list 350this is found in new era dianetics series 41 prepared list of categories of somatics which is assessed in connection with the original item the list includes pains sensations feelings emotions attitudes misemotions unconsciousnesses sorenesses compulsions fears aches tirednesses pressures discomforts dislikes numbnesses preassessment item the largest reading item obtained on an assessment of the preassessment list this item is used to get running items listing for running items the auditor now takes the preassessment item and makes list on separate sheet of paper and asks the pc what preassessment item found areis connected with original item found the auditor writes down exactly what the pc says in column and notes the meter reads at the exact moment the pc ends the statement of the running item the result is list called the running item list if the pc gives you an exact feeling feeling scared burning feeling in my ear sharp pain in my toe the feeling is simply run out r3ra quad if it reads and the pc is interested an item which states somatic and is runnable is called running item running items are exactly stated pains sensations feelings emotions attitudes misemotions unconsciousnesses sorenesses compulsions fears aches tirednesses pressures discomforts dislikes numbnesses if the pc gives you general type item like stomach problems drug alcohol medicine medical term or narrative which does not state feeling etc the feelings etc for the item must be found so they can be run the preassessment is done to get running items running item the auditor takes the best reading item on the running item list possibly an lf or an lfbd or an instant fn and checks with the pc are you interested in this item and if so it becomes the running item which you will run by r3ra quad running items are sometimes abruptly volunteered by the pc and if they are within the categories of the assessment list they can be run but be careful of 1 jumping onto some other subject than the original item you are trying to handle or 2 upsetting the pc because you refuse to audit it warning if you go off new era dianetics assessment procedure you will be pot shooting all over case and never finish it all this new era dianetics procedure is leading up to finding running items that will run and resolve the case so the thing you are after in assessment is the running item and it is most accurately obtained as above this is done by taking the original item say stomach problems doing preas sessment on it and with the preassessment item finding running item example stomach problems is the original item preassessment is done and sorenesses is the largest reading item on the preassessment list the auditor then lists for running items using sorenesses and gets dull soreness on my left side this is the running item which will be handled with r3ra quad 351preassessment previous to new era dianetics you would have taken dianetic item such as drug or chronic condition or an accident and you would have asked the pc to give you the attitudes emotions sensations and pains connected to the item i have just developed new procedure on the handling and running of dianetics it is called the preassessment this is how it works 1 the auditor obtains an original item from the pc this will be from drug list the original assessment sheet or other new era dianetics rundown it will be drug condition an illness an accident etc 2 he then preassesses the feelings on the preassessment list to find out which preassessment item is the most highly charged in connection with the original item 3 from the preassessment item the largest reading preassessment list item the auditor can get specific somatics called running items from the pc these running items will be the ones the pc is most interested in 4 the running item found in step 3 is run r3ra quad example the original item is bronchitis the auditor assesses the preassess ment list below by asking the pc are__________connected with bronchitis pains compulsions sensations fears feelings aches emotions tirednesses attitudes pressures misemotions discomforts unconsciousnesses dislikes sorenesses numbnesses he gets an lf on misemotions this is the largest read what misemotions are connected with bronchitis as the pc tells him the auditor takes them down noting meter reads while the pc is giving the items and thats all there is to the preassessment preassessment item this is in turn the largest reading item on the preassessment list above and then subsequently lesser reading items from the same list are taken up with the preassessment item gotten the auditor can list to find the running items example the preassessment item is misemotion the auditor asks what misemotions are connected with bronchitis he writes down all the answers the pc gives him with their reads feeling like i want to give up x worried about my lungs lfbd feeling angry about not breathing f scared to death sf 352the auditor would first run worried about my lungs r3ra quad and then would return to the next best reading item in this case feeling angry about not breathing running item the auditor chooses the largest reading item the pc has given and checks interest for the next chain this is the running item actual auditing having found the running item the auditor then runs it out r3ra quad finding the next running item the auditor has choice of taking lesser reading item from the preassessment list or the running item list or safer do new preassessment on the same original item you dont stop working on the original item until it is gone completely and forever having done preassessment on the same original item you do new running item list take the best read fall lf instant fn and use it as your new running item assessment commands commands for the original assessment sheet of the new era dianetics rundown 1 ask the question on the original assessment sheet write answer and note meter read 2 are preassessment item being called connected with original item being preassessed 3 what largest reading preassessment item are connected with original item 4 are you interested in running largest reading or instantly fning running item found in 3 above 5 go straight into r3ra quad using the item in 4 if the pc is interested handling somatics the preassessment list is designed to locate somatics which the auditor can then handle with r3ra by somatic is meant pain or ache sensation misemotion or even unconscious ness there are thousand different descriptive words that could add up to feeling pain aches dizziness sadness they are all feelings all chains are held together by the general various awarenesses which are named on the preassessment list one generally identified difficulty given by the pc on the original assessment is in actual fact in almost all cases composed of pains sensations feelings emotions attitudes misemotions unconsciousnesses sorenesses compulsions fears aches tirednesses pressures discomforts dislikes and numbnesses as well as one or more postulates it is very possible that any major original assessment item contains 3 or 4 full chains for each one of these hence an auditor really hasnt got prayer of eradicating major original assessment unless he runs 64 or more complete chains thoroughly and accurately some might give up with less and some might require many more 353if you follow the new era dianetics assessment procedure perfectly and flaw lessly well you have every chance of achieving well and happy human being handling narratives narrative is story an account tale for many years narratives were held in disrepute and auditors were sometimes warned against running them the reason for this is that when you try to solve case on narratives alone it takes several thousand hours of auditing however to abandon narratives totally is to abandon some of the most dramatic case changes you can get occasionally the pc will come into session after physically or emotionally painful experience an accident illness loss or great emotional stress running these incidents out narrative erases the psychic trauma the person has undergone and speeds recovery you sometimes find that persons whole life changed around the death of relative or child or divorce or an auto accident or some other similar catastrophe this is usually found and handled in action nine in the hcob 22 june 1978r new era dianetics series 2r new era dianetics full pc program outline when running narrative one is running out the narrative incident narrative needs to be run and run and run on that one incident you are running that incident to erasure and you only go earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly the trick in running narratives is to find the earlier beginning each time the person is moved through it see action nine new era dianetics series 2 condition or circumstance without an incident is not narrative an example of this would be obstruction of justice it would not run as there is not an exact incident hitting cop is narrative feeling sick about cops is not narrative as there is story connected with it but there is somatic running narratives to run narrative item the auditor must first find out exactly what happened with the pc then by asking the pc what shall we call this incident he will have the preclears wording and can run it narrative using the new era dianetics narrative commands one would run narrative item only if it reads well and the pc is interested in running it out narrative handling to its full ep can give miraculous results but it can take long time to get the pc through it full dianetic ep of postulate off which is the erasure fn and vgis must be reached if the pc gives cognition which is not the actual postulate from the incident or doesnt sound like it to the auditor the postulate is asked for narrative assessment commands 1 ask the questions called for on the original assessment sheet 2 note any original items that contain recent losses illnesses accidents upsets or deaths and ask are you interested in handling description of item on the original assessment sheet 3 if the pc signifies that he is go immediately into r3ra narrative 354assessing tone of voice the auditor does the assessing by asking the question as question not as statement of fact to assess the question as statement tends to evaluate and can even invalidate the preclear you can go around asking questions with tape recorder going play it back and you will notice the voice tone rises on question and goes down on statement so the right way to assess the questions would be to have slight upcurve at the end and actually assess it as question assessment is done by the auditor between the pcs bank and the meter there is particular need in dianetic assess ing to look at the pc just note which item has the longest fall or bd the auditor looks at the meter while doing an assessment rote procedure gets heavily in the road of dianetic assessment the pc gives list the auditor doesnt watch the reads and note them then the auditor commonly goes back to assess the list by that time the surface charge is off he should have watched the meter in the first place and taken reads while the pc was originating the item why all this assessing of the finished list of course when you already have list done by another with reads marked on it you have to read it off and mark what reads and using list second time you have to read it off to the pc to see what reads in dianetics one always handles an instant fn first then any lfbd lf f or sf in that order the largest reading items are the ones the pc can most easily confront when the largest reading item is handled go on to the next biggest reading item and so on until all reading items have been handled this same principle applies to all new era dianetics auditing take up the biggest reading areas and handle those first you may find there is something plainly visible that is wrong with the preclear like broken leg yet it may not read at all instead the meter is reading on the pain in his arm you do the standard action of handling the items that the meter reads on in assessing prepared list such as the preassessment list always take up the item which got an instant fn first followed by the next largest read in list like the running items list you continue listing until the pc says thats all or youve got an fn item if you get in trouble right after listing running item list on pc and the pc seems upset and you are not scientology auditor go get scientology auditor class iv fast and have him repair the list for you as it may have become scientology list either through auditor error or inability to read meter or missing read or whatever the laws of listing and nulling always apply to scientology lists and sometimes on rare occasions apply to dianetic list and can on these cases cause trouble listing for running item on the running item list usually doesnt cause trouble as it is already taken from the preassessment list and is not very broad question this and failure to follow new era dianetics assessment and r3ra procedure exactly or failure to actually erase the basic on chain is about all the trouble youd run

and find something that is really real to you look around here and find something you wouldnt mind communicating with look around here and find something you wouldnt mind being around an alteration of the original command because the original command was too steep the pc and auditor are ambulant this process will bite suddenly and bring person up to present time it has been known to crack cases of all objectives this process tends to be the shortest it often ends with very bright cog after only few commands the end phenomena of this process would be person in present time cognition and very

dianetics series i new era dianetics is summary and refinement of dianetics based upon 30 years of experience in the application of the subject in that 30 years i have found much that could improve results if properly applied and in that 30 years many issues have been written by others that were bit altered and some materials have been lost new era dianetics corrects these points also recently i have done additional research and have come up with few breakthroughs in 1950 i said we should build better bridge well in 1978 here is better dianetics section of the bridge oldtimers in dianetics will only approve these upgrades there is invalidation of what they know already to be true but there are refinements about which they are jumping with joy new era dianetics is even more acceptable even more workable i did this review to move dianetics back into the miracles as usual band and the student studying it and the auditor practicing it will find that if he follows its precision drills with precision he will be able to handle life and the spirit as never before of course i cannot claim or guarantee that anyone audited on dianetics or new era dianetics will become cured of illnesses which would best be handled by immediate medical treatment and i cannot promise any pc that all of his undesirable conditions will be eradicated since that depends on the state of training and the accuracy of application by the student the student what does student need to know and do to acquire the skill of dianetic auditor 0 the student needs to have completed the student hat he needs to be able to handle study tech without that his misunderstood words will wipe him out study tech is contained in the student hat the definitions are in the tech and admin dictionaries and standard dictionaries the student must not go by single word he does not know the definition of 1 he should know the background of dianetics as contained in several books on the subject particularly the original thesis and dianetics the modern science of mental health 2 he needs an emeter and must know how to handle it 3 he should have good trs as acquired in tr course 4 he should have good grasp of objective processes both to make him better auditor and to enable him to do full drug rundowns 358objectives are actually scientology processing but if dianetic auditor doesnt know and cannot do them he is dependent on scientology auditor to finish up the drug rundown the training of dianetic auditor in objectives is not as complete as scientology auditors but it is sufficient to enable him to do those objective processes necessary to get person off drugs or to get him in condition to run dianetic processes 5 he should have good grasp of the materials of new era dianetics 6 he should be able to make and assess lists of dianetic items as called for in specific assessments of preclear in order to complete rundowns and preclears 7 he must be able to do tr 101 to 104 flawlessly using the commands of new era dianetics 8 he must know how to do dianetic assists 9 he must be able to assess and handle dianetic repair list and do repair actions 10 he must be able to handle dianetic remedies and all other actions called for in complete dianetic course or processing 11 he needs to be able to apply what he knows if the student can acquire the above skills he will achieve fine results it does not require mile long checksheets to make good dianetic auditor it does require study and hard effective drilling and it requires desire to help oneself and others and really make better bridge and better world by putting it there in terms of faultless application scientology goes on and is above dianetics but dianetics is the solid base of all this research so learn and apply it well l ron

drugs alcohol and medicine person has taken he does not make good case gain person who has been on drugs alcohol or medicine seldom runs any other type of engram seldom goes backtrack well and is subject to somatic emotional and perceptic shutoffs making any other type of dianetic or scientology auditing difficult activity therefore if drugs medicine or alcohol or individual names of them read on the meter on the original assessment sheet they are handled first and foremost note you do not ask the pc for whole track drugs you want only drugs medicine or alcohol he has taken in this lifetime in new era dianetics the drug rundown has five parts 1 the original assess ment in which the names of drugs medicines or alcohol the pc has taken in this lifetime are obtained 2 the running of each reading drug medicine or alcohol narrative r3ra quad 3 the preassessment of each of these and the running by r3ra quad of the items 4 the prior assessment to drugs or alcohol for each 5 the final step of bringing the pc fully into pt and stabilizing him by the running of further objectives sop 8c and op pro by dup 3611 the original assessment this has already been done as action one it may be necessary to get the preclear to add to the list and it is highly possible that he has taken more types of drugs in this lifetime than he remembered at the time the original assessment was done you have to have all drugs medicines and alcohol by their actual names as known to the pc it is not enough to use an item like drugs alcohol or medicine as you will get nowhere they have to be heroin or penicillin or bourbon 2 narrative handling of drugs before any other handling the pc runs out each of the reading drugs medicines or alcohols narrative r3ra quad this is done first 3 the preassessment new era dianetics handling for drugs includes the use of the preassessment list this is new procedure on the handling and running of dianetics previous to this you would ask the pc for attitudes emotions sensations and pains connected with an item instead the preassessment is done it ensures that every somatic is gotten off in connection with whatever you are handling ref hcob 18 jun 78r new

death or other severe changes in persons life such as losses of position or pets or objects it will be found that the persons life changed for the worse at that point the auditor spots these points of change either on the original assessment sheet or by asking the preclear these points are then handled with new era dianetics procedure it will be found that when all such great changes in persons life have been handled the person will experience considerable relief about life ref hcob 3 july 1978r ned series 10r action ten dianetic remediesoptional 362the picture and masses remedy and the past

intensive this is an optional step to be taken if your pc is having any trouble with study it takes up and handles any and all somatics connected with the subject of study student rescue intensive is not run until the pc has been completed up to action eleven as it would interrupt his program because drugs if he has taken any are probable contributory cause to being unable to study also the dianetic student rescue intensive is not substitute for proper word clearing of dianetic scientology and earlier courses and training it does however make the latter much more effective ref hcob 2 jul

so as to be perfected as understanding increased in the research line unfortunately this was taken advantage of by some of questionable intent because there had been changes and perfecting actions they could introduce unworkable changes that would go relatively undetected probably this is the fate of all subjects and why man is in state of high material cultural achievement yet does not have really workable equipment and is in terrible mess surrounded on every hand by failing material culture probably the heaviest hat ive worn in recent years is the recovery of lost dianetic and scientology tech and eradicating and correcting alterations introduced into the subject by others given knowledge of the composition and behavior of the time track engram running by chains is so simple that any auditor begins by overcomplication you almost cant get uncomplicated enough in engram running in teaching people to run engrams in 1949 my chief despair was summed up in one sentence to the group i was instructing all auditors talk too much and thats the first lesson the second lesson is all auditors acknowledge too little instead of cheerily acking what the pc said and saying continue auditors are always asking for more 380data and usually for more data than the pc could ever give example pc i see house here auditor okay how big is it thats not engram running thats just lousy q and the proper action is pc i see house here auditor okay continue the exceptions to this rule are nonexistent this isnt special brand of engram running it is modern engram running it was the first engram running and is the latest and you can put aside any complications in between the rule is acknowledge what the pc says and tell him to continue then theres the matter of being doubtful of control wrong example auditor move to yesterday are you there how do you know its yesterday what do you see that makes you think flunk flunk flunk right example auditor move to the beginning of that incident and tell when you are there pc answers what do you see good another error is failure to take the pcs data you take the pcs data never take his orders early engram running auditor who knew earlier than june 1978 engram running should consider he or she knows how to run engrams routine 3ra is itself it has dependence on earlier methods of running engrams failure to study and learn r3ra because one knows about engram running will cause lot of case failure if you know oldtime engram running there is attempt here to invalidate you or that knowledge or make you wrong in any way those are all ways to run engrams and gave you better grasp on it i only wish to call to your attention that r3ra is not oldtime engram running routine 3ra engram running by chains is designated routine 3ra it is new triumph of simplicity it does not demand visio sonic or other per ception at once by the pc it develops them r3ra revised by steps the first thing the auditor does is to make sure the room and session are set up this means in other words that the room is as comfortable as possible and free from interruptions and distractions that the auditors meter is fully charged and set up and that the auditor has all the administrative supplies he will need for the session prepared correction lists for dianetics must also be included he has the cs for that session the pc is seated in the chair furthest from the door and is asked to pick up the cans the auditor checks that the pc has had enough to eat by doing the metabolism test and also checks that the pc has the correct sensitivity setting by having the pc squeeze 381the cans and adjusting the sensitivity knob so that the needle registers one third of dial fall when squeezing the cans the auditor then starts the session by saying this is the session tone 40 the auditor then puts in the r reality factor with the pc by telling the pc briefly what he is going to do in the session preliminary step establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment ref hcob 18 june 78 new era dianetics series 4 assessment and how to get the item r3ra commands flow 1 step one locate the first incident by the command locate time when you had_____ step two when was it you accept any time or date or approximation the pc gives you do not attempt any dating drill step three move the pc to the incident with the exact command move to that incident this step is omitted if the pc keeps telling you he is there already step four what is the duration of that incident accept any duration the pc gives you or any statement he makes about it do not attempt to meter him more accurate duration step five move the pc to the beginning of the incident with the exact command move to the beginning of that incident and tell when you are there step six ask pc what he or she is looking at with the exact command what do you see if the pcs eyes are open tell the pc first close your eyes acknowledge him quietly for doing so and then give him the command step seven move through that incident to point duration pc said later step eight ask nothing say nothing do nothing except observe the meter or make quiet notes while pc is going through the incident if pc comments before reaching the end say ok continue step nine when the pc reaches the end of the incident say only what happened 382take whatever pc says acknowledge only as needful say nothing else ask nothing else when pc has told little or much and has finished talking give him final acknowledgement if the ta has risen from its position at step 1 the auditor immediately checks for an earlier incident step g if earlier incident he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident step h if the ta is the same or lower he runs the incident through again step in going through an incident the second or successive times one does not ask for date and duration or any description when the pc has told what happened and the auditor has acknowledged move to the beginning of that incident and tell when you are there b move through to the end of that incident c when the pc has done so tell what happened cais that incident erasing or going more solid ta rising means the incident has gone more solid so the question is unnecessary if ta is higher if the incident is erasing go through it again step d if it has gone more solid ask for an earlier incident step g and if earlier incident ask for an earlier beginning step h d return to the beginning of that incident and tell when you are there move through to the end of that incident f tell what happened fais that incident erasing or going more solid ta rising means the incident has gone more solid so the question is unnecessary if ta is higher if the incident is erasing go through it again step d if it has gone more solid ask for an earlier incident step g and if earlier incident ask for an earlier beginning step h gis there an earlier incident when you had exact same somatic continue on down the chain of the same somatic using steps 29 b c d f g h and eye his there an earlier beginning to this incident or does the one we are running start earlier or does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident if not give command d and put the pc through the incident again if there is an earlier beginning give command eye eye go to the new beginning of that incident and tell when you are there followed by b c postulate off equals erasure when it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing after each pass through ask 383has it erased the pc sometimes thinks the incident is erasing but its not erasing so you have to go back to your g h eye followed by 29 aeye in some cases this can happen several times in one chain the postulate coming off is the ep of the chain and means that you have obtained an erasure this will be accompanied by fn and vgis getting the postulate is the important thing even if you get an fn you dont call the fn until youve gotten the postulate at which time you have reached the ep and end off on that chain if the pc says the chain has erased but the postulate made during the time of the incident has not been volunteered by the pa ask did you make postulate at the time of that incident only when the postulate has come off to fn and vgis can one consider that the full ep of dianetic incident or chain has been reached you must recognize what the postulate is when it comes up if you overrun past the postulate you can really mess pc up and he may need extensive repair all youre trying to get off the line is the postulate that is what is keeping the chain there if the pc has given the postulate to fn and vgis that is it you have the ep of that chain going earlier ordinarily one runs an incident through twice steps 19 then ac to unburden it and allow the pa to locate earlier incidents on the chain however the ta rising on step 9 is an indication that there is something earlier if the auditor observes the ta rising he should ask the pc if there is an earlier incident using in the command the exact same somatic or feeling used in step one if there is earlier incident he asks if there is an earlier beginning an auditor should never solidify pays bank by putting him through an incident twice when by observation of the ta it is cear that the incident has gone more solid by the end of the first run through checking for an earlier incident after the first run through if the ta has risen is the solution to this if after the second pass through when you have asked the pc is the incident erasing or going more solid and the pc doesnt know or isnt sure ask for an earlier incident never ask erasingsolid in the middle of an incident bouncers if the pc is out of the session out of the incident bounces from the incident etc you would have to have him or her return to the beginning of the incident and move through the incident returning the pc to the incident as necessary the pc who bounces out of an incident on bouncer has to be put back into the incident and continue running it 384the commands to do this are as soon as you have seen that the pc has bounced give him command d return to the beginning of that incident and tell when you are there followed with f fa flows 2 3 and 0 step one and step g going earlier commands for flows 2 3 and 0 are flow 2 step one locate an incident of your causing another_____ the exact somatic or feeling used in flow 1 step g is there an earlier incident of your causing another_____ the exact somatic or feeling used in flow 1 flow 3 step one locate an incident of others causing others_____ plural of the somatic or feeling used in flow 1 step g is there an earlier incident of others causing others_____plural of the exact somatic or feeling used in flow 1 flow 0 step one locate an incident of you causing yourself_____the exact somatic or feeling used in flow 1 step g is there an earlier incident of you causing yourself_____the exact somatic or feeling used in flow 1 each of these step one and step g commands are run on the full verbatim 19 aeye steps as given herein narrative r3ra narrative item is often run to run out the physical experiences the person has just undergone this could be for example an accident illness an operation or emo tional shock however condition or circumstance without an incident is not narrative its just an incorrect item an example of this would be trying to run the item obstruction of justice it would not run as there is exact incident there narratives are too often just run through once or twice and abandoned this unfortunately leaves the incident still charged and affecting the pc narrative needs to 385be run and run and run on that one incident what you are doing is running the incident narrative to erasure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly most narratives will run out by themselves without going earlier even though it takes very long time but if you want to change somebodys life thats how you can do it when you are running narrative you always add the known incident to the command using the earlier beginning command in running narratives is essential for example if the pc is running out death of somebody closely related to him you will find that the incident actually started when he heard the phone ring then going back earlier to when somebody looked at him peculiarly etc so using the earlier beginning command in narrative running is vital the commands for narrative are flow 1 step one return to the time you______specific incident and tell when you are there steps 29 are followed 3 is omitted as you have already got the pc to the incident by giving him the first command return to the time earlier beginning step h is checked

are run with the same commands as r3ra if they are narrative secondaries they are run with the same commands as narrative r3ra engrams the earlier similar command is is there an earlier similar incident always run narrative incidents triple or quad flow as above auditor knowledge of commands these commands and procedures as given above must be thoroughly drilled with tr 101 102 103 and 104 before any dianetic auditing may be done on pc pcs can be messed up by incorrect and sloppy commands 387speed of commands some pcs run fast and some run slow an auditor must never rush pc or hold him up when he is ready to go on with the next command the auditor must never keep pc waiting for him while he handles his admin or comm lags before giving the next command timing and speed are especially crucial when the auditor gives the command to move through the incident after having told the pc to move to the beginning of the incident with slow command the pc would wind up halfway through the incident before he receives the command to move through it the better an auditor knows his trs his process commands his meter and admin the faster and more accurately he can operate speed is very important especially when auditing fast pcs pc interest in doing r3ra it is necessary that one chooses things the pc is interested in and b one does not force pc to run things he is protesting being run on last incident found if you ask if there is an earlier beginning and you have already checked for an earlier incident and the pc says there is earlier beginning you do not just walk off from the one he was just running you send the pc through it again and it will erase with full end phenomena or the pc will then be able to see an earlier incident and continue with the chain completing chains if you do sloppy r3ra and do one thing after another without getting the full ep of 1 the actual postulate which will be the erasure 2 fn 3 vgis you will get the pc stuck up on the track you complete each chain to full ep as above remembering that when the postulate comes off that is your ep the chain will have blown fns in running dianetics you do not stop at the first sign of an fn you do not call fns during the running dianetics runs only by asking the pc if it is erasing you ignore fns until the postulate has come off to fn and vgis then you call the fn and thats it for that chain blowing by inspection an auditor may occasionally encounter pc who erases chains before he can even tell about them along about step 3 of r3ra the ta blows down the needle fns the pc says its gone and vgis come in this is called blowing by inspection and occurs once in while with fast running pc on light chain if it was basic for that chain and the auditor fails to recognize and handle it the pc will go into another chain or heavy protest 388ending session an r3ra session can be safely ended on completed chain that ended with the full dianetic ep as above stated this doesnt mean the end of all dianetic auditing in the next session another assessment will turn up more unwanted feelings etc ending dianetics dianetics is ended off only when pc has become well and happy and remains that way

rundown action fourteen many chains locks secondaries and engrams are available on any pc but some of them are beyond the pcs reality and ability and some of them are too featherweight to get any case gain this rundown is designed to locate items that can be run r3ra it is called the dianetic prepared assessment rundown earlier assessment done the very earliest assessment 1948 used was what the pc could see when he closed his or her eyes this was then run this was followed by an arbitrary method of assigning necessary incidents to be run such as birth and prenatals the next earliest assessment 1949 was to ask each time for the incident necessary to resolve the case an automaticity known as the file clerk was pended upon impinged on by finger snapping the next period 1951 concerned whole track exploration running whatever you could get to read on meter the next period 1952 concerned overt engrams located by what the pc seemed to be doing physically this ended the dianetic period when engrams were run to clear case variations of these assessments were revived from time to time in dianetic uses culminating in the 5th acc where overt engrams were run with confront and great stress was laid on getting the postulates out of them the meter and shrewd guesses played their part in assessments significance and story content have bearing on the rightness or wrongness of chain selected they are entirely incidental to judging the correctness of chain 1 the first action of this rd is to assess the following list infirmity ________ sickness ________ being unwell ________ bad feelings ________ unpleasant feelings ________ disagreeable feelings ________ 396soreness ________ panic ________ hurting ________ apprehension ________ ailment ________ qualms ________ complaint ________ alarm ________ malady ________ timidity ________ disorder ________ physical disabilities ________ damaged body parts ________ casualty ________ hurt body parts ________ distress ________ disabled body parts ________ bodily affliction ________ skin irritation ________ defective body parts ________ skin disorder ________ allergies ________ unwanted feelings ________ relatives ________ dental problems ________ jobs ________ an unwanted body condition ________ environment ________ unwanted states of the body ________ this area ________ an unwanted manner ________ upsets ________ depression ________

change either on the original assessment sheet or by asking the preclear these points are then run narrative r3ra quad if the narrative r3ra quad does not clean it up fully one goes to the pre assessment step of new era dianetics series 4r and carries on from there but do not do this until the narrative is fully handled in running such incidents narrative it will be found that the clue to erasure lies in locating earlier beginnings each time the pc has been moved through the incident it will be found that the pc finds earlier and earlier moments when he received the information that then built up to catastrophe this can even go back to dream or telepathic awareness or premonition that the incident was going to occur narrative erasures often depend utterly on finding after each run through if there was any earlier beginning if the incident starts to grind change of ta or content despite having re peatedly searched for an earlier beginning only then do you go into an earlier narrative incident but do so with caution as most narratives expertly run will erase all by them selves and running chain of deaths for instance can go back an awfully long way when all such great changes in persons life have been found and erased the person should experience considerable sense of relief about life if he does not then treat the narrative even though handled as narrative as an original item and preassess it to find other running items connected with it and treat it with r3ra full handling also do this if the narrative grinds and there is trouble going earlier narrative

done gives the auditor and the cs an indication of the actual improvement additionally the pcs memory will have improved if youve done good job of auditing so we reassess the original assessment sheet and handle any additional items which come up in assessing this list the second time mark second original assessment across the top of the sheet it is important to give your pc an rfactor at this stage so hell not feel invalidated by doing this form again let him know that you will be asking him questions from the original assessment sheet for the purpose of picking up any new items which he may now remember and to make sure youve handled all the charge on the items you have already taken up ask him to answer each question as fully as he can even if he has already given the information in

simply means that the pc is running well an auditor running r3ra is not looking for fns he is looking for total complete erasure of the basic of chain in running r3ra one has to consult the pc this is part of r3ra commands an fn can occur five or more engrams before basic is reached you just go on with r3ra only when the pc says the engram has totally erased when he has cog nited is vgis and the postulate in the basic has come off do you consider the chain complete the emeter will have been fning for some time when the full end phenomena of dianetic chain is obtained the needle will of course be fning the fn simply broadens the auditor does not call fns when running dianetics until the ful ep of the chain is reached 1 when it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing after each pass through the auditor asks has it erased 2 the meter will have been fning for some time 3 when the pc has stated that it has erased the auditor should also expect cognition volunteered by the pc 4 the auditor should expect to see very good indicators vgis 5 if postulate made during the time of the incident has come off and been volunteered by the pc the auditor should ask did you make postulate at the time of that incident note that the postulate may have come off in the form of cognition and on the other hand may not have even though cognition was given only when these latter steps have occurred can one consider that the ep of dianetic incident or chain has been obtained power fns fns are disregarded in power each power process has its own end phenomena and is ended only when that is obtained lrhlfg l ron hubbard copyright g 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 403hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

because you ask for earlier beginnings or earlier similars because the thetans mind where pictures are concerned parallels the time track late things hang up where earlier like things exist for some reason best known to thetans you have to get the earlier like thing before you can erase the later like thing this is built into r3ra but what isnt built in is preventing the pc giving or the auditor choosing an after the fact running item an after the fact running item is one which clearly has an earlier thing before it yet by its very wording prohibits reaching the earlier thing example of an after the fact running item repression now clearly something had to happen before in order to have something repress the pc dutifully begins to run feeling repressed but what happened that caused it is not part of the item so he is forced to run late in the incident example feeling blue about hospitals this will find him in hospitals but will avoid letting him run what put him there the item is

made assessment questions into statements of fact which of course is cousin to evaluation downcurve at the end of an assessment question contributes to making it statement questions should go up at the end remedy for this is to record ordinary conversation ask some normal questions and make some normal statements and you will find that the voice tone rises on question and goes down on statement assessing with statements tone of voice instead of questioning tone of voice results in evaluation for the pc the pc feels accused or evaluated for rather than assessed and an auditor can get lot of

remedies dianetic remedies the remedies given here will handle pcs who go anaten or dope off in session even though they are well rested beforehand they will also handle high tas caused by chains left in restimulation by reason of not taking them to full dianetic ep word clearing one of the beginning pcs first steps in auditing is thorough and complete csi this is given as action seven on new era dianetics series 2 full pc program outline it must be done until the pc well understands the commands of r3ra and knows what is expected of him as pc ref hcob 9 jul 78 dianetic csi do not attempt to run r3ra on pc who is not properly indoctrinated clear the commands clear the list words and clear the procedures with him it is the auditors responsibility to ensure the pc understands the commands and the procedure he is being run on so the first remedy given here is word clearing pc who does not under stand r3ra commands assessment procedures etc will only restimulate masses in dianetic sessions he will not be able to erase them if there is any doubt that your pc understands the commands and procedures of r3ra you clear these up immediately there are uniformly two things that prevent pcs from running engrams they are the failure to fully clear all the commands and procedures of r3ra as we have covered above and unhandled drugs hence the following remedies are to be done in their correct sequence on the pcs dianetic program after full and complete drug handling per new era dianetics series 99 drug handling ref new era dianetics series 2 full pc program outline pictures or masses the following remedy is ordered by the cs when the pc has misunderstood words but still goes anaten in session even when assessment and r3ra procedure are correctly done and the pc has had sufficient sleep with unflat chains evident by folder inspection but has very high or low ta the auditor asks what pictures or masses have you touched on in life or in auditing that have been left unhandled the most obvious remedy is simply to take the best reading picture that was left unflat in auditing and simply finish the chain if the pc had only run it single flow at the time then finish it single flow for certain and check the other flows to see if they read and run them if they do the question one checks is step one narrative or step one regular r3ra one uses narrative when it is simply an incident and regular r3ra when he remembers what somatic he was running at the time 433the essence of this is simply to complete something that was already started and wasnt completed if it was picture which simply appeared in life one can treat it as an original item per the assessment hcob and carry on from there caution should be observed in running pc on quad who hitherto had only been run on single or triple flows one can get onto the subject of bypassed charge when he suddenly runs new flow like flow 0 that has never been run before on new item what happens is the pc audited on single or triple on other items in previous auditing collides with some of the unrun charge of previously unhandled chains of that flow and can get quite upset the best handling of this sort of thing is called quading up pc as contained in hcob 7 march 71r use of quadruple dianetics masses are handled simply by treating them as an original item as in the assess ment hcob in pictures or masses remedies one is best off following new era dianetics series 4 just treat the picture or mass as an original item therefore when the pc gives you list of pictures or masses that have been touched on in life or auditing he is really giving you list of original items so far as handling is concerned the auditor takes the best reading item from that list and does preassessment on it areis preassessment item connected with item is the preassessment question the auditor then follows the procedure outlined in hcob 18 june 1978 new era dianetics series 4 doing full preassessment and runs out r3ra quad all reading items with pc interest when this action is correctly performed the ta of the pc will be back in range and the pc will be bright automaticity of pictures there are some pcs who keep talking about this huge automaticity of pictures coming in faster and faster they also dope off in session and they are somewhat hard to get an fn on the thing which is really wrong with the pc is instability he cant hold things still cs could order hco training bulletin of 6 feb 1957 technical volume iii hold it still objectives are also indicated particularly scs as the pc cant control things after flattening objectives it will be found that the pcs bank is more stable as the multipictures may also have keyed something in cs after objectives are flat could order the following ask the pc what pictures have you seen in life or auditing and treat the best reading items in the resulting list as original items handling them per new era dianetics series 4 the phenomenon of automatic pictures is also called an avalanche and data on it is available in the technical bulletins volume ii page 39 volume viii page 106 the above section is the best handling 434overts when the pc goes anaten in session but there is evidence of unflat chains the cs issues this cs assess for overts on unconscious people overts on anaten people overts on asleep people overts on sick people run each reading item with interest r3ra narrative quad running f2 first the cs could vary the assessment list adding items if necessary in accordance with what the pc was motivating from imaginary incidents sometimes pc cannot confront the actual incidents that are keyedin by life or auditing such pc will not go backtrack in this case the running of imaginary incidents is quite productive sometimes the preclear will run them quite astonishingly with somatics but he is not being required to face any reality about them and the auditor is not insisting that any reality exists concerning them in surprisingly high percentage of times however he will be running actual incidents so long as he does not have to admit that these incidents are actual he can do something about them it should be understood that amount of imaginary incidents can supplant the running of real incidents the first value that this technique hasthe invitation to the preclear to run avowedly imaginary incidents in his pastis to build up the preclears confidence in the auditor the preclear begins to feel that he will not be censured for indulging in fantasy when the preclear discovers that he has an auditor who not only will listen to imagination but who encourages it the affinity level rises and the preclears ability to differentiate in terms of reality will itself rise the auditor must never after the incident has been run then insist that the incident was real this would be break of faith he and the preclear have entered into contract that what is being run is pure imagination and the auditor must not break his contract to run imaginary incidents the auditor discusses with the pc how they will be running imaginary incidents and gets the pcs agreement to do so the auditor then asks what imaginary incidents or pictures have you touched on all the pcs responses to this question with their meter reads are noted by the auditor he then takes up the best reading incident or picture and runs it out r3ra narrative quad first checking interest lesser reading items are then taken up this action is done until the pc is brighter and more able to confront actual incidents as they come up

beginning auditor working knowledge of the subject of havingness havingness i that which permits the experience of mass and pressure 2 the feeling that one owns or possesses 3 can be simply defined as arc with the environment 6 the ability to duplicate that which one perceives or to be willing to create duplication of it 8 havingness is the concept of being able to reach or not being prevented from reaching 4 that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pcs attention from the technical dictionary the above are all valid but the final definition of havingness can be simply stated as havingness is the concept of being able to reach hav ingness is the concept of not being able to reach inherent in the ability to reach is the willingness and ability to duplicate that which makes communication work in processes is the duplication part of the com munication formula axiom 28 amended the position of being on the tone scale is determined by his ability to reach and thus his willingness and ability to duplicate to communicate and experience the lower the tone of the being the less willing he is to reach communicate with and experience his present time environment and the less willing he is to reach and dupli cate events of the past or permit them to happen again this is remedied by objective havingness processes these are processes that deal with observing and touching objects in the auditing room or in the environment they are look around or physical contact processes used to remedy low or havingness condition thus we find the pcs havingness process early on in auditing and use it to gain or remedy havingness before or after processes or at session end 439finding and running the pcs havingness process the preclears havingness

youve tested is the having ness process for the preclear and may be used to remedy his havingness as necessary 4 if the process tightens the needle during the test dont use it dont bridge off just get off the process now and test the next process or the next continuing until you find havingness process that does loosen the needle and gives wider swing one will be found among the list of havingness processes on hcob 6 oct 60r 5 the correct havingness process selected is then run 10 to 12 commands at time usually just before ending off session pcs havingness process can change as the pc changes with auditing if at some point in the auditing the havingness process which has been being used fails to get the desired result simply retest for new havingness process find one that works and use it even the right havingness process if run too much at one time more than 10 or 20 commands will start running the bank it doesnt harm the preclear but that isnt its use as there are other processes

meaning of commands clear each word of each command with the preclear using the dictionary if necessary this has long been standard procedure you want pc set up to run smoothly knowing what is expected of him and understanding exactly the question being asked or the command being given misunderstood word or auditing command can waste hours of auditing time and keep whole case from moving thus this preliminary step to running process or procedure for the first time is vital the rules of clearing commands are 1 under circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the pc and tell him what the word or command means 2 always have the necessary and good dictionaries in the auditing room with you this would include the tech dictionary the admin dictionary good english dictionary and good nondinky dictionary in the pcs native language for foreign language case where the pcs native language is not english you will also need dual dictionary for that language and english example english word apple is looked up in englishfrench dictionary and pomme is found now look in the french dictionary to define pomme so for the foreign language case two dictionaries are needed 1 english to foreign language 2 foreign language itself 3 have the pc on the cans throughout the clearing of the words and commands 4 clear the command or question or list item backwards by first clearing in turn each word in the command in backwards sequence example to clear the command do fish swim clear swim first then fish then do this prevents the pc starting to run the process by himself while you are still clearing the words 4424a note fns obtained on clearing the words does not mean the process has been run 5 next clear the command itself auditor asks the pc what does this command mean to you if it is evident from the pcs answer that he has misunderstood word as it is used in the context of the command reclear the obvious word or words using the dictionary b have him use each word in sentence until he has it the worst fault is the pc using new set of words in place of the actual word and answering the alterised word not the word itself see hcob 10 mar 65 words understood goofs c reclear the command d if necessary repeat steps b and c above to make sure he understands the command 5a note that word reads when clearing command an assessment question or listing question does not mean the

the l1c or other correction list have not been cleared yet dont clear first go ahead and assess the list to handle the charge otherwise its auditing over an arc break in this case you just verify by asking afterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list 443all the words of the l1c or other correction list would then be cleared thoroughly at the first opportunityper your css instructions 10 do

definitions and patter ref hcob 15 aug 69 flying ruds note this bulletin in way summarizes all the data there is to be known about arc breaks ptps and missed withholds or handling rudiments there is wealth of technology and data on these subjects contained throughout the technical volumes and in scientology books which the student auditor will need as he progresses up the levels rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session for auditing to take place at all the pc must be in session which means 1 willing to talk to the auditor 2 interested in own case that is all you want to accomplish with rudiments you want to set up the case to run by getting the rudiments in not use the rudiments to run the case arc breaks present time problems and withholds all keep session from occur ring it is elementary auditing knowledge that auditing over the top of an arc break can reduce graph hang the pc up in sessions or worsen his case and that in the presence of ptps overts and missed withholds restimulated undisclosed overt gains can occur thus these are the rudiments we are most concerned with getting in at the beginning of session so that auditing with gains can occur getting the fn if you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release if rud doesnt fn then there is an earlier or an earlier or an earlier lock which is preventing it from fning thus we have the procedure and the rule if rud reads you always take it earlier similar until it fns the question used is is there an earlier similar arc break or problem or missed withhold if at the beginning of session the rudiments are in the needle is floating and the pc is vgis the auditor goes directly into the major actions of the session if not the auditor must fly rud or ruds as ordered by the cs 445arc breaks arc word from the initial letters of affinity reality and communication which together equate to understanding arc break sudden drop or cutting of ones affinity reality or communication with someone or something upsets with people or things come about because of lessening or sundering of affinity reality communication or understanding while the earlier similar rule fully applies to arc breaks there is an additional action taken in handling arc breaks that enables the pc to spot precisely what happened that resulted in the upset an arc break is called thatan arc breakinstead of an upset because if one discovers which of the three points of understanding have been cut one can bring about rapid recovery in the persons state of mind you never audit over the top of an arc break and you never audit an arc break itself they cannot be audited but they can be assessed to locate which of the basic elements of arc the charge is on thus to handle an arc break you assess affinity reality communication and understanding to find which of these points the break occurred on having determined that you assess the item found or r or c or u against the expanded cdei scale curious desired enforced inhibited and refused ref hcob 13 oct 59 dei expanded scale scientology s8 the book of basics and hcob 18 sep 67 corrected 4474 scales with this assessment the actual bypassed charge can be located and indicated even more accurately thus enabling the pc to blow it the assessment is done on every arc break as you go earlier similar until the rudiment is in with fn and vgis the first rudiment question is 1 do you have an arc break 2 if there is an arc break get the data on it briefly 3 find out by assessment which point the arc break occurred on was that break in affinity reality communication understanding you assess it once and get the read or the largest read on say communi cation 4 check it with the pc was that break in communication if he says rehandle if yes let him tell you about it if he wishes then give it to him by indicating it ie id like to indicate that was break in communication provided the right item has been gotten the pc will brighten up even if ever so slightly on the very first assessment note on step 4 the pc may originate yes i guess it was communication but to its really more like break in reality for example the wise auditor then acknowledges and indicates it was break in reality 4465 taking the item found in step 4 above assess it against the cdei scale was it curious about communication desired enforced inhibited refused 6 as in steps 3 and 4 above assess it once get the item and check it with the pc was it desired communication if rehandle if yes indicate it 7 if fn at this point you follow it earlier with the question is there an earlier similar arc break 8 get the earlier similar arc break get in arcu cdeinr indicate if fn repeat step 7 continuing to go earlier always using arcu cdeinr until you get an fn when you get the fn and vgis you have it present time problem problem conflict arising from two opposing intentions its one thing versus another thing an intentioncounterintention that worries the preclear present time problem special problem that exists in the physical universe now on which the pc has his attention fixed any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited violation of in sessionness occurs when the pcs attention is fixed on some concern that is right now in the physical universe the pcs attention is over there not on his case if the auditor overlooks and doesnt handle the ptp then the pc is never in session grows agitated arc breaks and gains are made because he is not in session the second rudiment question is 1 do you have present time problem 2 if there is ptp have the pc tell you about it 3 if fn take it earlier with the question is there an earlier similar problem 4 get the earlier problem and if fn follow it earlier similar earlier simi lar earlier similar to fn 447missed withholds overt act an intentionally committed harmful act committed in an effort to solve problem an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics that thing which you do which you arent willing to have happen to you withhold an undisclosed harmful contrasurvival act something the pc did that he isnt talking about missed withhold an undisclosed contrasurvival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed this is withhold which another person nearly found out about leaving the person with the withhold in state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not the pc with missed withhold will not be honestly willing to talk to the auditor and therefore not in session until the missed withhold is pulled missing withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of an arc break missed withhold is observable by any of the following pc not making progress pc critical of nattery or angry at the auditor refusing to talk to the auditor not desirous of being audited boiling off exhausted foggy at session end dropped havingness telling others the auditor is good demanding redress of wrongs critical of scien tology or organizations or people of scientology lack of auditing results dissemination failures ref hcob 3 may 62 arc breaks missed withholds the auditor must not overlook any manifestations of missed withhold thus if the pc has missed withhold you get it get all of it using the system described below and use the same system on each earlier similar missed withhold until you get the fn the third rudiment question is 1 has withhold been missed 2 if you get missed withhold find out what was it b when was it c is that all of the withhold d who missed it what did heshe do

revisions in this type style more on drugs drug users are apparently sitting on the idea that if youre numb nothing can hurt you and its probably defense against the physical universe thats probably why objectives pull them out of it drugs are an impression of fear on the physical universe and what it might do to person that is why objectives work it reassures them they arent going to get bit thats the ambition of the drug culture there are several more sensible ways of handling the same problem the first of these is exteriorization one exteriorizes before the impact yet drugs often make it impossible to exteriorize second way is to simply control the nerves so they dont transmit third is not to be in such protest against pain as it increases the intensity of the thing it is fact that pain is sort of havingness and if person is processed on wasting and having pain he finds it is just another sensation and he can have it and doesnt need these other remedies and that it is not that much of problem there are other unwanted sensations that drugs block off but there is whole sector of desirable sensations and drugs block off all sensations in spite of the prop aganda to the contrary even sexual sensation is blocked off with drugs and this is true even after drugs have apparently heightened it for one or two times after that it is dead dead dead the only brief that can be held out for drugs is that they give short quick oblivion from immediate agony and permit the handling of person to effect repair but even then this is applicable to persons who have other system to handle their pain dexterity ability and alertness are the main things that prevent getting into painful situations and primary target of these all vanish with drugs so drugs set you up to get into situations which are truly disastrous and keep you that way one has choice between being dead with drugs or being alive without them drugs rob life of the sensations and joys which are the only

person with the use of something the action or result of giving assistance or advantage work done duty performed computation that aberrated evaluation and postulate that one must be in certain state in order to succeed service facsimile the service facsimile is that computation generated by the preclear not the bank to make self right and others wrong to dominate or escape domination and enhance own survival and injure that of others note that it is computation not doingness beingness or havingness we could call this service computation but we will maintain the term we have used to describe this phenomenon throughout the technology service facsimile it is computation that the pc adopted when in an extreme situation he felt endangered by something but could not itsa it it is called service facsimile because he uses it it is of service to him aberration anybodys aberration on any subject has been of some use to them at some time or other you can trace it back its been of some use otherwise they wouldnt keep mocking it up but now if you put it up against survival standards youd find it very nonsurvival the pc adopted this because he couldnt stand the confusion in situation so he adopted safe solution safe solution is always adopted as retreat from the environmental restimulation he adopted safe solution in that instance and he survived his safe solution became his stable datum he has hung onto it ever since it is the computation the fixed idea he uses to handle life his service facsimile 456how the service facsimile becomes fixed an idea is the thing most easily substituted for thetan an idea doesnt have any mass connected with it basically and it appears to have some wisdom in it so its very easily substituted for thetan thus the idea the stable datum he has adopted is substituted for the thetan how does this stable datum become so fixed it gets fixed and more and more firmly as time goes on by the confusion it is supposed to handle but doesnt the stable datum was adopted in lieu of inspection the person ceased to inspect he fell back from inspecting he fell back from living he put the datum there to substitute for his own observation and his own coping with life and at that moment he started an accumulation of confusion that which is not confronted and inspected tends to persist thus in the absence of his own confronting mass collects the stable datum forbids inspection its an automatic solution its safe it solves everything he longer has to inspect to solve so he never anises the mass he gets caught in the middle of the mass and it collects more and more confusion and his ability to inspect becomes less and less the more he isnt confronting the less he can confront this becomes dwindling spiral so the thing he has adopted to handle his environment for him is the thing which reduces his ability to handle his environment those things which do not respond to routine auditing that routine auditing wont change are rooted in this mechanism therefore it is important to find the idea on which he is so fixed pull the fixed idea and you free the individual for broader perimeter of inspection in service fac handling the reason you get tone arm action when the fixed idea has been pulled is that the confusion which has been amassed and dammed up for so long is now running off rightwrong dominate and survive right and wrong are the tools of survival in order to survive you have to be right there is level at which true rightness is analytical and there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical or comprehensible when it drops below that point its aberration the point you degenerate from survive to succumb is the point you recognize you are wrong that is the beginning of succumb the moment one becomes worried about his own survival he enters into the necessity to dominate in order to survive it goes the insistence upon survival followed by the necessity to dominate followed then by the necessity to be right these postulates go downhill so you get an aberrated rightness or wrongness the game of domination consists of making the other fellow wrong in order to be right that is the essence of the service facsimile the reason the service facsimile isnt rational is because you have aaas along the whole line coming down the line it works itself back and forth in an aberrated aaa if the individual is surviving he must be right and people will defend the most fantastic wrongnesses on the basis they are being right in pt and at any point along the track the fellow is trying to be right trying to be right trying to be right whatever hes doing hes trying to be right in order to survive 457you have to be right more than youre wrong so you get the obsession to be right in order to survive the lie is that he cant do anything else except survive it isnt that trying to be right is wrongits obsessively being right about some thing thats obviously wrong thats when the individual is longer able to select his own course of behaviour when he is obsessively following courses of behaviour which are uninspected in order to be right there is nothing sane about service facsimile there is rationality to it the computation does not fit the incident or event occurring it simply enforces exaggerates and destroys freedom of choice over the exercise of ability to be happy or powerful or normal or active it destroys power destroys freedom of choice wherever that zone or area is youll see the individual worsening he is on dwindling spiral but he himself is generating it the intention to be right is the strongest intention in the universe above it you have the effort to dominate and above that you have the effort to survive these things are strong but were talking here about mental activity thinking activity an intentional activity survivalthat just happens dominationthat just happens those are not intended things but you get down along the level of intended and its right or wrong the strongest intention in the universe it is always an aberrated solution it always exists in pt and is part of the environment of the pc hes generating it its his solution overwhelmed as he is by it he is still generating it its aberrated because its an uninspected solution and it is something that everyone unintentionally or otherwise is telling the pc is wrong and causing him to assert that it is right the perfect solution when he first got hold of it but now it monitors his life its living his life for him and it doesnt even vaguely begin to take care of his life that is the anatomy of the service facsimile you are going to find these on any pc you audit service facsimile is the clue the key to pcs case the route to succumb which he blindly asserts is his route to survival and every pc has more than one of these fortunately we have the tech to salvage him we are the only ones who do l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

anatomy of the service fac and the rightwrong dominate and survive computations that enter into it and when one understands that an rs always means hidden evil intention and that the total reason for an rs is to make wrong in order to get someone to succumb they have to be wrong way back up there the idea preceding the service fac was right really right then it came down bit and was method of survival and then it was method of dominating and then it was method of being right in order to make others wrong and in that contest one got enough overts so that the communication line took switcheroo what was right about it is now wrong about it and what was once wrong is now right aaa enters into the situation where rightness becomes wrongness all of his overts get piled up on one of these fixed ideas or what we call service facsimile it isnt actually facsimile at all its the guy himself keeping facsimiles in restimulation because he knows whats best the person himself is generating the fixed idea it is not the bank it isnt what aberration the individual is dramatizing its what aberration does the individual dredge up in order to make somebody wrong it isnt the accidental thing you think it is its intended the intention is to be right and make others wrong to dominate others and escape domination oneself to aid own survival and hinder the survival of others that is the service facblood brother to the hidden evil intention that is behind the rock slam this does not mean you will necessarily see rses on every service fac you run it does mean that where pc is rsing in an area you have an area of heavy severe service fac know when you see an rs that the individual is in the grip of an evil intention which he himself is generating he intends that area or subject on which he is rsing nothing but harm calculatingly covertly he will go to great lengths to carry his intentions out at all times carefully concealing the fact the evil intention is not limited to terminals hes not rsing on terminal hes rsing on the evil intention the evil intention can associate with many terminals 461the rs dominates the individual it is the person he has been overwhelmed by it in that area he has ability to reason he has freedom to choose the evil intention is substituted for livingness it is his safe solution to life his service facsimile the service fac does not respond to ordinary auditing because in the course of ordinary auditing it does not get inspected it by its nature forbids inspection but when addressed at the rightwrong level the pc gives it up easily because in that area he has power of choice more than one service fac per pc we have had for many years service fac processing with which to handle these obsessions and thus to handle the person who rses but it is not just finding one service facsimile you find many service facs which then add up to the big one at saint hill in the mid60s this was commonly associated with rses it was what the pc had done with the service fac to make others wrong which was important not just finding it early on the tech included auditing them out with dianetics and you found many many more than one on each pc we used to get complete character changes with this the full tech on this has been submerged over the past several years it is probably this omission of requiring several service facs to be run and then auditing them out with dianetics that has resulted in so many rsers going on up undetected as of this writing the full tech has been exhumed and we have now new era dianetics tech to help strip these packages down and take them apart at their basics so we not only have more thorough means of handling service facs than ever beforewe also have more reliable route to the handling of an rser but its more than one service fac per pc you may audit off one two or three apparent service facsimiles that all answer up to the complete description of service fac and they will run but all are actually leaning on the central service fac that is in restimulation in pt as you take these lesser service facs off the central one comes to view on the first ones you find the most you can hope for is you found something that blew the ta down and moved you closer to finding the main service fac so you take them if youve found service fac the needle will be looser and the ta in reasonable range and it will run on the rightwrong etc brackets and the pc will get off automaticities when youve finally found several and walked it all the way through to the service fac its as if all the other service facs youve been peeling off are like the bands of trees and sod that lie up against the mountain peak so you take the service facsimiles and run them as you find them you unburden the cliffs

only with any dianetics steps deleted as they are not to be run on dianetics ________ we are into new echelon of service facsimile running at saint hill in the mid60s many many service facs were found on each pc and the earliest service fac running included the use of dianetics this was later omitted from service fac procedure and service facs were handled solely with scientology tech by running off the automaticities on the computation to cognition fn and vgis in the pc phenomenal gains and case changes were made on pcs with that tech aloneall of them valid that tech has been retained as vital action to service fac handling now with the advent of new era dianetics service fac handling has been re stored to its full technology new era dianetics has opened the door to more complete and finite handling of service fac with precision and exactness than we have had heretofore we longer just find service fac audit off the automaticities key it out and forget it we audit it out fully and terminatedly using new era dianetics to take it down to its basics and erase those this in way contradicts the fact that there were many pcs who with service fac found and the automaticities taken off were able to actually then blow the service fac computation upon inspection 463what it does make possible is the actual erasure of service fac and its residuals on every pc one for one and not just one service facsimile per pc but many an auditor who has been trained on service fac running prior to this bulletin will need the tech he already has plus an excellent command of new era dianetics tech if he has not done the new era dianetics course it will be required before attempting to run routine 3sca class iv auditor who has already done the new era dianetics course need only review it in order to be able to handle all the steps of the new full service fac procedure service facsimile handling revised by steps before you can run flows on service facsimile you must first find it you want the pcs service facsimile you dont find service facsimile by listing for it on flows you find the pcs service facsimile and run it on the flows the sequence is you list for the pcs service fac find it run the automaticities off it then you run the service fac itself on r3ra engram running by chains it is run to basic and full dianetic end phenomena you dont leave service fac until you have taken it apart and blown it at its very roots then you list for another service fac using different listing question and handle it fully and another and another pc can have many many service facsimiles you peel them off until you find the main service fac at the core of the case and you handle that one fully as you do the others per the steps above needless to say you are going to see some remarkable results full service facsimile procedure preliminary steps 0a put in the r reality factor with the pc telling him briefly what is going to be done in the session 0b clear computation very thoroughly with the pc use the tech dictionary hcob 23 aug 66 service facsimile and any other reference you feel the pc may need have him demo it until you are certain he fully understands it 0c clear the bracket commands rightwrong dominate survivalfirst using birds fly as sample service facsimile clearing the bracket commands is done at this point so you will be able to use these questions immediately when the service fac is found without putting stops on the pcs first rush of automaticities coming off 0d then clear the listing question steps of the procedure list and null for the pcs service fac using the question in this lifetime what do you use to make others wrong you want bd fn item that is computation not doingness beingness or havingness when you get it indicate the item then indicate the fn then despite the bd fn go on to the next step of the handling 464b run the service fac found in 1 on the brackets 1 in this lifetime how would service fac make you right 2 in this lifetime how would service fac make others wrong 3 in this lifetime how would service fac help you escape domination 4 in this lifetime how would service fac help you to dominate others 5 in this lifetime how would service fac aid your survival 6 in this lifetime how would service fac hinder the survival of others these are run as follows give the pc the first question in this lifetime how would service fac make you right and let him run with it he will have rush of answers answers coming too fast to be said easily at this stage dont repeat the question unless the pc needs it just let him answer 1111111 he may give you as many as 50 answers until he comes to cognition or runs out of answers or inadvertently answers question 2 then switch to question 2 in this lifetime how would service fac make others wrong treat this the same way ie let him answer 22222222 until he cognites or runs out of answers or starts to answer question 1 then switch back to question 1 same handling back to question 2 same handling as long as pc has answers coming easily upon cognition and fn acknowledge indicate the fn and end off on 1 and 2 now give him question 3 in this lifetime how would service fac help you escape domination and let it run by the same method as above when this seems cooled off use question 4 in this lifetime how would service fac help you to dominate others use questions 3 and 4 as above as long as pc has answers coming easily upon cognition and fn acknowledge indicate the fn and go on to the next bracket using the same method as above give him question 5 in this lifetime how would service fac aid your survival when hes run out on 555555 switch to question 6 in this lifetime how would service fac hinder the survival of others use questions 5 and 6 as above as long as pc has answers coming easily let him get off all the automaticities and come to cognition and fn acknowledge and indicate the fn at this point it is safe to end off on running the brackets the idea is not to beat the process to death the pc will have automaticities coming off thick and fast early in the run these must be gone and the pc bright fning and vgis when you end off you are only trying to end the compulsive character of the service facsimile found and get it off automatic and get the pc to see it better at this stage not to bleed the process of every bit of ta action running the service fac in the brackets will result in major cognition which could occur at any point during this running when it does occur it is the ep of this step of the service fac handling end off and go onto the r3ra step note in running dianetic clear on service facs you would end off running this service fac at this point when the pc had reached good cognition fn and vgis do not run the dianetic actions of service fac handling on dianetic clear as these pcs are not to be run on dianetics when you have completed one service fac on steps and b you can then list for another service fac and repeat the procedure 465note if the service fac found on any pc did not run on the brackets it would need to be prepchecked see sections when running off the auto maticity and when to prepcheck below c run the service fac r3ra quad each flow to ep it is not run narrative and it is not preassessed otherwise full new era dianetics tech is used per hcob 26 june 78r ii new era dianetics series 6 routine 3ra engram running by chains the service fac phrase itself is used as the running item the commands for running service fac on r3ra quad flows are flow 1 locate time when you used service fac example locate time when you used all horses sleep in beds flow 2 locate an incident of your causing another to use service fac flow 3 locate an incident of others causing others to use service fac flow 0 locate an incident of you causing yourself to use service fac take each flow down its chain of incidents to the basic and full dianetic ep fn postulate postulate off erasure and vgis that will be the end of all vestiges of that service fac d list for another service fac on the pc using the listing question in this lifetime what do you use to dominate others when you have the service fac repeat steps b and c above find another service fac on the pc with the listing question in this lifetime what do you use to aid your own survival handle the service fac per steps b and c above f continue to find and handle service facs on the pc using in order the following listing questions 1 in this lifetime what do you use to make yourself right 2 in this lifetime what do you use to escape domination 3 in this lifetime what do you use to hinder the survival of others further listing questions which can be used are given on hcob 30 nov 66 assessment for service facsimiles you will need to find and handle several service facsimiles on the pc which will then add up to the big one when listing for the service facsimile you are listing for bd fn item write down each computation the pc gives you exactly as he states it verbatim with its read matter how improbable non sequitur or inane it may sound 466the service fac operates like magnet as youre listing youve given the pc the question and as the question is in the vicinity of the service fac youve already ticked it it draws the pcs attention to it hes listing along and suddenly hell put non sequitur item on the list it doesnt make sense it doesnt even answer the question but there it is because his attention is being pulled to this inevitably youre asking him for answers and he gives you the rightest answer he knowspeople always jump off the empire state building thats the solution that solves everything it blows the ta down thats the service fac indicate the item to the pc then indicate the fn youre now ready to run it in the brackets when running off the automaticity if youve found service fac the pc wont be able to stay out of it i guarantee you the first question is always how would it make him right never how would it make him wrong never never never the automaticities should start with the first question if not ask him how it would make others wrong you almost always enter it at the level of rightwrong but dont make the blunder of thinking it cant be service fac if it doesnt enter at that level try it on the other levels it can enter at the level of dominate it might enter at the level of survival but ifon one of thosethe pc doesnt immediately jump in and swim into the whirlpool its not it if he tells you well lets see make right hmmmm or escape domination doesnt make sense thats not it if he says that isnt it then that isnt it dont hang him with wrong service fac because its too easy to find right one they abound if he hasnt jumped in and swum madly to the center of the whirlpool and gotten embroiled in this thing its not it because thats the first thing they want to do with service facdrown when you have the right one youll get the automaticities coming off thick and fast dont stop the avalanche with acknowledgements dont stop it with new question let it run out its not one auditing question for one answer its one auditing question for one waterfall when to prepcheck when the item found as service fac wont run on any of the brackets you prepcheck it to ep fn cog vgis ref hcob 14 march 71r fn everything rightnesswrongness computation doesnt surrender to normal auditing because it is service fac the pc has vested interest in holding onto it he wont be able to itsa it on prepcheck thus service fac if present will turn on mass on prepcheck the prepcheck is series of types of decisions thetans make about things so if it doesnt prepcheck the prepcheck must be in conflict with the rightness and wrongness reversely if its not service fac it will prepcheck and you polish it off by that method to ep then go back to the list and find service fac that will run 467completing service facsimile handling with r3ra even when the pc has gotten off the automaticities has cognited and is compara tively free of the compulsive character of the service facsimile there is more to be handled running the service fac using r3ra enables him to run out what he has done with it to make others wrong etc these will be the actual most charged incidents in which hes used it which will have accumulated in his wake as he went along substi tuting the service fac for himself and never inspecting the consequences he will now be free to inspect those parts of the track as himself and to inspect as well the effects of the service fac on the other flows finally the use of r3ra engram running by chains enables him to fully erase the somatics and engram chains which have their roots in the service fac or vice versa as well as the postulates underlying them ending service fac running service fac running can be ended off when you have fully run many service facs which will lead to the main service fac when the main service fac has been run to full ep service fac handling is complete note it might happen rarely that you get the main service fac on the pc on your first listing and nulling it will be rare because the main one does not usually come to view until the others have been taken off you run it of course any service fac run produces change but on this one you will see the pc changing character before your eyes the results are quite astounding but realize that he does have other lesser service facs which do not simply dissolve because the main core service fac is now gone even though they have been leaning upon it you will need to ln for these and completely clean the pc of service facs the main core service facsimile will be the one the pc has used as solution to all of life when found and run it will be unmistakable to both the pc and the auditor when this one has been completed on all the steps above as well as the lesser service facs surrounding it you will have attained the ep on service fac running you will have brought about complete character change in the individual returned his freedom of choice and his freedom to inspect and enabled him to be truly right and that is the stuff of which sanity is made this level is actually the sanity level l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 468hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

prepchecks the correct procedure for handling an arc break uncovered during prep check is contained herein modern repetitive prepchecking prepchecking in varying forms has been with us since the early sixties and has quite long history which is available in the saint hill special briefing course tapes and the tech volumes the latest form of prepchecking repetitive prepchecking has been used by many with very good results for quite some time it is simple and very workable process which can be widely used since there has been comprehensive bulletin on modern repetitive prepcheck ing i thought i would describe and clarify it for you _________ there are 20 prepcheck buttons which are used in the following order suppressed evaluated in validated careful of didnt reveal notised suggested mistake been made protested anxious about decided withdrawn from reached ignored stated helped altered revealed asserted agreed with virtually any charged subject or area can be prepchecked the buttons are used to take charge off the subject question is formed around each of the buttons and each question is run repetitively to fn cog vgis the button is prefaced with the subject on going to school on auditing etc or with time limiter since last august since your last session etc both subject and time limiter can be used thorough use of the prepcheck buttons will blow the charge from that item 469the only time prepchecking cannot be done is while running dianetics to do so mushes up engrams the question has to be tailored to the button so we have subject or time limiter has anything been button or subject or time limiter is there anything you have been button or subject or time limiter is there anything you button in the case of the button mistake been made the command would be subject or time limiter has button the procedure 0 if this is the pays first prepcheck or if it has not been previously cleared fully clear the definitions of each of the prepcheck buttons with the pc clear the prepcheck questions and go over the procedure with him so that he understands how it will be run 1 clear the subject or time limiter you will be using 2 let the pc know you will be checking the first question on the meter on has anything been suppressed or appropriate variation depending on the use of the time limiter or subject if the question does not read instantly leave it and go on to the next prepcheck question you do not run unreading questions so theres sense in sitting there waiting for the pc to rummage around for an answer when the meter shows there is charge on the question in the first place if the question reads go right into it and run it repetitively to fn cog vgis 3 check the next prepcheck button on has anything been evaluated if reading take to fn cog vgis per the above procedure 4 handle each prepcheck button until you have reached the ep of big win major cog on the subject or regained ability accompanied by an fn and vgis in some cases you may have to prepcheck all the buttons before the ep is reached but be alert recognize the ep dont overrun there is need when the pc runs out of answers to recheck the question the question has already read so you just run it repetitively to fn cog vgis if the pc insists hes out of answers it may be that an out rudiment or some situation requiring tr 4 or other handling has cropped up find out whats going on and handle do not just abandon the prepcheck button because it does not now read take it to its ep when prepcheck uncovers an arc break you handle the arc break with arcu cdeinr to fn the arc break thus handled that is the ep for that prepcheck button you then go on to the next button and check it prepchecks are very effective method for releasing charge and provide much relief and theyre very simple to do especially in their most modern form so just study up drill it well and do it with your pc youll have fine results lrhmfkjm l ron hubbard copyright 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all

cses earlier than there is supervisors when you go past the postulate or insist on an earlier similar when there isnt one the pc can go later or jump chains and put into action other phenomena this and bad assessment is when you get tangled cases and repair overrun of basic when you get blowdown and the pc tells you the postulate and then you tell him to return to the beginning of the incident again you can overrun the incident and turn the analytical concept of it back into solid picture which will just get more and more solid and youll think there was nothing erased what youre erasing actually is the basic postulate that made the chain occur in the first place overrun of nonbasic in engram running by chains when you demand pc go through the incident more than twice and it is not basic that incident will grow more solid good dianetic auditor watches his ta and the moment that ta starts to rise while running an incident on the chain he knows there is an earlier similar incident it is told to him by the ta which is saying this incident is getting more solid when he sees this he immediately asks for an earlier incident after either step 9 or step c of r3ra when you ask for earlier beginnings and then run the incident again and keep doing this you can run nonbasic through several times and it will inevitably become more solid the degree that this can exert pressure on pc is very great and is extremely uncomfortable really smooth dianetic auditor never increases the solidity of the bank it is nondetermined point whether an earlier beginning alone will if found decrease the solidity of nonbasic amount of ta scientology auditor works for amount of ta out of process dianetic auditor works for the eradication of chain the dianetic auditor could get lots of ta if he overran every nonbasic engram but it is this that he does not want the dianetic auditor is not concerned with the amount of ta that he gets ta has to go up before it goes down in running an engram chain if you let nonbasic engram raise the ta more than thousandth of an inch at step 9 or step c and do not immediately ask for an earlier incident you goofed as you will make the pcs bank more solid scientology audits by the amount of ta the most expert dianetic auditor audits with minimum of ta 474assessments lousy job of assessment trying to run unreading items will find the pc going into

important courses all auditors cses r3ra engram running by chains and narrative r3ra an additional difference since the release of new era dianetics i have been keeping close eye on the running of ned on an extensive basis pcs have been experiencing tremendous and quite amazing gains and resolving areas of their cases which have never before been handled so fully this new and more precise dianetics tech can and is changing the lives of many across the planet when this tech was researched and developed i wanted to get it into your hands immediately now that it is in broad use there is wealth of data coming in on its application and the use of the new commands and handling of eps from this i have located point where ned as originally issued could go wrong on some pcs where earlier dianetics did not as it has always been my practice to provide you with the most accurate proven and workable tech as it is developed and as ned is more powerful tech than any earlier dianetics it is important that you have this data the point referred to above is on the auditor asking for earlier beginning or earlier incident the basic stable datum is and always has been ta up even slightly at the end of pcs run through the incident something earlier the something earlier could be an earlier incident or an earlier beginning to the incident being run there is slight difference between the way these two are handled in r3ra engram running by chains and r3ra narrative running because of what the auditor is trying to accomplish with each the difference is in the order of importance of earlier beginning and earlier incident r3ra engram running by chains in r3ra engram running by chains you are following down and erasing somatic chain here in almost all cases an earlier incident on the chain takes precedence over an earlier beginning to the incident being run therefore if the ta is even slightly up at the end of the pcs run through an incident on the chain the auditor asks first for an earlier incident and if there is none or none the pc can yet see he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident being run where you find an earlier beginning to an incident on the chain that is not the basic incident you rerun that incident only once more through from the earlier beginning to the end of the incident if ta does not come down on that run through theres an earlier incident 476the whole point being made here is that on engram running by chains you always want the earlier incident as soon as that is available thus you ask for the earlier incident first then if necessary for an earlier beginning r3ra narrative running in r3ra narrative running you are handling one single narrative incident such as an accident physically or emotionally painful experience an illness loss or period of great emotional stress which is not ordinarily part of chain you are running that one incident many many times through to erasure the clue to erasure of narrative incident lies in locating earlier beginnings to the incident it will be found that the pc finds earlier and earlier moments when he was told or had an awareness that the incident was going to occur thus in running r3ra narrative it is the earlier beginning that takes prece dence and that is what the auditor asks for after each run through narrative incident only if the incident starts to grind change of content etc after having repeatedly searched for an earlier beginning would you ask for an earlier similar narrative incident this data on earlier beginning is new breakthrough on narrative incident running and erasure and the ned auditor should fully understand it and the tech on which this additional difference between the two procedures is based as pointed out in other issues erasure of the somatic chain or the narrative incident occurs when the postulate is obtained and it is vital that the auditor not go beyond that new era dianetics series 6 and 7 have been revised to incorporate this difference in earlier incident and earlier beginning handlings i wanted you to have the full and exact data on why these commands are being slightly revised this should make for even smoother running of new era

erasure the ep of dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off the postulate is what holds the chain in place release the postulate the chain blows thats it you must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it note the vgis call the fn and end off auditing on that chain even if you get an fn as the incident is erasing you dont call it until youve gotten the postulate 1 when it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing after each pass through the auditor asks has the incident erased 2 when the pc has stated that it has erased the auditor should also expect postulate to be volunteered by the pc 3 if the pc says the incident has erased but postulate made during the time of the incident has come off and been volunteered by the pc the auditor should ask did you make postulate at the time of that incident note that the postulate will usually come off in the form of cognition however the pc may give cognition which does not contain postulate if this is the case simply ask did you make postulate at the time of that incident 4 the pc does not have to state that the incident has erased once he has given up the postulate the chain has blown you will have an fn and vgis this is full dianetic ep now you call the fn do not call fns until you have reached the ep you must learn to recognize postulate when you hear one it is vitally impor tant skill as postulates can be confused with bouncers and denyers when they are in respect similar and require totally different handlings women are good is an obvious postulate thats the way men are is postulate i cant stay here is bouncer i cant remember this is denyer to push pc earlier after he has given the postulate is severe invalidation of the erasure and you will soon have the pc believing that nothing erases anyway to cause pc to search for further earlier incidents on chain which is longer there will get him into some very serious overrun he may pull in another flow

breakthroughs this year has so far resulted in technical breakthroughs from one end of the grade chart to the other each of these is the result of years of research and in recent months one major discovery has led to another with great rapidity and astounding success on research line one sometimes hits pay dirt this time i struck pure gold not once but several times and we now have new major grades and rundowns at both ends of the bridge new era dianetics has already been released and is internationally reported to be working fabulously well producing 80 more gain an attempt to run ned on an ot resulted in phenomenon which caught my attention and on further investigation brought to light the fact that you cannot run ned or any dianetics for that matter on clear dianetic or scientology clear or above research into this paid off handsomely with fantastic breakthrough for clears and ots i have now developed an entirely new rundown called ned for ots this deals with living lightning the very stuff of life itself run exactly correctly by the book it produces remarkable results in the ot band and has made it possible for to now release ot viii ned for ots is highly confidential rundown done by class iv ot iii auditor called an advanced courses specialist acs who is specially trained on its rundown and techniques it is now forbidden to run ned on clears or above from grade vi to ot iii is the noninterference zone during which nothing should be run persons in this zone should move on up to ot iii so that they may be audited on ned for ots this rundown will be delivered in aos and flag to ot iiis and above clears and ots who have paid for ned will now receive ned for ots which in the pilot auditing produced results beyond their wildest dreams while much of it is confidential i can tell you that the first step of ned for ots is designed to raise perceptions especially theta perception and as for the rest of the rundown surprise surprise surprise ot viii although ot viii has been researched earlier i knew there was something that had to be handled before i could release ot viii ned for ots does just that and now i am very pleased to announce the release of ot viii which will be available at aos and flag to ots who have completed ned for ots it is solo level which will fortify an ot already in excellent shape from ned for ots end of endless drug rundowns these breakthroughs at the ot level suddenly brought to view the reason why drug rundowns become endless when they do and gave the way to resolve this now the drug rundown will be comparatively short action and many many scientologists will be able to make much faster progress up the bridge if you have had 482an endless drug rundown you can now look forward to getting it completed with ease and get on to your grades and ot levels in this druggie culture in which we live it is very timely discovery because now we can undo the mindcrippling effects of drugs psychiatrists gift to mankind with great ease and with complete rehabilitation of the individual in few intensives of auditing the end of endless drug rundowns has been incorporated into ned and will be available in all orgs by ned auditors as soon as they are trained on it which will be in about 2 weeks trainingfast courses all these new techniques require auditors and cses fully trained and specialists in that level to audit and cs them it is forbidden for any auditor or cs to run any of these without being properly trained and certified it is therefore just as well that i overhauled the training route earlier this year resulting in fast training we might even say the end of endless training today it takes 4 weeks or less to train ned auditor the checksheet and course for training class iv ot iii auditors advanced courses specialists who will deliver ned for ots is also fast but accurate training level so we are able to train auditors and cses rapidly to deliver these fabulous rundowns and thus make them available to you very soon i have always said that as soon as i make technical discoveries i will get them to you as fast as i can and i am doing that now i appreciate your support and help which makes it possible for to do this research for you 1978 is the year of technical breakthroughs there have been more this year than in any other year so far i am delighted to be

and universes if you keep pushing it you can always find more drugs on the track what youre interested in is this lifetime and this body this doesnt mean you dont run track on the drug rd just dont push it dont ask for whole track drugs when you list out the drugs pc has taken you only want the ones he has taken this lifetime the steps of the drug rd have been rearranged to prevent this endless running and allow the rundown to be taken to flat point of freedom from the harmful effects of this lifetime drugs and an fning drug list objectives are run on the pc each drug is run narrative

october 1978 remimeo cancels hcob 8 apr 78 an fn is read reissued to delete an incorrect reference an instant fn is read ref hcob 2 nov 68r case supervisor class viii the basic processes hcob 20 feb 70 floating needles and end phenomena an instant fn is an fn which occurs instantly at the end of the major thought voiced by the auditor or at the end of the major thought voiced by the pc when he originates items or tells what the command means it will most usually be seen as lfbdfn or lffn so what does this mean an instant fn is read read means theres charge there to handle it means there is force connected with that significance which is available to the pc to view and run it means that item is real to the pc an fn means something has keyedout now keyout is what we are looking for on many processes which are run it means stop end of process end of rud end of action so an instant fn does not always mean you should take up that item to sort this out you will have to understand the basic mechanics of keyout key in and erasure it will then become clear why an fn is read and when it is taken up to confuse this could really mess up pc for example on ruds prepcheck questions protest overrun rehabs to name few an instant fn would not be taken up the ep of charge keyedout has been attained but to ignore an instant fn on dianetic items and certain correction lists etc will leave the pc with bypassed charge and major areas of case unhandled the key is is handling required on the item or is an fn the legitimate ep you will also have to understand that we are talking about instant fns an fn which continues to fn through an assessment means charge an instant fn on an item means charge has just keyedout on that item and that it can key back in again there are actions as in dianetics where keyout is not what you are going for you want the postulate off the basic incident of the chain which indicates you have an erasure in dianetics an instant fn takes precedence over all other reads this is because the pc having just keyedout the charge on that item will find it most real it will be the most runnable item an instantly fning item is taken up first lfbd lf f and sf follow in their usual order 487the use of this thing is mainly cs use cs can look down column of two way comm or look down an l and n list and spot what fned if the cs doesnt realize that this was the item he can then take erroneously some lfbd item or f item out of the columns of twoway comm as the resulting item for that subject the use of an fn as read is almost entirely relegated to the next cs except when used in dianetics example cs is looking for the actual service facsimile in twoway comm you usually l and n to find service facs but you may have an instance where you found one in twoway comm the pc mentions several and finally one fns the cs knows at once it is the service fac example twoway comm has operated as list and the cs is trying to recon struct it unless he knows that an fn is read he might overlook the actual item on that list which is the one which occurred immediately before the fn this is the item when used in the session itself the auditor has to know that an fn is read in doing l and n the item which fned is of course the item in dianetic session it is not uncommon to find brief fn occurring on list or preassessment in dianetics we are not interested in keyouts we are interested in chains and erasures so the hottest reading item on the list is the one that gave an fn usually it will be bd fn if the dianetic auditor does not know that an instant fn is read he is likely to ignore the item that fned in dianetics you will find that an fn taken up again will immediately keyin but this is what the dianetic auditor wants the scientology auditor is usually handling other phenomena and if he bypassed an fn and kept on going the ta would go up and he would have trouble so the use of this principle is very touchy thing and has to be understood of course the first thing you have to know about is what an fn looks like this tech fully understood and applied will mean the difference between case beingfully handled and just doing better understand it and use it youll see the difference in your results l ron hubbard founder lrhncmf copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 488hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

when an auditor is not having good success with new era dianetics this ned auditor analysis checklist is used to find his exact trouble areas and misunderstoods and get them corrected new era dianetics is so powerful and exact that when correctly applied it is successful on pcs one for one if an auditor is not getting good results it is important to get the situation handled early on for the sake of his pcs the auditor himself and to protect this vital workable tech against invalidation through misuse cs should order an auditor to have ned auditor analysis checklist when that auditors pcs are not making good gains or when the auditors reports show indicators of misunderstoods or misapplications or when the auditor is goofing and does not correct with ordinary cramming how the checklist is done the checklist has two parts part i consists of an assessment done on the auditor by the cramming officer or another auditor the assessment will disclose general areas of weakness or uncertainty on the part of the auditor trs metering etc which are then looked into extensively on part ii part ii is divided into sections which correspond to those in part i if section has read on part i that section is taken up on part ii where the auditor must do exact drills demos and checkouts which will show up his ability or inability to handle that aspect of r3ra the purpose of this checklist is to help the auditor it must be done without invalidating him or making him wrong each area taken up is fully explored per the checklist and is signed off point by point by the cramming officer as it is covered the cramming officer decides how to best correct the auditor based on what he has found this can be cram retread retrain andor handling in session or in ethics cramming is of course not limited to the references given in each section and should cover fully with word clearing checkouts demos clay demos and drills whatever the auditor is weak on or misunderstands when all corrective actions have been completed the auditor sees the cramming officer who ensures hes really got it the auditor should be very bright and eager by this point he then goes to the examiner and attests to the ned auditor analysis checklist the auditor may now resume auditing new era dianetics this checklist promptly csed for and promptly done can save entire hgcs not to mention needless
