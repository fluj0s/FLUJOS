trade agreement to go into effect ftas must be approved by congress and the korean national assembly the fta ne gotiation and ratifica tion processes are likely to politicize bilateral trade dis putes

friction over trade disputes the bilateral economic relationship has been accompanied by numerous disagreements over trade policies the intensity of the disputes has diminished considerably since the late 1980s and ear ly 1990s in large measure because south korea has enacted set of sweeping marketoriented reforms as quid pro quo for receiving 58 billion package from the international mone tary fund imf following the near collapse of the sout h korean economy in 1997 in particular as result of the reforms south korea s opened its doors to foreign investors ushering in billions of dollars of foreign portfolio and foreign direct investment fdi the result is that foreign companies including us firms now are significant shareholders in many promin ent industrial c onglomerates chaebol own an estimated 40 of the value of the shares traded on south koreas stock exchange and at one point owned about onethird of the korean banking industry after his election to one fiveyear term in 2002 s outh korean president roh moohyun said that more extensive reforms were needed to help accomplish his goals of raising per capita gross domestic product gdp to 20000 and of transforming south korea into major economic hub in northeast asia in essence for nearly decade most us traderelated complaints are echoed by voices within the south korean establishment the united states and south korea appear to have become more adept at managing their trade disputes so that they tend to be less acrimonious than they were in the 1980s and 1990s this may be partly due to the quarterly workinglevel trade action agenda trade meetings that were in itiated in early 2001 both sides credit the meetings which appear to be unique to the ussouth korean trade relationship with creating more constructive

seventh round which began in washington on february 11 and was scheduled to end on february 14 2007 the two sides have reported progress in some areas such as industrial tariffs customs administration anticorruption measures and foreign investment but sharp differences remain over trade in autos pharmaceuticals and agricultural products and over antidumping procedures both sides are still aiming to complete the negotiation before the end of march to comply with tpa deadlines if an agreement is reached it would be the united statess largest fta since the north american free trade agreement nafta to go into effect ftas must be approved by congress the ussouth ko rea fta korus fta negotiations are being conducted under the trade promoti on authority tpa that the congress granted to the

would have to be completed before april 2 20073 the decision to launch the fta is regarded by some as highrisk high reward move by both governments the economic side of the usrok relationship has been source of strength and stability in recent years even as the diplomatic and military sides have been frayed by differences between seoul and washington over how best to deal with north korea and how to adapt the us troop presence in korea the launch of the fta talks has brought to the surface number of long standing deepseated differe nces in trade and investment relations that remained below the surface for years if south korean and us negotiators can successfully address them the relationship would strengthen if not nd the negotiations fail the bilateral relationship could be seriously harmed for some time as failure may be sign of the lack of trust south koreas economy the 1997 financial crisis and imfdirected reforms south koreas 1997 financial cr isis was seminal event in the

cards led to the nearcollapse of many financial firms and sharp slowdown in economic growth which fell back to 31 until the late 1990s the consumer sector of the economy had been largely untapped with korean lenders focusing on the cor porate sector thus when the government liberalized financial regulations and forced koreas giant conglomerates to curtail their borrowing in the aftermath of th 1997 crisis banks nd other financial institutions turned to consumers at times recklessly as new source of profit the number of credit card holders behind in their payments increased sharply with an estimated 8 of the popula tion in default in march 20045 in 2003 and 2004 all eight of koreas specialized creditcard issuers registered massive losses that collectively were more than double their

tightening restrictions on credit card use and issuance and by initiating refinancing and forgiveness program for individual debtors for 2004 south koreas economy grew by 46 below the 6 growth rate

to make the economy truly responsive to marketoriented pressu res and incentives progress has been particularly difficult in the governments attempts to pressure the chaebol to correct the problems

individual families rather than professional business managers although two of the largest chaebol daewoo and hyundai have been dismantled and btequity ratios for most of the top conglomerates have been reduced corporate governance and crossshareholdings within chaebol groupings remain major problems the bailouts of struggling credit card affiliates in 2003 and 2004 seemed to many to indicate

however have reacted with alarm to foreign investment and there has been growing discussion of restricting the takeover of korean companies by foreigners for instance when newbridge capital sold its 50 stake in korea first bank in early 2005 at high profit it was accused of being foreign exploiter the south korean government attempted to limit or eliminate an investment treaty with malaysia newbridges home that allowed the company to avoid paying korean taxes on its gains newbridge bought korea first bank in 1999 and is credited in many circ with turning around the banks fortunes part of the korean governments appare nt ambivalence to foreign investment particularly in the financial sector is that foreign multinationals often are more resistant to government pressu re newbridge for
