both continuity and change has demonstrated the best of american democracy to the world1 the activities surrounding presidentia l transition today begin shortly after the election as the presidentelect has fe wer than 11 weeks to formulate the new administration before taking the oath of office on january 20 formal transition process has been shown to be essential to ensure conti nuity in the conduct of the affairs of the executive branch as well as the rest of the federal government before 1963 the primary source of fundi ng for transition expenses was the political party organization of the incoming president and the efforts of volunteer staff realizing the importance of presid ential transitions for effective government congress first enacted the presidential tr ansition act of 1963 pta to authorize federal funding and assistance for future incoming administrations2 the act was amended by congress in 1976 to increas the authorization for presidential transition to 3 million with 2 million availa ble to the presidentelect and vice presidentelect and 1 million to the outgoing president and vice president3 in 1988 congress enacted the presidentia l transitions effectiveness act to increase federal funding to 5 million to support change of administrations4 of this total 35 million was authorized to be appropriated for rvices and facilities to the presidentelect and vice presidentelect the outgoing president and vice president were authorized 15 million in federal funds total of 250000 would be returned to the treasury if the outgoin g vice president were subsequently elected president these funds were authorized to be increased in future transitions to accommodate inflation the new legislati on also amended the pta to require that

transition st atutes discussed in the report presidents commission on campaign costs subsequent to the 1960 election it was wi dely recognized that changes were needed in campaign finance practices f unding for presidential transition activities was among the issues discussed acco rdingly on november 8 1961 president kennedy established the presidents commission on campaign costs to make recommendations on improved ways of financing expenditures required of nominees for the offices of president and vice president as well as other relevant costs associated with presidential campaigns6 five months later the 12member bipartisan commission completed its final report entitled financing presidential campaigns which included recommendati on on presidential transitions7 the commission reported that the 19521953 transition for president dwight d eisenhower cost special republican committee more than 200000 and the 1960 1961 trans ition for president kennedy cost 360000 funded by the democratic national committee noting that such expenses created financial hardship for the political parties especially after an election the commission recommended that funding for the presidentelect and vi ce presidentelect should not be the responsibility of political party we endorse proposals to institutionalize the transition from one administration to another when the party in power change s important reasons for doing so exist wholly aside from the costs to the partie s the new president must select and assemble the staff to man his administration and they in return must prepare

presidentelect during the trans ition period between the election and the inauguration of new administration it is entirely desirable and appropriate that the federal government provide funds for paying the reasonable and necessary costs of installing new administration in office10 in addition to the importance of federa l funding president kennedy stressed that an incoming president must select respons ible public officials who must prepare themselves for their new respons ibilitiesduring the transition period the presidential transition act of 1963 as recommended by the presidents commission on campaign costs legislation was introduced during the 87th congress to provide federal financial support for presidential transitions lthough it was supported by president kennedy there
