security the notch issue kathleen romig analyst in social security domestic social policy division summary some social security beneficiaries who were born from 1917 to 1921 the so called notch babies believe they are not receiving fair social security benefits1 the notch issue resulted from legislative changes to social security during the 1970s the 1972 amendments to the social security act first established costofliving adjustments colas for social security benefits this change was intended to adjust benefits for inflation automatically but an error in the formula caused benefits to rise substantially faster than inflation congress corrected the error in the 1977 amendments however benefits for beneficiarie s born from 1910 to 1916 were calculated using the flawed formula giving them unintended windfall benefits the notch babies born from 1917 to 1921 became eligible for benefits during the period in which th corrected formula was phased in some feel it is unfair that their benefits are lower than those who received the windfall benefits the term notch comes from graphs of benefit levels over time there is vshaped dip for those born from 1917 to 1921 during the transition to the corrected formula number of legislative attempts have been made over the years to give notch babies additional bene fits but none have been successf ul congressi onally mandated commission studied the issue and concluded in its 1994 report that benefits paid to those in the notch years are equitable and remedial legislation is in order this crs report will be update d as

calculating the new costofliving adjustment cola was flawed although intended to provide inflation adjustments only to people already receiving benefits each increase for current beneficiaries also

continue to ri faster than prices as they had in the past however the high in flation and unemployment in th 1970s resulted in higherthan intended increases for beneficiaries affected by the new formula and lowerthanexpected revenues for social security2 if the erroneous formula had not been changed future beneficiaries could have r eceived initial benefits that exceeded their preretirement earnings higher than congress intended and higher than payroll taxes could finance3 the 1977 amendments as part of the 1977 amendments pl 95216 congress corrected the error in the cola formula in the 1972 amendments by creating new formula in which initial benefit levels are indexed to wages then increased by inflation after the initial year without the 1977 amendments the system would have become insolvent within five years4 the correction to the cola formula resulted in different treatment for all social security beneficiaries depending on year of birth as described in the following section5 benefit levels before during and after the notch beneficiaries born from 1910 to 1916 the erroneous cola formula created by the 1972 amendments affected people who turned 62 in 1972 or later that is individuals born in 1910 and later this is because the formula used to calculate social security retirement benefits is based on the year an individual reaches the earliest age of eligibility which is age 62 when the error in the benefit formula was corrected in the 1977 amendments benefits for people who were already eligible fo r retirement benefits were left unchanged as result beneficiaries born between 1910 and 1916 the seven years prior to the notch were allowed to receive unintentional windfall benefits for the rest of their lives beneficiaries born from 1917 to 1921 the 1977 amendments corrected the error in the social security benefit formul starting with individuals born in 1917 as result the benefits of peopl who were born during the notch years are lower than those of the beneficiaries who came just before them to ease the transition to the new corrected formula congress phased in the change for people born from 1917 through 1921 the notch babies6 figure 1 shows

from graphs such as this one where the lines representing the benefit levels of notch babies dip below the lines representing the benefit levels of individuals born imme diately before and soon after many notch babies actually receive higher real benefits than people who were born after they were all else equal for ex ample people born in 1917 receive significantly higher average monthly benefits than pe ople born in 1922 the first year the correct formula was fully phased in as shown in figure 1 an average wage earner born in 1917 would receive monthly benefit of 1166 in 2007 dollars while an average wage earner born in 1922 would receive monthly benefit of 1080 source 2007 social security trustees report table vif10 note the lines representing the notch period 19171921 are yellow average wage earners are assumed to have earnings equal to ssas average wage index awi each year about 40000 in 2007 in addition most notch babies have si gnificantly higher replacement rates than people born after they were all else equal replacement rate is one way of measuring the adequacy of persons postretirement in come it is comparison between persons income before and after retirement this report calculates replacement rates in the same way as the social security administrati on ssa actuaries which is to show the proportion of beneficiaries average indexe d earnings replaced by their initial social security benefits in 2007 the estimated re placement rate for an average wage earner retiring at age 65 is 40 in drafting the 1972 amendments congress intended to maintain replacement rates at roughly 40 but the doubleindexing erro r caused replacement rates to rise above 50 before the error was fixed as shown in figure 2 below the notch babies replacement rates are higher than most beneficiaries born after they were particularly in comparison to current and future beneficiaries whos replacement rates are declining as the full retirement age increases

study the notch issue the commission on the social security notch issue released its report on december 29 19947 its principal conclusion was that the benefits paid to those in the notch years are equitable and remedial legi slation is in order its report states that the uneven treatment between those in the n otch years and those just before them was magnified by the decision of congress to fully grandfather people born before 1917 under the old law it further states that in retrospect congress probably should have limited the benefits of those whose benefits were calculated using the erroneous formula in the 1972 amendments but that it was too late to do so given their advanced age advocacy group activity among advocacy groups support for legislati on to increase benefits for notch babies has been limited the lead proponent of such legislation is the trea senior citizens league tscl tscl argues that the transitional benefit formula affecting notch babies was flawed some
