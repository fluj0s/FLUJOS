presentation of the admin istrations proposals the budget documents are an annual basic reference sour ce for federal budget information the administrations annual budget sub mission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconciliation bill or bills during the months of deliberation on budget legislation the ad ministration often re vises its original proposals because of interactions with c ongress and changing circumstances in the economy and the world the current situation the treasury released final budget totals for fy2004 on october 14 2004 with the release of the final monthly treasury statemen t of receipts and outlays of the united states government for fy2004 receipts were 1880

those originally presented by the president or congress the war on terrorism the 2001 recession nd the slow economic recovery until it speeded up in the fall of 2003 changes in policies tax cuts spending increases and changes in the technical assumptions underlying budgetec onomic relationships have all contributed to the deterioration in the budget outlook since early 2001 under current policies and even more so under policies proposed in the presidents fy2005 budget there is little expectation that the budget will reach balance over the next 10 years budget proposals and estimates

ed tax cuts were needed to boost the lagging economy and that the acceleration of economic growth resulting from the tax cuts would lead to the recovery of much of the lost revenue over future years in contrast the presidents c ouncil of economic advisors in its annual report stated although the economy grows in response to tax reductions because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity3 both ombs and cbos original fy2004 budget documents were produced prior to the completion of final work on the fy2003 appropriations this forced both agencies to estimate the discretionary spending levels congress would approve and that the

n their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimate s and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes the last couple of ears have demonstrated this volatility the original proposals and estimates for fy 2002 made in early 2001 dramatically changed over the 20 to 21 months of c ongressional and presid ential action on the budget the budget estimates in the om b and cbo budget documents for five to 10 years in the future are subject to even greater variability the early 2001 estimates for fy2002 estimated surplus of 231 billion to 313 billion the year ended on september 30 2002 with deficit of 158 billion the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the gislation adopted in

outcomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31784crs7 8 some things are known with relative cert ainty about the direc tion of future budgets demographics can partly determine the shape of future budgets the upcoming retirement of the baby boom generation will rapidly drive hi gher the spending for social security and medicare as well as other federal spending or ta x breaks for the elderly in the next

favorable economic and budget conditions continue throughout the forecast that the increase in productivity persists and that mandatory spending is lower than in the baseline the pessimistic scenario assumes that less favorable economic and budget conditions occur that the economy grows more slowly and that ma ndatory spending is higher than in the baseline the optimistic scenario produces

how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the underlying assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the existing or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can and usually do have subs

for and go t from congress in the fall of 2003 an 875 billion supplemental appropriation mostly for the ongoing operations in afghanistan and iraq implementing the presidents proposals would raise each years deficit above the ba seline and leave very uncertain whether or not the budget would return to surplus after fy2008 cbos summer 2003 baseline estimates raised the ficit estimate to 480 billion in fy2004 falling to 197 billion in fy2008 and becoming surplus of 211 billion in fy2013 after the scheduled expi ration of various tax cuts at the end of 2010 the cumulative fy2004fy2008 baseline deficit was 1445 billion in the cbo report the 10year peri od fy2004fy2013 had cumulative baseline deficit of 1397 billion smaller than the five year cumulative deficit because of the forecast return to surpluses in the second fiveyear period the january 2004 cbo baseline estimates for the fy2005 budget cycle included revised deficit estimates for fy2004 through fy2014 cbo estimated the baseline deficit for fy2004 at 477 billion th deficits in subs equent years were larger than cbo had estimated in august 2003 with the budget never returning to surplus throughout the period the cb march 2004 revisions slightly increased deficits throughout the projec tion period beginning in fy2005 the administrations fy2005 budget feb ruary 2004 included larger deficit estimates for fy2004 and subsequent years that reflected the effects of the administrations policy proposals the budget included fy2004 deficit estimate of 521 billion up from the 475 billion level in the july 2003 midsession review the administration arbitrarily reduced its fy2004 revenue estimate by 20 billion in the budget thereby raising the fy 2004 deficit by 20 billion cbos march 2004 estimates of the presidents proposals pr oduced deficit of 477 billion for fy2004 although the presidents budget estimated th at the deficit would fall to 237 billion in fy2009 half the amount that the administration expects in fy2004 almost all of the reduction occurs between fy2004 and fy2006 after fy2006 the deficit in dollars changes very little through fy2009 th last year of tailed projections in the administrations budget in addition to the reestimates the pr esidents proposals cbo march 2004 report included updated baseline estimates there wa s change in cbos fy2004 baseline deficit from the one in january 2004 the march baselin deficit estimates for subsequent years were somewhat larger than they had been in cbos january 2004 budget report the 2004 midyear reports from omb july 30 and cbo september 7 contained smaller deficit estimates for fy2004 than had their earlier 2004 budget reports omb estimated that the defi cit would be 445 billion for fy2004 while cbo estimated that the deficit would be 422 billion the actual deficit as reported by the treasury in october was 413 billion cbo attributed much of the deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31784crs21 reduction since its march report to higher receipts than expected earlier mostly from the effect of changed economic conditions and technical changes neither legislation nor any changes in outlays had much effect on these final deficit estimates cbos alternative policies t included in the baseline cbos summer report august 2003 also included estimates of the budgetary effects of policy alternatives not included in cbos baseline the alternatives include policies that have high probability of being enacted or seriously debated they included extending expiring tax pr ovisions the reform of the alternative minimum tax amt medicare reform in cluding prescription drug benefit which had not yet been adopted and in creasing discretionary spending at the growth rate of nominal gdp or at the aver age rate of discretionary spending growth from fy1998 through fy2003 the alternatives are all fairly costly running from 112 billion for amt reform for fy2004 through fy2008 to 608 billion for increasing discretionary spending at its recent historical growth rate for the same years during the 10 years fy2004fy2013 these costs become much larger ranging from 400 billion for both amt and medicare reform to 1564 billion to extend the expiring provisions to 2833 billion for incr easing discretionary spending at the recent historical rate combining these effects and excluding the cost of increasing discretionary spending at the rate of minal gdp growth with the baseline deficit estimate and projection raises the fy2004 deficit to 510 billion the fy2008 deficit to 577 billion and instead of becomin g 161 billi on surplus in fy2012 the alternatives produce defic it of 765 billion in that year and deficit of 826 billion in fy2013 under these alternative polic ies the cumulative deficit for fy2004 through fy2008 rises from 1455 billion in the baseline to 2577 billion under the alternatives for the 10 year period fy2004 through fy2013 the cumulative deficit rises from 1397 billion in the baseline to 6193 billion with the alternatives included adoption of these alternative po licies moves the budget further into deficit with indications of it moving towards balance the longer run over longer period one running decades into this century the administration indicated in its fy2004 budget that it expects under existing policies and assumptions large and continually growing deficits beginning sometime in the next decade the retirement of the baby boom generation beginning in large numbers within 15 years will rapidly drive up spending on social security medicare and other programs for the elderly doubling these collective programs size as percentage of gdp their growth under current policy will raise the deficit or reduce the surplus if there is one and put severe strain on both the budget and the economy the tax cuts and spending increas of the last few years intensified the already existing longterm budget pressurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31784crs22 the budget and the economy the budget nd the economy affect each other unequally small economic changes have more significant effect on the budget than the effect of large policy changes on the economy the worsethan expected recent economic conditions that lasted into 2003 played substantial role di rectly or indirectly in the deterioration of the budget outlook over those year s and affected the outlook for fy2004 after fy2004 the budget projections fro m 2003 assumed that the economy has returned to its normal rate of growth under policies that are in fiscal balance return to normal economic growth shoul d reduce or eliminate deficit or produce surplus the budget balance using cbos august 2003 alternative assumptions does not improve over the next several year s this implies that the budget has an underlying fiscal imbalance that the current policies of the gove rnment are producing outlays that are too large or receipts that are too small to produce balanced budget or one in surplus during peri ods of normal economic growth the positive budget outlook forecast in early 2001 was substa ntially based on the favorable future economic conditions that were then expected along with policies that would continue producing surpluse s the outlook continued the overall improvement in the budget situation since the early 1990s much of the improvement had come from strong and sustained econo mic growth and the rest from policy changes to reduce the deficit when those favorable economic conditions faltered as they did in 2001 so di d the string of positive forecasts of the budget outlook what good economic cond itions give bad economic conditions can take away the unexpectedly lengthy ec onomic weakness into 2003 the start of recession in march 2001 the lengthy fall in the stock market the policy responses to the september 2001 terrorist attacks ong with negative changes in the technical components of the budget estimates raised outlays reduced receipts beyond policy changes and eliminated the previously expected surpluses the fy2004 presidential budget documents and cbos january 2003 budget report included information of the ex pected economic ou tlook and th budgets sensitivity to changes in selected economic variables both reports included tables showing the budgets sensitivity to changes in selected economic variables it was found in chapter 2 of the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents fy2004 budget and in chapter 5 of cbos january 2003 budget report the effects of the variables are generally symmetrical higher rate of real economic growth than assumed in the budget proposal has approx imately the same effect on the budget as samesized lower rate of ec onomic growth has but in the opposite direction if 1 lower rate of economic growth reduces the surplus or increases the deficit by 30 billion in fy2004 from the omb table table 26 p 32 the budget of the united states government fiscal ye ar 2004 analytical perspectives 1 higher than expected rate of economic growth would reduce the deficit or increase the surplus by approximately 30 b illion changes in other variab generally have smaller effects on the budgetary balance than changes in real gdp sustained changes in the underlying economic variable s tend to produce larger changes in the budget numbers than the effect of one or two year
