controlling time in favor of the resolution yielded for that purpose 2 if the motion for the previous question was not offered or was defeated or 3the amendment was in the form of instructions in motion to commit11 motion to commit with or without instructions is in order if offered by member before debate on the resolution has begun the motion itself would be debatable for one hour controlled by the member who offered the motion if offered after the previous question is ordered committal motion would not be debatable this motion would also be subject to nondebatable motion to lay on the
