jordans total assistance package has averaged over 700 million per fiscal year this higher figure is due in part to large allocations for jordan in subsequent supplemental ppropriations acts total of

cooperation states for gistical expenses in support of us military operations increased us aid has reflected the bush administrations appreciation for jordans role in combating terrorism and rebuildin

47year reign educated largely in britain and the united states king abdullah ii had earlier pursued military career ultimately serving as commander of jordans special operations forces with the rank

government and the council of ministers cabinet typically jordania n governments last about 15 years before they are dissolved by royal decree this is done in order to bolster the kings reform credentials and to dispense patronage to various elites the king also appoints all judges and is commander of the armed forces parliament constitution and elections jordans bicameral legislature is com posed of an elected 110member lower house and an appointed 55member upper house2 building on his fathers legacy king abdullah ii has supported l imited parliamentar democracy while periodically curtailing dissent when it thr eatened economic refo rms or normalization of relations with israel overall parliament has limited power in theory it can override the veto authority of the king w ith twothirds majority in both the upper and lower houses twothirds majority of the lower house can also dissolve the cabinet with confidence vote howeve r since both houses almost always have solid progovernment majorities such actions are rarely attempted once in april 1963 the constitution enables the king to dissolve parliament and postpone lower house elections for two years3 the king also can also ci rcumvent parlia ment through constitutional mechanism that allows provisional legislation to be issued by the cabinet when parliament is not sitting or has been dissolved the king also can issue royal decrees which are not subj ect to parliamentary scrutiny overall political parties in jordan are extremely weak as the moderately fundamentalist islamic action front iaf is the only well organized movement most parties represent narrow parochial in terests and are composed of prominent individuals representing particular family or tribe there are approximately 36 small parties in jorda n consisting of an timated 4100 total members4 the 1993 election law the opposition in jordan routinely criticizes the law governing national elections afte r islamists made gains in the 1989

choose just one representative voters havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33546crs4 6 continued individual candidates as there are ats allocated to that district 7 according to one study of jordans elec tion law it is coincidence that under represented urban governorates have large popul ation of palestinian origin and that over represented largely rural governorates are c onsidered mainstays of support for the regime see david m debartolo jordan attention turns to electoral law arab reform bulletin published by the carnegie endowment for international peace volume 5 issue 3 april 2007 in amman each

disproportionate democracy ahram weekly 2228 november 2007 issue 872 10 the july municipal elections marked the first time that voters elected all municipal council members half of whom were previously selected by the king with the exception of the capital amman where all were elected nd support for the iaf is particularly strong the iaf seemed poised to participate in the election only to withdraw hours before the polls opened typically chosen candidates based on familial or tribal ties not on ideology reformers would like to see mixed election system that provides for some proportional representation and llows parties to field lists of candidates in addition many reformers have called for changes to jordans electoral map asserting that the government gerrymandered voting district s to favor candidates from rural tribal strongholds over urban areas where is lamists typically have more support7 2007 parliamentary elections on november 20 2007 approximately 989 candidates vied for 110 seats in the chambe r of deputies par liaments lower house progovernment candidates won an overwhelming majority while the iaf secured just 6 seats it only fielded 22 candida

according to one anonymous voter i gave my vote in exchange for jd10 14 est i voted and all my sisters di d and we went back home with jd40 56 in total9 jordanian authorities did rrest several individuals accused of vote buying the authorities prohibited nongove rnmental organizations from monitoring the election in the months prior to the election the iaf had announced that despite any significant changes to the electoral law it would participate in the november election when asked why the iaf has decide d to participate after boycotting the july municipal elections10 one spokesman remarked that t he party that boycotts loses an important forum the islamists want to have the important forum which parliament provides reportedly the iaf decided to pa rticipate after the prime minister pledged to hold clean election in exchange for the islamists limiting the number of candidates they would field other reports suggest that some prominent iaf members wanted to boycott the

government accused her of slandering jordans image and accu sing officials of corruption although king abdullah ii pardoned faisal vocal cr itic of the royal family her previous conviction was used to justify the rejec tion of her candidacy faisal responded by saying they do not want lawmakers w ho enjoy popularity and fight corruption in jordan they want progovernment legislators the authorities are ready to do anything to prevent from running in the elections12 the jordanian muslim brotherhood the jordanian muslim brotherhood has long been integrated into the political mainstream due to its acceptance of the gitimacy of hashemite monarchy although relations between the brotherhood and the pa lace have fluctuated over the years the brotherhood presence in jordan dates b ack to the 1930s as it has been tacitly recognized first as charitable organization and later as quasipolitical organization which has openly fielded candi dates in parliament ary elections albeit under different name isl amic action front iaf th relationship between the brotherhood and the palace has been mutua lly beneficial over the years successive jordanian monarchs have found that the brot herhood has been more useful po litically as an ally than as an opponent as opposed to the brotherhood in egypt as it secured islamist support in counterin g arab nationalist interference during the 1950s and 1960s and secular palestin ian nationalism in the 1970s the brotherhoods educational social and health services have grown so extensive over the years that some experts believe that th brotherhoods budget for services rivals that of the jordanian government like other islamist parties in the re gion the islamic action front the muslim brotherhoods political wing operates in tight political space wedged between government which seeks to limit its influence and disillusioned constituency impatient for reform in jordans poor er neighborhoods the brotherhood uses its social services to attract support though it must compete with the growing allure of militant islam emanating both from within jordan and from neighboring iraq the iaf markets itself as bey ond the culture of corruption found in jordanian politics and while this message may resonate with the average supporter it is unclear what the partys platform is aside from its slogan of islam is the solution government crackdown in 2006 and 2007 the jordanian government took additional steps to curb the brotherhood s influence in domestic politics violence in neighboring iraq the 2005 amman hotel bombings which killed 58 people and the hamas 2007 takeover of the gaza strip all ma the jordanian authorities more cautious of the brot herhoods political and charitable activities in june 2006 justhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33546crs6 13

respectively though their sentences were reduced to 13 months shortly thereafter the case did not dr aw great deal of international attention according to sarah leah whitson director of the middle

published by the jamestown foundation june 10 2008days after the death of the terrorist mastermind abu musab alzarqawi four iaf parliamentarians were arrested after making statements praising the late qaeda in iraq leader one iaf deputy reportedly remarked that zarqawi was martyr and holy warrior the government charged13 that such remarks were in violation of article 150 of jordans penal code which bans all writing or speech that is intended to or results in stirring up s ectarian or racial nsion or strife among different elements of the nation14 several weeks later the jordanian government dissolved the administration of the islamic centre charity society the brotherhoods main vehicle for dispensing social welfare to its supporte rs some estimate that the charity controls over 1 billion

particularly democratic reform remains slow by western standards for every step forward on issues such as womens rights economic liber alization and education th ere are steps backward on press freedoms and institutional reforms16 jordanian officials have been adamant in insisting that they be allowed to institute social changes at their own pace asserting that society has changed dramatically over the past century from desert tribal society into modern nation state the jordanian government believes that some portions of its population are suspicious of u s intentions in the region and that local leaders would consider some us democra tic reform proposals to be antithetical to jordans conservative islamic and tribal social culture overall analysts have widely documented culture of political apathy in jordan where citizens are angry over corruption unemp loyment and rising inflation but are largely complacent when it comes to taking political action according to one observer most jordanians accept this system or at least do not actively resist or challenge it the vital democratic principle of the consent of the governed has been adjusted to the acquiescence of the governed who do not take political governance too seriously because they appreciate what the system offers them in comparison with many other arab c ountries the system shuns severe abuses of citizen rights and human dignity mass graves have ever been found in jordan nobody disappears forever in the middle of the night unable to shape policy citizens instead value stability the opportunity

jordan possesses substantial reserves of phosphates and potash significant oil and gas fields have been discovered and its oil tar sands remain commercially unviable 19 one factor that exacerbates the unemploymen t situation in jordan is the social stigma attached to menial labor jobs referred to as the culture of shame jordanian tribal traditions look down on certain types of empl oyment such as construction in fact the government estimates that there are pproximately 300000 to 400000 foreign laborers in jordan working as domestic laborers bricklayers and other tasks 20 though jordan is resourcepoor country hi gh global oil prices can indirectly boost its economic growth oil booms benefit the families of jordanians employed in oilrich nations of the persian gulf as these guest workers have more income to send back home in addition foreign direct investment from the arab gulf states has increased in recent years particularly in the construction and real estate markets 21 other factors also have caused drop in the standard of living the devaluation of the jordanian dinar which is pegged to the dollar has contributed to high inflation rates the influx of hundreds of thousands of iraqi refu gees into greater amman has caused housing shortages and led to rising rents and real tate prices by some accounts amman is now one of the most expensive arab capital cities in

public and makes for fertile ground for believing lies and rumors and hence different groups are using this discontent to further their own political agendas the debate should focus on transparency and the use of the proceeds of thes funds instead of continuing with baseless accusations our culture and national identity will never be for sale as claimed by some malicious rumors25 despite the

promoting peace in the middle east finding peaceful solution to the israelipalestinian conflict is the utmost priority of the jordanian government although jordan joined other neighboring arab states in series of military conflicts against israel between 1948 and 1973 the late king hussein ruled 19521999 ultimately c oncluded that peace with israel was in jordans strategic interests due to isr aels conventional milita ry superiority the development of an independe nt palestinian national movement that threatened both jordanian and israeli security and jordan s support for saddam hussein in the first gulf war which isolated it from the west consequently in 1994 jordan and israel signed peace treaty27 and king abdullah ii has used his countrys semicordial official relationship with israel to imp rove jordans standing with western governments and international financial institutions on which it relies heavily for external support and aid nevertheless the continua tion of conflict c ontinues to be major obstacle to jordans development the issue of palestinian rights resonates with much of the population as more than half of all jordan ian citizens originate from either the west bank or the pre1967 borders of israel there are an estimated 19 million united nationsregistered palestinia n refugees in jordan and while many longer regard their stay in jordan as temporary they have retained their refugee status both as symbolic sign of support fo r palestinians living under is raeli occupation and in hope of being included in any futu re settlement furthermore for king abdullah ii and the royal hashemite family who are of arab bedouin descent and rely politically on the support of east bank tribal families finding solution to the conflict is considered matter of

jordan is jordan and palestine is palestine opposition to normalization king abdullahs efforts to normalize relations with israel have faced significant resistance within jordan particularly among islamic fundame ntalist groups parts of the palestinian community and influential trade and pr ofessional organizations among many mainstream jordanians there is some disappointment th at peace with israel has not brought more tangible economic benefits to them so far opponents of normalization have repeatedly called on jordanians to boycott contacts with israel and activists among them have compiled black lists of jordanian individuals and companies that deal with israel the jordanian government s arrested organizers of these lists but courts have upheld their right to publis h them in addition iaf parliamentarians periodically propose legislation to prohibit cooperation with israel in various sectors the iaf also has proposed legislation to abrogate jordans 1994 peace treaty with israel reviving the arabisraeli peace process for nearly decade king abdullah ii has attemp ted to convince us policy ma kers and congress to become more actively involved in mediating be tween israelis and palestinians king abdullah ii is strong supporter of saudi initiative dubbed th arab p eace initiative which calls for israels full withdrawal from all occupied territories and the

tensions in the region king abdullah ii supported the convening of the ussponsored peace conference in annapolis maryland in n ovember 2007 and he has encouraged the united states to push for israelipalestinian negotiations over core issues status of jerusalem refugees and borders he has warned repeatedly that without settlement to the conflict armed islamist movements like hamas and hezbollah will grow in strength and radicalize jordans own islamist movements according to king abdullah ii the process that started in annapolis is from our perspective positive development but it also may be our last chance for peace for many many years to come for us to fully realize the benefits of reform we need to be able to exchange goods and services with our neighbors and facilitate the
