internal oversight services internal audit division ii audit of united nations economic commission for eur ope information and communications technology management ae200572001 executive summary during september and october 2005 oios conducted n audit of uneces information and communications technology management function the audit did not reveal major weaknesses however number of measures need to be taken to strengthen the governance and administrative struct ure over the overall ict operations except for one recommendation where management has proposed substantive change unece has accepted all of the recommendations and has set up timetable for their implementation the setting up of the ict management group and the holding of regular meetings has been an important step in the coordination of ict matters oios is of the opinion that there is room for raising the profile of ict across the commission and strengthening ict governance and is recommending that strategic and highlevel policy m atters be presented at directors meetings on more regular basis unece has agreed to implement this recommendation w ith immediate effect oios has also recommended assigning the role of chi ef information and communications technology officer cio to suitably qualified nior official management has proposed different approach namely that of assigning the ro of cio to the chief of the information systems unit oios remains of the opinion that this function need s to be assigned to someone at the senior management level and has reiterated its recommendation for uneces reconsideration oios recognizes that the formulation of comprehen sive ict strategy for the medium term will need to take into account the ongoing unece reform process and that certain decisions cannot be taken unilaterally but in the context of the ict in frastructure within unog and the policies set by unhq nevertheless oios believes that management is in position to start implementing the recommendations made in this report oios is recommending that the information systems u nit coordinate with the business owners to draw up rolling strategic plan supporting the com missions mandate and policies for it services and applications covering the next two biennia th plan would be reviewed on an annual basis and updated to take into account any changes in int ernal policies and in the context of unogs ict plans once these are finalized unece should f irst make every attempt to use applications and services that are already available through oth er entities such as the information technology service division at headquarters g and the international computing centre the strategy should serve as the basis for determin ing uneces ict budget requirements for the 20082009 biennium oios is pleased to note that unece will be starti ng the process of developing rolling ict strategy for 20072009 dur ing the current quarter while isu is responsible for the uneces core appli cation systems it has control over systems that are developed and maintained within the other divisions there are currently eight applications that have been developed outside of is u and are run independently oios is recommending that all ict matters throughout the co mmission including software development and maintenance be assigned to the isu and that th chief isu attend meetings of the directors in its role the isu should present senior manageme nt with an update on the ict policies and procedures including those within the united natio ns secretariat and implement procedures for user acceptance testing and formal signoff of proj ect outputs unece will be taking steps to implement the recommendations made by oios in respe ct of the above matters allowing for the fact that the timing and details of their implement ation and of others made in this report will be linked to the ict strategy document oios welcomes uneces initiative to obtain direct r epresentation on the secretariats ict board given the interdependence of certain ict functions such as security and business continuity planning oios is recommending that unece coordinat with unog and other entities based in geneva to form an ict board at the geneva level oios is pleased to note that unece will be taking this initiative with other organi sations in geneva isu has service agreement with the statistical di vision oios is recommending that the ict services isu is mandated to provide to each of the divisions and the rest of the user community are defined in service catalogue and that any ot her services are reflected in bilateral service delivery agreements these measures should improve the level of ict services to the user community and generate more accountability and tran sparency unece will be taking steps to implement these recommendations during the third qu arter of 2006 and during 2007 respectively unece management has noted the need to increase it training across the commission but agreement has not yet been reached on how the proce ss should be structured and funding allocated funds for ict training are allocated on the basis f proportionality which could mean that staff training requirements do not address the commission s overall priorities oios is recommending that the ictmg draw up strategy develop criteria and provide mechanism for the utilization of ictrelated training funds it is also recommendin g that programme is set up under which all unece staff will obtain ecdlicdl certification unece will be taking steps to have this recommendation fully implemented during 2007 unece needs to develop formal policy covering all aspects of it security including the granting and administering of access rights periodic revie ws can then be carried out to check that existing access rights conform to the policy there should be mechanism under which isu is immediately informed of all staff movements so that it can update their profile accordingly oios is also recommending formal policy over the grant ing and administering of access rights to the mail system including remote access and the closu re of email accounts unece has agreed to implement the recommended actions uneces production servers and the backupandrest ore services are outsourced it is understood that security arrangements over backup media are t he responsibility of the service provider but this is not sufficiently specified in the service greements oios is recommending that this matter be included in the agreements unece should also establish formalized incident reporting procedure with its service providers and in coordination with unogicts and icc carry out recovery exercise on an annual basis unece has accepted to implement the recommended measures subject to agreement on the pa rt of the respective service providers there are detailed plans to ensure that in the vent of major disaster uneces critical operational functions are properly recovered and be come operational within acceptable timescales oios is recommending that unece collaborate with ogicts and unhqitsd and hold workshop for members of the ictmg to advice on the categorization of missioncritical systems and data this should lead to the implementation f business continuity plan unece has agreed to establish suitable procedure for the finition of business continuity oios believes that the implementation of the recomm endations set out in its report would bring the management of ict more in line with best practi ce and would demonstrate managements commitment to

responsibilities annex i introduction 1 during september and october 2005 oios conducted an audit of information and communications technology management within the uni ted nations economic commission for europe the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the unece has about 220 staff members the major ity 198 being regular staff in addition to the 55 member states all interested member s tates have observer status and may participate in the commissions work the unece secretariat s six divisions which currently manage nine sub programmes there is also technical cooperati on unit the information systems unit reports directly to the executive secretary 3 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 3 november 2005 with the director statistical division in his capa city as chairman of the ict management group the secretary of the commission and special assistant to the executive secretary and the chief information systems unit isu ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to assess uneces governance and organisational st ructure with respect to ict b determine what is required for the development of uneces strategic plan for ict c assess uneces practices and plans for ict agai nst the global ict strategy of the secretariat and d identify areas of ict that require the attentio n of uneces management to bring them in line with best practice iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit addressed the general management of ic t within unece and focused on the relevant areas of information technology controls t hat fall under the responsibility of the isu it d id not examine the it controls over individual applica tion systems or the functionality aspects of such systems 6 oios sought to obtain an understanding of the co mputer environment at unece organization systems and key performance indicato rs through the completion of questionnaire set of tailored audit programmes in the form of nother questionnaire covering all the audit objectives was developed on the basis of the above and discussions with relevant personnel during the audit oios analysed applicable data and review ed the available documents and other relevant records interviews were held with selected manager s and staff other managers were invited to meet with the auditors and comment on any ictrelat ed matter they wished to discuss 2 iv audit findings and recommendations governance structure for uneces ict function 1 ict governance at the unece level 7 the governance role for ict within unece is entr usted to the information and communications management group ictmg this is in conformity with the requirements of the secretarygenerals bulletin information and commu nications technology board stsgb200317 which inter alia calls for all departments and offices away from h eadquarters to establish information and communications technol ogy committees stsgb200317 44 this committee would oversee all major decisions re garding new software applications define system and data ownership and monitor itrelated ma tters to see they are in line with the ict strategy of the entity in question and the overall ict strategy of the organization 8 oios is pleased to note that the ictmg has been active with 12 meetings held since it was set up in september 2003 the director statistica l division has been the chairman of the group the ictmg has served as useful forum for the coo rdination of ict activities it has also provided means for ensuring that all ict projects and new systems including those financed by extra budgetary funds follow standard procedures 9 paper entitled towards an estrategy for the unece that was approved by the directors in september 2003 and which included recommendation for setting up the ictmg suggested that that the orientation of the group sh ould be relatively highlevel and with strategic orientation at the same time the group was to ve technical functions thus relieving the and the directors meeting from the burden of takin g technical decisions these two objectives while both valid may not be easy to achieve within the same forum review of the groups meeting minutes and the report by the chairman to s enior management for the period october 2003 to december 2004 shows that the groups meetings ve in fact been more technicallyoriented in this regard the established network of ict focal p oints has crucial role to play as this forum advices exclusively on technical matters 10 oios feels that there is room for more awarenes s of ict policy and strategic issues at the senior management level and that raising the profi of ict would be to the benefit of the commission while the ictmg should serve as the for um for implementing common it policy across the whole of unece for example with regard to the implementation of new systems change control procedures and data security oios is of the opinion that matters concerning ict strategic direction should be discussed in the presence of th executive secretary in the directors meeting in more systematic way recommendation head2right strategic and highlevel ict policy matters should be presented for review and decision by unece senior management at t he directors meeting in more regular way rec 01 3 management response unece accepts recommendation 0 1 implementation january 2006 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of the relevant extract from the meeting minutes an dor agenda as evidence of implementation 2 designating chief ict officer 11 to achieve more effective governance function entities operating in the private and public sectors have created the role of chief information and communications technology officer cio this person would be senior manager or director w ho sits on the board and has overall responsibility for the entitys information technol ogy planning coordination and policy implementation 12 the importance of this role is also being recog nized within the organization as demonstrated by the following examples general assembly resolution 57304 4 reques ted the secretarygeneral inter alia to make proposals on how to reflect the functions of c hief information and communication technology officer of the united nations in the org anizational structure of the organization as suggested by the advisory committee on administr ative and budgetary questions in response the secretariat stated that the project r eview committee of the ict board provides the head of the information technology services div ision as chair of this committee with strong central authority over information and comm unication technology initiatives in the global organization a587 annex ix the joint inspection unit jiu in its report on t he management of information systems in united nations organizations recommended that the executive heads appoint or designate senior official to serve as cio a5882 recommend ation 2 depending on the size of the organization the cio or the official including th chief of an appropriate unit who has cio functions would report directly to the executiv head or to the deputy executive head in charge of programmes the report also recommende d that depending upon organizationspecific circumstances the cio functi ons could be performed by an appropriate unit or in the case of small organizations that ca nnot afford cio by senior official with organizationwide coordinating responsibilities as well as some it knowledge the jiu also recommended the designation or appoint ment of senior official as cio to the united nations high commissioner for refugees a5 9394add1 19 recommendation 7d and in 2004 unhcr recruited nd appointed cio at the d2 level to perform the abovementioned functions 13 the cio would represent unece in external meeti ngs where highlevel policy issues are discussed for example the secretariats ict board as such the role would not duplicate that of the chief isu who would be responsible for all day today matters concerning ict across the commission while the ictmg should continue to form the basis of uneces ict governance structure director designated as cio would facil itate the implementation of ictrelated policies throughout the commission his position would als provide him with an opportunity to identify 4 areas where efficiencies can be achieved list of specific responsibilities that may be assigned to the cio function is attached at annex recommendation head2right unece should define the functions associated with t he role of chief information and communications technology off icer and assign this role to suitablyqualified senior off icial rec 02 management response unece accepts recommendation 02 subject to propos ed substantive change the job description of the chief isu be amended to cover all functions of cio except for the chairing of the ictmg and its classificati on be reviewed and b the ictmg will continue to be chaired by director from user division in the unece the head of isu reports to the deputy executive secretary d2 who has many other responsibilities than resource management assignin g the cio function to an existing d1 would mean to give management responsibility to senior manager outside the line hierarchy between the chief of isu and his supervisor furthermore there are ict professionals at the d1 level in the unece however in order to see the cio function im plemented with its intended weight it has to be carried out by someone whose responsibility incl udes the ict domain for the unece as whole we understand that in larger organizations with an ict division of certain size either the head of this division assumes the role of cio for t he organization and is at the same time included in senior management meetings or the senior manager t whom the head of ict responds and who has responsibilities for other resource components such as human and financial resources carries out these two roles as will be the case in unctad including the chairing of the ict management group the proposal for unece in the report is more in line with the second variant we consider that the alternative way to implement recommendatio n 02 as proposed above which is more in line with the classical organizational model for cio is more appropriate for unece even if this means that the cio function would not be assigned t senior manager at d1 level for the ictmg as body that represent users we are of the pinion that the present arrangement of the chairperson being director at d1 level from the user side should continue implementation second quarter 2006 oios takes note of managements response on the basis of this audit and of similar ones conducted at other entities oios is of the opin ion that assigning the functions of cio to the chief isu whose post is currently at the p4 leve l will not achieve the desired objectives we must emphasise that this is reflection on the ma nagerial or technical competencies of the person currently occupying this post while level of i ct knowledge would be desirable the most important role of the cio would be to act as focal point at the senior management level to see that ict policies are properly implemented throughout th commission in the case of unctad where the post of chief it is at the p5 level manageme nt accepted similar recommendation and this was reflected in the vacancy announcement for the posit ion of director division of management with regard to comment b annex lists the various re sponsibilities that may be delegated to the person who is assigned the role of cio and oios leaves it at executive secretarys discretion whether the ictmg is chaired by the cio or director from the user side oios is reiterating recommendation 02 as originally drafted for consideration by management and will keep it open pending managements response 5 3 the role of the information systems unit 14 isu currently has eight posts five of these ar at the professional level the unit is structured into two sections one dealing with syst ems development and maintenance of inhouse developed systems the other with operations the development section with one information officer and two associate programmers allows for sting by person who is independent of the one who has done the programming 15 isu has been providing support service that i s essentially aimed at ensuring users within the various divisions can access their systems without interruption and that the integrity of data held n these systems is safeguarded while the unit has xpanded its responsibilities from an infrastructure service towards software development the latter s been made possible through the implementation of an outsourcing strategy for ict services 16 while isu is responsible for the uneces core pplication systems there are eight applications that have been developed outside of is u and are run independently none of these systems interface with core application systems such as imis and galaxy but isu has control over systems that are developed implemented and ma intained within the other divisions in some cases divisions operate their own change control p rocedures independently of isu the ictmg is the only forum through which some monitoring by isu can be achieved 17 oios sees the chief of isu as first in the line for ensuring that the commissions overall ict function is maintained at high level this requir participation at the senior management level to properly plan uneces ict services requirements an d to coordinate with the commissions ict service providers 18 the september 2003 paper towards an estrateg for the unece recommended the current role of isu should be extended so that it c an act as provider for software development and maintenance for general and specific division needs oios feels that formal ict strategy still needs to be developed it will also need to take i nto consideration the direction that the commission will be taking in the coming years and may come up with number of options for example the commission may be better served if due to limited available funds software development is further systematically outsourced however isu would be r esponsible for monitoring the development of all applications within unece and see that this com plies with the secretariats global ict policies over systems development and security standards 19 irrespective of the approach towards systems velopment oios is of the opinion that isu should be assigned overall responsibility for the c ommissions ict function in line with this responsibility the chief isu in addition to atte nding ictmg meetings would also attend meetings of the directors recommendation head2right unece should define the ictrelated tasks applicable to the commission and assign responsibility for the ict function inc luding software 6 development and maintenance throughout the commiss ion to the information systems unit and b include the chief isu in meetings of the direc tors when ict issues as such or issues with possible impact on i ct are on the agenda rec 03 management response unece accepts recommendation 03 in order to avoid centralization of all ict related posts recommendation could be accomplished through matrix organization by maintaining the supervisory function in the divi sion and establishing functional reporting line to isu implementation second quarter 2006 january 2006 f or and b respectively oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of documentation evidencing its implementation 4 coordination among entities based in geneva 20 there is presently forum where the entiti based at the palais des nations can discuss policies on ict matters which to some ext ent or other are interdependent entities need to be aware of the constraints imposed by the current infrastructure within unog as well as that planned for the medium term in order to draw up comprehensive and attainable ict strategy for example the plans for setting up data centre wit hin unog and the replacement of the network infrastructure over the next two years are unknown to senior management this will impact on all users and on plans for the provision of services r elated to disaster recovery 21 unece is represented on unogs technology innov ation committee tic however the tic is technical advisory board and does not have mandate for example to approve ict initiatives and projects undertaken by entities based in geneva the tics terms of reference are currently under review with the aim of clarifying i ts mandate and objectives but oios understands that the updated terms of reference will still see the tic focussed on technological matters with the participation of technical people and representa tion from senior management 22 oios feels there is scope for the setting up of an ict board to coordinate aspects of ict such as governance strategic planning and business continuity planning at the geneva level this board would be made up of persons designated as cio and the chiefs of it of the individual entities recommendation head2right unece should coordinate with unogicts and other entities based in geneva to form an ict board at th geneva level rec 04 management response unece fully accepts recommendation 04 the success of establishing an ict board will also depend on other organisation s in geneva implementation second quarter 2006 third quarter 2007 7 oios takes note of managements response and acknow ledges the fact that its successful implementation depends on third parties it will k eep this recommendation open until an ict board at the geneva level has been set up b implementing an ict strategy for unece 1 ict strategy 23 unece does not have formal strategy for infor mation technology systems such plan is necessary to ensure that the commission has the rig ht systems to support its mandate and is able to provide the best service to member states and other users 24 document also titled towards an estrategy for the unece eece1422 dated 22 december 2004 was on the provisional agenda of the sixtieth session of the economic commission for europe oios understands that this is now bein g updated and will be presented at the forthcoming annual session 25 this document provides review of the existing ict initiatives within the various sub programmes but it is more of status report and th little there is by way of strategic direction is set out at very high level in one of its conclusion s the paper does call upon the principal subsidiar bodies to contribute towards the preparation of an unece estrategy and action plan 85 oios also notes that the document does not make ref erence to compliance with ict policies set at the secretarial level and does not take into accoun t the advantages and restrictions of the ict infrastructure within unog 26 the absence of clear and wellstructured ict strategy for unece was identified as an important gap in an internal management paper also entitled towards an estrategy for the unece that was approved by the directors in septe mber 2003 this paper correctly identified the existing shortcomings such as the fact that the ma nagement of ict was technicallyoriented and on needsbasis and was not necessarily in line with the commissions mandate and service orientation one of the benefits of this exercise was the setting up of the ictmg 27 unece needs to develop an ict strategy for the medium term this should take into account the ongoing unece reform process the str ategy should contribute towards improved overall governance and facilitate the drive towards more efficiency and member state satisfaction in particular by providing the infrastructure for bett er access to and dissemination of information by member states 28 considering rapid changes in technology oios i s recommending the drawing up of rolling strategy which can be reviewed at the end of each year and revised accordingly ictrelated funding would be based on the strategy the strategy docum ent would take into consideration the already approved procedures and policies eg the project review committee process within the unece and standards for uneces pcs and laptops 29 as noted in the introductory note by the secret ariat to the december 2004 document the implementation of an estrategy is not resources ne utral it will require input from all business owners oios also appreciates that on number of ict strategic and planning issues unece 8 cannot act unilaterally since these depend on other parties this is an area where unece can work jointly with unog and the other entities based i n geneva recommendation head2right unece ictmg should request the chief isu to coord inate with the commissions business owners to draw up rolli ng strategic plan supporting the commissions mandate and polici for it services and applications covering the next two bie nnia the strategy should continue to use applications and rvices that are already available through other entities such as the information technology service division at headquarters gicts and the icc once approved by the ictmg the ict s trategy should be submitted for review and endorsement by t he directors meeting and the executive secretary and should serv as the basis for determining uneces ict budget requirements for the 2008 2009 biennium rec 05 management response unece accepts recommendation 05 rolling ict stra tegy will be developed for 20072009 the process will start dur ing first quarter 2006 implementation fourth quarter 2006 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of copy of the ict strategy endorsed by executive secretary 2 compliance with the secretariats global ict pol icies 30 uneces ict strategy will need to take into sideration and comply with the global ict policies of the secretariat 31 unece has been represented on the secretariats ict board indirectly through the unog representative in june of this year the executiv secretary wrote to the chairman of the ict board requesting direct representation this was granted and the commission is now represented on the board by the chairman of the ictmg oios welcomes this initiative on the part of unece 32 number of official documents have been issued with the aim of ensuring coherent and coordinated global management of ict initiatives ac ross departments and duty stations these include ga document a55780 information technology in the secretariat plan of action ga document a57620 information and communicatio n technology strategy stsgb200317 information and communications tech nology board stsgb200415 use of information and communicatio n technology resources and data stai200510 information and communication techno logy initiatives 33 oios notes the steps that have been taken by th ictmg which is now monitoring overall systems development within unece and the isu to c omply with the requirements of these official documents these include the setting up of proje ct review committee at the commission level 9 and documenting the procedures to be followed for i ct projects and initiatives including requirement to submit business case for the proje ct in question this procedure has in fact been applied on three occasions 34 it is important that senior management is appra ised of these developments since they also place responsibility on it one appreciates that certain cultures and concepts eg that of busine ss owner are new not only to unece but also to the rganization in general for example business owners should formally take over the ownership of n application once this has been delivered and they are satisfied it meets their requirements but this is something that has practically never taken place recommendations head2right unece isu should continue to ensure that the future strategic pl an for the commissions overall it services and applications i s aligned with the global ict strategy of the united nations secre tariat and remains in conformity with the global ict policies of the secretariat b present senior management with an update on the ict policies and procedures including those pertaining to the i mplementation of new systems that are in place within the united na tions secretariat and c implement procedures for user acceptance testin g and formal signoff of project outputs rec 06 management response unece accepts recommendation 06 implementation will be implemented in parallel with recommendation 05fourth quarter 2006 b during the third quarter of 2006 and c during the first half of 2007 oios takes note of managements response it advic management to try and bring forward as much as possible the implementation of c it wi ll keep this recommendation open pending receipt of documentation evidencing implementation c ict services provided to users 1 service agreements 35 the september 2003 paper towards an estrateg for the unece identified the need for service agreementbased approach towards ict ma nagement as the paper noted this is common practice in the private sector and has also been introduced in certain areas of the secretariat oios has also been recommending the introduction f these types of agreements between the providers and users of ict services at entities whe re they were not yet in place 36 the nature and scope of services that isu is re sponsible to provide to users are only defined in one service agreement with the statistical divis ion for the development and maintenance of the statistical databases network of ict focal poin ts meets on needs basis seven meetings were 10 held in 2004 and seven in 2005 up to 30 september the meetings are chaired by the chief isu 37 oios welcomes the existence of forum that can help it services become more client oriented however the standard services expected f isu should be clearly defined and formalized in service catalogue between isu and unece this service catalogue should be developed in cooperation with the ict focal points and approved by the ictmg any additional services outside the standard catalogue would be defined in bilate ral service delivery agreement between the isu and the division concerned which should also addre ss any resource implications the implementation of these measures should help to cla rify the roles and responsibilities of all the players concerned recommendation head2right unece isu should identify all those ict services that it is mand ated to provide to each of the divisions and the rest of the user comm unity and have these services and respective responsibilities defi ned in service catalogue copy of which should be made available on the intranet and b negotiate bilateral service delivery agreements for any services to be provided in addition to the service catalogue rec 07 management response unece fully accepts recommendation 07 implementation third quarter 2006 b during 2007 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of copy of the service catalogue 2 training 38 the september 2003 paper towards an estrateg for the unece identified the need to increase it training not only for it staff but so for staff in general the report by the chairma n to senior management for the period october 2003 to cember 2004 summarising the work of the ictmg also identified the issue of ict training as an area where improvement can be achieved ictmg members however have not yet reached cons ensus on how the process should be structured and funding allocated 39 funds for ict training are allocated on the bas is of proportionality this could mean that staff training requirements are not addressed in manner that takes into account the commissions overall priorities rather than those of particula r division oios is of the opinion that the ictmg should identify the ict training priorities at an ntity level and develop strategy and set of cri teria for the allocation of these funds 40 isu regularly coordinates training classes for ict with unogs staff development and learning section pilot group of unece users has participated in the europeaninternational computer driving licence ecdlicdl certification oios proposes that all unece staff should 11 obtain ecdlicdl certification recommendation head2right unece ictmg should draw up strategy develop criteria and provid mechanism for the utilization of ictrelated training funds and b set up programme through which all unece staf f will obtain ecdlicdl certification rec 08 management response unece accepts recommendation 08 with proposed min or change whereas clear strategy and transparent mechanis m for the allocation of funds can be developed set of criteria applicable to all types of needs is likely to be too ambitious the generalisation of the ecdl or icdl certificat ion programme will require coordination with sdlsunog any cost for systematic training of staf f in view of the certification and for the certification itself will have to be covered by sd lsunog the ece ict training fund is far too limited for this purpose furthermore sufficient t ime will be necessary before this recommendation will be fully implemented due to their limitation the ict training funds will have to be used for specific and welltargeted actions related both to the various subprogrammes and to the needs of isu staff implementation first half of 2007 b informa lly during 2006 formally starting in 2007 oios takes note of managements response it remai ns of the opinion that setting up some fund allocation criteria is necessary for this exercise to be properly carried out examples of such crite ria may include evidence of demand direct application of acquired knowledgeskills duration cost and willingness to cost share management can set up points system and utilize the training funds accordingly this use of criteria would also show more transparency in the allocation of funds oios will keep this recommendation open pending rec eipt of copy of the training strategy and programme for certification d access security 1 general policies 41 unece does not have documented computer secur ity policy that covers logical and physical access control procedures over its ict sys tems data and equipment such policy would set out the roles and responsibilities regarding ac cess to systems applications and data including data held offline the policy would identify the persons who are assigned the most powerful access rights both within and outside of unece and can v iew or delete the data of others these people should be identifiable and their rights and respons ibilities should be clearly set out and approved by management 42 all requests for new accounts to network resour ces are channelled through the administrative assistants to isu except interns in which case the intern coordinator submits the request isu enables the necessary access rights b taking into consideration the job specific needs once access rights are granted unece does not have formal procedure for identity management there is formal notification to is u with respect to separation or movement of 12 staff members or in cases of contract breaks 43 there are currently unwide rules over confi dentiality the chief of icts said that this falls under the responsibility of unhq and they pla n to act on this the does not yet have clear policy with regard to the retention or deleti on of data after separation oios understands that unece was going to acquire software to assist in ma naging this area but were informed that unhq was going to act on this this matter is still pen ding 2 email system 44 the chief isu is responsible for access contro l over the email system he may not always by informed of terminated employees and consultants in order to close their email account and these accounts may still be accessed remotely via t he internet the chief icts confirmed that unece could run its own retention policy for email such policy is currently employed by isu but it has never been endorsed by the ictmg recommendation head2right unece isu should develop security policy covering all aspects of it security within unece the policy should define the roles nd responsibilities of staff associated with computer security including nonunece staff it should be supported b written procedures over the granting and modification of ac cess rights and the removal of profiles in the case of terminated u sers the security policy would be approved by the ictmg b carrying out periodic or cyclical reviews of ac cess rights to ensure they conform with the policy c implement mechanism eg assign responsibili ty to the executive office or the persons direct supervisor so that isu is immediately informed of all staff movements d followup on the issues of data confidentiality and data retention with the secretariat ict board and establish policy over the granting and admini stering of access rights to the email system including remot access and the closure of email accounts this policy would form part of the overall security policy rec 09 management response unece accepts recommendation 09 reviews of access rights will be carried out on cycle to be determined implementation first half of 2007 oios takes note of managements response it advic management to try and bring forward the implementation of those measures that can be immedi ately taken in hand 13 contingency and business continuity planning 1 backup and recovery of systems 45 isu does not run or operate server or compute r room all of uneces production servers are outsourced to unogicts icc or private compani the backupandrestore services for all production servers are also outsourced to unogicts and icc these services are noted in the respective service agreement security arrangement s over backup media are also the responsibility of the service provider however there is only lim ited explanation of this in either of the agreement s 46 there is mention in either of the agreement s what the providers liability would be if the services were not met it may be difficult for ece to obtain some form of financial compensation given that unogicts and icc are both entities unece should at least establish formalized incidentreporting procedure with its service providers whereby the latter would provide isu with detailed report of any inc ident affecting its systems or data and the action taken to resolve this recommendation head2right unece isu should establish formalized incidentreporting proce dure with its service providers b see that responsibility for ensuring proper sec urity arrangements over backup media are detailed in the service agreements with the service providers and c in coordination with icts and icc respectively carry out recovery exercise and determine the optimal period when such an exercise should be conducted the procedures for t his exercise would form part of the disaster recovery plan rec 10 management response unece accepts recommendation 10 but notes that ther is guarantee that the respective service providers will agree on the inclusion of such clauses in particular for changes in the sdas with icc an icc management committee resolution may be required implementation and b fourth quarter 2006 ch ange in service agreements c starting in 2007 oios takes note of managements response it advic management to try and bring forward the implementation of c and will keep the recommendat ion open pending receipt of supporting documentation evidencing implementation 2 disaster recovery and business continuity planni ng 47 unece does not have plan aimed at ensuring th at in the event of major disaster affecting its computer facilities management would be able t mobilise alternate arrangements for processing data and continue to provide its core services effi ciently while the facilities are being properly restored 14 48 business continuity planning bcp is wide in s cope and requires input from all user departments senior management needs to be aware of the wider aspects of bcp and the fact that this is not something that is restricted to or can be h andled solely by isu 49 bcp also requires coordination with external pa rties such as the suppliers of hardware software and communications service and equipment in the case of unece this means close coordination with unogicts icc and the informatio n technology services division itsd at unhq in new york it also places restrictions on h ow far the commission can move ahead for example unogicts has acquired storage area netw ork san this will undergo test period of about 6 months and it will not be possible to pe rform simulation of disaster scenario until the lines are in place unece should monitor developme nts in this area 50 an effective business continuity plan needs to be preceded by risk assessment to define the missioncritical functions and data and the system s supporting them unogicts in cooperation with itsd is leading this project for the in ge neva first assessment of clients needs using business impact analysis bia has been carried out but this will probably need revisiting business owners need to correctly identify and define the ssioncritical data oios understands that there has been significant divergence in the business own ers interpretation of which data is mission critical the importance of data also needs to be evaluated at the entity level recommendation head2right unece ictmg should collaborate with unogicts and unhqitsd and hold workshop for the members of the ictmg to advice on the categorization of missioncritical systems and data this would take into consideration any changes resulting from the ongoing reform of unece and b draw up project plan for the implementation f business continuity plan that details the stages to be follo wed to ensure that the critical business functions are properly recove red and become operational within acceptable timeframes rec 11 management response unece
