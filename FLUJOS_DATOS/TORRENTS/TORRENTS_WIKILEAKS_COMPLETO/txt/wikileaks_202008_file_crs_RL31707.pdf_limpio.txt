relatively high educational and social standards political social and economic development has however been seriously constrained by ethnic conflict between the majority sinhalese and minority tamil ethnic groups since 1983 separatist war costing at least 70000 lives has been waged against government forces by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte rebel group that seeks to establish separate state or internal selfrule in the tamildominated areas of the north and east the united states designated the ltte as foreign terrorist organization in 1997 and demands the tigers lay down their arms and foreswear the use of force before that status can change norwegianbrokered peace process begun in the late 1990s produced february 2002 permanent ceasefire agreement the colombo government and the ltte held their first peace talks in seven years in 2002 with the rebels indicating they were willing to accept autonomy rather than independence for tamilmajority regions the two sides agreed in principle to seek solution through federal structure yet the period 20042005 witnessed increasing instability within the ranks of both the colombo government and the ltte this was exacerbated by wrangling over administration of foreign aid in response to massive december 2004 tidal wave that killed up to 35000 citizens in sri lankas worstever natural disaster political rivalry between the sri lankan freedom party slfp and the united national party unp has long hindered peace efforts the united peoples freedom alliance coalition of the slfp and the staunch marxist peoples liberation front jvp won slim majority in 2004 parliamentary elections and defeated the unp to replace its thenprime minister ranil wickremesinghe with perceived hardliner mahinda rajapaksa who himself went on to win the presidency in narrow 2005 electoral victory rajapaksa stabilized his position by enticing the defection of several unp and muslim party parliamentarians in early 2007 but his government has faced constant pressure from the jvp and from hardline buddhistnationalist parties that are part of the ruling coalition meanwhile the ltte suffered major schism in 2004 when top commander in the east known as colonel karuna broke away with up to 6000 cadres and began collaborating with government forces ethnic violence spiked in mid2006 and with major government military offensives in 2007 and colombos formal withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement in january 2008 fullscale civil war again appears to be at hand us policy supports peaceful efforts to reform sri lankas democratic political system in way that provides for full political participation of all communities it does not endorse the establishment of another independent state on the island since sri lankan independence in 1948 the united states has provided more than 36 billion in assistance funds about twothirds of this in the form of food aid direct nonfood aid for fy2007 is estimated at 94 million serious human rights problems in sri lanka are blamed on all major parties to the ethnic conflict and have led to some limited us and international aid sanctions this report will be updated periodically

did not mark declaration of war against the tigers and came in response to more than 10000 alleged ceasefire violations by the ltte the countrys defense ministry claimed the withdrawal was necessitated to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of sri lanka in the backdrop of ltte terrorism and the tigers unwavering intention to establish monoethnic monopolitical separate

indias deccan peninsula the island nation was settled by successive waves of migration from india beginning in the 5th century bce indoaryans from northern india established sinhalese buddhist kingdoms in the central part of the island tamil hindus from southern india settled in the northeastern coastal areas establishing kingdom in the jaffna peninsula beginning in the 16 th century sri lanka was colonized in succession by the portuguese dutch and english becoming the britis h crown colony of ceylon in 1815 in the late 19th century tamil laborers were brought from india to work british tea and rubber plantations in the southern highlands known as indian tamils the descendants of these workers currently comprise 5 of sri lankas population and are clustered in the south central tea country descendants of earlier tamil arrivals known as sri lankan or ceylon tamils constitute up to 12 of the countrys population and live predominantly in the north and east moorish and malay muslims largely sunni account for another 8 of the population the majority of sri lankans about threequarters are ethnic sinhalese most of them buddhist 9 in 1972 ceylon was renamed sri lanka resplendent land as it was known in indian epic literature although ceylon gained its independence from britain peacefully in 1948 succeeding decades have been marred by ethic conflict between the countrys sinhalese majority clustered in the densely populated south and west and largely hindu tamil minority living in the northern and eastern provinces following independence the tamilswho had attained educational and civil service predominance under the britishincreasingly found themselves discriminated against by the sinhalesedominated government which made sinhala the sole official language and gave preferences to sinhalese in university admissions and government jobs the sinhalese who had deeply resented british favoritism toward the tamils saw themselves not as the majority however but as minority in large tamil sea that includes 60 million tamils just across the palk strait in indias southern state of tamil nadu 9 us department of state background notes sri lanka

political violence the countrys political life has long featured struggle between two broad umbrella parties the sri lanka freedom party slfp and the united national party unpboth dominated by prominent family clusters since independence the two parties have frequently ternated in power in the simplest terms the slfp may be viewed as more sinhala nationalist statist and social democratic while the unp may be viewed as more westernoriented liberal and open to free market economics10 initially sri lanka followed the westminster parliamentar model in 1978 however the unp instituted strong executive presidential system of government under this frenchstyle system the popularly elected president has the power to dissolve the 225member unicameral parliament and call new elections as

relatively more open to talks with the tamil rebels his bitter personal rivalry with president kumaratunga reportedly hampered progress in peace negotiations an april 2004 national election was held to restore the parliament dissolved by kumaratunga in those polls the united peoples freedom alliance upfa coalition composed of the p opulist slfp and the staunch marxistleninist sinhalese nationalist peoples liberation front jvp took plurality of the seats in parliament and so ousted the unp the upfa won 105 seats and nearly 46 of the vote as compared to the unp which won 82 seats and about 38 of the vote the unps defeat was attributed in part to perception among voters that too many concessions were being made to the ltte in peace negotiations an eu election observation mission noted some problems with the conduct of the 2004 polls but called them vast improvement in comparison to past exercises 15

october date for renewed peace negotiations approached president rajapaksa sought to find common ground with the countrys main opposition unp resulting threepage memorandum of understanding signed by rajapaksa and opposition leader wickremesinghe gave the peace process boost with the two leaders agreeing to adopt bipartisan approach to conflict resolution the pact represented rare expression of political unity especially among the fractious sinhalese of the countrys sinhaladominated south 18 rajapaksa also at this time constituted an all party representative committee aprc as part of an effort to create constitutional proposals that would represent political consensus on powersharing between the islands majority and minority ethnic communities after the october peace talks with the rebels talks failed to make progress president rajapaksa changed his political strategy and in january 2007 was able to secure simple 113seat parliamentary majority for his coalition by offering ministerial positions to lure 19 parliamentarians from the unp and another 6 from the muslim congress into defection from the opposition benches the crossovers put damper on bipartisanship in colombo by spurring the unps withdrawal from the aprc and served to further deepen the slfpunp rift the adjustment did however ease rajapaksas previous dependence on his hardline and oftentimes unpredictable marxist jvp and buddhist jhu allies potentially making deal with the rebels more attainable the jhu in particular has been at the forefront of resurgent sinhalese buddhist nationalism that adamantly opposes tamil autonomy in the north and that has played role in some recent human rights violations 19 by the end of 2007 some senior members of rajapaksas cabinet were openly calling for blanket ban on the ltte and formal end to the 2002 truce20 jvp leaders convinced that unp administration would only deepen the countrys woes have rejected opposition efforts to bring down the slfpled coalition government21 the rajapaksa government vowed to hold locallevel elections by the end of 2007 as part of controversial devolution plan however the preference of president rajapaksa and his party is to devolve power at the district level only not at higher level as demanded by the tigers in the absence of compromise by the ruling coalition on this key point crossparty effort to forge consensus is unlikely to succeed moreover serious doubt has been cast on the ability of the aprc which has not included representatives of the tamil national alliance to reach consensus on any proposals that could win the requisite twothirds parliamentary majority for passage an aprc report due in january 2008 is expected to call for unitary sri lanka state in the sense it shall be deemed to be an undivided

of the ltte headed by the supreme commander of the ltte veluppillai prabhakaran and took an estimated 6000 soldiers with him colonel karuna then called for separate truce with the government factional fighting ensued between karunas splinter group and the northern faction of the ltte resulting in prabhakarans reassertion of control over the eastern areas where karuna had previously operated the karuna factions ongoing influence has done significant damage to the longstanding ltte claim to be the sole representative of sri lankas tamil people since the 2004 schism colonel karuna and those loyal to him apparently have fought in cooperation with government forces although colombo continues to deny any link with the breakaway faction 23 karuna himself was arrested in london in november 2007 while traveling on forged passport possibly supplied by the colombo government24 the karuna group along with the ltte and sometimes government forces is widely accused of abusing human rights in the course of its struggle especially through the recruitment of child soldiers the united states has called on colombo to exert control over paramilitary groups such as karunas that are believed to commit human rights abuses against the sri lanka people25 g7g157g145g151g146g140g561g5g152g151g143g149g146g140g157g561g138g151g141g561g5g146g159g146g149g561g25g138g155g561 combination of communal politics as practiced by both sinhalese and tamil political leaders and deteriorating economic conditions created deep schisms in sri lankan society through the early decades of independence by the 1970s the government was facing tamil unrest in the north and east while the sinhalese marxist jvp waged terrorist campaign against tamils in the central and southern regions periodic rioting against tamils in the late 1970s and early 1980s culminating in the devastating communal riots of 1983 spawned the creation of several militant tamil groups that sought to establish by force tamil homeland to include the northern and eastern provinces the liberation tigers of tamil eelam led by its charismatic founder and chief strategist velupillai prabhakaran was established in 1976 and emerged as the strongest and best organized of these groups fullscale separatist war broke out in the north following july 1983 riots in which several thousand tamils were killed in retaliation for the slaying of 13 sinhalese soldiers by separatist tamil militants more than two decades of ensuing war have claimed some 70000 lives and displaced between 800000 and 16 million people most of whom remain in transit camps with little hope of returning to their homes in the foreseeable future each of four major attempts at peaceful settlement has ended in failure and further violence ceasefire agreement cfa brokered by the norwegian government in february 2002 was formally abrogated by the colombo government in january 2008 according to the colombo governments secretariat for coordinating the peace process nearly 4200 ceasefire violations occurred from february 2002april 2007 when the list was most recently updated the great majority of these about 92 being committed by the ltte more than half

government and the tigers for widespread abuses and in 2006 the norwegian general overseeing the ceasefire asserted that he could distinguish significant difference in the gravity of truce and human rights violations by either side27 according to the sri lankan ministry of defense the period december 2005 to october 2007 saw total of 5888 sri lankans killed in the countrys ethnic conflict including 3696 ltte members 1322 security forces and 870 civilians28 determining the true situation on the ground in conflict zones is difficult given fierce propaganda campaign being fought by both

its defense capabilities and levels of training have improved morale too has been bolstered likely contributing to battlefield successes in 2006 and 2007 which themselves further burnished the militarys selfimage over the decades of sri lankan independence the countrys military s become increasingly dominated by ethnic sinhalese meaning that in much of the northern and eastern provinces it

of historical habituation of the tamilspeaking peoples based on federal structure within united sri lanka 44 this language marked significant concession from both parties the colombo government for

effort to revitalize the peace process and prevent its devolution back into further conflict these init iatives followed meeting of the tigers with constitutional experts in paris meeting that was part of the tigers effort to respond to sri lankan government proposal for an interim administration in the northeast of sri lanka major concession by the government to tiger demands which were prerequisite for further talks 50 for their part the ltte had previously made the key concession that it would settle for an autonomy agreement rather than its previous goal of separate state despite such concessions by both sides peace agreement was not guaranteed the ltte indicated that it would once again seek secession and an independent state if substantial autonomy was not achieved through the negotiation process 51 the colombo government was at that time split between more conciliatory faction represented by president chandrika kumaratunga and more hardline faction represented by the jvp the unp opposition was regarded as the major party most willing to negotiate with the ltte in order to end the conflict many observers believed this was due to the fact that large portion of unp political support comes from sri lankas business classes whose success in turn depends on limiting the impact of uncertainty and instability which the conflict creates it was hoped that the ltte would respond to the governments offer and rejoin peace negotiations by the end of september 2003 an earlier proposal for an interim administration was rejected by the ltte the government continued having difficulty making offers as some observers noted that constitutionally viable solution would require the consent of the more hardline faction in the government led by the jvp which was on record as opposed to further concessions to the ltte 52 the international community made an effort to support the dialogue process by offering inducements for peace the international donors conference held in

remained deadlocked for more than two years with the ltte continuing to insist on interim selfrule in the tamil northeast as the basis of resumption of negotiations the government expressed desire that the ltte restate its willingness to explore federal solution to the conflict and colombo also requested that discussion of an interim self governing authority isga be part of comprehensive peace discussion and not precondition of such negotiations moreover divisions within both the government and the ltte cast pervasive doubt on the eventual outcome of the peace talks the crisis continued beyond the april 2004 elections and was exacerbated in 2005 by number of factors including tensions between the slfp and its jvp coalition partners over the privatization of the university educational system and the petroleum sector the possibility of joint governmentltte distribution mechanism for foreign aid to ltte controlled areas in response to the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the prospect of peace agreement that would grant greater autonomy to the tamilcontrolled north and east the jvp strongly opposes each of these options and has made numerous threats to withdraw from the united peoples freedom alliance move that would deprive the ruling coalition of its parliamentary majority 56 following the mid2004 ltte schism there were numerous instances of political and military operatives being killed by each side as they jockey for power in the east the ltte accuses colonel karuna and those loyal to him of cooperating with sri lankan army sla paramilitaries and special

abrogation of the cfa as part of politically expeditious decision to placate hardline marxist and buddhist parties in return for their continued support of the ruling coalition86 potential obstacle to any peace deal in the near and middleterm is the continuing political division between the jvp and the slfp as regards any settlement of autonomy or selfgoverning aspects of any eventual peace deal the jvp has threatened to withdraw from the current ruling coalition if any agreement is reached which they allege might impinge national sovereignty and the jhu represents an virulent and influential form of sinhalese majoritarianism the capacity of these nationalist actors to mobilize sinhala nationalist sentiments poses deep problems for the future of the peace process as it threatens to draw mainstream political actors back into more nationalist strategies for political survival it also serves to challenge the legitimacy of governing coalitions or through the use of coalitional veto bring

evidence that the tsunami weakened the ltte through the destruction of many of its naval assets and the loss of at least 1000 of its cadres 93 the sri lankan navy also saw significant damage to some of its southern coastal facilities the single most costly event in terms of human lives was the complete destruction of train traveling along coastal railroad track more than 2000 people died in this single incident94 fortunately projected outbreak of disease following the tsunami never materialized president bush expressed condolences to the sri lankan people over the terrible loss of life and

exchange earners the first country in south asia to liberalize its economy sri lanka began an ongoing process of market reform and privatization of stateowned industries in 1977 many observers attribute the ability of the national economy to thrive even in the midst of civil war to these successful reforms privatization efforts have slowed in recent years however since 2001 both tourism and investor confidence previously on the rebound have been negatively affected by major ltte terrorist attacks and renewed political instability sri lankas entire economy has also suffered as result of recent prolonged drought the worst in two decades related hydroelectric power shortages and the worldwide economic downturn around the turn of the century the country experienced its first ever recorded recession in 2001 with negative gdp growth rate of 14 the unpled coalition government that came to power under thenprime minister wickremesinghe in late 2001 sought to institute program of sweeping economic reforms and liberalization stabilization efforts were based on reduced government expenditures while structural reforms included downsizing the bureaucracy selling off stateowned businesses and reforming labor and land laws to encourage the freer operation of market mechanisms the united states and other external donor countries sought to support this reform effort with greatly increased aid according to one source external aid rose more than fourfold from 2002 to 2003 however this same analysis is among those that fault the wickremesinghe government for pursuing this tack while failing to link it to the ongoing peace process from this perspective the stalemating of that processand the unps 2004 election defeatcould be traced to an economic reform program that alienated many so cial classes within short period of time without offering any benefits in return 98 despite the existence of considerable obstacles not least being renewed civil war current statistics show sri lankas economy to be performing relatively well the economy grew by an estimated 61 in 2007 led by services sector that accounts for more than half of gdp short term projections

points of gdp to gross domestic savings by 2010 fdi is projected at around 2 of gdp compared to less than1 in the past decade 100 nearly all commentators agree that continued escalation in ethnic violence will negatively impact the economy especially by reducing investor confidence and by further damaging the vital tourism sector the civil war continues to place heavy burden on the countrys economy as well as to hinder its future potential defense expenditures as percentage of gdp have doubled since 1980 aside from defense spending other costs of the war include damage to infrastructure

provides for full political participation of all communities it does not endorse the establishment of another independent state on the island the bush administration has vowed to play role in multilateral efforts to settle the conflict and to assist in the rebuilding of wartorn areas the united states and sri lanka signed new trade and investment framework agreement tifa in 2002 however the political instability of subsequent years set back the time frame for any possible free trade agreement fta and relevant negotiations were put on hold pending positive developments in peace

colombo the lead us diplomat for the region assistant secretary of state for south and central asia richard boucher outlined key us concerns about the way things have been heading in sri lanka first among these was the negative impact that armed ethnic conflict was having on the people both directly through terrorism and human rights abuses and indirectly by harming the countrys economy in the area of human rights secretary boucher placed special emphasis on the increased incidence of abductions and unlawful killings as well as on widespread reports of government attempts to intimidate the press he acknowledged that the government of president rajapaksa had voiced commitment to upholding human rights but said lot more needs to be done both in dealing with the behavior of government security forces and in contro lling paramilitaries often euphemism for the karuna faction which broke away from the ltte in 2004 he conveyed to sri lankan political leaders of all stripes the us position that consensus through the all parties representative committeea consensus that identifies for the tamil community their role in the island their place their control over various levels of government and their own livesrepresented the best basis for future progress toward conflict resolution 103 in august 2007 testimony before the house foreign affairs committee state department official offered that sri lankas longstanding ethnic conflict fr agile peace process and deteriorating human rights conditions continue to cause concern for the united states and the international

projects to promote interethnic dialogue and by helping to fund humanitarian relief programs overseen by save the children the childrens fund the world food program and the international committee of the red cross the us state department first designated the ltte as foreign terrorist organization in 1997105 in 2003 thendeputy secretary of state armitage reiterated that if the ltte can move beyond the terror tactics of the past and make convincing case through its conduct and its actual actions that it is committed to political solution and to peace the united states will certainly consider removing the ltte from the list of foreign terrorist organizations as well as any other terrorismrelated designations 106 the ltte has rejected calls that it renounce violence saying it will do so only when the aspirations of the tamil people are met by political settlement the usled global anti terrorism campaign which reportedly has resulted in the international withholding of several billion dollars from the ltte and made it more difficult for the group to acquire weapons was likely factor in the rebels decision to enter into peace negotiations in late 2001 107

document the scope of the countrys humanitarian crisis129 the us state department in its sri lanka country report on human rights practices 2006 issued in march 2007 determined that the colombo governments respect for the human rights of its citizens declined in 2006 due in part to the breakdown of the ceasefire agreement130 states supporting human rights and democracy the us record 2006 issued in april 2007 provided an overview of the major human rights concerns as result of the escalating hostilities between the government and ltte and numerous violations of the ceasefire agreement by bot h sides overall respect for human rights declined in the affected areas there were numerous credible reports that armed paramilitary groups suspected of being linked to the govern ment and security forces participated in armed attacks during the year human rights monitors also reported arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces poor prison conditions denial of fair and public

g344g351g561 g561such perceived problems included proposed anticonversion laws and legal restrictions and sporadic attacks on christian churches the us government found change in the status of respect for religious freedom in sri lanka in 2007 with regard to human trafficking the state departments latest annual report issued in june 2007 determined that colombo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do so and it placed sri lanka on the tier 2 watch list for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to address trafficking over the previous year especially in its efforts to punish trafficking for involuntary servitude 134 during his august 2007 visit to sri lanka top humanitarian official noted that dozens of aid agency staff had been reported killed on the island since january 2006 and he identified sri lanka as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for humanitarian workers colombo condemned the remarks calling them contribution to forces devoted to discrediting the sri lankan government 135 the worst such attack in recent years involved the august 2006 murder of 17 local aid workers employed by french nongovernmental organization operating near trincomalee colombo vowed to pursue full investigation of the massacre but much suspicion fell upon government security forces themselves as being complicit given that such an attack was seen to serve tactical purpose for the tigers one year later with arrests made in the case and rights groups demanding swifter government action top colombo official appeared to lay blame on the french ngo itself for sending its employees into known combat zone 136 in august 2007 new yorkbased human rights watch issued sharp critique of sri lankas worsening human rights situation focusing particular attention on dramatic increase in abuses by government forces since 2006 and on colombos alleged responsibility for unlawful killings enforced disappearances and other serious human rights violations most of them affecting members of the countrys tamil and muslim minorities the sri lankan government rejected most of the allegations as baseless and unsubstantiated saying that its largely successful efforts to resolve issues such as disappearances and internal displacement had been ignored137 london based amnesty international has called on the u n human rights council unhrc to address growing number of reported human rights violations by all parties to the conflict including failures to protect civilians attacks on journalists and persistent climate of impunity that it said required systematic monitoring and urgent investigations 138
