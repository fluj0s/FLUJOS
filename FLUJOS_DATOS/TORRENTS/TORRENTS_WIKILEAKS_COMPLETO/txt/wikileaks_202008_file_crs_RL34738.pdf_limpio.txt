capehart specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34738cellulosic biofuels analysis of policy issues for congress summary cellulosic biofuels are produced fro m cellulose derive d from renewable biomass they are thought by many to hold the key to increased benefits from renewable biofuels because they are made from lowcost diverse nonfood feedstocks cellulosic biofuels could also potentially decrease the fossil energy required to produce ethanol resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions cellulosic biofuels are produced on very small scale at this time significant hurdles must be overcome before comme rcialscale production can occur the renewable fuels standard rfs ma jor federal incentive mandates 100 million gallons per year mgpy of cellulosic bi ofuels use in 2010 after 2015 most of the increase in the rfs is intended to come from cellulosic biofuels and by 2022 the mandate for cellulosic biofuels will be 16 billion gallons whether these targets can be met is uncertain research is ongoing and the cellulosic biofuels industry may be on the verge of rapid expansion and t echnical breakthroughs however at this time only two small refineries are sche duled to begin pr oduction in 2009 and an additional nine are expected to commen ce production by 2011 for total output of 300 mgpy per year compared with an rfs requirement of 500 mgpy in 2012 the federal government recognizing the risk inherent in commercializing this new technology has provided loan guarantees grants and tax credits in an effort to make the industry competitive by 2012 in particular the food conservation and energy act of 2008 the 2008 farm bill p l 110246 supports the nascent cellulosic industry through authorized research programs grants and loans exceeding 1 billion the enacted farm bill also c ontains production tax credit of 101 per gallon for ethanol produced from cellulosic f eedstocks private investment in many cases by oil companies also plays major role in cellulosic biofuels research and development three challenges must be overcome if the rfs is to be met first cellulosic feedstocks must be available in large vol umes when needed by refineries second the cost of converting cellulose to ethanol or other biofuels must be reduced to level to make it competitive with gasoline and cornstarch ethanol third the marketing distribution and vehicle in frastructure must absorb the increasing volumes of renewable fuel including cellulosi c fuel mandated by the rfs congress will continue to face questi ons about the appr opriate level of intervention in the cellulosic industry as it bates both the risks in trying to pick the winning technology and the bene fits of providing startup incentives the current tax credit for cellulosic biofuels expires in 2012 but its extension may be considered during the 111th congress congress may continue to debate the role of biofuels in food price inflation and whether cellulosic bi ofuels can alleviate its impacts recent congressional action on cellulosi c biofuels has focused on the definition of renewable biomass eligible for the rfs which is considered by some

analysis of policy issues for congress introduction cellulosic biofuels are produced from cellulose1 derived from renewable biomass feedstocks such as corn stover pla nt matter left in the field after harvest switchgrass wood chips and other plan t or waste matter current production consists of few small scale pilot pr ojects and significant hurdles must be overcome before industrial scale production can occur ethanol produced from corn starch and biodiesel produced from vegetable oil primarily soybean oil are currently the primary us biofuels2 high oil and gasoline prices environmental concerns rural development and national energy security have driven interest in domestic biofuels for many years however the volume of fuel that can be produced usin g food crops without causing major market disruptions is limited to fulfill stated goal s biofuels must also come from nonfood sources proponents see cellulosic biofuels as potential solution to these challenges and support government incentives and privat investment to hasten efforts towards commercial production some federal incentives grants loans tax credits and direct government research attempt to push cellulosic biofuels technology to the marketplace demandpull mechanisms such as the renewable fuel standard rfs mandate the use of biofuel blends creating an incentive for the development of new technology to enter the marketplace in contrast petroleum industry critic s of biofuel incentives argue that technological advances such as seismogr aphy drilling and ex traction continue to expand the fossilfuel resource base whic h has traditionally been cheaper and more accessible than biofuel supplies other cr itics argue that curre nt biofuel production strategies can only be economically comp etitive with existing fossil fuels in the absence of subsidies if significant impr ovements to existing technologies are made or new technologies are veloped until such technological breakthroughs are achieved critics contend that the subsidies distort energy markets and divert research funds from the development of other rene wable energy sources not dependent on internal combustion technology such as wind solar or geothermal which offer potentially cleaner more bountif ul alternatives still ot hers debate the rationale behind policies that promote biofuels for energy security questioning whether the united states could ever produce and mana ge sufficient feedstocks of starcheshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34738crs2 3 for more information on the rfs see crs report rl34265 selected issues related to an

oils or even cellulose to permit biofuel produc tion to meaningfully offset petroleum imports finally there are those who argue that the focus on development of alternative ergy sources undermines efforts to score energy savings through lower consumption the renewable fuel standard mandatory usage mandate principal among the cellulosic biofuels goals to be met is biofuels usage mandate the renewable fuel standa rd rfs as expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 section 202 that includes specific carveout for cellulosic biofuels3 the rfs is demandpull mechanism that provides stimulus mandate that can be met using wide array of technologies and fuels although most of the rfs is expected to be met using corn ethanol initially over time the share of advanced non corn starch derived biofuels in meeting the mandate increases the rfs mandate for cellulosic biofuels begins at 100 million gallons per year in 2010 and ri ses to 16 billion gallons per year in 2022 figure 1 this mandate represents prodigious challenge to the biofuels industry in light of the fact that commercial pr oduction of cellulosic biofuels yet exists source eisa pl 110140

but there are significant hurdles to overcome before competitiveness is reached in his 2007 state of the union address president bush announced the twenty in ten initiative calling for the rapid expansion of renewable biofuels production as major part of an effort to reduce us gasoline use by 20 through biofuels and conservation this go was given substance in december 2007 when congress passed eisa mandating the rfs for the use of specific volumes of rene wable biofuels through 2022 and setting goal of commercialscale cellulosic biofuels production by 2012 this report provides background on the cu rrent effort to develop industrial scale competitive technology to produce bi ofuels from cellulosic feedstocks it outlines the three major challenges faced in the context of the rfs 1 feedstock supply 2 extraction of fuel from cellu lose and 3 biofuel distribution and marketing issues it then examines the current role of government in cooperation with private industry in developing that technology finally the report reviews the role of congress with respect to the emer ging cellulosic biofuels industry reviews recent congressional actions affecting th industry and disc usses key questions facing congress cellulosic feedstock supplies feedstocks used for cellulosic biofue ls are abundant and diverse and are of immense potential to the industry one majo r advantage of cellulosic biofuels over cornstarch ethanol is that they can be derived from potentially inexpensive feedstocks that can be produced on marginal land5 corn on the other hand is resourceintensive crop that requires significant use of chemicals fertilizers and water and is generally grown on prime farmland cellulose combined with hemicellulose and lignin provides structural rigidity to plants and is also present in plant derived products such as paper and cardboard feedstocks high in cellulose come from ag ricultural forest and even urban sources see table 1 agricultural sources include cr op residues and biomass crops such as switchgrass forest sources include tree plantations natural forests and cuttings from forest management operations municipal solid waste

material and may also contain hazardous ma terial that is expensive to remove in general calculation of the estimated cost of biofuels produc tion does not reflect environmental or related impacts but such impacts are relevant to overall consideration of biofuels issues biomass feedstocks are bulky and diffi cult to handle presenting the industry with major challenge whether feedstocks are obtained from agriculture or forests specialized machinery would need to be developed to harvest and handle large volumes of bulky biomass for instance harvesting corn for both grain and stover would be more efficient with onepass machine capable of simultaneously segregating and processing both co mbination forage and grain harvester currently machines such as these are be ing developed to handle biomass crops but few are commercially available6 storage facilities capab of keeping immense volumes in optimal conditions must also be developed if an industry is to growhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34738crs5 7

byproducts of production processes such as producing grain and so their produc tion costs are minimal corn stover7 and rice and wheat straw are abundant agricultu ral residues with biomass potential8 among different residues corn stover has attr acted the most attention for biofuels production when harvesting stover sufficien t crop residue must be left in place to prevent erosion and maintain soil fertility up to 60 of some residuals can be removed without detrimental soil nutrition or erosion ffects results from early trials suggest the potential ethanol yield from corn stover not including the grain harvested which could be used for feed or fuel is approximately 180 gallons of ethanol per acre this compares with roughly 425 gallons of cornstarch ethanol9 from grain and 662 gallons per acre of sugar cane in brazil when grown as dedicated energy crops10 prairie grasses perennial prairie grasses include native species which were common before the spread of agriculture and nonindigenous species some of which are now quite common switchgrass is na tive perennial grass that once covered american prairies and is potential source of biomass its high density and native immunity to diseases and pests have caused many to focus on its use as cellulosic feedstock according to research at the university of tennessee the 10foot tall grass if harvested after frost will produce for 10 to 20 years however like other perennials switchgrass takes some time to establish according to field trials in the first year of production yields are estimate d at 30 two tons per acre of the full yield potential in the second year yield is about 70 five tons per acre and in the third year yields reach full potential at seven tons per acre11 the equivalent of 50012 to 1000

residues from logging nd other removals and residue from fire prevention treatments extracting and pro cessing forest biomass can be expensive because of poor accessibility transportati on and labor availability more efficient and specialized equipment than currently exists is needed for forest residual recovery to become cost effective18 commercial tree plantations perennial woody crops are another source of woody biomass compared to prairie gra sses perennial woody crops such as hybrid poplar willow and eucalyptus trees are relatively slow to mature and require harvesting at long intervals 24 year in tervals for willow or 815 years for poplar using specialized equipment harvesting usua lly occurs in the winter when trees are converted to chips on site and then transpor ted to the refinery for processing some trees such as willow resprout after cutting and can be harvested again after few years19 an acre of woody biomass ie hybrid poplar yields an estimated 700 gallons of

several reasons including the claim that it ignores the costs and difficulties likely to be associated with harvesting or collecting woody biomass as well as the charge that it uses optimistic yield growth assumptions to achieve its biomass tonnages the usda estimate also predates the definition of renewable biomass eligible for the rfs current provisions restrict the use of woody biomass to

particularly in the case of woody biomass feedstocks fro m forested areas not suitable for crops31 multiyear crop cycles arrangements for producing perennial crops would necessarily reflect their multiyear cycles producers whether they own or rent land can expect reduced returns while the crop becomes established producers renting land would need longterm agreements suitable for multiyear crops some suggest legal framework would have to be developed for multiyear harvests for example the university of tennessee has entered into threeyear contracts with producers to ensure switchgrass availability for pilo t refinery scheduled to begin producing ethanol in 200932 extracting fuel from cellulose conversion breaking down cellulose and converting it into fuel requires complex chemical processing technology that is now rudimentary and expensive see table 2 starches such as corn and sugars suc h as cane sugars are easily fermented into alcohol but cellulose must first be sepa rated from hemicellulose and lignin and then broken down into sugars or starch through enzymatic processes33 alternatively biomass can be thermochemically conve rted into synthesis gas syngas34 which can then be used to produce variety of fuels regardless of the pathway as discussed below at the present time processing cellulose into fuels is expensive relative to other conventional and altern ative fuel options production processes three basic methods are used to convert cellulose into fuels 1 acid hydrolysis dilute or concentrated 2 enzymatic hydrolysis and 3 thermochemical gasification and

would need to be blended into gasoline to fulfill the rising advanced biofuel mandate distributi on bottlenecks distribution issues may hinder the efficient delivery of ethanol to retail outlets ethanol mostly produced in the midwest would need to be transported to more populated areas for sale it cannot be sh ipped in pipelines designed for gasoline because it tends to attract water in gasoline pipelines the current ethanol distribution system is dependent on rail cars tanker trucks and barg because of competition options especially rail cars are often limited as noncorn bi ofuels play larger role some infrastructure concerns may be alleviated as producti on is more widely dispersed across the nation if biomassbased diesel substitutes are produced in much larger quantities some of these infrastructure issues may be mitigated however ethanol would need to be stored in unique storage tanks and blended immediately before pumping this would require fu rther infrastructure

implications for sustainable agriculture and energy in the 21st century table 101 p 127 june 2006economic and environmental issues economic efficiency cellulosic biofuels are generally thought to have favorable economic efficiency potential over cornstarch etha nol primarily because of th low costs of production for feedstocks however current nrel estimate s of the total cost of producing cellulosic ethanol including feedstock production and supply and conversion are 240 per gallon more than twice the cost of producing corn ethanol major impediment to the development of cellulosebased ethanol industry is the state of cellulosic conversion tec hnology ie the process of gasifying cellulosebased feedstocks or converting them into fermentable sugars47 does goal of competitiveness in 2012 assumes 130 2 007 dollars per gallon costs for corn stover ethanol based on feedstock price of 13 per ton this compares with usdas estimated cost of producing cornbased ethanol in 2002 of 0958 per gallon about 107 per gallon in 2007 dollars48 in addition the cost of harvesting transporting and storing bulky cellulosic biomass is not well understood and cons equently is often undervalued ethanol competitiveness is highly dependent on gasoline and corn prices higher gasoline prices relative to ethanol improve the competitiveness of ethanol while higher corn prices reduce ethanols

ethanols energy balance over cornbased ethanol relates to byproducts cornbased ethanols coproducts are valued as animal feeds whereas cellulosic ethanols coproducts are expected to serve directly as processing fuel at the plant substan tially increasing energy efficiencies additionally switchgrass uses far less fertiliz er than corn by factor of two or three51 and its perennial growth cycle reduces field passes for planting some suggest that ethanol from switchgrass has at leas t 700 more energy output per gallon than fossil energy input52 the same is largely true of woody biomass that even in plantations requires minimal fertilizer and infrequent planting operations greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions differ among type s of ethanol because of number of factors including the fuel used to power the refinery fossil or renewable and the original state of the land on which the feed stock was produced for instance if virgin forest land were cleared and planted with switchgrass higher greenhouse gas emissions would result than if switchg rass were grown on previouslycleared cropland mainly because ghg emissions asso ciated with clearing and plowing the virgin soil would have to be included as pa rt of the production process likewise cellulosic refinery powered by coal or na tural gas would have higher greenhouse gas emissions than one powered by r ecovered feedstock coproducts multiyear harvesting of perennial crops decreases greenhouse gas emissions by minimizing field passes prairie grasses and woody crops require reduced inputs compared with corn and have lowe r greenhouse gas emissions also because cellulosic feedstocks require far less fertilizer for their production the energy balance benefit of cellulosic ethanol could be significant
