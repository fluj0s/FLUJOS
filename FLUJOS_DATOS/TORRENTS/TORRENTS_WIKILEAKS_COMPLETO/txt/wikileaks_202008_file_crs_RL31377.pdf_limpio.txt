act passed in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks it flows from consultation draft circulated by the department of justice to which congress made substantial modifications and additions the stated purpose of the act is to enable law enforcement officials to track down and punish those responsible for the attacks and to protect against any similar attacks the act grants federal officials greater powers to trace and intercept terrorists communications both for law enforcement and foreign intelligence purposes it reenforces federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations in an effort to deny terrorists the resources necessary for future attacks it tightens our immigration laws to close our borders to foreign terrorists and to expel those among us finally it creates few new federal crimes such as the one outlawing terrorists attacks on mass transit increases the penalties for many others and institutes several procedural changes such as longer statute of limitations for crimes of terrorism critics have suggested that it may go too far the authority to monitor email traffic to share grand jury information with intelligence and immigration officers to confiscate property and to impose new bookkeeping requirements on financial institutions are among the features troubling to some the act itself responds to some of these reservations many of the wiretapping and foreign intelligence amendments sunset on december 31 2005 the act creates judicial safeguards for email monitoring and grand jury disclosures recognizes innocent owner defenses to forfeiture and entrusts

cases but in connection with any criminal investigation and without the extraordinary levels of approval or constraint that mark title iii interception 18 usc 2703 least demanding and perhaps least intrusive of all is the procedure that governs court orders approving the governments use of trap and trace devices and pen registers kind of secret caller id which identify the source and destination of calls made to and from particular telephone 18 usc 31213127 chapter 206 the orders are available based on the governments certification rather than finding of the court that the use of the device is likely to produce information relevant to the investigation of crime any crime 18 usc 3123 the devices record more than the identity of the participants in telephone conversation10 but neither the orders nor the results they produce need ever be revealed to the participants the act modifies the procedures at each of the three levels ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs5 11 where the law enforcement agency implementing an ex parte order under this subsection seeks to do so by installing and using its own pen register or trap and trace device on packet switched data network of provider

each time the device is accessed to obtain information iii the configuration of the device at the time of its installation and any subsequent modification thereof and iv any information which has been collected by the device to the extent that the pen register or trap and trace device can be set automatically to record this information electronically the record shall be maintained electronically

provisions and several of the foreign intelligence amendments with sunset provision dec 31 2005 pen registers and trap and trace devices in section 216 the act allows court orders authorizing trap and trace devices and pen registers to be used to capture source and addressee information for computer conversations eg email as well as telephone conversations 18 usc 3121 3123 in answer to objections that email header information can be more revealing than telephone number it creates detailed report to the court 18 usc 3123a311 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs6 12 the justice department urged the change in the name of expediency at present the government must apply for new pen trap orders in every jurisdiction where an investigation is being pursued hence law enforcement officers tracking suspected terrorist in multiple jurisdictions must waste valuable time and resources by obtaining duplicative order in each jurisdiction doj at 101 here and throughout citations to the united states code usc without reference to an edition refer to the current code references to the 2000 edition of the code refer to the law prior to amendment by the act 13 prior to the amendment investigators could not use subpoena to obtain such records as credit card number or other form of payment in many cases users register with internet service providers using false names making the form of payment critical to determining the users true identity this information could only be obtained by the slower and more cumbersome process of court order in fastmoving investigations such as terrorist bombings in which internet communications are critical method of identifying conspirators and in determining the source of the attacks the delay necessitated by the use of court orders can often be important obtaining billing and other information can identify not only the perpetrator but also give valuable information about the financial accounts of those responsible and their conspirators doj at 107the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices was limited at one time to the judicial district in which the order was issued 18 usc 3123 2000 ed under section 216 court with jurisdiction over the crime under investigation may issue an order to be executed anywhere in the united states 18 usc 3123b1c 3127212 communications records and stored email with respect to chapter 126 relating among other things to the content of stored email and to communications records held by third parties the law permits criminal investigators to retrieve the content of electronic communications in storage like email with search warrant and if the communication has been in remote storage for more than 180 days without notifying the subscriber 18 usc 2703ab warrant will also suffice to seize records describing telephone and other communications transactions without customer notice 18 usc 2703c in the absence of the probable cause necessary for warrant but with showing of reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to criminal investigation officers are entitled to court order mandating access to electronic communications in remote storage for more than 180 days or to communications records 18 usc 2703bc they can obtain limited amount of record information subscribers names and addresses telephone numbers billing records and the like using an administrative grand jury or trial court subpoena 18 usc 2703c1c there is subscriber notification in record cases elsewhere the court may delay customer notification in the face of exigent circumstances or if notice is likely to seriously jeopardize the investigation or unduly delay the trial 18 usc 2705 in order to streamline the investigation process the act in section 210 adds credit card and bank account numbers to the information law enforcement officials may subpoena from communications service providers customer records 18 usc 2703c1c13 another streamlining amendment section 220 eliminates the jurisdictional restrictions on access to the content of stored email pursuant to court orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs7 14 speaking of the law before amendment doj explained current law requires the government to use search warrant to compel provider to disclose unopened email 18 usc 2703a because federal rule of criminal procedure 41 requires that the property to be obtained be within the district of the issuing court however the rule may not allow the issuance of 2703a warrants for email located in other districts thus for example where an investigator in boston is seeking electronic email in the yahoo account of suspected terrorist he may need to coordinate with agents prosecutors and judges in the northern district of california none of whom have any other involvement in the investigation this electronic communications information can be critical in establishing relationships motives means and plans of terrorists moreover it is equally relevant to cyberincidents in which terrorist motive has not but may well be identified finally even cases that require the quickest response kidnappings threats or other dangers to public safety or the economy may rest on evidence gathered under 2703a to further public safety this section accordingly authorizes courts with jurisdiction over investigations to compel evidence directly without requiring the intervention of their counterparts in other districts where major internet service providers are located doj at 108 15 see eg doj at 109 law enforcement must have the capability to trace intercept and obtain records of the communications of terrorists and other criminals with great speed even if they choose to use cable provider for their telephone and internet service this section amends the cable communications policy act cable act to clarify that when cable company acts as telephone company or an internet service provider it must comply with the same laws governing the interception and disclosure of wire and electronic communications that apply to any other telephone company or internet service provider the cable act passed in 1984 to regulate various aspects of the cable television industry could not take into account the changes in technology that have occurred over the last seventeen years cable television companies now often provide internet access and telephone service in addition to television programming because of perceived conflicts between the cable act and laws that govern law enforcements access to communications and records of communications carried by cable companies cable providers have refused to comply with lawful court orders thereby slowing or ending critical investigations previously only federal court in the district in which the email was stored could issue the order under section 220 federal courts in the district where an offense under investigation occurred may issue orders applicable without geographic limitation 18 usc 270314 the act in section 209 treats voice mail like email that is subject to the warrant or court order procedure rather than to the more demandin g coverage of title iii once required united states v smith 155 f3d 1050 105556 9th cir 1998 finally the act resolves conflict between chapter 121 and the federal law governing cable companies government entities may have access to cable company customer records only under court order following an adversary hearing if they can show that the records will evidence that the customer is or has engaged in criminal activity 47 usc 511h when cable companies began offering telephone and other communications services the question arose whether the more demanding cable rules applied or whether law enforcement agencies were entitled to ex parte court orders under the nonotice procedures applicable to communications providers15 the act makes it clear that the cable rules apply when cable television viewing services arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs8 16 18

providers often lack the expertise equipment or financial resources required to monitor attacks themselves as permitted under current law they often have way to exercise their rights to protect themselves from unauthorized attackers moreover such attackers can target critical infrastructures and engage in cyberterrorism doj at 106 elsewhere the act defines electronic surveillance for purposes of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa to emphasize that the law enforcement authority for this intruder surveillance does not confer similar authority for purposes of foreign intelligence gathering section 1003 50 usc 1801f2 18 for general discussion of federal intelligence and law enforcement cooperation see best intelligence and law enforcement countering transnational threats to the us crs repno rl30252 dec 3 2001involved and that the communications rules of chapter 121 apply when cable company or anyone else provides communications services section 211 electronic surveillance to title iiis predicate offense list the act adds cybercrime 18 usc 1030 and several terrorists crimes sections 201 20216 second cybercrime initiative section 217 permits law enforcement officials to intercept the communications of an intruder within protected computer system ie system used by the federal government financial institution or one used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication without the necessity of warrant or court order 18 usc 25112 i yet only the interlopers intruding communications those to or from the invaded system are exposed under the section the justice department originally sought the change because the law then did not clearly allow victims of computer trespassing to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring unauthorized attacks as they occur17 criminal investigators access to foreign intelligence information the act clearly contemplates closer working relations between criminal investigators and foreign intelligence investigators particular in cases of international terrorism18 it amends the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa to that end as originally enacted the application for surveillance order under fisa required certification of the fact that the purpose for the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information 50 usc 1804a7b2000 ed emphasis added although it anticipated that any evidence divulged as result might be turned over to law enforcement officials defendants often questioned whether authorities had used fisa surveillance order against them in order to avoid the predicate crime threshold for title iii order out of these challenges arose the notion that perhaps the purpose might not always mean the sole purpose the case law indicated that while an expectation that evidence of crime might be discovered did not preclude fisa order at such time as criminal prosecution became the focus of the investigationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs9 19 before fisa several lower federal courts recognized foreign intelligence exception to the fourth amendments warrant clause it is here that the primary purpose notion originated in united states v truong dinh hung 629 f2d 908 915 4th cir 1980 decided after fisa on the basis of preexistin g law the court declared as the district court ruled the executive should be excused from securing warrant only when the surveillance is conducted primarily for foreign intelligence reasons we think that the district court adopted the proper test because once surveillance becomes primarily criminal investigation the courts are entirely competent to make the usual probable cause determination and because importantly individual privacy interests come to the fore and government foreign policy concerns recede when the government is primarily attempting to form the basis for criminal prosecution subsequent case law however is not as clear as it might be see eg united states v duggan 743 f2d 59 77 2d cir 1984fisa permits federal officials to obtain orders authorizing electronic surveillance for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information the requirement that foreign intelligence information be the primary objective of the surveillance is plain not only from the language of sec 1802b but also from the requirements in sec 1804 as to what the application must contain the application must contain certification by designated official of the executive branch that the purpose of the surveillance is to acquire foreign intelligence information and the certification must set forth the basis for the certifying officialss belief that the information sought is the type of foreign intelligence information described united states v pelton 835 f2d 1067 107576 4th cir 1987we also reject peltons claim that the 1985 fisa surveillance was conducted primarily for the purpose of his criminal prosecution and not primarily for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence informat ion we agree with the district court that the primary purpose of the surveillance both initially and throughout was to gather foreign intelligence information it is clear that otherwise valid fisa surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can anticipate that the fruits of the surveillance may later be used as evidence in criminal trial united states v sarkissian 841 f2d 959 9078 9th cir 1988defendants rely on the primary purpose test articulated in united states v truong dinh hung one other court has applied the primary purpose test another court has rejected it distinguishing truong third court has declined to decide the issue we also decline to decide the issue united states v johnson 952 f2d 565 572 1st cir 1991appellants attack the governments surveillance on the ground that it was undertaken not for foreign intelligence purposes but to gather evidence for criminal prosecution fisa applications must contain among other things certification that the purpose of the requested surveillance is the gathering of foreign intelligence information although the evidence obtained under fisa subsequently may be used in criminal prosecutions the investigation of criminal activity cannot be the primary purpose of the surveillance 20 current law requires that fisa be used only where foreign intelligence gathering is the sole or primary purpose of the investigati on this section will clarify that the certification of fisa request is supportable where foreign intelligen ce gathering is purpose of the investigation this change would eliminate the current need continually to evaluate the relative weight of criminal and intelligence purposes and would facilitate information sharing between law enforcement and foreign intelligence authorities which is critical to the success of antiterrorism efforts doj at 153officials were required to either end surveillance or secure an order under title iii19 the justice department sought fisa surveillance and physical search authority on the basis of foreign intelligence purpose20 section 218 of the act insists that foreign intelligence gathering be significant purpose for the request for the fisa surveillance or physical search order 50 usc 1804a7b 1823a7 b morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs10 21 k1 federal officers who conduct electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence

customer records in compliance with court access order 18 usc 2703f 27 existing law contains provision that allows providers of electronic communications service to disclose the communications or records relating to such communications of their customers or subscribers in emergencies that threaten death or serious bodily injury this section amends 18 usc 2702 to authorize such disclosures if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information without delay current law also contains an odd disconnect provider may disclose the contents of the customers communications in order to protect its rights or property but the current statute does not expressly permit provider to voluntarily disclose noncontent records such as subscribers login records 18 usc 2702b5 this problem substantially hinders the ability of providers to protect themselves from cyberterrorists and criminals yet the right to disclose the contents of communications necessarily implies the less intrusive ability to disclose noncontent records in order to promote the protection of our nations

federal officers or employees were found to have intentionally violated its proscriptions 18 usc 2707 the act augments these sanctions by authorizing claim against the united states for not less than 10000 and costs for violations of title iii chapter 121 or the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa by federal officials and emphasizing the prospect of administrative discipline for offending federal officials section 223 finally the act instructs the department of justices inspector general to designate an official to receive and review complaints of civil liberties violations by doj officers and employees section 1001 the second category of protective measures applies to service providers and others who help authorities track and gather communications information for example section 815 immunizes service providers who in good faith preserve customer records at the governments request until court order authorizing access can be obtained26 another allows providers to disclose customer records to protect the providers rights and property and to disclose stored customer communications and records in emergency circumstances section 212 under preexisting law providers could disclose the content of stored communications but not customer records the justice department recommended the changes in the interests of greater protection against cybercrimes committed by terrorists and others27 third sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs12 110 28 chapter 206 had long guaranteed providers and others reasonable compensation 18 usc 3124c but section 216 of the act expands the circumstances under which the authorities may request assistance including requests for the help of those not specifically mentioned in the court order section 222 makes it clear the expanded obligation to provide assistance is matched by corresponding right to compensation 29 thus in the name of assisting in the execution of title iii chapter 121 or chapter 206 order the courts

available to secure court orders in certain foreign intelligence cases35 it operates through the judges of special court which prior to the act consisted of seven judges scattered throughout the

the case of both surveillance orders and physical search orders extends the maximum life of an order involving an agent of foreign power to 120 days with extensions for up to year 50 usc 1805e 1824d this represents compromise over the justice departments original proposal which would have set the required expiration date for orders at one year instead of 120 days draft at 15136 section 901 of the

director of centralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs16 process as interpreted by the oipr is administratively burdensome and at times extremely slow many applications undergo months of scrutiny before submission to the court because the oipr prescribes standards and restrictions not imposed by the statute in particular the oipr has been criticized for an overly restrictive interpretation of the fisa currency requirement this is the issue of how recent subjects activities must be to support finding of probable cause that the subject is engaged in clandestine intelligence gathering activities while existing law does not specifically address past activities it does not preclude and legislative history supports the conclusion that past activities may be part of the totality of circumstances considered by the fisc in making probable cause determination by definition information collected pursuant to court order issued under the foreign intelligence surveillance act is foreign intelligence not law enforcement information accordingly the committee wants to clarify that the fisa take can and must be shared by the federal bureau of investigation with appropriate intelligence agencies for the intelligence mission of the united states to be successful there must be cooperative and concerted effort among intelligence agencies any information collected by one agency under foreign intelligence authorities that could assist another agency in executing its lawful mission should be shared fully and promptly only then can the united states government pursue aggressively important national security targets including for example counterterrorist and counternarcotics targets see also 147 congrec s799803 daily ed feb 24 2000remarks of sens specter torricelli and biden 38 when added to fisa two years ago the pen registertrap and trace section was intended to mirror the criminal pentrap authority defined in 18 usc 3123 the fisa authority differs from the criminal authority in that it requires in addition to showing of relevance an additional factual showing that the communications device has been used to contact an agent of foreign power engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities this has the effect of making the fisa pentrap authority much more difficult to obtain in fact the process of obtaining fisa pentrap authority is only slightly less burdensome than the process for obtaining full electronic surveillance authority under fisa this stands in stark contrast to the criminal pentrap authority which can be obtained quickly from local court on the basis of certification that the information to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing investigation the amendment simply eliminates the agent of foreign power prong from the predication and thus makes the fisa authority more closely track the criminal authority doj at 155intelligence with the responsibility to formulate requirements and priorities for the use of fisa to

privacy act for telephone and electronic communications records the financial right to privacy act for financial records and the fair credit reporting act for credit records like the fisa pen registertrap and trace authority described above nsl authority requires both showing of relevance and showing of links to an agent of foreign power in this respect they are substantially more demanding than the analogous criminal authorities which require only certification of relevance because the nsls require documentation of the facts supporting the agent of foreign power predicate and because they require the signature of high ranking official at fbi headquarters they often take months to be issued this is in stark contrast to criminal subpoenas which can be used to obtain the same information and are issued rapidly at the local level in many cases counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations suffer substantial delays while waiting for nsls to be prepared returned from headquarters and served the section would streamline the process of obtaining nsl authority and also clarify the fisa court can issue orders compelling production of consumer reports 40 when it requested the amendment the department of justice explained that the provision expands the obligations of third parties to furnish assistance to the government under fisa under current fisa provisions the government can seek information and assistance from common carriers landlords custodians and other persons specified in courtordered surveillance section 152 would amend fisa to expand existing authority to allow in circumstances where the court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of specified person that common carrier landlord custodian or other persons not specified in the courts order be required to furnish the applicant information and technical assistance necessary to accomplish electronic surveillance in

fisa judge or magistrate in practice this makes the authority unavailable for most investigative contexts the time and difficulty involved in getting such pleadings before the court usually outweighs the importance of the business records sought since its enactment the authority has been sought less than five times this section would delete the old authority and replace it with general administrative subpoena authority for documents and records this authority modeled on the administrative subpoena authority available to drug investigators pursuant to title 21 allows the attorney general to compel production of such records upon finding that the information is relevant doj at 156 42 section 314 of the intelligence authorization act further amended the section to permit orders

the provision would also expand right to financial privacy act rfpa exemption currently applicable to law enforcement inquiries to allow an agency or department to share relevant financial records with another agency or department involved in intelligence or counterintelligence activities investigations or analyses related to domestic or international terrorism the section would also exempt

records obtained through federal grand jury subpoena when relevant to intelligence or counterintelligence activities investigations or analyses related to domestic or international terrorism in each case the transferring governmental entity must certify that there is reason to believe that the financial records are relevant to such an activity investigation or analysis finally this section facilitates government access to information contained in suspected terrorists credit reports when the governmental inquiry relates to an investigation of or intelligence activity or analysis relating to domestic or international terrorism even though private entities such as lenders and insurers can access an individuals credit history the government is strictly limited in its ability under current law to obtain the information this section would permit those investigating suspected terrorists prompt access to credit histories that may reveal key information about the terrorists plan or

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs20 wiretap statutes to permit the disclosure of title iiigenerated information to nonlaw enforcement officer for such purposes as furthering an intelligence investigation this will harmonize title iii standards with those of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa which allows such informationsharing allowing disclosure under title iii is particularly appropriate given that the requirements for obtaining title iii surveillance order in general are more stringent than for fisa order and because the attendant privacy concerns in either situation are similar and are adequately protected by existing statutory provisions 45 see also doj at 354 this section makes changes in rule 6e of the federal rules of criminal procedure relating to grand jury secrecy to facilitate the sharing of information with federal law enforcement intelligence protective national defense and immigration personnel in terrorism and national security cases the section is in part complimentary to section 154 of the bill relating to sharing of foreign intelligence information and reflects similar purpose of promoting coordinated governmental response to terrorist and national security threats contrary to the implication here section 154 deals with sharing information gathered by law enforcement officials not with information gathered by intelligence officers 46 see also doj at 154 this section provides that foreign intelligence information obtained in criminal investigations including grand jury and electronic surveillance information may be shared with other federal government personnel having responsibilities relating to the defense of the nation and its interests with limited exceptions it is presently impossible for criminal investigators to share information obtained through grand jury including through the use of grand jury subpoenas and information obtained from electron ic surveillance authorized under title iii with the intelligence community this limitation will be very significant in some criminal investigations for example grand jury subpoenas often are used to obtain telephone computer financial and other business records in organized crime investigations thus these relatively basic investigative materials are inaccessible for examination by intelligence community analysts working on related transnational organized crime groups similar problem occurs in computer intrusion investigations grand jury subpoenas and title iii intercepts are used to collect transactional data and to monitor the unknown intruders the intelligence community will have an equal interest in such information because the intruder may be acting on behalf of foreign power 47 blair v united states 250 us 273 281

expressed earlier concerning coordinated efforts to develop ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs24 54 the committee is concerned that intelligence in general and intelligence related to terrorism in particular is increasingly reliant on the ability of the intelligence community to quickly accurately and efficiently translate information in large number of languages many of the languages for which translation capabilities are limited within the united states government are the languages that are of critical importance in our counterterrorism efforts the committee believes that this problem can be alleviated by applying cuttingedge internetlike technology to create national virtual translation center such center would link secure locations maintained by the intelligence community throughout the country and would apply digital technology to network store retrieve and catalogue the audio and textual information foreign intelligence could be collected technically in one location translated in second location and provided to an intelligence community analyst in third location the committee notes that the cia fbi nsa and other intelligence agencies have applied new technology to this problem the committee believes that these efforts should be coordinated so that the solution can be applied on communitywide basis accordingly the committee directs the director of central intelligence in consultation with the director of the fbi and other heads of departments and agencies within the intelligence community to prepare and submit to the intelligence committees by june 1 2002 report concerning the feasibility and structure of national virtual translation center including recommendations regarding the establishment of such center and the funding necessary to do so

at 389 2001most importantly the committee found significant shortcomings in the use of information already in possession of the government section 6050i of the internal revenue code requires that any person engaged in trade or business other than financial institutions required to report under the bank secrecy act file report with the federal government on cash transactions in excess of 10000 reports filed pursuant to this requirement provide law enforcement authorities with paper trail that can among other things lead to the detection and prosecution of money laundering activity under current law nonfinancial institutions are required to report cash transactions exceeding 10000 to the internal revenue service irs on irs form 8300 because the requirement that such reports be filed is contained in the internal revenue code form 8300 information is considered tax return information and is subject to the procedural and recordkeeping requirements of section 6103 of the internal revenue code for example section 6103p4e requires agencies seeking form 8300 information to file report with the secretary of the treasury that describes the procedures established and utilized by the agency for ensuring the confidentiality of the information irs requires that agencies requesting form 8300 information file safeguard procedures report which must be approved by the irs before any such information can be released for that reason federal state and local law enforcement agencies are not given access to the form 8300s as congress anticipated when it last amended this statute see 26 usc 6103l15 while the irs uses form 8300 to identify individuals who may be engaged in tax evasion form 8300 information can also be instrumental in helping law enforcement authorities trace cash payments by drug traffickers and other criminals for luxury cars jewelry and other expensive merchandise because of the restrictions on their dissemination outlined above however form 8300s are not nearly as accessible to law enforcementrecords and reports for instance under the currency and financial transaction reporting act component of the bank secrecy act anyone who transports more than

likewisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs26 authorities as the various reports mandated by the bank secrecy act which can typically be retrieved electronically from database maintained by the treasury department the differential access to the two kinds of reports is made anomalous by the fact that form 8300 elicits much the same information that is required to be disclosed by the bank secrecy act for example just as form 8300 seeks the name address and social security number of customer who engages in cash transaction exceeding 10000 with trade or business currency transaction reports ctrs mandated by the bank secrecy act require the same information to be reported on cash transacti on exceeding 10000 between financial institution and its customer 59 subsection of section 351 makes

judicial proceedings second it amends section 5318g3 to clarify the safe harbors coverage of voluntary disclosures that is those not covered by the sar regulatory reporting requirement the language in section 5318g3a providing that any financial institution that makes disclosure pursuant to any other authority shall not be liable to any person is not intended to avoid the application of the reporting and disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws to any person or to insulate any issuers from private rights of actions for disclosures made under the federal securities laws

disclosure by financial institution of potential wrongdoing in written employment reference provided in response to request from another financial institution pursuant to section 18v of the federal

section 311 adds new section 5318a to the bank secrecy act authorizing the secretary of the treasury to require domestic financial institutions and agencies to take one or more of five special measures if the secretar finds that reasonable grounds exist to conclude that foreign jurisdiction financial institution operating outside the united states class of international transactions or one or more types of accounts is primary money laundering concern prior to invoking any of the special measures contained in section 5318ab the secretary is required to consult with the chairman of the

discretion of the secretary such other agencies and interested parties as the secretary may find to be appropriate among other things this consultation is designed to ensure that the secretary possesses information on the effect that any particular special measure may have on the domestic and international banking system in addition the committee encourages the secretary to consult with nongovernmental interested parties including for example the bank secrecy act advisory group to obtain input from those who may be subject to regulation or order under this section prior to invoking any of the special measures contained in section 5318a the secretary must consider three discrete factors namely 1 whether other countries or multilateral groups have taken similar action 2 whether the imposition of the measure would create significant competitive disadvantage including any significant cost or burden associated with compliance for firms organized or licensed in the united states and 3 the extent to which the action would have an adverse systemic impact on the payment system or legitimatelaundering concern61 these special measures may require us financial institutions to

reports on certain transactions involving the primary money laundering concern to include any information the secretary requires such as the identity and address of participants in transaction the legal capacity in which the participant is acting the beneficial ownership of the funds in accordance with steps that the secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable to obtain such information and description of the transaction the records andor reports authorized by this section must involve transactions from foreign jurisdiction financial institution operating outside the united states or class of international transactions within or involving foreign jurisdiction and are not to include transactions that both originate and terminate in and only involve domestic financial institutions the second special measure would require domestic financial institutions to take such steps as the secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable to ascertain beneficial ownership of accounts opened or maintained in the us by foreign person excluding publicly traded foreign corporations associated with what has been determined to be primary money laundering concern the third special measure the secretary could impose in the case of primary money laundering concern would require domestic financial institutions as condition of opening or maintaining payablethrough account for foreign financial institution to identify each customer and representative of the customer who is permitted to use or whose transactions flow through such an account and to obtain for each customer and representative information that is substantially comparable to the information it would obtain with respect to its own customers payablethrough account is defined for purposes of the legislation as an account including transaction account as defined in section 19b1c of the federal reserve act opened at depository institution by foreign financial institution by means of which the foreign financial institution permits its customers to engage either directly or through subaccount in banking activities usual in connection with the business of banking in the united states the fourth special measure the secretary could impose in the case of primary money laundering concern would require domestic financial institutions as condition of opening or maintaining correspondent account for foreign financial institution to identify each customer and representative of the customer who is permitted to use or whose transactions flow through such an account and to obtain for each customer and representative information that is substantially comparable to the information that it would obtain with respect to its own customers with respect to bank the term correspondent account

concern would prohibit or impose conditions beyond those already provided for in the third and fourth measures on domestic financial institutions correspondent or payablethrough accounts with foreign banking institutions in addition to the required consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve prior to imposing this measure the secretary is also directed to

customer identification by financial institutions in connection with the opening of an account by referencing customers in this section the committee intends that the regulations prescribed by treasury take an approach similar to that of regulations promulgated under title v of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 where the functional regulators defined customers and customer relationship for purposes of the financial privacy rules under this approach for example where mutual fund sells its shares to the public through brokerdealer and maintains street name or omnibus account in the brokerdealers name the individual purchasers of the fund shares are customers of the brokerdealer rather than the mutual fund the mutual fund would not be required to look through the brokerdealer to identify and verify the identities of those customers similarly where mutual fund sells its shares to qualified retirement plan the plan and not its participants would be the funds customers thus the fund would not be required to look through the plan to identify its participants paragraph 2 requires that the regulations must at minimum require financial institutions to implement procedures to verify to the extent reasonable and practicable the identity of any person seeking to open an account maintain records of the information used to do so and consult applicable lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations the lists of known or suspected terrorists that the committee intends financial institutions to consult are those already supplied to financial institutions by the office of foreign asset control ofac and occasionally by law enforcement and regulatory authorities as in the days immediately following the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon it is the committees intent that the verification procedu res prescribed by treasury make use of information currently obtained by most financial institutions in the account opening process it is not the committees intent for the regulations to require verification procedures that are prohibitively expensive or impractical paragraph 3 requires that treasury consider the various types of accounts maintained by various financial institutions the various methods of opening accounts and the various types of identifying information available in promulgating its regulations this would require treasury to consider for example the feasibility of obtaining particular types of information for accounts opened through the mail electronically or in other situations where the accountholder is not physically present at the financial institution millions of americans open accounts at mutual funds brokerdealers and other financial institutions in this manner it is not the committees intent that the regulations adopted pursuant to this legislation impose burdens that would make this prohibitively expensive or impractical this provision allows treasury to adopt regulations that are appropriately tailored to these types of accounts current regulato ry guidance instructs depository institutions to make reasonable efforts to determine the true identity of all customers requesting an institutions services see eg fdic division of supervision manual of exam policies section 94 vi the committee intends that the regulations prescribed under this section adopt similar approach and impose requirements appropriate to the size location and type of business of an institution paragraph 4 requires that treasury consult with the appropriate

the us and other countries and 2 report annually to congress on treasurys progress in achieving this objective and on impediments to instituting regime in which all appropriate identification about wire transfer recipients is included with wire transfers from their point of origination until disbursement the committee is concerned that inadequate information on the originator of wire transfers from number of foreign jurisdictions makes it difficult for both law enforcement and financial institutions to properly understand the source of funds entering the united states in wire transfers such lack of clarity could aid money launderers or terrorists in moving their funds into the united states financial system additionally while arguments have been made that there are technical impediments to requiring that complete addressee information appear on all wire transfers terminating in or passing through the united states the committee believes that having such information is technically feasible and would aid both financial institutions in performing due diligence and law enforcement in tracking or seizing money that is the derivative of or would be used in the commission of

united states the additional crimes include all crimes of violence public corruption and offenses covered by existing bilateral extradition treaties the committee intends this provision to send strong signal that the united states will not tolerate the use of its financial institutions for the purpose of laundering the proceeds of such activities hrrepno 107250 at 55 2000 in this same vein section

united states code makes it an offense to conduct transaction involving financial institution if the transaction involves criminally derived property similarly 18 usc 1957 creates an offense relating to the deposit withdrawal transfer or exchange of criminally derived funds by to or through financial institution for the purposes of both statutes the term financial institution is defined in 31 usc 5312 see 18 usc 1956c6 18 usc 1957f the definition of financial institution in 5312 does not explicitly include foreign banks such banks may well be covered because they fall within the meaning of commercial bank or other terms in the statute but as presently drafted there is some confusion over whether the government can rely on section 5312 to prosecute an offense under either 1956 or 1957 involving transaction through foreign bank even if the offense occurs in part in the united states for example if person in the united states sends criminal proceeds abroadsay to mexican bankand launders them through series of financial transactions the government conceivably could not rely on the definition of financial institution in 1956c6 to establish that the transaction was financial transaction within the meaning of 1956c4b defining financial transaction as transaction involving the use of financial institution or that it was monetary transaction within the meaning of 1957f defining monetary transaction as inter alia transaction that would be financial transaction under 1956c4b similarly the money laundering laws in effect in most countries simply make it an offense to launder the proceeds of any crime foreign or domestic in the united states however the money laundering statute is violated only when person launders the proceeds of one of the crimes set forth on list of specified unlawful activities 18 usc 1956c7 currently only handful of foreign crimes appear on that list see 1956c7 b hrrepno 107250 at 38 2000 72 cf hrrepno 107250 at 57expands 18 usc 1956 to

federal law under 18 usc 1960 first section 104 clarifies the scienter requirement in 1960 to avoid the problems that occurred when the supreme court interpreted the currency transaction reporting statutes to require proof that the defendant knew that structuring cash transaction to avoid the reporting requirements had been made criminal offense see ratzlaf v united states 114 s ct 655 1994 the proposal makes clear that an offense under 1960 is general intent crime for which defendant is liable if he knowingly operates an unlicensed money transmitting business for purposes of criminal prosecution the government would not have to show that the defendant knew that state license was required or that the federal registration requirements promulgated pursuant to 31 usc 5330 applied to the business second section 104 expands the definition of an unlicensed money transmitting business to include business engaged in the transportation or transmission of funds that the defendant knows are derived from criminal offense or are intended to be used for an unlawful purpose thus person who agrees to transmit or to transport drug proceeds for drug dealer or funds from any source for terrorist knowing such funds are to be used to commit terrorist act would be engaged in the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business it would not be necessary for the government to show that the business was storefront or other formal business open to walkin trade to the contrary it would be sufficient to show that the defendant offered his services as money transmitter to another finally when congress enacted 1960 in 1992 it provided for criminal but not civil forfeiture the proposal corrects this oversight and allows the government to obtain forfeiture of property involved in the operation of an illegal money transmitting business even if the perpetrator is fugitive hrrepno 107250 at 54 2001 74 this section makes it criminal offense to possess an electronic image of an obligation or security document of the united states with intent to defraud the provision harmonizes counterfeiting language to clarify that possessing either analog or digital copies with intent to

punishable by the same penalties the acts bulk cash smuggling offense section 371 augments these proscriptions with somewhat unique feature 31 usc 5332 criminal forfeiture of the smuggled cash in lieu of criminal fine the basic offense outlaws smuggling cash into or out of the united states the concealment element of the offense seems to cover everything but insight possession as long as an amount 10000 or more is carried in manner to evade reporting75 the section appears to be the product of reactions to the supreme courts decision in united states v bajakian 524 us 321 1998 there officials had confiscati on 350000 because bajakian attempted to leave the country without declaring it violation of 31 usc 5322 in the view of the court the confiscation was grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense and consequently contrary to the constitutions excessive fines clause 524 us at 337 the committee report accompanying hr 3004 explains the justice departments assurance that casting surreptitious removal of cash from the united states as smuggling rather than false reporting offense will avoid the adverse consequences of the supreme courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs39 76 as recent congressional hearings have demonstrated currency smuggling is an extremely serious law enforcement problem hundreds of millions of dollars in us currency representing the proceeds of drug trafficking and other criminal offenses is annually transported out of the united states to foreign countries in shipments of bulk cash smugglers use all available means to transport the currency out of the country from false bottoms in personal luggage to secret compartments in automobiles to concealment in durable goods exported for sale abroad presently the only law enforcement weapon against such smuggling is section 5316 of title 31 united states code which makes it an offense to transport more than 10000 in currency or monetary instruments into or out of the united state without filing report with the united states customs service the effectiveness of section 5316 as law enforcement tool has been diminished however by recent supreme court decision in united states v bajakajian 118 sct 2028 1998 the supreme court held that section 5316 constitutes mere reporting violation which is not serious offense for purposes of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment accordingly confiscation of the full amount of the smuggled currency is unconstitutional even if the smuggler took elaborate steps to conceal the currency and otherwise obstruct justice confiscation of the smuggled currency is of course the most effective weapon that can be employed against currency smugglers accordingly in response to the bajakajian decision the department of justice proposed making the act of bulk cash smuggling itself criminal offense and to authorize the imposition of the full range of civil and criminal sanctions when the offense is discovered because the act of concealing currency for the purpose of smuggling it out of the united states is inherently more serious than simply failing to file customs report strong and meaningful sanctions such as confiscation of the smuggled currency are likely to withstand eighth amendment challenges to the new statute hrrepno 107250 at 367 2001 examination of

the supreme court in cabrales held that charge of money laundering in florida of the proceeds of missouri drug trafficking could not be tried in missouri the court declared in dicta however that money

forfeiture is the government confiscation of property as consequence of crime80 the forfeiture amendments of the act fall into two categories some make adjustments to those portions of federal

terrorists under certain conditions under ieepa as amended by section 106 of the act the president or his delegate may confiscate and dispose of any property within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs41 81 this section is designed to accomplish two principal objectives first the section restores to the president in limited circumstances involvin g armed hostilities or attacks against the united states the power to confiscate and vest in the united states property of enemies during times of national emergency which was contained in the trading with the enemy act 50 app usc 5btwea until 1977 until the international economic emergency act ieepa was passed in 1977 section 5b permitted the president to vest enemy property in the united states during time of war or national emergency when ieepa was passed it did not expressly include provision permitting the vesting of property in the united states and section 5b of twea was amended to apply only during the time of war 50 appusc 5b this new provision tracks the vesting language currently in section 5b of twea and permits the president only in the limited circumstances when the united states is engaged in military hostilities or has been subject to an attack to confiscate property of any foreign country person or organization involved in hostilities or attacks on the united states like the original provision in twea it is an exercise of congresss war power under article i section 8 clause 11 of the constitution and is designed to apply to unconventional warfare where congress has not formally declared war against foreign nation the second principal purpose of this amendment to ieepa is to ensure that reviewing courts may base their rulings on an examination of the complet administrative record in sensitive national security or terrorism cases without requiring the united states to compromise classified information new section c would authorize reviewing court in the process of verifying that determinations made by the executive branch were based upon substantial evidence and were not arbitrary or capricious to consider classified evidence ex parte and in camera this would ensure that reviewing courts have the best and most complete information upon which to base their decisions without forcing the united states to choose between compromising highly sensitive intelligence information or declining to take action against individuals or entities that may present serious threat to the united states or its nationals similar accommodation mechanism was enacted by congress in the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 8 usc 1189b2 doj at 159 82 an owner of property that is confiscated under any provision of law relating to the confiscation of assets of suspected international terrorists may contest that confiscation by filing claim in the manner set forth in the federal rules of civil procedure supplemental rules for certain admiralty and

united states code apply to the case sec 316ajurisdiction of the united states belonging to any foreign individual foreign entity or foreign country whom they determine to have planned authorized aided or engaged in an attack on the united states by foreign country or foreign nationals the section also permits the government to present secretly ex parte and in camera any classified information upon which the forfeiture was based should the decision be subject to judicial review the justice department requested the section as revival of the presidents powers in times of unconventional wars81 by virtue of section 316 property owners may initiate challenge to confiscation by filing claim under the rules applicable in maritime confiscations the section permits two defenses to forfeiture that the property is not subject to confiscation under section 106 or that the claimant is entitled to the innocent owner defense of 18 usc 983d82 the characterizati on of the defenses as affirmative defense indicates that the claimant bears the burden of proof the innocent owner defenses of 18 usc 983d are probably not available in cases under section 106 since that section is

constitution or c subschapter ii of chapter 5 of title 5 united states code commonly known as the administrative procedure act sec 316c1 85 current law does not contain any authority tailored specifically to the confiscation of terrorist assets instead currently forfeiture is authorized only in narrow circumstances for the proceeds of murder arson and some terrorism offenses or for laundering the proceeds of such offenses however most terrorism offenses do not yield proceeds and available current forfeiture laws require detailed tracing that is quite difficult for accounts coming through the banks of countries used by many terrorists this section increases the governments ability to strike at terrorist organizations economic base by permitting the forfeiture of its property regardless of the source of the property and regardless of whether the property has actually been used to commit terrorism offense this is similar in concept to the forfeiture now available under rico in parity with the drug forfeiture laws the section also authorizes the forfeiture of property used or intended to be used to facilitate terrorist act regardless of its source there is need for separate criminal forfeiture provision because criminal forfeiture is incorporated under current law by reference the provision is retroactive to permit it to be applied to the events of september

department also recommended enactment of an overlapping provision which ultimately passed as section 806 of the act without any real discussion of the relationship of the two sections85 section 806

administered and accounted for authorizes the vesting of such foreignowned property in the custodian and its administration in the interest of and for the benefit of the united states it is not confiscation measure but liquidation measure for the protection of american creditors it provides for the filing and proving of claims and states that the funds shall be equitably applied for the payments of debts 93 united states v bajakajian 524 us 321 337 1998 austin v united states 509 us 602 622 1993neither section 106 nor 806 require conviction of the terrorist property owner90 both call for forfeiture of all of the terrorists property without requiring any nexus to the terrorists offenses other than terrorist ownership neither makes any explicit provision for the terrorists heirs section 106 applies only to foreign persons organizations or countries but section 806 recognizes such distinction of course the supreme court long ago confirmed the constitutional validity of seemingly similar pattern in twea under the presidents war powers91 the court was careful to point out however that the twea procedure was not really forfeiture or confiscation for the benefit of the united states but by express statutory provision liquidation measure to protect the creditors of enemy property owners92 neither section 106 nor 806 are part of twea and neither explicitly treats the proceeds of confiscation as fund for the benefit of creditors moreover broad as the presidents war powers may be they would hardly seem to provide justification for section 806 which embraces domestic terrorism and is neither limited to foreign offenders nor predicated upon warlike hostilities criminal forfeitures civil forfeitures with punitive as well as remedial purposes and civil forfeitures whose effect is so punitive as to negate any presumption of remedial purpose all raise other constitutional points of interest the eighth amendments excessive fines clause prohibits criminal forfeitures and civil forfeitures with at least some punitive purposes that are grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the crimes which trigger them93 the fifth amendments double jeopardy clause applies to criminal forfeitures and civil forfeitures which are so punitive as to negatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs45 94 united states v ursery 518 us 267 278 1996 95 see eg united states v

the district court jurisdiction over foreign person including foreign bank that commits money laundering offense in the united states or converts laundered funds that have been forfeited to the government to his own use thus if the government files civil enforcement action under section 1956b or files civil lawsuit to recover forfeited property from third party the district court would have jurisdiction over the defendant if the defendant has been served with process pursuant to the applicable statutes or rules of procedure and the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts is satisfied in one of three ways the money laundering offense took place in the united states in the case of converted property the property was the property of the united states by virtue of civil or criminal forfeiture judgment or in the case of financial institution the defendant maintained correspondent bank account at another bank in the united states under this provision for example the district courts would have had jurisdict ion over the defendant in the circumstances described in united states v swissany presumption of remedial purposes94 the same has been said of the applicability of the ex post facto clause95 the limitations on criminal forfeitures would apply to the forfeitures under section 806 when prosecuted as criminal forfeitures by operation of 28 usc 2461c the offenses that activate section 106 and 806 confiscations however are of such gravity that successful excessive fine clause challenges are unlikely even if the value of confiscated property were extraordinarily high on the other hand there is more than little support for the argument that section 106 and 806 constitute punitive rather than remedial measures they are potentially severe section 806 calls for the total impoverishment of those to whom it applies all assets foreign and domestic while section 106 anticipates confiscation of all assets within the jurisdiction of the united states they seem to undermine any claim to remedial purpose by reaching those assets that neither facilitate the commission of terrorism nor constitute its fruits moreover in its analysis of the language of section 806 the justice department described it as conceptually akin to the criminal forfeiture provisions of rico96 if the courts find section 106 or 806 are civil in name but criminal in nature they may well conclude that efforts to enforce the sections are bound by the limitations of the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses other forfeiture amendments in order to more effectively enforce money laundering penalties and prosecute civil forfeiture actions involving foreign individuals or entities section 317 of the act establishes procedure for longarm jurisdiction over individuals and entities located overseas and for the appointment of federal receiver to take control of contested assets during the pendency of the proceedings97httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs46 american bank 191 f3d 30 1st cir 1999 the second provision modeled on 18 usc 1345b gives the district court the power to restrain property issue seizure warrants or take other action necessary to ensure that defendant in an action covered by the statute does not dissipate the assets that would be needed to satisfy judgment this section also authorizes court on the motion of the government or state or federal regulator to appoint receiver to gather and protect assets needed to satisfy judgment under sections 1956 and 957 and the forfeiture provisions in sections 981 and 982 this authority is intended to apply in three circumstances 1 when there is judgment in criminal case includin g an order of restitution following conviction for violation of section 1956 or 1957 2 when there is judgment in civil case under section 1956b assessing penalty for violation of either section 1956 or 1957 and 3 when there is civil forfeiture judgment under section 981 or criminal forfeiture judgment including personal money judgment under section 982 the amendment also makes section 1956b applicable to violations of section 1957 it applies to conduct occurring before the effective date of the act 98 18 usc 981k hrrepno 107250 at 578 2001section 114 creates new provision in the civil forfeiture statute 18 usc 981k authorizing the forfeiture of funds found in an interbank account the new provision is necessary to reconcile the law regarding the forfeiture of funds in bank accounts with the realities of the global movement of electronic funds and the use of offshore banks to insulate criminal proceeds from forfeiture to prevent drug dealers and other criminals from taking advantage of certain nuances of forfeiture law to insulate their property from forfeiture even though it is deposited in bank account in the united states it is necessary to change the law regarding the location of the debt that bank owes to its depositor and the identity of the real party in interest with standing to contest the forfeiture the amendment in this section addresses the location issue by treating deposit made into an account in foreign bank that has correspondent account at us bank as if the deposit had been made into the us bank directly second the section treats the deposit in the correspondent account as debt owed directly to the depositor and not as debt owed to the respondent bank in other words the correspondent account is treated as if it were the foreign bank itself and the funds in the correspondent account were debts owed to the foreign banks customers under this arrangement if funds traceable to criminal activity are deposited into foreign bank the government may bring forfeiture action against funds in that banks correspondent account and only the initial depositor and not the intermediary bank would have standing to contest it the section authorizes the attorney general to suspend or terminate forfeiture in cases where there exists conflict of laws between the us and the jurisdiction in which the foreign bank is located where such suspension or termination would be in the interest of justice and not harm us national interestsin the case of interbank accounts where bank in foreign nation has an account in bank located in the united states section 319a allows seizure of funds in an account here when the foreign bank has received money laundering or drug trafficking deposits overseas98 confiscation proceedings are conducted pursuant to 18 usc 953 federal law has for some time permitted criminal forfeiture orders to reach substitute assets if the property of the defendant subject to confiscation has become unavailable section 319d establishes procedure under which convictedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs47 99 cf hrrepno 107250 at 589 2001 section 116 authorizes court to order criminal defendant to repatriate his property to the united states in criminal cases in criminal forfeiture cases the sentencing court is authorized to order the forfeiture of substitute assets when the defendant has placed the property otherwise subject to forfeiture beyond the jurisdiction of the court frequently this provision is applied when defendant has transferred drug proceeds or other criminally derived property to foreign country in many cases however the defendant has other assets in the united states of value commensurate with the forfeitable property overseas in such cases ordering the forfeiture of substitute assets is hollow sanction this section amends 21 usc 853 to make clear that court in criminal case may issue repatriation ordereither posttrial as part of the criminal sentence and judgment or pretrial pursuant to the courts authority under 21 usc 853e to restrain propertyso that they will be available for forfeiture failure to comply with such an order would be punishable as contempt of court or it could result in sentencing enhancement such as longer prison term under the us sentencing guidelines or both 100 18 usc 981a1b 101 hrrepno 107250 at 56 2001this section is intended to reinforce the united states compliance with the vienna convention it amends 18 usc 981a1b to allow the united states to institute its own action against the proceeds of foreign criminal offenses when such proceeds are found in the united states as required by the vienna convention it also authorizes the confiscation of property used to facilitate such crimes the list of foreign crimes to which this section applies is determined by crossreference to the foreign crimes that are money laundering predicates under 1956c7b this section will permit the forfeiture of property involved in conduct occurring before the effective date of the act 102 hrrepno 107250 at 5960 2001under current law 28 usc 2467d gives federal courts the authorit to enforce civil and criminal forfeiture judgments entered by foreign courts this section amends that provision to include mechanism for preserving property subject to forfeiture in foreign country specifically federal court could issue restraining order under 18 usc 983j or register and enforce foreign restraining order if the attorney general certified that such foreign order was obtained in accordance with the principles of due process person seekingdefendant may be ordered to transfer property to this country from overseas if the property is subject to confiscation99 prior to enactment of the act federal law permitted confiscation of any property in the united states that could be traced to drug offense committed overseas if the offense was punishable as felony under the laws of the nation where it occurred and if the offense would have been felony if committed here100 section 320 enlarges this provisions to cover not only drug offenses but any of the crimes in the money laundering predicate offense list of 18 usc 1956c7b and continues the reciprocal felony requirements101 this treatment is comparable to the early coverage of the federal statute 28 usc 2467 which permitted enforcement of foreign confiscation orders in the case of drug offenses or the crimes on the money laundering predicate offense list section 323 of the act amends the foreign forfeiture enforcement statute to 1 expand the grounds for enforcement to include any crime which would have provided the grounds for confiscation had the offense been committed in the united states 2 to authorize restraining orders to freeze the target property while enforcement litigation is pending and 3 to limit the absenceof timelynotice defense102httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs48 to contest the restraining order could do so on the ground that 28 usc 2467 was not properly applied to the particular case but could not oppose the restraining order on any ground that could also be raised in the proceedings pending in foreign court this provision prevents litigant from taking two bites at the apple by raising objections to the basis for the forfeiture in the federal court that he also raised or is entitled to raise in the foreign court where the forfeiture action is pending it complements the existing provision in section 2467e providing that the federal court is bound by the findings of fact of the foreign court and may not look behind such findings in determining whether to enter an order enforcing foreign forfeiture judgment this section also amends 28 usc 2467 to make clear that it is not necessary to prove that the person asserting an interest in the property received actual notice of the forfeiture proceedings as is the case with respect to forfeitures under us law it is sufficient if the foreign nation takes steps to provide notice in accordance with the principles of due process see gonzalez v united states 1997 wl 278123 sdny 1997 the government is not required to ensure actual receipt of notice that is properly mailed albajon v gugliotta 72 f supp 2d 1362 sd fla 1999 notice sent to various addresses on claimants identifications and mailed after claimant released from jail is sufficient to satisfy due process even if claimant never received notice united states v schiavo 897 f supp 644 648 49 d mass 1995 sending notice to fugitives last known address is sufficient due process satisfied even if he did not receive the notice finally 28 usc 2467 is amended to authorize the enforcement of forfeiture judgment based on any foreign offense that would constitute an offense giving rise to civil or criminal forfeiture of the same property if the offense had been committed in the united states this is one of two safeguards that the statute contains against the enforcement of judgments that the united states does not consider appropriate for enforcement if the judgment is based on an act that would not constitute crime in the united states such as removing assets from the reach of repressive regime it could not be enforced in addition section 2467 already provides that foreign judgment may only be enforced by federal court at the request of the united states and only after the attorney general has certified that the judgment was obtained in accordance with the principles of due process thus neither foreign government nor foreign private party could enforce foreign judgment on its own under this provision note that the safeguard to which the report refers is the range of foreign offenses that will support an enforceable confiscation order ie drug offenses and crimes on the money laundering predicate offense list and that the amendment narrows that safeguard by adding additional foreign offenses ie any foreign equivalent of federal crime which would support confiscation order 103 28 usc 2466 fugitive may not challenge federal forfeiture103 section 322 applies this fugitive disentitlement to corporations whose major shareholder is fugitive or whose representative in the confiscation proceedings is fugitive

soliciting on behalf of terrorist organization or providing material support to terrorist organization 8 usc 1182a3biii2000 ed it did not explain in so many words however what constituted terrorist organization but it presumably included groups designated as terrorist organizations under section 219 of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1189 section 411 defines terrorist organization to include not only organizations designated under section 219 but also organizations which the secretary of state has identified in the federal register as having provided material support for committed incited planned or gathered information on potential targets of terrorist acts of violence 8 usc 1182a3bvi a3biv it then recasts the definition of engaging in terrorist activities to include solicitation on behalf of such organizations or recruiting on their behalf or providing them with material support 8 uschttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs51 1182a3biv nevertheless section 411 permits

operation and two counts of laundering in florida could not be prosecuted in missouri on the laundering counts the court might be thought to have retreated somewhat from cabrales when it later approved prosecution for carrying firearm in relation to crime of violence in federal court in new jersey where the underlying kidnaping occurred notwithstanding the fact that the firearm had been acquired in maryland after the defendants left new jersey with their victim in tow united states v rodriguezmoreno 526 us 275 28081 n4 1999by way of comparison last term in cabrales we considered whether venue for money laundering in violation of 18 usc 1956a1b ii and 1957 was proper in missouri where the laundered proceeds were unlawfully generated or rather only in florida where the prohibited laundering transactions occurred as we interpreted the laundering statutes at issue they did not proscribe the anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered the existence of criminally generated proceeds was circumstan ce element of the offense but the proscribed conduct defendants money laundering activity occurred after the fact of an offense begun and completed by others here by contrast given the during and in relation to language of section 924 the underlying crime of violence is critical part of the 924c1 offensethe act in section 803 instead establishes separate offense which punishes harboring terrorists by imprisonment for not more than ten years andor fine of not more than 250000 18 usc 2339 the predicate offense list consists of

the sections in several ways in section 805 section 2339b support of terrorist organization joins section 2339a support of terrorist as money laundering predicate offense 18 usc 1956c7d the predicate offense list of 18 usc 2339a support to terrorists grows to includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs57 113 the justice department sought the expansion along with the enlargement of the predicate offense list 18 usc 2339a prohibits providing material support or resources to terrorists the existing definition of material support or resources is generally not broad enough to encompass expert services and assistance for example advice provided by person with expertise in aviation matters to facilitate an aircraft hijacking or advice provided by an accountant to facilitate the concealment of funds used to support terrorist activities this section accordingly amends 18 usc 2339a to include expert services and assistance making the offense applicable to experts who provide services or assistance knowing or intending that the services or assistance is to be used in preparing for or carrying out terrorism crimes this section also amends 18 usc 2339a to conform its coverage of

amendment vagueness problems some courts have found in assistance which takes the form of training and personnel humanitarian law project v reno 205 f3d 1130 1137136 9th cir 2000113 finally the section announces that prosecution for violation of section 2339a support of terrorists may be brought where the support is provided or where the predicate act of terrorism occurs there may be some question whether the constitution permits prosecution where the predicate act occurs114 section 813 of the act also accepts the justice departments suggestion that various terrorism offenses be added to the predicate offense list for rico racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations which proscribes acquiring or operating through the patterned commission of any of series of predicate offenses an enterprise whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce 18 usc 1961115 prior law 18 usc 23252327 outlawed violation of federal trade commission ftc telemarketing regulations promulgated

maximum prison terms for federal offenses are normally determined by specifications in the provisions which define them these provisions can provide inadequate maxima in cases where the offense is aggravated by its terrorist character or motivation this section accordingly adds new subsection to 18 usc 3559 which provides alternative maximum prison terms including imprisonment for any term of years or for life for crimes likely to be committed by terrorists this is analogous to the maximum fine provisions of 18 usc 3571bc which supersede lower fine amounts specified in the statutes defining particular offenses and will more consistently ensure the availability of sufficiently high maximum penalties in terrorism cases as in several other provisions of this bill the list of the serious crimes most frequently committed by terrorists set forth in section 309 of the bill federal terrorism offenses is used in defining the scope of the provision doj at 302 118 person convicted of any federal terrorism offense may be sentenced to imprisonment for any term of years or for life notwithstanding any maximum term of imprisonment specified in the law describing the offense the authorization of imprisonment under this subsection is supplementary to and does not limit the availability of any other penalty authorized by the law describing the offense including the death penalty and does not limit the applicability of any mandatory minimum term of imprisonment including any mandatory life term provided by the law describing the offense draft at 302new penalties the act increases the penalties for acts of terrorism and for crimes which terrorists might commit more specifically it establishes an alternative maximum penalty for acts of terrorism raises the penalties for conspiracy to commit certain terrorist offenses envisions sentencing some terrorists to lifelong parole and increases the penalties for counterfeiting cybercrime and charity fraud the justice department suggested an alternative term of imprisonment up to life imprisonment for anyone convicted of an offense designated terrorist crime it characterized its proposal as analogous to the standard fine provisions of 18 usc 3571bc section 3571 sets basic maximum fine of 250000 for any individual who convicted of federal felony notwithstanding any lower maximum fine called for in the statute that outlaws the offense117 the proposal however failed to identify the critical elements that would trigger the alternative 118 both practical and constitutional challenges might be thought to attend this failure to distinguish between those convicted of some garden variety crime of terrorism and the more serious offender meriting the alternative supplementary penalty perhaps for this reason the act opted to simply increase the maximum penalties for various crimes of terrorism particularly those which involve the taking of human life and are not already capital offenses section 810 thus it increases the maximum terms imprisonment for for lifethreatening arson or arson of dwelling committed within federal enclave from 20 years to any term of years or life 18 usc 81 for causing more than 100000 in damage to or significantly impairing the operation of an energy facility from 10 to 20 years or any term of years or life if death results 18 usc 1366httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs59 119 the maximum penalty under the general conspiracy provision of federal criminal law 18 usc 371 is five years even if the object of the conspiracy is serious crime carrying far higher maximum penalty for some individual offenses and types of offense special provisions authorize conspiracy penalties equal to the penalties for the object offense see eg 21 usc 846 drug crimes but there is consistently applicable provision of this type for the crimes that are likely to be committed by terrorists this section according ly adds new 2332c to the terrorism chapter of the criminal code parallel to the drug crime conspiracy provision in 21 usc 846 which provides maximum penalties for conspiracies to commit terrorism crimes that are equal to the maximum penalties authorized for the objects of such conspiracies this will more consistently provide adequate penalties for terrorist conspiracies as in various other provisions of this bill the relevant class of offenses is specified by the notion of federal terrorism offense which is defined in section 309 of the bill doj at 303 for providing material support to terrorist or terrorist organization from 10 to 15 years or any term of years or life if death results 18 usc 2339a 2339b for destruction of national defense materials from 10 to 20 years or any term of years or life if death results 18 usc 2155 for sabotage of nuclear facility from 10 to 20 years or any term of years or life if death results 42 usc 2284 for carrying weapon or explosive abroad an aircraft with us special aircraft jurisdiction from 15 to 20 years or any term of years or life if death results 49 usc 46505 and for sabotage of interstate gas pipeline facilities from 15 to 20 years or any term of years or life if death results 49 usc 60123 it is separate federal offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years to conspire to commit any federal felony 18 usc 371 coconspirators are likewise subject to punishment for the underlying offense and for any other crimes committed in furtherance of the conspirac nevertheless some federal criminal statutes impose the same penalties for both the crimes they proscribe and any conspiracy to commit them the justice department urged similar treatment for crimes of terrorism119 again the act in section 811 opts for less sweeping approach and establishes equivalent sanctions for conspiracy and the underlying offense in cases of arson committed within federal enclave 18 usc 81 killing committed while armed with firearm in federal building 18 usc 930c destruction of communications facilities 18 usc 1362 destruction of property within federal enclave 18 usc 1363 causing train wreck 18 usc 1922 providing material support to terrorist 18

supervision for released felons at 3 or 5 years thus in relation to released but still unreformed terrorist there is means of tracking the person or imposing conditions to prevent renewed involvement in terrorist activities beyond period of few years the drug laws 21 usc 841 mandate longer supervision periods for persons convicted of certain drug trafficking crimes and specify upper limit on the duration of supervision but there is nothing comparable for terrorism offenses this section accordingly adds new subsection to 18 usc 3583 to authorize longer supervision periods including potentially lifetime supervision for persons convicted of terrorism crimes this would permit appropriate tracking and oversight following release of offenders whose involvement with terrorism may reflect lifelong ideological commitm ents as in other provisions in this bill the covered class of crimes is federal terrorism offenses which are specified in section 390 of the bill this section affects only the maximum periods of postrelease supervision allowed by statute it does not limit the authority of the sentencing commission and the courts to tailor the supervision periods imposed in particular cases to offense and offender characteristics and the courts will retain their normal authority under 18 usc 3583e1 to terminate supervision if it is longer warranted doj at 308 interfering with flight crew within us special aircraft jurisdiction 49 usc 46504 carrying weapon or explosive abroad an aircraft within us special aircraft jurisdiction 49 usc 46505 and sabotage of interstate gas pipeline facilities 49 usc 60123 when federal courts impose sentence of year or more upon convicted defendant they must also impose term of supervised release 18 usc 3583 ussg 5d11 supervised release is not unlike parole except that it is ordinarily imposed in addition to rather than in lieu of term or portion of term of imprisonment the term may be longer than 5 years for most crimes and violations of the conditions of release may result in imprisonment for up to an additional 5 years 18 usc 3583e the terms of supervisory release for drug dealers however are often cast as mandatory minimums with statutory ceiling thus for example dealer convicted of distributing more than kilogram of heroin must receive term of supervised release of at least 5 years in addition to term of imprisonment imposed for the offense 21 usc 841b although majority feel that the more specific drug provisions of 21 usc 841 trump the more general limitations of 18 usc 3583 some of the federal appellate courts believe the two should be read in concert where possible eg at least but not more than 5 years120 the justice department recommended maximum supervisory term of life for those convicted of acts of terrorism subject to the calibrations of the sentencing commission121 recommendation which the act accepted in section 812 but only in the case of terrorists whose crimes resulted in death or were marked by foreseeable risk of death or serious bodily injury 18 usc 3583jhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs61 122 it provides comparable increase to not more than 20 years from not more than 10 years for those

assistanc to the department of justice as long as the appropriations and judiciary committees are notified of any rewards in excess of 100000 18 usc 3059b although he has special reward authority in terrorism cases individual awards were capped at 500000 the ceiling for the total amount paid in such rewards was 5 million and rewards of 100000 or more required his personal approval or that of the

federal rules of criminal procedure seemed to preclude sneak and peek warrants before passage of the act sneak and peek warrant is one that authorizes officers to secretly enter either physically or virtually conduct search observe takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs63 126 the district court held that search warrant permitting agents to observe but not seize tangible property was impermissible under rule 41 that holding conflicts with language in united states v new york telephone co 434 us 159 169 1977 although rule 41h defines property to include documents books papers and any other tangible objects it does not restrict or purport to exhaustively enumerate all the items which may be seized pursuant to rule 41 rule 41 is not limited to tangible items that case held seizures of intangibles were not precluded by the definition of property appearing in rule 41b without doubt there was search in this case its purpose we hold was to seize intangible not tangible property the intangible property to be seized was information regarding the status of the suspected clandestine methamphetamine laboratory the search was authorized by warrant supported by what the district court concluded was probable cause the question remains however whether warrant lacking both description of the property to be seized and notice requirement conforms to rule 41 we hold that there was compliance with rule 41 under the facts of this case while it is clear that the fourth amendment does not prohibit all surreptitious entries it is also clear that the absence of any notice requirement in the warrant casts strong doubt on its constitutional adequacy we resolve those doubts by holding that in this case the warrant was constitutionally defective in failing to provide explicitly for notice within reasonable but short time subsequent to the surreptitious entry such time should not exceed seven days except upon strong showing of necessity we take this position because surreptitious searches and seizures of intangibles strike at the very heart of the interests protected by the fourth amendment the mere thought of strangers walking through and visually examining the center of our privacy interests our home arouses our passion for freedom as does nothing else that passion the true source of the fourthmeasurements conduct examinations smell take pictures copy documents download or transmit computer files and the like and depart without taking any tangible evidence or leaving notice of their presence the rule required that after the execution of federal search warrant officers leave copy of the warrant and an inventory of what they have seized tangible or intangible and they were to advise the issuing court what they had done frcrimp 41d to what extent did rule 41 portray the standards for reasonable search and seizure for purposes of the fourth amendment the fourth amendment clearly requires officers to knock and announce their purpose before entering to execute warrant richards v wisconsin 520 us 385 1997 but with equal clarity recognizes exceptions for exigent circumstances such as where compliance will lead to the destruction of evidence flight of suspect or endanger the officers wilson v arkansas 514 us 927 1995 it is undisputed that title iii the federal wiretap statute is not constitutionally invalid because it permits delayed notice of the installation of an interception device dalia v united states 441 us 238 1979 finally there is doubt that the fourth amendment imposes demands where it does not apply thus chapter 121 court authorization for disclosure of the contents of email stored with third party service providers may permit delayed notification of the search of email in remote storage with third party for more than 180 days without offending the fourth amendment because there is fourth amendment justifiable expectation of privacy under such circumstances cf united states v miller 425 us 435 1976 the lower federal courts are divided over the extent to which the rule reflects fourth amendment requirements the ninth circuit saw the fourth amendment reflected in rule 41 united states v freitas 800 f2d 1451

court remanded the case for determination of whether grounds existed for good faith exception to application of the exclusionary rule it subsequently declined to exclude the evidence on those grounds united states v freitas freitas ii 856 f2d 1425 9th cir 1988 127 provision specifically requiring notice of the execution of search warrant is included in the fourth amendment accordingly in dalia v united states 441 us 238 247 1979 the supreme court found basis for constitutional rule proscribing all covert entries resolving the particular issue raised in dalia the court determined that the fourth amendment does not prohibit per covert entry performed for the purpose of installing otherwise legal electronic bugging equipment rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure does require notice of the execution of search warrant but does not prescribe when the notice must be given rule 41 by its terms provides for notice only in the case of seizures of physical property the supreme court also has held that the authority conferred by rule 41 is not limited to the seizure of tangible items see united states v new york telephone co 434 us 159 169 1977 despite the absence of notice requirements in the constitution and rule 41 it stands to reason that notice of surreptitious search must be given at some point after the covert entry although the freitas i court specifically determined that the warrant was constitutionally defective for failure to include notice requirement we made such determination in united states v villegas 899 f2d 1324 1999 although the freitas i court found that covert entry searches without physical seizure strike at the very heart of the fourth amendmentprotected interests we used such language in villegas indeed it was our perception that covert entry search for intangibles is less intrusive than conventional search with physical seizure because the latter deprives the owner not only of privacy but also of the use of his property we prefer to root out notice requirement in the provisions of rule 41 rather than in the somewhat amorphous fourth amendment interests concept developed by the freitas i court the fourth amendment does not deal with notice of any kind but rule 41 does it is from the rules requirements for service of copy of the warrant and for provision of an inventory that we derive the requirements of notice in cases where search warrant authorizes covert entry to search and to seize intangibles united states v pangburn 983 f2d 449 45355 2d cir 1993 128 in simons search team entered simons office at night in his absence and copied the contents of simons computer computer diskettes found in simons desk drawer computer files stored on the zip drive or on zip drives diskettes videotapes and various documents including personal corresponden ce original evidence was removed from the office neither copy of the warrant nor receipt for the property seized was left in the office or otherwise given to simons at that time and simons did not learn of the search for approximately 45 days property list however was returned to the magistrate in the view of the fourth circuit there are two categories of rule 41 violations those involving constitutional violations and all others the violations termed ministerial in our prior cases obviously fall into the latter category nonconstitutional violations of rule 41 warrant suppression only when the defendant is prejudiced by the violation or when there is evidence of intentional and deliberate disregard of provision in the rule first we conclude that the failure of the team executing the warrant to leave either copy of the warrant or receipt for the items taken did not render the search unreaso nable under the fourth amendment thethe second circuit was less convinced and preferred to hold sneak and peek searches to the demands of rule 41 united states v pangburn 983 f2d 449 2d cir 1993127 the fourth circuit was if anything less convinced moreover the facts in the case demonstrate the potential impact of the issue on computer privacy united states v simons 206 f3d 392 4th cir 2000128 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs65 fourth amendment does not mention notice and the supreme court has stated that the constitution does not categorically proscribe covert entries which necessarily involve delay in notice and insofar as the august search satisfied the requirements of the fourth amendment ie it was conducted pursuant to warrant based on probable cause issued by neutral and detached magistrate we perceive basis for concluding that the 45day delay in notice rendered the search unconstitutional having concluded that the rule 41d violation at issue here did not infringe on simons constitutional rights we must now evaluate his argument that the violation was deliberate the district court did not address the intent issue when it ruled on simons motion to suppress we therefore remand for the district court to consider whether the government intentionally and deliberately disregarded the notice provision of rule 41d when it carried out the august 6 1998 search 206 f3d at 403 129 the law that currently governs notice to subjects of warrants where there is showing to the court that immediate notice would jeopardize an ongoing investigation or otherwise interfere with lawful law enforcement activities is mix of inconsistent rules practices and court decisions varying widely from jurisdiction to jurisdicti on across the country this greatly hinders the investigation of many terrorism cases and other cases this section resolves this problem by establishing statutory uniform standard for all such circumstances it incorporates by reference the familiar courtenforced standards currently applicable to stored communications under 18 usc 2705 and applies them to all instances where the court is satisfied that immediate notice of execution of search warrant would jeopardize an ongoing investigation or otherwise interfere with lawful lawenforcement activities doj at 353 130 since neither the restriction nor its reasonable necessity exception appeared in the justice departments initial proposal the departments justification does not address the questionthe justice department urged that the conflict be resolved with uniform rule which permitted sneak and peek warrants under the same circumstances that excused delayed notification of government access to email to longerterm remote third party storage129 the act in section 213 stops short of the justice department proposal characterized as codification of the second circuit decision 147 congrec h7197 daily ed oct 23 2001 the act extends the delayed notification procedure of chapter 121 which operates in an area to which the fourth amendment is inapplicable to cases to which the fourth amendment applies 18 usc 3103a its sneak and peek authorization reaches all federal search and seizure warrants where the court finds reasonable cause to believe that notification would have the kind of adverse results depicted in 18 usc 2705 section 2705 describes both exigent circums tances eg risk of destruction of evidence or bodily injury and circumstances that are not likely to excuse notification when it is required by the fourth amendment eg jeopardizing an investigation delaying trial the sneak and peek authorization however does not reach tangible evidence or wire or electronic communication unless the court finds the seizure reasonably necessary it is not clear whether reasonable necessity means seizure necessary to the investigation that is also reasonable in fourth amendment sense ie in the presence of exigent circumstances or whether it means seizure which reasonable judge might find necessary for the

operate or seek asylum 5 the term domestic terrorism means activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state b appear to be intended i to intimidate or coerce civilian population ii to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion or iii to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and c occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 233115 132 the justice department with whom the proposal originated was somewhat cryptic on this point its analysis suggests execution in one of the several judicial districts of the united states but not so precisely as to negate any other construction the restrictiveness of the existing rule creates unnecessary delays and burdens for the government in the investigation of terrorist activities and networks that span number of districts since warrants must be separately obtained in each district this section resolves that problem by providing that warrants can be obtained in any district in which activities related to the terrorism may have occurred regardless of where the warrants will be executed doj at 351 133 united states v barona 56 f3d 1087 1092 9th cir 1995united states agents participation in the investigation is so substantial that the action is

code still carries remnants of the consular courts which speak of the overseas execution of arrest warrants in places where the united states has extraterritorial jurisdiction 18 usc 3042 the history of the provisions makes it clear that the phrase extraterritorial jurisdiction was intended to coincide with those places in which the us had consular courts see srep 217 73d cong 2d sess 3 1934

may be some question whether it creates procedure to be used in lieu of extradition when the person for whom the search warrant has been issued is located outside the united states the section refers to warrants for search of property or for person within or outside the district 219 emphasis added the judicial conference in 1990 recommended an amendment to rule 41 which the supreme court rejected that would have permitted the overseas execution of federal search warrants in doing so the conference suggested extraterritorial execution be limited to warrants to search for property and not reach

applied for most other federal crimes before passage of the act with few exceptions among the relevant exceptions were an eight year statute of limitations for several terrorist offenses 18 usc 3286137 and ten year statute of limitations for few arson and explosives offenses 18 usc 3295 the justice department recommended the elimination of statute of limitations in terrorism cases138 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs69 connection with the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the constitutionality of such retroactive applications of changes in statutes of limitations is wellsettled see eg united states v grimes 142 f3d 1342 135051 11th cir 1998 people v frazer 982 p2d 180 cal 1999 existing federal law 18 usc 3282 bars prosecuting most offenses after five years 18 usc 3286 as currently formulated extends the limitation period for prosecution for certain offenses that may be committed by terrorists but only to eight years while this is limited improvement over the fiveyear limitation period for most federal offenses it is patently inadequate in relation to the catastrophic human and social costs that frequently follow from such crimes as destruction of aircraft 18 usc 32 aircraft hijackings 49 usc 46502 4650406 attempted political assassinations 18 usc 351 1116 1751 or hostage taking 18 usc 1203 these are not minor acts of misconduct which can properly be forgiven or forgotten merely because the perpetrator has avoided apprehension for some period of time anomalously existing law provides longer limitation periods for such offenses as bank frauds and certain artwork thefts 18 usc329394 than it does for crimes characteristically committed by terrorists in many american jurisdictions the limitation periods for prosecution for serious offenses are more permissible than those found in federal law including number of states which have limitation period for the prosecution of felonies generally while this section does not go so far it does eliminate

absence of such risk or result all other terrorism offenses become subject to the eight year statute of limitations unless already covered by the ten year statute for explosives and arson offenses 18 usc 3286 application of the statute of limitations rarely provokes constitutional inquiry nevertheless due process precludes prosecution when it can be shown that pre indictment delay caused substantial prejudice to defendants rights to fair trial and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused140 moreover judicial difference of opinion has appeared in those caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs70 141 united states v matta 266 f3d 1275 1286 11th cir 2001 united states v grimes 142 f3d 1342 1351 11th cir 1998 united states v morrow 177

9th cir 1988at the time of the overseas murder of congressman ryan for which layton was convicted the statute was silent as to its extraterritorial application several years later congress added an explicit extraterritorial provision 18 usc 351i united state s v benitez 741 f2d 1312 11th cir 198418 usc 1114 has since expanded to protect all federal officers and employees including members of the armed forces and those assisting themwhen an existing period of limitation is enlarged legislatively and the new period made applicable to past offenses the lower federal courts have long noted that the constitution poses impediment to enlarging period of limitation as long as it does not revive an expired period141 recently however the california supreme court held that retroactive revival of an expired statute of limitations offended neither the california nor the united states constitution142 section 809 applies to the prosecution of any offense committed before on or after the date of enactment of this section the very words used in the justice department proposal the justice department in describing its proposal cited both federal law grimes where the court held that extensions may be applied where the earlier period of limitations has not expired and california law frazer where the court held that extensions may revive an expired period of limitations the implication is that the justice department understood its proposal to apply to past offenses whether the earlier statute of limitations had expired or not other than its use of identical terminology congress gave hint of whether it intended to adopt this view for section 809 whether the federal courts could be persuaded to overcome their previously expressed constitutional reservations is equally uncertain extraterritoriality crime is usually outlawed prosecuted and punished where it is committed in the case of the united states this is ordinarily matter of practical and diplomatic preference rather than constitutional necessity consequently although prosecutions are somewhat uncommon surprising number of federal criminal laws have extraterritorial application in some instances the statute proscribing the misconduct expressly permits the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction 18 usc 2381 treason whoever owing allegiance to the united states within the united states or elsewhere in others such as those banning assassination of members of congress 18 usc 351 or the murder of federal law enforcement officers 18 usc 1114 the courts have assumed congress intended the prohibitions to have extraterritorial reach143 the act touches upon extraterritoriality only to limited extent and in somewhat unusual ways congress has made most common law crimes murder sexual abuse kidnaping assault robbery theft and the like federal crimes when committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states represents two variations of extraterritorial jurisdiction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31377crs71 144 compare united states v gatlin 216 f3d 207 2d cir 2000 united states v laden 92 fsupp2d

territories were located exclusively within the confines of the united states but over the years they came to include at least temporarily hawaii the philippines and several other american overseas territories and possessions recently the lower federal courts have become divided over the question of whether laws enacted to apply on federal enclaves within the united states and within american territories overseas might also apply to areas in foreign countries over which the united states has proprietary control144 the act resolves the conflict by declaring within the territory of the united states those overseas areas used by american governmental entities for their activities or residences for their personnel at least to the extent that crimes are committed by or against an american section 804 18 usc 7 9 the section is inapplicable where it would otherwi conflict with treaty obligation or where the offender is covered by the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act 18 usc 3261 victims federal law has provided for crime victim compensation and assistance programs for some time moreover congress enacted september 11th victim compensation fund legislation before it passed the act consequently the acts victim provisions focus on adjustments to existing programs primarily to those of the victims of crime act of 1984 42 usc 10601 et seq and to those maintained for the benefit of public safety officers and their survivors 42 usc 3796 et seq public safety officers police officers firefighters ambulance and rescue personnel killed or disabled in the line of duty
