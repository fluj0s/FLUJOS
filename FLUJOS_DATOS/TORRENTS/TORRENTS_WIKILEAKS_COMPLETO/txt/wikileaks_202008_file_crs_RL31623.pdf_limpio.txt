nuclear weapons force posture during its first year in office the review sought to adjust us nuclear posture to address changes in the international security environment at the start of the new century although it continued many longstanding policies and programs it also introduced new elements into both us policy and us nuclear weapons programs this report wh ich will be updated as needed provides an overview of the us nuclear posture to highli ght areas of change and areas of continuity during the cold war the united states sought to deter the soviet union and its allies from attacking the united states and its allies by convincing the soviet union that any level of conflict could escalate into nuclear exchange and in that exchange the united states would plan to destroy the full range of valued targets in the soviet union other nations were included in us nuclear war plans due to their alliances with the soviet union after the cold war the united states maintained substantial nuclear arsenal to deter potential threats from russia it would not forswear the first use of nuclear weapons in confli cts with other nations such as those armed with chemical or biological weapons and formed contingency plans for such conflicts the bush administration has emphasized that the united states and russia are longer enemies and that the united states will longer plan or size its nuclear force to deter russian threat instead the united states will maintain nuclear arsenal with the capabilities needed to counter capabilities of any potential adversary focusing on how we will fight rather than who we will fight furthermore us nuclear weapons will combine with missile defenses conventional weapons and responsive infrastructure in seeking to assure us allies dissuade us adversaries deter conflict and defeat adversaries if conflict should occur during the cold war the united states maintained triad of icbms slbms and heavy bombers in strategic nuclear arsenal of more than 10000 warheads during the 1990s the united states reduced the size of this arsenal to around 7000 warheads but maintained all three legs of the triad the bush administration has announced that the united states will further reduce its arsenal to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads but that it will not eliminate many delivery vehicles while reducing its force and it will retain many nondeployed warheads in storage as responsive force that could be added to the deployed forces if conditions warranted the bush administration has also announced that it will resize and modernize the infrastructure that supports us nuclear weapons so that the united states could respond to unexpected changes in the status of its arsenal or the international security environment analysts and observers have identified several issues raised by the administrations nuclear posture review these include the role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy how to make the us nuclear deterrent credible the relationship between the us nuclear posture and the goal of discouraging nuclear proliferation plans for strategic nuclear weapons and the future of nonstrategic nuclear weapons httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31623g23g495g21g495g561g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g497g561g5g145 g138g151g144

the united states maintained nuclear forces that were sized and structured to deter any attack by the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies and if deterrence failed to defeat the soviet union in the years since the 1989 collapse of the berlin wall and 1991 demise of the soviet union officials in the us government and analysts outside government have conducted numerous reviews and studies of us nuclear weapons policy and force structure although these studies have varied in scope intent and outcome most have sought to describe new role for us nuclear weapons and to identify the appropriate size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal in the postcold war era in offering their recommendations these analyses addressed not only the end of the hostile ussoviet global rivalry but also the emergence of new threats and regional challenges to us security the us department of defense conducted several farreaching reviews including the 1993 bottomup review the 1994 nuclear posture review and the 1997 quadrennial defense review that contributed to the clinton administrations response to changes in the international security environment these formal reviews when combined with less prominent internal studies resulted in numerous changes to the structure of us nuclear forces and policy guiding their potential use however many critics of the clin ton administration argued that at the end of the 1990s the us nuclear posture looked much as it had at the beginning of the decade the number of deployed nuclear weapons had declined as the united states implemented the first strategic arms reduction treaty start i and completed the withdrawal of most of its nonstrategic nuclear weapons but even though the soviet ion longer existed and the threat of global nuclear war had sharply diminished the united stat continued to focus its nuclear planning and size and structure its nuclear forces to deter the potential threat of russian attack in speech at the national press club in ma 2000 thengovernor george w bush both echoed the criticism of the clinton administrations nuclear policy and outlined an alternative approach that he pledged to adopt if elected 1 he stated that the clintongore administration remained locked in cold war mentality and that the united states needed to fend against the new threats of the 21st century he argued that america should rethink the requirements for nuclear deterrence and stated that the premises of cold war nuclear targeting should longer dictate the size of our arsenal he stated that if ected he would ask the secretary of defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture after dod completed that assessment he would reduce us nuclear forces to the lowest possible number consistent with our national security in several speeches and statements during his first year in office president bush and his advisers stated that russia is longer our enemy and they pledged to alter us nuclear weapons policy to reflect this view in its debate over the fy2001 defense authorization bill the senate passed provision that called on the next president to conduct new nuclear posture review during his first year in office during the last few years of the clinton administration congress had prevented the president from reducing us strategic nuclear forces below the levels specified in start i until the 1993 start ii treaty entered into force the clinton administration had sought relief from this language because the costs to the services of retaining weapons slated for elimination were 1 federal document clearing

g344g561growing but some members questioned whether the clinton administration might reduce us forces too far if congress lifted the prohibition hence the senate retained the prohibition in the fy2001 bill and stated that the next president could only reduce us forces after conducting new nuclear posture review although the house had not included similar language in its bill the conference committee supported the call for new nuclear posture review2 these two factorsthe congressional mandate and the presidential commitmentestablished the framework for the bush administrations revi ew of us nuclear posture the administration completed its review and sent classified report to congress at the end of december 2001 it provided the public with summary of its results in early january 2002 the results of the administrations review generated significant amount of debate in january and then again in march when copy of the classified report leaked to the press most analysts focused on areas where the bush administration had proposed to change us nuclear posture some focused on areas where us nuclear policy would remain the same as it had been for years or even decades this report provides general overview of the past present and possible future of us nuclear policy it begins with review of the international security environment highlighting the threats that the united states has sought to deter or res pond to with its nuclear forces it then reviews the strategy and doctrine guiding the us nuclear force posture targeting and employment policy the numbers and types of weapons in the nuclear force structure and the infrastructure that has supported design development and testing of us nuclear weapons in each of these areas the report summarizes us nuclear policy during the cold war identifies changes implemented in the decade after the collapse of the soviet union and details how the bush administration proposes to bring continuity and change to us nuclear weapons policy and infrastructure the report concludes with discussion of several issues and questions that analysts have raised after reviewing the bush administrations nuclear posture review these include the role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy how to make the us nuclear deterrent credible the relationship between us nuclear posture and th goal of discouraging nuclear proliferation plans for strategic nuclear weapons and the future of nonstrategic nuclear weapons

capabilities sufficient to convince any potential aggressor that the costs of aggression would exceed any potential gains that he might achieve3 in spite of these general statements however one nation stood at the top of the list of potential aggresso rs the soviet union was the only nation with nuclear arsenal that could threaten the political existence of the united states and the only nation that could pose global challenge to us allies and interests therefore when detailing threats to 2 section 1041 of that legislation pl 106945 called on the secretary of defense to conduct comprehensive

threat to us security interests remained the global challenge posed by the soviet union4 other nations such as those in sovietdominated eastern europe were included in the us nuclear war plans but their presence reflected their relationship with the soviet union more than any independent threat they might pose to the united states or allies china could also threaten us interests and the united states maintained the capability to respond to possible contingencies in asia but because the soviet threat dominated us defense planning officials believed that nuclear forces sized and structured to deter the soviet threat would be sufficient to deter or respond to these lesser included cases

of 1991 essentially eliminated the threat of global nuclear war between the supe rpowers the clinton administration argued that the dissolution of the soviet empire had radically transformed the security environment facing the united states and our allies the primary security imperative of the past half century containing communist expansion whil preventing nuclear waris gone 5 but the clinton administration argued that russia could potentially pose threat to the united states again in the future this potential existed not because its intentions are hostile but because it controls the only nuclear arsenal that can physically threaten the survivability of us nuclear forces6 furthermore officials in the administration argued that stable transition in russia is by means assured so the united states must hedge against the possibility that russia which continues to maintain formidable nuclear arsenal consisting of thousands of deliverable strategic and tactical warheads could reemerge at some time in the future as threat to the west7 at the same time the clinton administration recognized growing threats to the united states from number of emerging adversaries particularly if they were armed with weapons of mass destruction in its national security strategy report for 1998 the administration noted that number of states still have the capabilities and the desire to threaten our vital interests and that in many cases these states are also actively improving their offensive capabilities including efforts to obtain or retain nuclear biologic or chemical weapons and in some cases long range delivery systems the clinton administration also declared that weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to global stability and security proliferation of advanced weapons and technologies threatens to provide rogue states terrorists and international crime organizations the means to inflict terrible damage on the united states its allies and us citizens and troops abroad8 the clinton administration did not consider china to pose direct threat to the united states nevertheless administration officials did note that china maintained formidable

administration also stated that china continues to make steady efforts to modernize those forces and that the united states cannot be sure that it will not need nuclear weapons to deter china in the future9 g22g145g155g142g138g157g561g3g156g156g142g156g156g150g142g151g157g561g158g151g141g142g155g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g156g145g561g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 the bush administration has stated that nuclear forces continue to play critical role in the defense of the united states its allies and friends they provide credible capabilities to deter wide range of threats including weapons of mass destruction and largescale conventional military force 10 however in contrast with the clinton administrations view about potential russian threat the bush administration has stated on several occasions that russia and the united states are longer enemies even though russia retains thousands of nuclear warheads which could reach targets in the united states the administration hoped that the growing cooperation between the two nations would allow new strategic framework to replace the cold wars adversarial relationship and its reliance on mutual assured destruction consequently according to the administrations public comments on the nuclear posture review the united states will longer plan size or sustain its nuclear forces as though russia presented merely smaller version of the threat posed by the former soviet union 11 the administration does acknowledge however that hostile peer competitor could reemerge in the future and this potential contingency did play role in decisions on the future size and structure of us nuclear forces 12 at the same time the bush administration has argued that in the future the united states is likely to be challenged by adversaries who possess wide range of capabilities including asymmetric approaches to warfare particularly weapons of mass destruction13 according to some in the administration these adversaries might threaten us allies and interests us forces protecting us interests and us territory in an effort to blackmail the united states to retreat from its commitments around the world these adversaries could include nonstate actors and terrorists as well as nations such as china 14 iran north korea and others therefore when planning its nuclear policy and force structure the united states now faces threats from multiple potential opponents sources of conflict and unprecedented challenges15 9 statement of the honorable edward l warner assistant secretary of

adversaries as was noted above the soviet union and russia have been the primary but not only targets of this strategy the united states has sought to deter attack by maintaining nuclear force structure and operational plans for those forces that would convince any attacking nation that the costs of its aggression would far outweigh the benefits the challenge for us nuclear policy has been to make this threat credible many analysts have argued that the overwhelming destructive power of nuclear weapons could have undermined the threat to use thembecause the soviet union and russia could have responded to us retaliatory attack with equally destructive attacks against the united states the united states might not have launched its nuclear forces other nations might not be able to threaten the united states with massive destruction but they also might not believe that the united states would cross the nuclear threshold unless its own survival were at risk hence the united states has sought on many occasions in the past 50 years to modify and adjust its forces and targeting strategy so that potential adversaries would believe and heed the us threat to retaliate with nuclear weapons adding more limited attack options and seeking greater flexibility in the timing and size of potential nuclear attacks

threatening massive retaliation and assured destruction these strategies envisioned largescale us nuclear strike against wide variety of targets in the soviet union eastern europe and china if the soviet union or its allies initiated nuclear or largescale conventional attack against the united states or its allies16 in threatening such an overwhelming response the united states sought to convince soviet leaders that the soviet union would cease to exist as functioning society if it initiated conflict against the united states and its allies in the 1970s the united states adopted strategy of flexible response and subsequently countervailing strategy these policies emphasized retaliatory strikes on soviet military forces and warmaking capabilities as opposed to attacks on civilian and industrial targets they also allowed for the possibility of limited focused attacks on smaller number of targets these strategies sought to provide the president with more flexibility with respect to the timing scale and the targets of the attack than he would have had in earlier years the united states sought to deter not only nuclear attack on us territory but also nuclear chemical or conventional attacks and coercion aimed at us allies in europe and asia 17 this extended deterrent sought to convince the soviet union that any level of aggression against us allies could escalate into nuclear conflict that might involve attacks on the soviet union the united states and its allies did not insist that they would respond to any level of aggression with nuclear weapons but they sought to maintain the capability to do so this posture reflected in part the fact that the soviet union and warsaw pact maintained clear numerical superiority 16 for more detailed discussion

weapons the united states and nato might face defeat consequently the united states would not rule out the possible first use of nuclear weapons in conflict however in the late 1970s the united states issued negative security assurance in conjunction with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in which it stated that it would not threaten or attack with nuclear weapons any nonnuclear weapons states that were parties to the npt unless these states were allied with nuclear nation in conflict with the united states this last exclusion meant that the statement did not alter us nuclear planning for potential conflicts with the soviet union and warsaw pact however some analysts believed that this commitment would encourage other nations to forswear their own nuclear weapons because they knew they would not need such weapons to deter or respond to nuclear attack from the united states

the 1990s the clinton administrati on and others argued that nuclear weapons remained important to deter the range of threats faced by the united states secretary of defense perry outlined this view in his annual repor t for 1995 noting that recent international upheavals have not changed the calculation that nuclear weapons remain an essential part of american military power concepts of deterrence continue to be central to the us nuclear posture thus the united states will continue to threaten retaliation including nuclear retaliation to deter aggression against the united states us forces and allies 18 in theory this deterrent strategy extended beyond russiathe united states must continue to maintain robust triad of strategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile fore ign leadership with access to nuclear forces and to convince it that seeking nuclear advantage would be futile furthermore according to the clinton administration nuclear weapons serve as hedge against an uncertain future guarantee of our security commitments to allies and disincentive to those who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons 19 the clinton administration retained the existing us policy on first usespecifically it did not forswear the first use of nuclear weapons the clinton administration indicated that nations other than russia might face nuclear retaliation if they attacked the united states with nuclear chemical or biological weapons although it reaff irmed the us negative security assurance in 1995 administration officials indicated that the united states would reserve the right to use nuclear weapons first if state is not state in good standing under the nuclearnonproliferation treaty npt or an equivalent international convention 20 furthermore nation might forfeit its protections under the negative security assurance if it attacked the united states or us forces with weapons of mass destruction wmd 21 the united states did not however directly threaten to use nuclear weapons in retaliation for nonnuclear attacks its policy was one of studi ed ambiguity for example when discussing how the united states might

g349g561secretary of defense william perry stated if some nation were to attack the united states with chemical weapons then they would have to fear the consequences of response from any weapon in our inventory we could make devastating response without the use of nuclear weapons but we would not forswear the possibility22 secretary perry also noted that although the united states would not specify how it would respond to wmd use an aggressor could be certain that the us response would be both overwhelming nd devastating assistant secretary of defense edward warner testified that the very existence of us strategic and theater nuclear forces backed by highly capable conventional forces should certainly give pause to any rogue leader contemplating the use of wmd against the united states its overseas deployed forces or its allies23 these statements generally referred to the potential us response to an attack from another nation most experts agreed that nuclear weapons could do little to deter an attack from non state actorit might be difficult to identify such an attacker and it could be difficult to identify appropriate targets for us response nonetheless many experts agreed that us nuclear weapons might play role in deterring the state sponsors of nonstate actors during the 1990s the nato alliance altered its nuclear strategy to reflect the demise of the soviet union and warsaw pact but also did not adopt nofirst use policy although nuclear weapons play far smaller role in alliance strategy than they did during the cold war the nato allies reaffirmed the importance of nuclear weapons for deterrence the new strategic concept signed in april 1999 stated that to protect peace and to prevent war or any kind of coercion the alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces nuclear weapons make unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the alliance incalculable and unacceptable furthermore nuclear weapons ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor about the nature of the allies response to military aggression 24

range of targets valued by an adversary as result they continue to play key role in us deterrent strategy during the cold war and in the past decade us policy often viewed nuclear weapons apart from

integrated role for nuclear weapons in its presentation outlining the results of the nuclear posture review the administration argued that nuclear weapons along with missile defenses and other elements of the us military establishment not only deter adversaries by promising an unacceptable amount of damage in response to an adversarys attack they can also assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security by providing an extended deterrent dissuade potential adversaries from challenging the united states with nuclear weapons or other asymmetrical threats by convincing them that they can never negate the us nuclear deterrent and defeat enemies by holding at risk those targets that could not be destroyed with other types of weapons26 according to former undersecretary of defense douglas feith linking nuclear forces to multiple defense policy goals and not simply to deterrence recognizes that these forces perform key missions in peacetime as well as in crisis or conflict 27 in addition to expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond deterrence the bush administration has altered the role of deterrence in us national security strategy it has stated in several speeches and documents that the united states may not be able to contain or deter the types of threats that are emerging today such as those created by rogue nations or terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction consequently the united states must also be prepared to preempt these threats by launching strikes against adversaries before the adversary attacks the united states its allies or its interests some analysts have concluded that with this change in perspective the administration foresees the possible preemptive use of nuclear weapons against nations or groups that are not necessarily armed with their own nuclear weapons 28 this would be striking change in us national security policy with the united states possibly contemplating nuclear use early or at the start of conflict rather than in response to actions taken by the adversary 29 on the other hand some have argued that with its overwhelming conventional superiority it would be difficult to imagine scenario where the united states would have military need to launch preemptive strike with nuclear weapons in the opening phases of conflict nevertheless the united states has not ruled out this possibility the idea that nuclear weapons can play role that goes beyond threatening nuclear retaliation is not new to the bush administration the clinton ad ministration also stated that nuclear weapons can serve as guarantee of our security commitments to allies and disincentive to those who would contemplate developing or otherw ise acquiring their own nuclear weapons30 the key difference between the past and the future may be rhetoricalduring the cold war the united states emphasized the role that nuclear weapons could play in deterring the soviet union before mentioning other possible objectives for us nuclear policy in the future with the greatly reduced risk of global nuclear war the other objectives may become more prominent in discussions of us national security strategy 26 us department

bush administration asserted that in spite of contributing to four distinct policy objectives nuclear weapons would play smaller role in us national security strategy in the future than they had during the cold war according to the administration us deterrent policy has been highly dependent on the threat of offensive nuclear retaliation with the president having few other options for response if the united states or its allies were attacked now according to the administration the united states will also seek to deter and defeat adversaries with precision conventional weapons which may soon be able to destroy some targets that were assigned to nuclear weapons in the past and ballistic missile defenses which can deter attack by denying an adversary the ability to threaten us targets with ballistic missiles 31 according to administration officials this new combination of weapons will provide the president with greater number of options and greater flexibility when responding to threats or aggression from us adversaries some in the administration have referred to this change as tailored deterrence with the united states developing more specific responses that would rely on broader range of military capabilities to respond to the threats posed by emerging adversaries 32 some have argued that national security concept that combines nuclear and conventional capabilities will blur the distinction between the two types of weapons and therefore increase the likelihood of nuclear response the administration however has argued that the presence of nuclear and conventional options would reduce pressures to resort to nuclear weapons by giving the president nonnuclear options to ensure us security 33 furthermore according to those who support the administrations approach where adversaries might doubt the us willingness to resort to nuclear weapons these expanded options could enhance the credibility of the us deterrent others note however that over the years the threat of conventional response has not succeeded in deterring potential adversaries requiring the united states to respond with conventional attack and war further in spite of the administrations presentation of new triad us military planning has always presented the president with range of options nuclear options may have dominated possible us responses to soviet aggression but the president could always choose conventional options when faced with crisis or conflict in fact throughout the cold war and the decade since the united states has always chosen conventional rather than nuclear options when responding to aggression

not alter the us policy on the first use of nuclear weapons however with its emphasis on the emerging threats posed by nations armed with weapons of mass destruction the administration did appear to shift towards somewhat more explicit approach when acknowledging that the united states might use nuclear weapons in response to attacks by nations armed with chemical biological and conventional weapons the bush administration has stated that the united states would develop and deploy those nuclear capabilities that it would need to defeat the capabilities of any potential adversary whether or not it possessed nuclear weapons spec ifically in its briefing on the nuclear posture review the administration stated that the capabilities needed in the us nuclear force structure are not countryspecific and that the united states must maintain capabilities for unexpected and potential risks the focus will be on how we will fight not who we will fight 34 this does not by itself indicate that the united states would plan to use nuclear weapons first in conflicts with nonnuclear nations however general richard b myers then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff stated in an interview that the scope of the destruction not the weapon used in an attack would affect us decision on whether to respond with nuclear weapons he included high explosives ie conventional weapons in the list of weapons of mass destruction that might bring nuclear response from the united states35 furthermore press articles that reported on the nuclear posture review stated that the administ ration had considered using nuclear weapons in contingencies with nations such as iran iraq syria and libya36 these nations do not at this time possess nuclear weapons when responding to these press reports the bush administration stated that the npr had not produced war plans for attacks on nonnuclear nations instead the us nuclear force posture was designed to deter these nations from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction according to the presidents national security adviser condoleezza rice it was supposed to send very strong signal to anyone who might try to use weapons of mass destruction against the united states 37 president bush also appeared to endorse policy of more explicit nuclear threats during news conference on march 14 2002 he stated that we want to make it very clear to nations that you will not threaten the united states or use weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies i view our nuclear arsenal as deterrent as way to say to people that would harm america that there is consequence and the president must have all the options available to make that deterrent have meaning 38 documents and press reports published in the years since the release of the npr have reinforced the perception that the united states is planning for the possible or even likely first use of nuclear weapons in conflicts with nations that do not possess their own nuclear weapons in 2004 and 2005 the joint staff prepared new draft of its joint doctrine for nuclear operations document that had last been updated in 1995 the last available draft of this document dated march 15 2005 includes list of several circumstances under which the united states might consider the first use of nuclear weapons these would not only allow for the use of nuclear weapons in

rhetorical approach used in the negative security assurance is necessarily the most productive and doesnt seem to to be terribly helpful in analyzing what our security needs may be in the real world 40 he argued that the assurances had been offered in very different geostrategic context and stated that the bush administration would be reviewing us security assurances to nonnuclear nations in the context of our preparation for the 2005 review conference of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 41

in terms of the numbers and types of targets to be attacked and varied according to the number and types of us warheads available when the conflict began42 in 1990 general john chain commander in

the disintegration of the warsaw pact and collapse of the soviet union the department of defense conducted several studies to review us nuclear targeting strategy and weapons employment policy according to published reports these reviews revised and greatly reduced the length of the target list but left the basic tenets of the strategy untouched according to 1995 article in the washington post the united states primary nuclear war plan still targets russia and provides the president an option for counterattack within 30 minutes of confirmed enemy launch 44 in 1997 the clinton administration altered the us strategy from seeking to win protracted nuclear war strategy identified during the reagan administration to seeking to deter nuclear war in practice this probably meant the united states would not seek to cause as much damage against as wide range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans consequently the united states would not need to maintain as large an arsenal of nuclear weapons as it had needed during the cold war 45 but these changes did not alter the core objectives of us nuclear policy the unite d states would continue to emphasize the survivability of the nuclear systems and infrastructure necessary to endure preemptive attack and still respond at overwhelming levels 46 furthermore the united states reportedly continued to

arguing that it leads russia to maintain its forces at high st ate of alert which could lead to an inadvertent launch of russias nuclear weapons if russia r eceived false or ambiguous warnings of nuclear attack nevertheless clinton administration officials stated that the united states would not rely solely on the ability to launch promptly it could wait until detonations had occurred then launch its retaliatory strike at later time 49 consequently some of the options available in us war plans included weapons that would be available if the united states launched its forces before any were destroyed and some included only those weapons that would survive if the united states absorbed first strike before initiating its response the decision on whether to launch us weapons promptly or to wait for detonations on us soil would be left to the national command authority at the time of the crisis

range of capabilities and contingencies that the united states may confront and tailor us military capabilities to address this wide spectrum of possible contingencies52 specifically the united states would identify potential future conflicts review the capabilities of its possible adversaries identify those capabilities that the united states might need to attack or threaten with nuclear weapons and develop force posture and nuclear weapons employment strategy that would allow it to attack those capabilities the most specific and visible change to emerge from this new targeting strategy has been the replacement of the cold war siop single integrated operational plan with new war plan known as oplan operations plan 8044 this docu ment now contains the major strike options and major contingency plans that had been included in the siop some press reports indicate that the administration also developed then companion contingency plan conplan 802222 which planned for the prompt us response to number of contingencies with nations other than russia reports indicate that while most of the options in this new plan called for the use of conventional weapons some also allow for the use of nuclear weapons early or at the start of conflict 53 the pentagon reportedly eliminated this plan after few years absorbing its targeting and attack options into oplan 8044 the bush administration has not discussed publicly how it will identify specific targets or allocate weapons in its capabilitiesbased targeting strategy it has however identified three types of contingencies that it believes the united states must prepare to address with its nuclear employment plans54 immediate contingencies include wellrecognized current dangers the soviet threat was an immediate contingency in the past current examples include wmd attack on us forces or allies in the middle east or asia potential contingencies are plausible but not immediate dangers this might include the emergence of new adversarial military coalitions or the reemergence of hostile peer competitor according to the administration the united states would probably have sufficient warning of the emergence of these threats to modify or adjust its nuclear posture unexpected contingencies are sudden and unpredicted security challenges this might include sudden regime change when an existing nuclear arsenal transferred to the control of hostile leadership or an adversarys sudden acquisition of wmd these three types of contingencies would place different demands on us nuclear war planners because the united states can understand and anticipate immediate contingencies it can size structure and plan in advance for the use of its nuclear arsenal to address these contingencies just 52 us senate

war55 the united states can also plan in advance for the possible use of nuclear weapons in potential contingencies even if it does not maintain the needed force structure on daytoday basis hence the warplanning and targeting process for these contingencies are likely to be similar to the process used during the cold war albeit with wider range of possible plans to address targets among greater number of countries and although the administration has not addressed this issue the united states will likely prepare number of alternative employment plans so that the president will have options to choose from if conflict occurs these are likely to include many of the same types of targets as the united states planned to attack during the cold war because the ability to destroy these types of facilities is likely to remain important to th us ability to defeat an enemy and limit damage to itself during conflict these targets could include deployed and nondeployed stocks of weapons of mass destruction during the cold war soviet nuclear weapons made up the majority of the targets in this category other military facilities leadership facilities and possibly other economic targets the united states cannot however prepare preplanned options for attacks for unexpected contingencies because it does not know when or where these threats may emerge the focus on the unexpected has underlined the administrations insistence that the united states develop and expand its capabilities for adaptive planning 56 the united states strategic command stra tcom which develops the operational plans for us strategic nuclear weapons already has the ability to do some adaptive planning it began this effort in 1992 when it sought to develop flexible globally focused war planning process along with living siop nuclear war plan able to respond almost instantaneously to new requirements57 now stratcom is in the process of developing more flexible and adaptive planning system that employs modern computing techniques and streamlined processes to significantly improve our planning capability for rapid flexible crisis response 58 responsive adaptive planning process must also rely on timely and accurate intelligence so that the planners will be able to identify targets and attack them at their vulnerable points therefore the administration has called for improvements in us sensors and technologies so that they can provide more detailed information about an adversarys plans force developments and vulnerabilities it has requested additional funding for the development of advanced sensors and imagery for improved intelligence and assessment and for modernization of communications and targeting capabilities in support of evolving strike concepts 59 the bush administration has emphasized the increasing importance of adaptive planning and waning relevance of preplanned attack options to highlight the fact that its nuclear doctrine and targeting strategy focus on emerging threats ra ther than on smaller version of the cold war 55 the administration has indicated however that it will not size the force of operationally deployed nuclear warheads to address the potential russian threat us department of defense special briefing on the nuclear posture review news transcript january 9 2002 56 according to undersecretary feith the united states mu st

probably do not represent complete break from past practices first because the administration has identified the reemergence of peer competitor as one of the potential contingencies the united states might need to address the united states is likely to retain some form of predetermined war plan with options for possible attacks against russian targets second although the administration has indicated that it will reduce the number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads this is discussed in the next section it will retain enough warheads to threaten many if not most of the targets included in options in the current oplan it may eliminate some of the existing options and possibly add options for attacks against other possible adversaries but it probably will not completely replace preplanned options with adaptive planning instead us nuclear weapons employment policy is likely to include options for attacks against russia contingency plans for attacks against other countries and adaptive planning capabilities to address unexpected emerging threats this would be similar to the employment policy that had emerged by the end of the clinton administration although the clinton ad ministration continued to prepare siop that focused on russia press reports indicate it also maintained current intelligence on wmd facilities in countries such as iran iraq and rth korea and that it passed this information to target planners at stratcom so that they coul d prepare contingency plans for attacks with us nuclear weapons according to one report stra tcom

to maintain the morale and operational readiness of the units further the 2005 draft of the doctrine for joint nuclear operations specifically states that increased readiness levels may be necessary to deter aggression and that the alert posturing of nuclear weapons can send forceful message that demonstrates the national will to use nuclear weapons if necessary 61 in addition with the growing

shorterrange nuclear weapons on land in europe japan and south korea and on ships around the world these weapons were deemed essential to the us strategy of extending nuclear deterrence to its allies the united states began to reduce these forces in the late 1970s in part because nato officials believed they could maintain deterrence with fewer but more modern weapons 63 these modernization programs continued through the 1980s particularly through the deployment of groundlaunched cruise missiles and intermediaterange ballistic missiles in europe however by the end of that decade as the warsaw pact dissolved the united states had canceled or scaled back all planned modernization programs in 1987 it also signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty which eliminated all us

1960s the united states has maintained triad of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles these include landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms and longrange heavy bombers the united states developed these three different types of nuclear delivery vehicles in large part because each of the military services wanted to play role in the us nuclear arsenal however during the 1960s and 1970s analysts developed more reasoned rationale for the nuclear triad they argued that these different basing modes would enhance deterrence and discourage soviet first strike because they complicated soviet attack planning and ensured the survivability of significant portion of the us force in the event of soviet first strike 64 the different characteristics of each weapon system might also strengthen the credibility of us targeting strategy for example icbms eventually had the accuracy and prompt responsiveness needed to attack hardened targets such as

icbms and trident submarines and trident ii d5 slbms in the mid1980s and 1990s and with the deployment of the b2 stealth bomber in the 1990s the united states also continued to add to the numbers of

research and development on antiballistic missile abm systems since the early 1950s in the mid1960s it developed the sentinel system which would have used groundbased nucleararmed interceptor missiles to protect number of major us urban centers against soviet attack in 1969 the nixon admini stration renamed the system safeguard and changed its focus to deployment around icbm fields to ensure that these missiles could survive first strike and retaliate against the soviet union congress almost stopped the program in 1969 when the senate voted 5050 to approve an amendment halting construction safeguard continued however when vice president spiro agnew broke the tie with vote for the program in 1972 the united states and soviet union signed the antiballistic missile abm treaty which limited each nation to the deployment of two abm sites one around its capital and one around an icbm field 66 the united states completed its abm site around icbm fields near grand forks north dakota it operated for short time in 1974 and 1975 then was shut down by congress largely because the costs of operating the system even in peacetime were thought to be high relative to the limited protection it offered us research and development into abm systems especially for icbm protection continued albeit at lower budget levels through the late 1970s before rising again during the carter administration the reagan administration further increased this funding after president reagan announced an expansive effort known as the strategic defense initiative sdi to develop nonnuclear ballistic missile defenses based on land at sea and in space that would protect the united states against fullscale attack from the soviet union as cost estimates and technical challenges increased the reagan administration stated that it would begin with more limited deployment of landbased and spacebased sensors and interceptors that would seek to disrupt and deter an incoming attack instead of providing complete protection the first bush administration further scaled back the goals for sdi stating that the united states would seek to deploy defensive system that could protect against small scale missile attacks from the soviet union or other us adversaries

would withdraw all landbased tactical nuclear weapons those that could travel more than 300 miles from overseas bases and all seabased tactical nuclear weapons from us surface ships submarines and naval aircraft67 these initiatives affected more than 2500 nuclear warheads that had been deployed on shorter range delivery systems68 furthermore in late 1991 nato decided to reduce by about half the number of weapons for nuclearcapable aircraft based in europe which led to the withdrawal of an additional 700 us airdelivered nuclear weapons at the end of the 1990s the united states maintained an estimated 1000 warheads for its active stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons 69 this number included around 500 airdelivered weapons that may still be stored at bases in europe70 the remainder are airdelivered weapons and around 350 nuclear armed sealaunched cruise missiles that are stored at facilities in the united states

1 below in early 1993 the united states and russia signed second strategic arms reduction treaty under this treaty the united states and russia would have each reduced their strategic offensive nuclear weapons to between 3000 and 3500 accountable warheads in 1994 the department of defense decided that to meet this limit it would deploy force of 500 minuteman iii icbms with one warhead on each missile 14 trident submarines with 24 missiles on each submarine and 5 warheads on each missile 76 b52 bombers and 21 b2 bombers the air force would eliminate 50 peacekeeper icbms and reorient

outlines the forces that the 67 these steps were not contingent on reciprocal actions by the soviet union but on october 5 1991 soviet president gorbachev announced similar set of initiatives 68 the united states maintained the capability to return seabased nuclear weapons to aircraft carriers and submarines in 1994 the department of defense nuclear posture review recommended that the united

described new triad of weapons systems and capabilities that will contribute to nuclear deterrence and us national security in the coming years 71 in this new triad nuclear weapons and precisionguided conventional weapons combine as offensive strike forces according to the administration this combined strike force will reduce the us reliance on nuclear weapons and provide the pres ident with greater number of options when responding to an attack missile defenses make up the second leg of the triad the bush administration has stated that defenses will contribute to deterrence by complicating attack planning and undermining confidence for an adversary planning an attack with ballistic missiles and by giving the united states an option besides shooting back if attacked with ballistic missiles the third leg of the new triad is responsive infrastructure that would allow the united states to maintain and if necessary expand its nuclear arsenal in response to emerging threats this capability would allow the united states to reduce its forces knowing it could restore them at later date if new threats emerged these three legs are joined together by command and control intelligence and planning capabilities the administration has stated that these will provide the united states the ability to identify targets and plan nuclear or conventional attacks on short notice in response to unexpected threats the administration argues that the new triad will provide the flexibility in planning necessary to address the new range of contingencies including the unexpected and undeterrable 72 the following sections summarize the bush administrations plans for nonstrategic and strategic nuclear weapons missile defenses and infrastructure the report does not

from 10 bases in seven countries in 2000 to 8 bases in six countries by the end of its first term76 although the reports on the npr did not discuss many details for us nonstrategic nuclear weapons the bush administration could support th continued deployment of these systems the administrations strategy outlines the need to react quickly to new intelligence and promptly target and deliver nuclear weapons to emerging targets nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed at bases overseas may be closer to the battlefield than strategic weapons based in the continental united states and therefore may be able to respond more quickly they also may carry fewer and smaller warheads than us strategic nuclear weapons which would make them better suited to discrete precise attacks

not determined by need to counter russian threat however the administration did consider russias remaining nuclear capabilities when developing the us nuclear force posture conflict with russia is considered to be potential contingency that could arise if the us relationship with russia were to deteriorate significantly the forces needed to address potential contingencies are included in the

this traditional triad although the points raised in the past about the differing and complementary capabilities of the systems probably still pertain moreover the administration also initially at least plans to retain most of the delivery vehicles in the current strategic force structure as it reduces from the current level of around 7000 warheads80 to force of around 2200 operationally

total number of weapons that could be carried on all us bombers the administration has indicated that approximately 3800 warheads would be deactivated in the nearterm and many of these warheads would be placed in an active reserve according to the administration these stored warheads constitute responsive force because the warheads could be restored to deployment in weeks or months in response to potential contingencies which are more severe dangers that could emerge over longer period of time secretary of defense rumsfeld has also noted that the united states must retain many retired warheads because it currently has warhead production capacity if problems came up that disabled type of warhead the united states could only maintain its forces by deploying the stored warheads 83 on the other hand in june 2004 ambassador linton brooks director of the national nuclear security administration nnsa announced that the bush administration had decided to reduce sharply the size of the us nuclear stockpile although he did not offer any precise numbers he stated that the number of warheads would decline by over half in the next eight years84 groups outside the government have estimated that this decision could lead to the retirement and disassembly of around 4300 warheads in the coming years leaving around 6000 warheads in the us stockpile by 201285 further in middecember 2007 the white house announced that president bush had approved significant reduction in the us nuclear weapons stockpile86 the release did not provide any concrete numbers but officials indicated the reduction could be between 10 and 15 critics argue that this reconstitution force makes mockery of the us plans to reduce its offensive nuclear forces the administration however has claimed that the ability to reconstitute forces if necessary allows for deep reductions in operationally deployed forces the administration has also stated that the responsive force represents the force that the united states will need to meet the four goals of dissuading potential adversaries assuring allies deterring aggression and defeating enemies 87 the following provides more detailed summary of the bush administrations plans for each leg of triad of strategic offensive forces88 g11g5g4g15g156g561 at the start of the bush administration in 2001 the us icbm force contained 500 peacekeeper missiles each deployed with 10 warheads and 500 minuteman iii missiles each minuteman iii missile could carry 3 warheads but as it reduced to the start force levels the united states downloaded 150 minutema n iii

carried total of 1700 warheads before the peacekeeper deactivation program began the bush administration deactivated and retired all 50 peacekeeper icbms dod first announced this decision and the air force began to budget for the process in 1994 the 1993 start ii treaty would have banned multiple warhead icbms so the united states would have had to eliminate these missiles while implementing the treaty however beginning in fy1998 congress prohibited the clinton administration from spending any money on the deactivation or retirement of these missiles until start ii entered into force an event that never occurred the bush administration requested 14 million in fy2002 to begin the missiles retirement congress lifted the restriction and authorized the funding the bush administration began deactivating the peacekeeper missiles in october 2002 and completed the retirement on september 19 2005 89 under start ii the united states would have had to destroy the silos that house the peacekeeper missiles to ensure that the missiles could not be deployed again in the future now however the air force plans to retain the empty silos and save the expense of excavating or exploding them it also plans to retain the missile stages for possible use as space launch vehicles or target vehicles for missile defense tests finally it plans to retain the warheads removed from the missiles and deploy some of them on minuteman iii missiles90 the bush administration is also in the proces s of reducing the minu teman iii force from 500 to 450 missiles although the 109th congress prohibited the administration from proceeding with this plan until it submitted report justifying the plan and analyzing its implications it still plans to download most of them to carry only 1 warhea d but some could remain deployed with 2 or 3 warheads for total force of 500600 warheads the air force plans to modernize these missiles to improve their accuracy and reliability and to extend their service lives beyond 2020 this modernization program is expected to cost around 55 billion 91 of this amount 55 million will be used to upgrade the command consoles in missile alert facilities to allow for more rapid retargetinga capability identified in the npr as essential to the future nuclear force the air force is also conducting an ongoing 19 billion program to replace the guidance system on the minuteman missile to increase its accuracy and extend its service life the air force had hoped that the new guidance system would make the minuteman missile as accurate as the peacekeeper missiles but press reports indicate that the system has shown some problems during its testing program 92 the air force has also been repouring the fuel in the first and second stages of the minuteman missiles remanufacturing the third stage the air force will also eventually extend the life of the missiles fourth stage the one that carries the reentry vehicle finally under the safety enhanced reentry vehicle program the air force will replace the existing warheads on some of the minuteman missiles with the w87 warheads removed from peacekeeper missiles 93 the air force has also begun to study its options for extending or replacing the minuteman iii missiles it reportedly produced mission needs statement and conducted an analysis of alternatives aoa during fy2004 nd fy2005 with plan to bring the new missile into service 89 us nuclear forces 2002 nrdc nuclear notebook bulletin of the atomic scientists mayjune 2002 p 70 90 ibid 91 ibid 92 donnelly john m air force defends spending half

command noted that his organization would recommend to the pentagon that the air force take an evolutionary approach with the minuteman and continue to modernize and upgrade existing missiles rather than start from scratch designing and producing new missile under this plan the existing fleet of minuteman iii missiles could remain in the force through 2025 or 2030 some in the air force and defense community have also begun to cons ider the possibility of deploying icbms with conventional rather than nuclear warheads94 they argue that this type weapon system would improve the us ability to swiftly react to ta rgets around the globe contributing to the mission of prompt global strike95 critics however contend that such deployment and use of icbms could prove very destabilizing they note that if the united states ever launched these missiles both russia and china could misinterpret the launch and react as if the united states had launched nuclear attack against them g21g14g4g15g156g561 at the start of the bush administration the us slbm force consisted of 18 trident submarines eight of these submarines which were based at bangor washington carried the older trident i c4 missile four of these are being converted to carry conventional weapons the other four are being converted to carry the trident ii d5 missile the remaining 10 submarines which were based at kings bay georgia all carried the trident ii missile each of these missiles can be equipped to carry up to 8 warheads however when reducing its forces to comply with the start i treaty the navy removed warheads from the missiles on the 8 tridents in the pacific fleet and each now carries more than 6 warheads it may have also begun to download the warheads on the remaining submarines so that ll the missiles will eventually carry more than 6 warheads the bush administration plans to retain 14 trident submarines all equipped with d5 missiles in the us strategic nuclear force this is the same plan that the clinton administration announced in 1994 for the us force under start ii however the clinton administration had planned to retire the four oldest trident submarines so that the missiles that could be deployed on them would not count under the limits in the start ii treaty the navy has instead begun to convert these vessels to carry conventional cruise missiles or other nonnuclear weapons or to perform special missions all four have now been removed from the strategic force reports estimate that it will take two years and up to 1 billion to convert each submarine 96 because these submarines will still have launch tubes for ballistic missiles they will still count under the start treaty but they will not count under the administrations calculation of operationally deployed warheads the retirement of four trident submarines will eliminate 576 operationally deployed warheads 4 submarines with 24 missiles and 6 warheads on each missile to further reduce the number of operationally deployed warheads the navy may remove additional warheads from trident 94 for more information on proposals to deploy ballis tic missiles with conventional warheads see crs report

under start ii they are likely to carry as few as 3 warheads in the future in addition the navy will have two trident submarines in overhaul at any given time the warheads that could be carried on missiles on these submarines will count under start and wo uld have counted under start ii however the bush administration will not count these warheads in its total of 2200 operationally deployed warheads furthermore as the navy retired four submarines based at bangor washington it moved 5 submarines from kings bay georgia to bangor for total of 9 submarines at bangor and 5 submarines at kings bay this move occurr ed between fy2003 and fy2006 initially the navy had planned to move 3 submarines to bangor leaving 7 at each base to balance the force and to maintain an equivalent workload at each base however some reports indicate that the navy decided to move an additional two submarines to bangor so that the united states could increase its ability to cover potential targets in china and east asia 97 the navy also plans to continue producing d5 missiles with the force expected to grow to total of 561 missiles with 58 of the missiles designated for the british trident program98 the navy has indicated that the trident submarines can remain in service for 44 years which means that the first retirements will begin in 2029 the navy has initiated studies into options for replacement for the tridentone would be new dedicated ballistic missile submarine and another would be variant of the virginia class attack submarine it would have to begin work on new submarine by 2016 so that it could begin to enter the fleet as the tridents begin to retire 99 the trident ii missiles will reach the end of their service lives sooner than the submarines and they will begin to retire in 2019 the navy plans to conduct modification program to extend the missiles life funding will begin in fy2005 and missile production is scheduled to begin in fy2015 the navy plans to purchase 300 missiles enough to equip 10 trident submarines the navy is also planning to refurbish the w76 warheads on the trident missiles starting in 2007 so they can remain in service until 2040 100 the navy has also devloped plan to deploy some trident missiles with conventional warheads as part of the prompt global strike mission this responds to recommendation in the npr that dod study the feasibility of modifying ballistic missile system to carry nonnuclear payload101 to perform this type of mission the missiles accuracy would have to be improved consequently dod requested 30 million to begin three year effective enhancement effort to demonstrate the nearterm capability to steer sealaunched ballistic missile warhead to gps like accuracy102 congress rejected this request in fy2003 and fy2004 however the navy requested 127 million in funding again in fy2007 and reprogramming of 100 million in fy2006 so that it could pursue the deployment of conventional warheads on trident submarines 97

this effort in fy2008 this effort is designed to provide stratcom with the ability to use conventionallyarmed ballistic missiles in support of the new global strike mission103 the 109th congress rejected the request for funding to alter the missiles and submarines although it did permit some funding for continued research on the reentry vehicle members expressed particular concern about the possibility that adversaries might mistake the launch of conventionallyarmed trident missile for nucleararmed missile and react accordingly in its first session the 110 th congress also rejected the administrations request for funding for this program creating instead new 100 million fund that could conduct research into wider range of options for the prompt global strike mission g4g152g150g139g142g155g156g561 at the present time the us air force has 94 b52 bombers and 21 b2 bombers that are equipped to carry nuclear weapons the air force also has 92 b1 bombers that were deployed as nucleararmed aircraft in the 1980s and 1990s the united states reoriented the b1 bombers to conventional missions and removed them from the nuclear war plans in the late 1990s under the start ii treaty the united states could have restored them to nuclear role even though it had plans to do so the bush administration has i ndicated that it will longer maintain the capability to exercise this option 104 the bush administration has also indicated that it would like to reduce the size of the b1 force it initially planned to retire 33 bombers assigned to the air national guard and provide upgrades to the conventional weapons systems on the remaining 60 aircraft105 however in the fy2004 defense authorization and appropriations bills congress had mandated that the air force restore 23 of these aircraft to service the air force has argued that this mandate would be too costly and complex to implement it indicated however in early february 2004 that it might request that seven or eight of these aircraft return to active service 106 the bush administration did not outline any changes to the size of the b52 or b2 fleets when it announced the results of the npr107 the fy2007 budget however it requested the elimination of 38 b52 bombers leaving fleet of 56 aircraft the 109th congress rejected this request allowing the air force to retire only 18 b52 bombers and mandating that it maintain at least 44 combatcoded aircraft congress also required that the administration submit report on the future requirements for the us bomber fleet in the fy2008 defense authorization bill hr 1585 sec 137 congress mandated that the air force maintain fleet of 74 b52 bombers with less than 63 in the primary aircraft inventory and 11 backup aircraft two additional aircraft would be designated as attrition reserve the conference committee indicated that the members agreed that fleet of fewer than 76 aircraft would be insufficient to meet longrange strike

to carry nuclear or conventional airlaunched cruise missiles and nucleararmed advanced cruise missiles the b52 bombers can also deliver widerange of conv entional arms with upgrades the administration expects the older version of these cruise missiles the alcms to the fleet until 2030 and the aircraft to remain in service until around 2044 the b2 stealth bomber first entered service in late 1993 it is equipped to carry nuclear gravity bombs such as the b61 and the b83 and conventional bombs the bush administration believes this aircraft will remain in the force until 2040 under the start ii treaty the united states would have had to count the total number of nuclear weapons these aircraft were equipped to carry under its allocation of permitted warheads these warheads would have counted even if the bombers were equipped to perform conventional missions unless the bombers were altered so that they could longer carry nuclear weapons the bush administration has stated however that it will not count the weapons that could be carried on bombers under its total of 2200 operationally deployed warheads it will only count as operationally deployed those nuclear weapons stored at bomber bases excluding small number of spare warheads it does not intend to alter any bombers so that they cannot carry nuclear weapons it plans to maintain nuclear capability without distinction on all b52 and b2 bombers but it does plan however to eliminate the nuclear mission from the b52 bombers housed at barksdale air force base consequently the number of bomber weapons could decrease in the future even without changes to the numbers of deployed bombers g4g138g149g149g146g156g157g146g140g561g15g146g156g156g146g149g142g561g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g156g561 in several speeches given during the campaign and his early months in office president bush indicated that he would pursue more robust missile defense program than the one he inherited from the clinton administration the president stated that the world had changed that the united states faced new threats and that it could longer rely on the cold warera doctrine of nuclear deterrence to safeguard its national security he stated that he would pursue the development of missile defense technologies that could be deployed on land at sea and in space and that would protect the united states its allies and its forces overseas from ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations the president recognized that his planned missile defense system would not be consistent with the limits in the abm treaty he sought to convince russia to withdraw from the treaty together with the united states when that approach failed he announced on december 13 2001 that the united states had given its six months notice the united states withdrew from the treaty on june 13 2002 the administration began to outline its plans for missile defense in july 2001 108 initially the administration planned to continue all the ongoing theater missile defense those that would attempt to shoot down shorterrange missiles and national missile defense those that would attempt to shoot down longerrange missiles programs pursued by the clinton administration however it did propose sharp increases in funding adding 31 billion to the clinton administrations planned budget of 52 bil lion for missile defense in fy2002 the bush administration also eliminated the distinction between theater and national missile defense dividing the programs instead into boostphase midcourse and terminal phase109 the bush 108 for details see crs report

ballistic missile system it has stated that it does not know what types of tec hnologies or how many sensors and interceptors it will eventually deploy or when these systems will be available instead it has pursued robust research and development program to identify promising technologies and systems it has indicated that it may begin deploying technologies in the next few years as they begin to show promise then upgrade them over time as the technologies mature this process often referred to as spiral development differs significantly from most other military acquisition programs because military officials have not established performance criteria or milestones that the systems must achieve before they can proceed to production and deployment in addition because the administration has not identified the eventual size or structure of its completed program it cannot identify either the annual or total costs for the program the administration and others who support this acquisition approach argue that it will allow the united states to field missile defense technologies quickly even if they are not perfect and require later modifications they argue that this is necessary because the united states faces growing threat from nations armed with ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction furthermore as was noted above missile defenses form one of the legs in the administrations new triad of capabilities identified in the nuclear posture review the administration argues that missile defenses can enhance deterrence by complicating an adversarys attack planning dissuade an adversary from acquiring ballistic missiles by undermining the value of those weapons assure allies of the us ability to contribute to their defense and limit damage to the united states its friends and forces if deterrence fails 110 during 2004 dod began to deploy interceptor missile s for its missile defense system in silos in alaska six of these were in place by the end of 2004 two more were deployed in 2005 and three more in 2006 for total of 11 111 the administration also deployed two of these interceptor missiles at vandenberg air force base in california the administration

the 1980s the us nuclear weapons complex consisted of 14 major facilities and number of smaller facilities located in 12 states 112 three laboratorieslawrence livermore national laboratory in livermore ca alamos national laboratory in alamos nm and the sandia national laborat ories in albuquerque nmconducted research and development and designed new nuclear weapons the complex also included four facilities that could produce nuclear or other materials used in nuclear weapons and naval nuclear reactors these facilities which were operated by number of industrial contractors included the hanford site near richland wa the savannah river site near aiken sc the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls id and the feed material production center at fernald oh the nuclear weapons complex also included six major nuclear weapons production facilities these included the rocky flats plant outside denv er co the kansas city plant near kansas city mo the mound plant near dayton oh the pinellas plant in clearwater fl and the pantex plant near amarillo tx these facilities were also operated by industrial contractors finally the complex included the nevada test site about 65 miles from vegas which conducted explosive tests of us and british nuclear warheads these tests were used to confirm the reliability of existing weapons test the effects of nuclear weapons and help in the development of new nuclear warheads many of the facilities in the nuclear weapons complex were constructed in the 1940s and 1950s so they were deteriorating significantly during the 1980s in 1988 doe closed the nuclear reactors at hanford and savannah river in response to safety concerns the rocky flats plant which produced the nuclear triggers or pits for nuclear weapons closed in 1989 in response to safety and environmental concerns at the time doe expected to reopen at least some of these facilities in the late 1980s it also developed plan to modernize and replace many of its facilities on the assumption that the united states would need to continue to design produce test maintain and dismantle large numbers of nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future 113 however the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war led many to question and reconsider assumptions about the future of the us nuclear weapons complex 112 for detailed description of these

weapons complex changed instead of concentrating on developing testing and producing new nuclear weapons the united states turned its efforts to maintaining the existing stockpile and ensuring its safety and reliability in the absence of underground nuclear testing doe also reduced the size of the existing infrastructure from 14 to 8 facilities and began to modernize the remaining facilities114 the facilities at hanford pinellas mound and rocky flats all ce ased work on nuclear weapons the remaining facilities included the 3 nuclear weapons laboratorieslivermore alamos and sandia four production facilitiesthe kansas city plant the y12 plant in tennessee the savannah river site and the pantex plant and the nevada test site the number of people employed by the nuclear weapons complex which had reached peak of nearly 58000 people in 1990 had fallen below 24000 people by the end of the decade operations at all eight of the remaining facilities changed in response to changing demands for nuclear weapons work and changes in the us nuclear force posture for example the savannah river site which had produced plutonium and tritium in its nowclosed reactors focused instead on efforts to purify existing tritium 115 in addition the pantex plant which had focused mostly on the final assembly of nuclear weapons began to shift its workload towards the dismantlement of retired weapons doe is also establishing facility at alamos laboratory that can make pits for nuclear weapons which had been produced at the rocky flats plant during the cold war the alamos facility will not have nearly the capacity of rocky flats but its supporters argue that it will help fill gap in the us ability to maintain its nuclear weapons and certify the reliability of its pits perhaps the most significant change in the us nuclear weapons complex was the cessation of nuclear testing the united states adopted moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992 and signed the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996 116 although the senate refused to consent to the ratification of the treaty in october 1999 the united states has continued to observe moratorium in the absence of nuclear testing doe developed the stockpile stewardship program to maintain us nuclear weapons this program which will use existing computing and analysis capabilities along with several new large experimental facilities at the nuclear weapons laboratories includes surveillance efforts that are designed to predict and detect problems in nuclear warheads assessment and certification efforts that analyze and evaluate the effects of changes on warheads safety and performance and design and manufacturing efforts which are intended to refurbish stockpile warheads and certify new parts materials and processes 117 114 for details see crs report 97945 nuclear weapons production capability issues summary of findings and choices by jonathan medalia 115 tritium radioactive isotope of hydrogen is needed to boost the

nuclear weapons infrastructure one of the three legs of its new triad according to administration officials the us ability to maintain its existing nuclear weapons lends credibility to the arsenal and assurance to allies an infrastructure focused on sustainment and sized to meet the needs of smaller nuclear deterrent would provide the united states with the capabilities to respond to future strategic challenges in addition the ability to innovate and produce small builds of special purpose weapons would convince an adversary that it could not expect to negate us nuclear weapons capabilities hence according to the administration an infrastructure that allows the united states to sustain its forces and adapt them to meet emerging needs would provide the united states with the means to respond to new unexpected or emerging threats in timely manner 119 further by maintaining the infrastructure needed to adapt old warheads and produce new ones the united states can reduce its stockpile of nondeployed warheads this characterization of the nuclear weapons infrastructure and its integration into the new model of deterrence does not alter its central functions but it does raise the profile of the facilities and underline the administrations commitment to modernize and expand the complex120 when announcing the results of the nuclear posture review the bush administration indicated that the united states would continue to observe moratorium on nuclear testing in spite of the presidents opposition to the comprehensive test ban treaty the administration has stated that the united states will continue to pursue the stockpile stewardship programs to assure the safety reliability and performance of the nuclear weapons stockpile according to administration officials doe will strengthen the weapons assessment process and seek improvements in understanding the of physics of nuclear expl osions through new and expanded simulation capabilities 121 the ongoing program will include aggressive surveillance and the planned refurbishment of existing warheads to anticipate stockpile problems and fix them before they arise the bush administration confirmed that the stockpile stewardship program has permitted doe to certify the safety and reliability of the us nuclear arsenal up till now but it contends the united states may not be able to continue to do so in the future as the nuclear stockpile ages furthermore doe has only limited capacity to fabricate and certify pits and other components for nuclear weapons many existing facilities and the workforce are aging therefore the administration has outlined more comprehensive program to rebuild the nuclear weapons complex and its workforce to ensure that the united states can respond to emerging problems in the nuclear weapons arsenal or emerging threats in the international environment 118 see pl 103160 fy1994 national defense authorization act sec 3138 119 us senate

infrastructure must incorporate several capabilities that include and go beyond the 1990s focus on stockpile surveillance and management for example the infrastructure must be able to respond to surprises in the status of the stockpile such as agerelated defects that appear suddenly or changes in international security environments the administration has also argued that the united states should be able to anticipate innovations in weapons design and countermeasures pursued by an adversary and counter them before they arise the infrastructure must also have sufficient reserve or surge capacity for research development and production sufficient stock of assets such as tritium to support the deployed and responsive force of nuclear warheads and the capacity to maintain the readiness of sufficient numbers and types of weapons specifically the npr recommends that the infrastructure have the capacity to identify and repair emerging problems in existing warheads in three to four years and to allow for the design development and production of new types of warheads within five years of decision to enter full scale development 122 the administration has identified number of specific tasks that the infrastructure must accomplish over the next decade at the top of the list is the refurbishment of several existing warheads so that it can retain them for the forese eable future this refurbishment effort will take place at the pantex plant and will use most of the existing capacity at that facility in addition the npr has indicated that the united states should be able to produce new warheads if the international security environment dictates therefore the npr reportedly indicates that pantex will need to expand its capacity from the current level of around 350 warheads per year to 600 warheads per year 123 so that it could assemble sufficient quantities of new warheads without interfering with the planned refurbishment program in the past decade pantex has concentrated on dismantling warheads removed from service in the future doe will schedule warhead dismantlement at pantex when there is time between refurbishment and other production efforts doe also plans to expand the capacity at the y12 plant in oak ridge tennessee so that it can meet the expected workload for replacing uranium components in the existing us nuclear arsenal124 the administration also sought funding in the years after the completion of the npr for study on one specific modified nuclear warheadthe robust earth penetrator this type of warhead would be designed to penetrate below the ground before exploding so that it could increase the probability of destroying hardened and deeply buried targets these types of targets might include command and control facilities storage depots for weapons of mass destruction or other military assets the united states currently has one type of nuclear weaponthe b61 mod 11 bomb that is designed to penetrate before detonating but this weapon can only penetrate about 10 meters and may not survive penetration in many types of terrain 125 consequently doe initiated research project on new earth penetrating weapon according to ambassador linton brooks the administrator of the national nuclear security administration this research would focus on modifications to the b61 and b83 bombs126 this study could have cost 10 million

program to provide the united states with new way to maintain and modify its warheads ambassador brooks indicated that this program could be part of the transformation of the us weapons complex allowing the united states to maintain and modify its warheads without explosive nuclear testing and allowing the united states to reduce the size of its stored stockpile of warheads129 doe has pursued this program by establishing design teams at both us nuclear weapons labs by february 2006 both teams had developed designs that they believed would meet military requirements would not require nuclear testing to certify and would meet other criteria established for the program130 in early march 2007 the national nuclear security administration nnsa announced that the nuclear weapons council had selected the design from lawrence livermore lab in california131 in recent years questions have come up about the need for this new warhead design particularly in light of the fact that many have begun to question the role and requirements for nuclear weapons in the future in the fy2008 omnibus ap propriations bill congress eliminated all funding for this program the npr also recommended that the united states reduce the amount of time that it would take to resume nuclear explosive testing at the nevada test site the administration claims that this enhanced test readiness is prudent as hedge for the possibility that future safety or reliability problem could not be fixed without testing132 if problem came up in these 127 weisman jonathan nuclear arsenal upgrade planned

conduct an underground nuclear test furthermore the administration has noted that this time might lengthen in the future as remaining personnel with nuclear testing skills and expertise retire consequently the administration included 15 million in the fy2003 doe budget and 25 billion in the fy2004 doe budget to begin to reduce the time needed to prepare for nuclear testing these funds would be used to augment key personnel and increase their proficiency begin training the next generation of personnel conduct additional subcritical tests replace key components modernize certain test diagnostic capabilities and decrease time to show regulatory compliance 133 the administration also hoped to construct on new facility that would be able to produce the pits for nuclear weapons doe will continue to use the interim pit facility at alamos national laboratory but this facility would only be able to produce 2050 pits per year and would not be able to manufacture all the types of pits currently in the us stockpile according to the administration this facility may not be sufficient if the united states must replace large numbers of aging pits in the future therefore it plans to bring new facility on line by 2020 134 it will size this facility with the capacity to support the planned workload for maintaining and replacing existing pits and to address surprise requirements and the need for potential new warhead production135 congress has raised questions about this program in the consolidated appropriations act 2005 congress provided 7 million for the modern pit facility but specified that these funds could not be used to select construction site for the facility in 2006 doe announced plan to consolidate and reduce the size of its nuclear weapons complex this plan which is still in the early stages would eliminate some of the doe facilities and combine others at smaller number of locations this plan is at this time known as complex 2030 136 the national nuclear security administration formally announced plans to transform the nuclear weapons complex in middecember 2007 this plan would reduce the size and the cost of the complex with reduction of about 30 in

administration before it also eliminated many specific targets from the us war plan and began to reduce the size of the us nuclear arsenal in response to the demise of the warsaw pact and soviet union but the central tenets of the us deterrence strategy and nuclear employment plans remained essentially unchanged furthermore during the 1990s the cl inton administration began to develop targeting options for the use of nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attack from nations other than russia and in its declaratory policy the administration would not rule out the possible first use of nuclear weapons in these circumstances at the same time many participants in the public debate over nuclear weapons policy argued that the united states should alter sharply its nuclear weapons strategy and force posture they claimed that in the absence of the global threat from the soviet union the united states could maintain its deterrent posture with far smaller number of nuclear weapons many proposed reductions to levels of around 1000 warheads some also argued that with its overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons the united states could defeat almost any potential adversary without threatening to resort to nuclear weapons several studies concluded that policy of nuclear abolition could be practical albeit long term goal for the united states and other nations with nuclear weapons in the meantime they argued that the united states should use its nuclear weapons only to deter the potential use of nuclear weapons by other nations in this framework the united states could consider its nuclear weapons to be weapons of last resort 138 the bush administrations description of the role of nuclear weapons differs sharply from the views advocated by many analysts over the last decade but it is more consistent with official policies and posture adopted by the clinton administration the bush administration assumes that nuclear weapons will be part of us security strategy for at least the next 50 years given this time frame the npr recommends that the united states begin now to develop weapons systems that will enter the force in the years between 2020 and 2040 therefore the administration clearly does not assume that the cu rrent systems in the us nuclear arsenal will be the last the administration also has role for nuclear weapons that goes well beyond weapon of last resort designed to deter only nuclear attack the administration not only argues that nuclear weapons can deter chemical biological and conventional attack it believes they can do more than just deter attack it has argued that they can also be used to assure allies of us commitments dissuade adversaries from acquiring weapons of mass destruction or threatening the united states and defeat adversaries by destroying critical targets if deterrence fails this last objective has contributed to the administrations interest in developing new types of nuclear weapons that can threaten hardened and deeply buried targets the administration has argued however that this expanded role for nuclear weapons does not mean that the united states is increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons it has noted that the addition of missile defenses and precisionguided conventional weapons to us deterrent forces will give the president greater number of options in crisis and actually reduce the likelihood of nuclear use critics however question this logic arguing that the administrations approach will blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons and increase the likelihood of nuclear use according to one analyst the administration has outlined role for nuclear weapons 138 as the cold war waned so did the notion that nuclear weapons could be used to fight war while washington did not give up its option to make the first use of nuclear weapons against warsaw pact attack it cast the use of such weapons as last resort with the end of the cold war the need for nuclear weapons seemed to fade further gordon michael r nuclear arms for deterrence or fighting new york times march 11 2002 p 1

if military planners are now to consider the nuclear option any time they confront surprising military development the distinction between nuclear and nonnuclear options fades away139 others have also concluded that the administrations plan will increase us reliance on nuclear weapons former senator sam nunn former secretary of defense william perry and retired general eugene habiger wrote that the administrations policy is expandi ng options for nuclear attacks widening the number of targeted nations and developing new nuc lear weapons variants they note that each of these ideas may have plausible military rationale but their collective effect is to suggest that the nation with the worlds most powerful conventional forces is actually increasing its reliance on nuclear forces140 some critics of the administrations policy continue to argue for far more limited role for nuclear weapons in us defense and security policy they question whether threats to use nuclear weapons in response to anything other than nuclear attack would be either necessary or credible therefore according to one analyst the us would be far better served by adopting genuinely new nuclear posture one that maintains nuclear weapons only to deter nuclear attack given the awesome power of us conventional forces we do not need nuclear weapons for any other purpose even to deter chemical or biological attack141 furthermore given the longstanding taboo against the use of nuclear weapons some argue that the united states would enhance its standing in the international community if it sought to reduce rather than expand the role of nuclear weapons in international affairs g5g155g142g141g146g139g149g142g561g6g142g157g142g155g155g142g151g140g142g561 in many ways the debate over the role of nuclear weapons in us defense policy follows from more fundamental debate over how to make deterrence credible this debate surfaced frequently during the cold war when the united states sought to develop mixture of strategy doctrine and force posture that would deter not only soviet nuclear attack on the united states but also conventional attack by the soviet union or its allies against us allies for example some analysts questioned whether the soviet union would believe us threats to launch massive retaliatory strike in response to an attack in europe when the soviet union could respond by devastating us cities concerns about the credibility of the us deterrent underlined many of the us efforts to develop smaller more accurate nuclear weapons and war plans that contained options allowing attacks against range of targ ets analysts hypothesized that if the soviet union knew that the united states could launch an attack more tailored to the provocation and more directed against soviet nuclear forces then us threats might seem more credible to the soviet leadership in other words the more prepar ed the united states appeared to fight and win nuclear war the more likely it would be for the soviet union to refrain from aggression and for deterrence to succeed others argued however that such large force structures and elaborate plans were simply overkill that the threat of nuclear destruction with as few as 100 warheads known as minimum deterrent could be enough to deter any rational leader from challenging the united states 139 comments attributed to ivo daalder of

credibility of nuclear deterrence often focused on whether nations armed with chemical or biological weapons might believe us threats to retaliate with nuclear weapons if attacked with chemicals or biological agents some argued that the potential loss of life from biological attack would be so severe that nuclear deterrent threats would be both appropriate and credible others argued that nations simply would not believe that the united states would cross the nuclear threshold in response to anything less than nuclear attack so nuclear threats would not be credible deterrent for chemical or biological weapons furthermore some argued that if nation did use chemical or biological weapons and the united states did not retaliate with nuclear weapons the united states would be caught in bluff and the credibility of its nuclear deterrent would be further damaged these views contributed to the theory that the united st ates should threaten to use nuclear weapons only as last resort the bush administration has outlined plans to develop more focused nuclear warfighting capability for the united states the emphasis on the development of penetrating nuclear weapons that can destroy hardened and deeply buried targets along with the capabilities based approach that states the united states will seek the ability to destroy threatening capabilities possessed by any potential adversary are part of this new strategy as was noted above critics have argued that these changes in the us nuclear posture make it more likely that the united states will use nuclear weapons in future crisis the bush administration has argued however that us plans and capabilities to use nuclear weapons against smaller countries would make nuclear use less likely because it would make the us deterrent more credible and robust 142 analysts who support the bush administrations approach have noted that leaders of rogue states may not take seriously us threat to launch massive nuclear strikes on leadership and weapons sites thus having the capability to destroy such targets with smaller and less destructive weapons would strengthen rather than erode deterrence 143 in addition to altering the us force posture and war plans the bush administration has been somewhat more explicit in threatening the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation for chemical or biological attacks as was noted above us policy both during the cold war and in the decade since its end has been one of studied ambiguity about the circumstances under which it would retaliate with nuclear weapons for chemical biological or even conventional attack it never openly declared that it would use nuclear weapons and therefore never would have been caught in bluff if it did not retaliate with nuclear weapons but it also would not foreswear the first use of nuclear weapons president bush has not altered this policy but he has stated that we want to make it very clear to nations that you will not threaten the united states or use weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies he said that i view our nuclear arsenal as deterrent as way to say to people that would harm america that there is consequence 144

nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction the report says that the united states will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd145 according to the administration the development of new types of nuclear weapons that can defeat hardened and deeply buried targets alon g with the potential use of nuclear weapons in retaliation for nonnuclear attacks are part of the us effort to dissuade other nations from acquiring and threatening to use chemical biological or nuclear weapons but many critics of the administration approach argue that this policy is likely to undermine us diplomatic efforts to discourage nuclear proliferation according to one analyst by emphasizing the important role of nuclear weapons the pentagon is encouraging other nations to think it is important to have them as well146 senator john kerry expressed similar view when he stated that the npr would undermine us credibility when it sought to convince other nations to forego nuclear weapons noting that it reduces all our bona fides on the proliferation issue147 critics of the administrations policy point specifically to the implications its views on the us negative security assurance might have for us nonproliferation efforts many note that through the negative security assurance the united states sought to convince other nations that they would not need their own nuclear weapons to deter nuclear threat from the united states but there would be reason for other countries to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons if the united states abandoned that policy 148 not only would these nations receive security benefit from the absence of nuclear weapons in their arsenals they might also conclude that they could only deter us attack if they were to acquire their own nuclear weapons others however have argued that the negative security assurance has done little to stem proliferation or enhance us security because other nations do not consider the us nuclear posture or declaratory policy when making their decisions about the acquisition of nuclear weapons even if the united states did not have any nuclear weapons some nations would seek them for themselves to counter their neighbors or offset the us advantage in conventional weapons furthermore some analysts consider th negative security assurance and its specific focus on nuclear weapons as an outdated policy that effectively gives nonnuclear countries safe haven for developing chemical and biological weapons 149 nevertheless many critics of the administrati ons policy have questioned the wisdom of an approach that might undermine us nuclear nonproliferation objectives even in the interest of providing new tools to address chemical and biological weapons they note that the united states currently possesses conventional forces that are far superior to those of any other country if however potential adversaries were to acquire nuclear weapons they might present the united states with an asymmetrical threat that could offset us conventional superiority therefore 145 white house national security strategy of the united states september 2002 p 14 146 comments of stan norris in gordon michael r

marginalize as much as possible the role that nuclear weapons play in us defense and foreign policy nations can only negate the overwhelming us conventional superiority with nuclear weapons so it is in us interest to keep the firewall between nuclear and conventional high and strong150 g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g146g140g561g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g561 as was noted above the bush administrations plans for the us arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons contain number of key components reductions in the number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to between 2200 and 1700 warheads retention of most deployed delivery vehicles icbms slbms and bombers with reductions in the number of warheads carried by and counted on these vehicles storage of many warheads removed from deployment the ability to restore stored warheads to deployed delivery vehicles in days weeks or monthsa capability known as the responsive force the administration argues that this combination of features will allow the united states to reduce its deployed forces while retaining the flexibility it needs to respond to unexpected or potential contingencies that might come up in the future wh combined with the plans to rebuild robust infrastructure these plans indicate that the united states will maintain the ability to enhance both the size and the capabilities of its strategic nuclear forces analysts have raised numerous questions about th administrations plans first they question why if russia and the united states are longer enemies does the united states need to maintain 2200 warheads in its deployed forces they argue that russia is the only potential adversary that has enough nuclear leadership and military targets to justify such large us force and by insisting on retaining this many weapons the united states must still be developing war plans that contemplate widespread attacks on russian targets the administration disputes this claim noting that the united states has other potential adversaries and even if these nations do not possess thousands of nuclear warheads some may expand their nuclear forces or chemical and biological capabilities in the future analysts have also noted that the administrations claims of deep reductions in offensive nuclear weapons are undermined by its plans to retain thousands of warheads in storage for responsive force they note that if these warheads were deployed on existing delivery vehicles the united states could have deployed force of nearly 4000 warheads in relatively short amount of time they also argue that if russia adopts similar posture the threat of nuclear terrorism could increase because russias stored warheads might be vulnerable to theft or sale to nations seeking their own nuclear weapons 150 daalder ivo and james m lindsay new agenda for nuclear weapons the brookings institution policy brief 94 february 2002 p 6

states has never destroyed warheads removed from delivery vehicles under past arms control agreements it has always retained an active stockpile of warheads for spares and testing purposes on the other hand under arms control agreements the united states did have to destroy delivery vehicles so that their warheads would longer count in the total of deployed warheads the bush administration does not plan to destroy either the silos for the peacekeeper missiles or the trident submarines that will be removed from the strategic force it also plans to retain the same number of delivery vehicles that the united states would have retained and counted as 3500 warheads under the start ii treaty hence even if the united states deploys only 2200 warheads on daytoday basis it could expand its forces relatively rapidly many of the questions raised by the administrations critics reflect their views on the role of nuclear weapons in us national security and their views on what is needed to maintain credible deterrent generally they believe that the united states should adopt posture where nuclear weapons are weapons of last resort used only to deter or respond to nuclear attack on the united states they conclude that the united states could maintain credible deterrent with far smaller number of nuclear weapons perhaps 1000 or fewer and without significant investments in new infrastructure or new nuclear weapons capabilities the administration however has outlined posture that reflects the view that nuclear weapons should play broader role in us national security strategy than just the deterrence of nuclear attack that credible deterrent requires the capability to effectively threaten and destroy range of critical targets and that the united states may need different numbers of nuclear weapons and different types of nuclear weapons to address threats that emerge in the future under this formula the flexibility to restore nuclear warheads quickly expand the number of deployed warheads over time and develop new weapons with new capabilities makes it possible for the united states to reduce its deployed weapons in the near term without creating potential risks to its security in the future g16g152g151g556g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g146g140g561g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g561 as was noted above the united states withdrew from deployment most its nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the early 1990s leaving few hundred airdelivered bombs deployed at bases in europe although some analysts question the need for these weapons and their relevance to natos strategy in the absence of the soviet union and warsaw pact most concerns about nonstrategic nuclear weapons focus on the potential for the loss or theft of russias weapons unclassified reports estimate that russia may still have up to 8000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons at storage areas around the country and that these storage areas might be poorly guarded and the weapons may be vulnerable to theft one former member of congress curt weldon referred to the issue of russias tactical nuclear weapons as severe and critical 151 many analysts believe that to address concerns about russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons the united states must propose unilateral or negotiated reductions in these forces others argue that negotiations are not an option because with just few hundred weapons deployed the united states would have little leverage to convince russia to reduce its stocks of nonstrategic nuclear weapons many contend that the united states should focus instead on measures to improve security at russias nuclear weapons storage facilities and to enhance transparency and openness so that both sides can remain confident in the safety and security

that accompanied its release however in the months following the release of the npr and particularly after the united states and russia signed the strategic offensive reductions treaty in may 2002 the administration began to recognize that nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be on the agenda for discussions between the united states and russia press reports indicated that this issue would be on the agenda during the may summit when presidents bush and putin signed the treaty 152 this did not occur and secretary of defense rumsfeld noted at the time that the issue on nonstrategic nuclear weapons was one that keeps getting set aside153 however during hearings on the treaty before the senate foreign relations committee in july 2002 secretary of defense rumsfeld and secretary of state powell both acknowledged that the two sides did need to address the issue both indicated that nonstrategic nuclear weapons would be on the agenda for the new consultative group for strategic stability which was announced in the joint declaration released after the may 2002 summit in moscow this group which is chaired by the us secretaries of defense and state and russias ministers of defense and foreign affairs held its first meeting in september 2002 many analysts believe that this group should place its highest priority on addressing the risks posed by russias arsenal of nonstrategic nuclear weapons but this has not happened to date g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 amy f woolf specialist in nuclear weapons policy
