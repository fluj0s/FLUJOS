extend unconditional mostfavorednation status mfn called pntr in the united states in order to receive the full benefits of wto membership in their bilateral trade relations until pntr was granted the united states had extended conditional ntr treatment to vietnam under title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended which includes the socalled jacksonvanik amendment section 402 title iv prohibits the president from granting certain countries permanent ntr unless the country has met certain conditions vietnams entry into the wto does not establish any new obligations on the part of the united states only on the part of vietnam however vietnams wto accession requires the united states and vietnam to adhere to wto rules in their bilateral trade relations including not imposing unilateral measures such as quotas on textile imports that have not been sanctioned by the wto accession to the wto affords vietnam the protection of the multilateral system of rules in its trade relations with

organization wto the agreement source cia world factbook january 10 was just one in number of steps that 2006 vietnam had to take to complete its quest to join the multilateral trade body crs2 however the agreement with the united states was the last and seemingly the most difficult of the bilateral agreements that vietnam had to negotiate with twentyeight wto members including the european union eu counting as one but representing twentyfive countries congress role the us congress has had direct role in vietnams accession to the wto congressional approval of the bilateral agreement was not required for it to go into effect the agreement itself does not establish any new obligations on the part of the united states only on the part of vietnam however vietnams accession to the wto will require the united states and vietnam to adhere to wto rules in their bilateral trade relations including not imposing unilateral measures such as quotas on textile imports that have not been sanctioned by the wto on the other hand the congress had an indirect role to play as has been the case with us trade relations with most of the other communist and former communist states us trade relations with vietnam had been governed by title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended which includes the socalled jacksonvanik amendment section 402 title iv prohibits the president from granting those countries mostfavorednation mfn called normal trade relations ntr in us law unless the country has met certain conditions however the wto requires its members to extend unconditional mfn permanent ntr pntr in order to receive the benefits of wto membership in their bilateral trade relations in order for the president to gain the authority to grant vietnam unconditional mfn pntr status congress needed to enact legislation removing vietnam from title iv coverage during the congressional debate on pntr members raised issues regarding the conditions for vietnams entry into the wto and other issues pertaining to the us vietnam economic relationship in particular the impact of increased imports from vietnam on the us textile and apparel industry members also raised issues pertaining to other aspects of the overall usvietnam relationship such as human rights in vietnam accession to the wto is important to vietnam it affords vietnam the protection of the multilateral system of rules in its trade relations with other wto members including the united states vietnam will also participate in the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations to expand the coverage of the wto those negotiations have been suspended since july 2006 pntr from the united states provides more predictability to vietnams growing trade relations with the united states and sheds legacy of the cold war for the united states pntr is another in series of steps the united states has taken in trade and foreign policy to normalize relations with vietnam and place distance between current relations and the vietnam war it also places the united states on par with vietnams other major trading partners all of whom have granted vietnam unconditional mfn status vietnams membership in the wto requires it to conduct trade with the united states under system of multilateral accepted rules vietnams trading practices can be subject to challenges by the united states and other wto members under the accepted dispute settlement mechanism crs3 this report provides brief overview of the usvietnam economic relationship an examination of the wto accession process and vietnams status an overview of the jacksonvanik amendment and pntr and an analysis of the issues that were raised during congressional consideration of pntr for vietnam this report will not be updated overview of us vietnam economic relations usvietnam diplomatic and economic relations remained essentially frozen for more than decade after communist north vietnams victory over usbacked south vietnam in 1975 relations took major steps forward in the mid1990s particularly in 1995 when the two sides reestablished formal diplomatic relations since then the normalization process has accelerated and bilateral ties have expanded particularly on the economic side of the relationship the most important step toward normalization since 1995 was the signing of sweeping bilateral trade agreement bta which was approved by congress and signed by president bush in 2001 pl 107052 under the bta the united states and vietnam extended mutual mfn ntr to one another that went into effect on december 10 2001 in return hanoi agreed to range of trade liberalization measures and marketoriented reforms the climate in trade relations between hanoi and washington has sobered considerably since the heady days after the bta was signed in part because of difficult bilateral negotiations over the terms of vietnams accession to the world trade organization wto and antidumping duties the united states has leveled against imports of vietnamese shrimp and catfish implementation of the 2001 bilateral trade agreement bta in general since the bta was signed in 2001 us trade officials have praised vietnams implementation of the agreement as discussed below in retrospect vietnams contentious and prolonged debate over whether to sign the bta was watershed event that helped break the logjam that for years had stalled economic policymaking the decision to sign the bta appears to have fashioned new consensus in favor of new economic reformist push in short order after signing the bta the government enacted series of measures including passing new enterprise law passing constitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sector reducing red tape creating unprecedented transparency rules for prior publication of new rules and regulations and for the first time giving party members the green light to engage in private business adhering to the btas implementation deadlines and achieving the governments goal of joining the wto have helped galvanize the vietnamese bureaucracy toward enacting many of these and other steps some us industry officials have expressed concern that the government has not met deadlines to implement in law andor in practice some of concessions particularly in the services sector many of these critics however tend to accept the argument that the slippages often are due more to weak capacity than to protectionist intentions and in 2005 vietnam passed more than 20 laws and regulations that belatedly address some of these concerns the belief that hanoi generally is attempting to comply with its bta obligations may explain why the bush crs4 administration appears not to have criticized harshly vietnam in areas where implementation has been delayed or incomplete with the exception of intellectual property rights see below aggregate usvietnam trade from 2001 to 2005 bilateral trade has more than quintupled from 14 billion to over 76 billion see table 1 almost all of the increase in trade since the bta went into effect has been from increased us imports of mainly apparel products from vietnam which rose from just over 1 billion in 2001 to over 65 billion four years later the united states is now vietnams largest export market and according to one study us firms constitute the singlelargest source of foreign direct investment fdi in vietnam us fdi has increased by an average of 27 percent year from 2002 through 2004 compared to just around 3 percent year from 1996 to 20011 vietnam ranks 38th as source of us imports and 58th as us export market

technical support for the development of the vietnamese report economist intelligence unit vietnam country report april 2006 ustr 2006 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers march 31 2006 crs5 in comparison to imports from vietnam growth in us exports to vietnam has been modest and since 2003 they have been concentrated mainly in aircraft indeed us exports to vietnam have fallen since 2003 largely because shipments of aircraft and aircraft parts have decreased trade in apparel imports of clothing from vietnam have been major issue for us apparel manufacturers before during and after the negotiations over vietnams wto accession nearly half of the increase in usvietnam trade since 2001 has come from sharp rise in clothing imports from vietnam which totaled 27 billion in 2005 this contrasts with less than 50 million in 2000 and 2001 by dollar value apparel excluding footwear now represents about 40 of total us imports from vietnam which accounted for 43 of total us clothing imports in 2005 compared with 01 in 2001 before the 2001 bta went into effect and 14 in 2002 increases in us imports of vietnamese apparel continued well into 2006 since 2001 vietnams apparel exports to the united states have increased more rapidly than us clothing imports from china the latter have grown faster after import quotas on textiles and apparel for wto members expired on january 1 2005 the continued rise in vietnamese exports of apparel however suggests continuing competitiveness of vietnameseproduced clothing although the dollar amount of its clothing exports to the united states is far less than that of china vietnam is the sixth largest exporter of apparel to the united states at about the same order of magnitude of such exporters as india indonesia and bangladesh whose clothing exports to the united states also have been rising rapidly mexicos apparel exports to the united states almost equal to those of china in 2001 actually have decreased since then and apparel exports to the united states by hong kong honduras the dominican republic and the philippines also have fallen or risen slowly see appendix the growth in us imports of vietnamese apparel from 2001 to 2002 and in subsequent years has been fairly widespread among product groups but with outer garments rather than undergarments and tshirts for example accounting for much of the totals thus trousers coats jackets and other lightweight outer garments accounted for more than half of vietnamese exports of clothing to the united states in 2005 see appendix b in contrast to textile and apparel trade with number of other countries the united states imports very small quantities of nonapparel textile endproducts from vietnam also us apparel exports to vietnam are relatively minimal equal to less than 1 of imports of apparel from vietnam in 2004 and 2005 on dollar basis the post2001 surge in clothing imports from vietnam followed the granting by the united states of conditional normal trade relations ntr status to vietnam in december 2001 as per the july 2001 bta such status greatly reduced us tariffs on most imports from vietnam and led to the very large increase in exports of apparel to the united states many members of congress had urged the administration to negotiate special bilateral textile agreement to address this threat an april 2003 agreement between the united states and vietnam maintains quotas on 38 categories of vietnams clothing exports with the quotalevels increasing annually crs6 intellectual property rights ipr beginning in 2002 the bush administration has annually placed vietnam on its special 301 watch list for allegedly poor protection of intellectual property rights particularly in the areas of music recordings and trademark protection2 the bta required vietnam to make its ipr regime wtoconsistent by the end of 2003 the united states trade representatives 2006 report on foreign trade barriers states that vietnam has made considerable progress in establishing the legal framework for ipr protection singling out the passage of new intellectual property law in november 2005 despite these efforts the governments enforcement of ipr protection remains extremely weak according to the ustr report which cites industry estimates that piracy rates for software music and videos run over 90 percent3 the international intellectual property alliance iipa estimated us trade losses from vietnam piracy at 428 million in 20054 us bilateral economic assistance to vietnam5 as the usvietnam normalization process has proceeded the united states has eliminated most of the cold warera restrictions on us aid to vietnam and us assistance has increased markedly since around 1 million was provided when assistance was resumed in 1991 us assistance reached an estimated 60 million in fy2005 about three times the level in fy2000 by far the largest component of the current us bilateral aid program is healthrelated assistance particularly spending on hivaids treatment and prevention which amounted to nearly 40 million in fy2005 vietnam is focus country eligible to receive increased funding to combat hivaids under the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar6 in recent years some members of congress have attempted to link increases in nonhumanitarian aid to progress in vietnams human rights record see the human rights section below 2 special 301 refers to section 182 of the trade act of 1974 since the start of the special 301 provision in 1989 the ustr has issued annually threetier list of countries judged to have inadequate regimes for ipr protection 1 priority foreign countries are deemed to be the worst violators and are subject to special investigations and possible trade sanctions 2 priority watch list countries are considered to have major deficiencies in their ipr regime which merit bilateral attention in these areas and 3 watch list countries which maintain ipr practices that are of particular concern but do not yet warrant higher level designations 3 ustr 2006 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers march 31 2006 4 httpwwwiipacom 5 for more on us aid to vietnam see crs report rl32636 us assistance to vietnam 6 vietnam qualified for the designation in part because of its demonstrated commitment to fighting the epidemic on its own and because of the competency of its medical institutions vietnam is estimated to have about 100000 people living with the hivaids virus number that is projected to grow significantly crs7 the jacksonvanik amendment and vietnams ntr status normal trade relations ntr or mostfavorednation mfn trade status is used to denote nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partner compared to that of other countries in practice duties on the imports from country that has been granted ntr status are set at lower rates than those from countries that do not receive such treatment thus imports from nonntr country can be at large price disadvantage compared with imports from ntrstatus countries the jacksonvanik amendment section 401 of title iv of the trade act of 1974 requires the president to continue to deny nondiscriminatory status to any country that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enactment on january 3 1975 but established procedure the jacksonvanik amendment to restore mfn status in effect this meant all communist countries including vietnam except poland and yugoslavia7 section 402 of title iv the socalled jacksonvanik amendment denies the countries eligibility for ntr status as well as access to us government financial facilities such as the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation opic as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedom of emigration these restrictions can be removed if the president determines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomofemigration conditions set out under the jacksonvanik amendment for country to maintain that status the president must reconfirm his determination of full compliance in semiannual reports due by june 30 and december 31 to congress his determination can be overturned by the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval concerning the december 31st report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of the amendment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to annual renewal by the president and to possible congressional disapproval via joint resolution before country can receive ntr treatment under either the presidential determination of full compliance or the presidential waiver it must have concluded bilateral agreement that provides for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn treatment the agreement and presidential proclamation extending ntr status cannot go into effect unless joint resolution approving the agreement is enacted that legislation is to be given fasttrack consideration as per provisions of title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended 7 mfn status had been initially suspended for the soviet union all areas under the control of international communism except yugoslavia since 1951 as required by the trade agreement extension act of 1951 mfn status for poland was restored in 1960 this authority was superceded first by the trade expansion act of 1962 and then title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended crs8 vietnams ntr status president clinton first granted vietnam waiver of the jacksonvanik requirements in 1998 that waiver has been upheld since that time from 1998 to 2002 resolutions disapproving the waivers failed in the house disapproval resolutions were not introduced in 2003 2004 or 2005 the presidential waiver gave vietnam access to exportimport bank credits and opic programs but vietnam was ineligible to receive ntr status until the united states and vietnam entered into bilateral agreement per the requirements under title iv in july 2000 the two countries signed bilateral trade agreement bta the agreement went into effect after the congress and vietnams national assembly approved it in 2001 the president signed it into law pl 107052 on october 16 2001 on december 10 2001 conditional ntr for vietnam went into effect of the countries that have been covered by the jacksonvanik amendment only cuba and north korea are not accorded us ntr status at all besides vietnam belarus and turkmenistan are granted conditional ntr status under the presidents waiver authority azerbaijan kazakhstan moldova russia tajikistan and uzbekistan are granted conditional ntr under the full compliance provision of the jacksonvanik amendment all other communist and former communist countries have been granted pntr ukraine was granted pntr on march 23 2006 president bush proclaimed pntr for vietnam on december 29 2006 implications of pntr on the usvietnam relationship pntr for vietnam does not have any direct impact on usvietnam trade relations because vietnam had conditional ntr its imports had already been receiving nondiscriminatory treatment and therefore us importers of vietnamese products were charged the lower concessional mfn tariff rates pntr does not affect vietnams status as nonmarket economy as regards to us antidumping laws vietnam had sought but failed to get us removal of the nonmarket economy designation as part of the agreement on wto accession8 for vietnam and for us businesses that want to conduct business with and in vietnam pntr provides sense of predictability longer is vietnams trade status with the united states be subject to annual reviews and possible termination 8 because vietnam would still be designated nonmarket economy in us antidumping duty ad cases against vietnam ad margins are used using methodology that invariably leads to higher ad duties than is the case with market economies the nonmarketmarket economy status is determined by the international trade administration at the us department of commerce after reviewing several criteria the extent to which countrys currency is convertible its wage rates are determined by free bargaining between management and labor joint ventures or foreign investment are permitted the government owns the means of production and the government determines prices crs9 in addition to the practical commercial effects pntr has politically symbolic implications it places us relations on higher plane the jacksonvanik requirements are viewed by many of the countries that are subject to them as an outdated legacy of the cold war when us foreign policy was designed to limit soviet influence and trade policy was subservient to those foreign policy objectives us policy now is to expand relations with many of the those countries and reflects the changing climate in us relations with former cold war adversaries the wto accession process and vietnams status vietnam applied to join the wto on january 1 1995 vietnam is scheduled to officially join the wto on january 11 2007 the following sections provide an overview of the process that vietnam went through in order to accede join the accession process the wtos membership of 149 countries and customs areas spans all levels of economic development from the least developed to the most highly developed economies the wto came into existence in january 1995 as part of the agreements reached by the signatories to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the wtos primary purpose is to administer the roughly 60 agreements and separate commitments made by its members as part of the gatt for trade in goods the general agreement on trade in services gats for trade in services and the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips the membership in the gattwto has grown exponentially the gatt was originally founded in 1947 by 23 countries and the wto now has 149 members accounting for around 90 of world trade among the most recent entrants are china and taiwan which joined on december 11 2001 and january 1 2002 respectively armenia which joined on february 5 2003 the former yugoslav republic of macedonia which joined on april 4 2003 cambodia and nepal which joined in 2004 the most recent entrant is saudi arabia which joined on december 11 2005 vietnam will join on january 11 2007 ukraine is also near completion of its accession process membership in the wto commits its members to fundamental principles in trade with other members including mostfavored nation mfn treatment the imports of goods and services originating from one member country will be treated less favorably than imports of goods and services from any other member country mfn is to be unconditional in practical terms this means that in most cases country cannot apply higher import tariff to good from one member country than it applies to like goods from any other member country national treatment imports of goods and services are treated less favorably than like goods and services produced domestically crs10 in practical terms this means that governments cannot discriminate against imports in the application of laws and regulations such as regulations to protect consumer safety or the environment transparency government laws and regulations that affect foreign trade and investment are to be published and available for anyone to see procedures to implement the laws and regulations are to be open lowering trade barriers through negotiations since the gatts creation its members have conducted eight rounds of negotiations to lower trade barriers at first these negotiations focused on lowering tariffs over time the rounds have broadened gattwto coverage to include nontariff barriers such as discriminatory government procurement practices discriminatory standards and tradedistorting government subsidies the last completed round the uruguay round 19861994 resulted in the most ambitious expansion of rules to cover for the first time trade in agricultural products and services and government policies and practices pertaining to intellectual property rights protection and foreign investment regulations that affect trade the current round the doha development agenda dda was launched in november 2001 reliance on tariffs in order to promote predictability and openness in commerce the wto requires member countries to use tariffs and avoid using quotas or other nontariff measures when restricting imports for legitimate purposes such as on injurious imports dispute settlement as part of its function to administer the rules established under the agreements the wto provides mechanism for the settlement of disputes between members where the dispute involves alleged violations of wto agreements moreover each members trade regime is reviewed by the wto secretariat from timetotime to ensure that it conforms to wto rules9 the collapse of the soviet union and its east european bloc and the movement of many developing countries toward liberal trade policies have spurred interest in joining the wto article xii of the agreement that established the wto sets out the requirements and procedures for countries to accede any state or customs territory having full autonomy in the conduct of its trade policies is eligible to accede to the wto on terms agreed between it and wto members the accession process begins with letter from the applicant to the wto requesting membership the wto general council the governing body of the wto when the ministerial conference is not meeting forms multilateral working party wp to consider the application membership on the wp is open to any 9 based on wto background information located at httpwwwwtoorg crs11 interested membercountry more than sixty member countries including the united states are part of the wp for vietnams accession the applicant submits memorandum to the multilateral wp that describes in detail its current trade regime the applicant and the wp then negotiate to determine what legislative and structural changes the applicant must make to meet wto requirements and to establish the terms and conditions for entry of the applicant into the wto the wps findings are then included in report of the working party and form the basis for drawing up the protocol of accession while it negotiates with the wp the applicant must also conduct bilateral negotiations with each interested wto member during these negotiations the wto member indicates what concessions and commitments on trade in goods and services it wants the applicant to make in order to gain entry and the applicant indicates what concessions and commitments it is willing to make until the two agree and set down the terms the terms of the bilateral agreements are combined into one document which will apply on an mfn basis to all wto members once the applicant has joined the wto the accession package is conveyed to the general council or ministerial conference for approval article xii does not establish deadline for the process the length of the process depends on number of factors how many legislative and structural changes an applicant must make in its trade regime in order to meet the demands of the wp how quickly its national and sub national legislatures can make those changes and the demands on the applicant made by members in bilateral negotiations and the willingness of the applicant to accept those demands the vietnamese national assembly has passed or is committed to pass laws in response to demands from wto members because wto accession is political process as well as legal process its success depends on the political will of all sides the wto member countries and the applicant country formal vote is taken in the wto that requires 23 majority for accession although in practice the wto has sought to gain consensus on each application the process can take long time chinas application took over 15 years bilateral agreement with the united states vietnams bilateral agreement with the united states is not free trade agreement such as nafta or cafta it establishes conditions for vietnams entry into the wto but imposes new conditions on the united states for that reason it does not require congressional approval as with ftas vietnams agreement with the united states was the last of the 28 bilateral agreements following is summary of its contents10 the most controversial issue at least for the us textile and apparel industry is what reforms would vietnam make regarding government subsidies for its textile 10 office of the united states trade representative trade facts vietnams accession to the world trade organization wto may 31 2006 crs12 and apparel industry and what protections would the us industry be given against surges in us textile and apparel imports from vietnam the usvietnam bilateral wto accession agreement commits vietnam to remove all wtoprohibited trade government export subsidies for its textile and apparel industry by the time of accession the agreement includes an enforcement mechanism that is in effect for the first 12 months after vietnams accession under this mechanism if the united states or any other wto member has reason to believe that vietnam has not fulfilled this commitment it could seek consultations with vietnam if the consultations do not resolve the issue then the united states or other wto member could seek the authority of third party in the form of neutral wto arbitrator who would then determine whether vietnam is in compliance if the arbitrator determines that vietnam is not in compliance then the united states would be authorized to reimpose those quotas on textile and wearing apparel imports from vietnam before vietnam entered the wto those quotas could be in force up to 12 months if the arbitrator does not render decision within 120 days of the filing of the complaint then the united states would automatically be authorized to impose the quotas11 among other concessions regarding manufactured goods according to the office of the ustr vietnam will accede to the wtos information technology agreement ita upon accession thus eliminating tariffs on information technology products such as computers cell phones and modems reduce tariffs on 80 of chemical products as required by the wto chemical harmonization agreement eliminate tariffs or aircraft and engines within seven years of its wto accession lift the ban on large motorcycles eg harley davidson models and reduce tariffs on suvs and on autoparts eliminate tariffs on 91 of medical equipment products within five years of accession and eliminate tariffs on 96 of imports of scientific equipment within three years of accession bind tariffs for about 90 of the tariff lines pertaining to agriculture and construction equipment at 5 or less and on all wood products at an average of 4 lift restrictions on imports of commercially available goods that include encryption technology 11 these procedures are spelled out in section 3 of hr 5602 crs13 reduce export duties on ferrous and other scrap metals by up to 51 of current duty levels within five to seven years of its accession and require stateowned and controlled enterprises to make purchases that are not for government use on commercial terms regarding trade in agriculture products vietnam has committed to reduce tariffs on about 34 of us agricultural products including beef pork dairy fruits nuts processed foods soybean products cotton and hides and skins and grains to rates of 15 or lower from an average applied rate of 27 adhere to the wto agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures meaning that its measures will have to be sciencebased upon accession recognize the us food safety inspection regimes for beef poultry and pork as equivalent to is own thus eliminating the need for duplicative inspections and permit imports of bonein beef and beef offal after the signing of the agreement even before accession to the wto the bilateral agreement also includes commitments in services trade under which vietnam has agreed to allow foreign banks as of april 1 2007 to establish 100owned subsidiaries in vietnam permit foreign securities firms to establish joint ventures with up to 49 foreign ownership as of the date of accession and 100 foreignowned subsidiaries five years after accession and allow foreign securities firms to have branches in vietnam for some securities activities grant national nondiscriminatory treatment to foreign financial firms in all financial services subsectors allow upon accession foreignowned insurance companies to operate 100 foreignowned subsidiaries and permit five years after accession foreign insurance companies to open direct branches that sell nonlife insurance eliminate all restrictions on foreign insurance company sales of any line of insurance product one year after accession extend national treatment to foreign insurance companies operating in vietnam and crs14 open its markets to foreign providers of telecommunications energy express delivery transportation business distribution environmental and hotel and restaurant services during the bilateral negotiations the two sides discussed vietnams restrictions on imports of printed media products including bibles it is unclear whether the bilateral accession agreement deals with this issue andor whether the issue will be discussed by the working party vietnams accession status the bilateral agreement with the united states was only one of 28 bilateral accession agreements that vietnam signed the conditions that vietnam has agreed to under all the bilateral agreements apply to vietnams trade with all other wto members including the united states the provisions of the bilateral agreements were combined to become part of the protocol of accession for vietnam in addition to the bilateral agreements vietnam had to complete the negotiations with the 63member wto working party intellectual property rights protection was concern of the united states and some other working party members vietnam recently passed new ipr law and the working party members are waiting to see the regulations on how the law will be implemented number of contentious issues arose during these negotiations for example vietnam had insisted that it be granted period of time within which its obligations under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures ascm are phased in rather than imposed immediately upon accession vietnam argued that as developing country it was entitled to this special and differential treatment the working party members resisted this demand working party members also raised issue with the vietnam governments policy of discriminating against companies in vietnam that have foreignownership and domesticallyowned enterprises in extending importing rights vietnam allows locallyowned firms to import products that are part of their product line and does not require them to obtain an import license foreignowned firms can only import goods that are used as inputs in final production or that would be used in establishing an enterprise under the 2001 usvietnam bilateral trade agreement bta vietnam granted usowned firms special trading rights not accorded to other foreignowned firms however as wto member vietnam can longer discriminate among wto members nor between foreign and domesticallyowned firms some working party members also raised the issue of vietnams ban on certain types of printed matter that contain culturally reactionary and superstitious material they are concerned that the restriction might be used to prevent imports of bibles crs15 implications for the usvietnam trading relationship vietnams accession will likely mean changes in how the two countries conduct their trade relations the two countries are now bound by wto rules in practice this will mean for example that the united states will not be able to impose unilateral restrictions on imports from vietnam such as quotas on apparel imports unless they have been sanctioned by the wto in addition the two countries will be able to use the dispute settlement body to challenge one anothers the trade practices if they suspect those practices violate wto rules for example vietnam might challenge us antidumping measures against vietnamese imports or the us might challenge vietnams tradedistorting subsidies overall significance of the issues for vietnam and the united states vietnams accession to the wto arguably has been the focal point for the general improvement and deepening of usvietnam relations that has occurred over the past three to five years this trend was symbolized in june 2005 when president bush hosted vietnamese prime minister phan van khai at the white house the first trip to the united states by vietnamese head of state and the two spoke of their desire to move bilateral relations to higher plane president bush also publicly backed vietnams bid to join the wto variety of economic strategic and historical factors have motivated the two countries to improve relations and obtain vietnams membership in the wto us interests economically pntr and wto accession for vietnam obviously has much less significance for the united states than it does for vietnam given the small share in us trade 03 that vietnam occupies nevertheless the twin issues can be considered as steps in fulfilling broader us trade and foreign policy objectives in the trade area pntr status for vietnam is consistent with the policy of the bush administration and the clinton administration before it to normalize trade relations with former adversaries most prominently china but also cambodia laos and the former communist states in eastern europe and the former soviet union vietnams accession to the wto could help the united states manage its trading relationship with vietnam in that vietnam would be obligated to wto rules thus providing some discipline in the relationship in addition the united states has been strengthening trade ties with east asian countries with free trade agreement with singapore and free trade agreement negotiations with thailand south korea and malaysia the united states is also undertaking an initiative to strengthen economic ties with the members of the association of southeast asian nations asean of which vietnam is member as counterweight to the growing influence of china crs16 as for vietnams intrinsic economic importance to the united states it represents to certain us export sectors potentially large 80 million people developing market for most of the past twenty years since doi moi renovation economic reforms were launched in 1986 vietnam has been one of the worlds fastestgrowing economies generally averaging around 78 real annual gross domestic product gdp growth12 additionally vietnams relatively low wages and highly educated population appeal to some us multinational corporations that see vietnam as an important site for foreign direct investment fdi often as way to avoid an overreliance upon factories and suppliers in china nike for instance has an extensive presence in vietnam vietnam is thought by some to be an attractive export and investment opportunity in variety of sectors including computer hardware and services telecommunications equipment and services and energy related machinery and services13 in addition to fulfilling some commercial objectives us pntr and support for vietnams wto accession vietnam are seen by many as tools to meet certain foreign policy objectives for example they can serve important tools for the united states to expand cooperation with country that has an ambivalent relationship with china while the united states is not actively promoting the development of multiparty democracy in vietnam wto membership is believed by many to be important means to promote increased pluralism accountability and adherence to the rule of law in vietnams political system pntr also has symbolic significance as milestone in series of steps to normalize relations with vietnam and to place greater distance from the legacy of the vietnam war that this and previous administrations have undertaken finally in the near term president bush attended the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in hanoi in november 2006 vietnams interests for vietnam it is believed that joining the wto will have significant economic effects despite the fact that vietnam already enjoys ntr status with its major trading partners including the united states an important example is vietnamese clothing industry which is expected to experience significant boost in exports when vietnam joins the wto14 in 2005 the apparel industrys contribution to vietnams total exports was about 15 wto entry is expected to give boost to inward fdi by further entrenching and expanding not only vietnams integration into the global economy but also its own domestic economic reforms us companies have been 12 by the mid1980s disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt the doi moi economic reforms under doi moi the government gave

january 1 2005 saw the expiration of the global system of import quotas on textile and apparel products for wto members until vietnam joins the wto its clothing industry generally is considered to be at disadvantage compared with its competitors that operate under quotafree trade in textiles and apparel crs17 major investors in vietnam since 1988 usrelated fdi has been over 25 billion from 20022004 us companies invested more in vietnam than firms from any other country15 additionally joining the wto fits vietnams broader economic strategy since the late 1980s vietnam has become increasingly dependent upon foreign trade in general and in particular with the united states which is now vietnams largest export market see table 2 and table 3 in the 1990s and early 2000s as vietnam deepened its integration into the global economy and as global trade rules expanded vietnam was forced to commit to an open market industrialization strategy by entering into bilateral trade agreement bta with the united states condition for obtaining conditional ntr from the united states by pushing to join the wto and by participating in the asean free trade area afta vietnam is attempting to achieve its goal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020 in effect without the benefits of protectionism and subsidization that the east asian tigers employed in an earlier era16 major presumed motivation for continued economic reforms is finding employment for the over 1 million new entrants to the labor force every year indeed job creation is perhaps is the key to the vibrancy of the ruling vietnamese communist party vcp as economic growth increasingly becomes its main source of legitimacy table 2 vietnams growing dependency on trade 1991 1996 2001 2005 exportgdp

leadership circles in vietnam despite the economic hardship that is expected to come to vietnamese stateowned enterprises and private firms facing reduced state subsidies and increased competition from abroad hanois decision to sign the bta in 2000 appears to have been cathartic moment for domestic debates about economic policy prior to the signing of the bta the reformist momentum was widely observed to have dissipated in large measure due to perhaps the worst infighting and political deadlock vietnam had experienced since reunification the deadlock can be simplified as disagreements between reformers and conservatives over how far to continue the economic reforms and concomitant integration into the international community many conservatives feared that economic rationalization would increase unemployment in particular by forcing the government to curtail subsidies to stateowned enterprises conservatives also felt that economic reform would affect vietnams sovereignty and undermine the socialist foundations of the countrys economic and political systems and thereby erode the vcps monopoly on power vietnams consensusbased decisionmaking style combined with the absence of any paramount leader only exacerbated the effect of these divisions these arguments were brought to head during the debate over whether to sign the bta with the united states decision that took more than year after an agreement in principle had been reached the bta broke the policymaking logjam new political consensus emerged in favor of reform that new leaders endorsed at vcps 9th party congress in 2001 in short order after signing the bta the government enacted series of measures including passing new enterprise law to give boost to privatelyowned businesses passing constitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sector reducing red tape creating unprecedented transparency rules for prior publication of new rules and regulations and for the first time giving party members the green light to engage in private business in sum many observers agree that for the foreseeable future vietnam has embraced deeper integration into the global economy as the key to the countrys economic policy issues regarding pntr for vietnam as the debate over pntr for vietnam and discussion of vietnams accession to the wto proceeded number of issues were raised because pntr and wto accession are ostensibly about trade some of the debate centered on traderelated crs19 issues probably the most controversial issue was vietnams exports of wearing apparel but the debate also touched on nontrade noneconomic issues imports of vietnamese apparel the accession agreement contains restrictions on vietnamese clothing exports to the united states but vietnam agreed to terminate all funding under major textile subsidy program upon the date of formal us and vietnam government approval textile and apparel quotas now applied to vietnam will be removed upon accession vietnam has agreed to eliminate all of its wtoprohibited textileapparel subsidy programs by the date of accession and textile and apparel quotas can be re imposed for one year if vietnam does not eliminate textile and apparel subsidy programs us textile groups had pushed for either the extension of current import quotas on vietnams textile and apparel exports not subject to wto disciplines or the creation of safeguard mechanism similar to the one included in chinas accession agreement among the major elements of that agreement were the united states and other wto members retain the right to impose safeguard measures specifically applying to textiles and apparel through the end of 2008 allowing continuation of some quotas in cases where surge in chinese exports cause or threaten to cause market disruption to domestic producers and b china will significantly lower its tariffs on wide range of textile and apparel products and not impose new nontariff barriers17 the industry wanted the accession agreement to allow restraints to be imposed in the future in the event of surge of imports of apparel from vietnam but with streamlined procedures that would promote quicker action that safeguard would be lifted once vietnam eliminated its export subsidies us officials reportedly have insisted that such an issue must be addressed in the multilateral working party negotiations without making specific commitment to do so according to informed sources18 under the industrys proposal the restrictions would stay in place until vietnam eliminates its export subsidy programs it is unlikely however that future increases in vietnamese exports of clothing to the united states would be as rapid as they have been recently because vietnam has not been wto member many observers believe that the expiration of import 17 to ensure that the wto agreements would fully apply between the united states and china once china joined the wto pl 106286 was enacted october 10 2000 creating mechanisms to monitor chinas compliance with wto and other trade agreements and authorizing the president to grant china permanent normal trade relations pntr status after it joined the wto china officially joined the wto on december 11 2001 and the president extended pntr status to china on december 27 2001 pl 106286 also requires the us trade representative ustr to annually issue report assessing chinas compliance with its wto trade obligations 18 ustr cool to textile industry demands for vietnam safeguard inside us trade may 5 2006 us vietnam reach bilateral wto agreement textile groups blast pact international trade reporter may 18 2006 crs20 quotas on textile and apparel products for wto members on january 1 2005 put vietnams apparel industry at disadvantage versus its competitors that have been operating under quotafree regimen since that date19 the us textile and apparel industry is not satisfied and strongly opposes the bilateral agreement because according to industry representatives it will allow imports of subsidized vietnamese textiles and apparel into the united states and unfairly compete with us producers auggie tantillo the president of the american manufacturing trade action coalition said the us textile industry explicitly told the administration that it would not support any agreement with vietnam that did not include adequate safeguards because vietnam has nonmarket communist economy with heavily subsidized stateowned textile industry just like china there are adequate safeguards in this deal in its present form we are left with choice but to urge congress to oppose this flawed agreement20 ustr officials when asked why the agreement does not include safeguard mechanism similar to one included in the agreement with china have responded that while textile and apparel imports from vietnam are increasing vietnam is much smaller producer and exporter of those products than is china and would not pose the competitive threat that china does in addition the officials stated that once vietnam has entered the wto the united states would have available the dispute settle mechanism with which to resolve issues with vietnam21 senator elizabeth dole nc and senator lindsey graham sc placed temporary holds on s 3495 that would allow vietnam to receive pntr the senators had concerns about the potential impact of vietnamese imports on the us textile industry they lifted their holds on september 29 2006 after the bush administration agreed to establish mechanism to monitor imports of textiles from vietnam and have the commerce department selfinitiate antidumping investigations when warranted22 in contrast to the criticism by us apparel manufacturers us retailers and apparel importers supported the negotiations and approved of the accession agreement seeing it as an opener to lowerpriced merchandise an enforcer of more 19 despite this disadvantage however the value of vietnamese clothing exports to the united states increased from 2004 to 2005 by just over 6 whereas imports of clothing into the united states from all countries increased by around 68 percentages were computed using the harmonized tariff system codes 61 62 63 and 65 20 american manufacturing trade action coalition press statement bush administration reaches wto accession agreement with vietnam us industry will be big

groups of retailers have raised concerns regarding the bush administrations initiative to monitor apparel imports from vietnam and selfinitiate antidumping investigations in an october 11 letter to commerce secretary carlos gutierrez and ustr susan schwab the groups implied that they are prepared to withdraw their support if their concerns are not addressed24 relatedly in early november senators dianne feinstein ca and gordon smith or reportedly sent letter to us trade representative susan schwab and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez raising their concerns about the administrations move and asking for response to the letter before the senate votes on the pntr bill according to one source retailers and importers wanted commitment in writing that when considering whether to self initiate an antidumping investigation the commerce department only will consider the impact of vietnamese imports on makers of apparel and not makers of apparel inputs and that the us only will look at like and comparable products25 human rights and religious freedom26 in recent years congress has devoted considerable attention to vietnams human rights record vietnam is oneparty authoritarian state ruled by the vietnamese communist party vcp since at least the late 1990s the vcp appears to have followed strategy of generally relaxing most restrictions on most forms of personal and religious expression while selectively repressing individuals and organizations that it deems threat to the partys monopoly on political power vietnamese living in the countrys urban areas generally enjoy wide and expanding latitude to exercise their civil economic and religious liberties in contrast conditions are more restrictive in more rural areas particularly in the countrys central highlands and northwestern regions the government has cracked down harshly on antigovernment protests by various ethnic minority groups most prominently the montagnards in the countrys central highlands where clashes between protestors and government security forces have flared periodically since 2001 both areas are populated by ethnic minority groups among which are many who belong to nonregistered protestant denominations many observers have pointed to evidence of improvements in the general human rights situation in vietnam in 2005 and 2006 even as conditions remain difficult for certain individuals groups and in certain regions in the central highlands there are signs that the level of government repression has diminished since april 2004 when thousands of protesting montagnard

americans were arrested in september 2005 while visiting family members in vietnam on charges of plotting violence against the vietnamese government after us concerns were raised vietnamese authorities announced that foshee and the six other individuals would be brought to trial ending their indefinite detention30 on november 10 foshee and the others were tried found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in prison with credit given for their time in detention before the trial this put the seven defendants in position to be released in december 2006 on november 12 however foshees daughter reported that vietnamese authorities had released and deported her mother for humanitarian reasons31 the following day martinez lifted his hold the other six defendants apparently remain imprisoned religious freedom although the freedom to worship generally exists in vietnam the government strictly regulates and monitors the activities of religious organizations and periodically has increased restrictions on certain ones vietnamese law requires religious groups to join one of the officiallyrecognized religious organizations or denominations according to many reports the government uses this process to monitor and restrict the operations of religious organizations additionally many groups either refuse to join one of the official religious orders or are denied permission to do so meaning that these groups activities technically are illegal in 2004 the state department designated vietnam for the first time country of particular concern cpc or severe violator of religious

the surprise of many the vietnamese government responded by negotiating with the bush administration and adopting some internal changes after months of talks in the spring of 2005 the united states and vietnam reached controversial agreement on religious freedom in which hanoi agreed to take steps that were designed to improve conditions for people of faith particularly in the central highlands the agreement which has not been released publicly enabled vietnam to avoid punitive consequences such as sanctions associated with its cpc designation the agreement has been faulted by human rights groups on number of grounds including the charge that religious persecution continues in the central highlands vietnam was redesignated cpc in the 2005 religious freedom report on november 13 2006 the state department announced that because of many positive steps taken by the vietnamese government since 2004 the country was longer severe violator of religious freedom and had been removed from the cpc list the announcement which came two days before president bush was due to depart to hanoi for the apec summit cited dramatic decline in forced renunciations of faith the release of religious prisoners an expansion of freedom to organize by many religious groups and the issuance of new laws regulations and stepped up enforcement mechanisms32 some human rights group including the us committee on international religious freedom disputed the factual basis of the decision and criticized the move as premature33 the vietnam human rights act some members of congress have attempted to link us aid to the human rights situation in vietnam the most prominent example the vietnam human rights act hr 3190 in the 109th congress proposes capping existing nonhumanitarian us assistance

were wary of antagonizing china and some in the vietnamese ministry of defense were concerned about outside scrutiny of its officers for human rights abuses over the past two years however hanoi has become more responsive to us entreaties as symbolized by the signing of an imet agreement in 2005 under which two vietnamese officers will attend in 2006 us air force language school in texas for

come from individuals and groups who argue that vietnam has not done enough to account for us prisoners of warmissing in action powmia from the vietnam war this argument has diminished markedly since the mid1990s when the united states and vietnam began devoting increased resources to powmia research and analysis by 1998 substantial permanent staff in vietnam was deeply involved in frequent searches of aircraft crash sites and discussions with local vietnamese witnesses throughout the country the vietnamese authorities also have allowed us analysts access to numerous powmiarelated archives and records the us defense department has reciprocated by allowing vietnamese officials access to us records and maps to assist their search for vietnamese mias the increased efforts have led
