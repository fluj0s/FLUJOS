ons for fy2007 also reflect these changes 302a and 302b allocations the maximum budget authority for annua l appropriations including dhs is determined through twostage congressiona l budget process in the first stage congress sets overall spending totals in the annual c oncurrent resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among the appropriations committees usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for enactment in annua l appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the developmen t of the bills in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allo cations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceilin g is subject to point of order 302b allocations may be adju sted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress towards final enactment the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget the senate budget

enactment of budget authority by cong ress in an appropriations act federal agencies then obligate funds from the acted budget authority to pay for their activities finally payments are made to liquidate those obligations the actual payment amounts are reflected in the budget as outlays budget authority is established throug h appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts that are available for federal agencies to spend the antideficiency act6 prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was acted by congress budget authority may be indefinite however when congress enact s language providing such sums as may be necessary to complete project or pur pose budget authority may be available on oneyear multiyear or noyear basis oneyear budget authority is only available for obligation during specific fis cal year any unobligated funds at the end of that year are longer available for spending multiyear budget authority specifies range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending noyear budget authority is available for obliga tion for an indefinite period of time obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel enter into contracts receive services nd engage in similar transactions in given fiscal year outlays are the funds that are actua lly spent during the fiscal year7

total funds available for spending by federal agency may be composed of discretiona ry and mandatory spending of the 427 billion gross budget authority requested for dhs in fy2007 83 is composed of discretionary spending and 17 is composed of mandatory spending discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by congress throug h appropriations acts the budget enforcement act8 of 1990 defines discretionary ppropriations as budget aut hority provided in annual appropriation acts and the ou tlays derived from that authority but it excludes appropriations for entitlements mandatory spending also known as direct spending consists of budget authority and resul ting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year however some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts within dhs the coast guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated ma ndatory spending offsetting collections9 offsetting funds are collected by th federal government either from government accounts or the public as part of businesstype transaction such as offsets to outlays or collection of fee these funds are not counted as revenue instead they are counted as negative outlays dhs net discretionary budget authority or the total funds that are appr opriated by congress each year is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending some collections offset portion of an agencys discretionary budget authority some of these fees offset spending at the account level and are subtracted from the appropriations committee tables directly below the program they offset an example of this is the federal protective service which is immediately offset in the appropriations tables by an intergovernmental transfer from the general services administration other discretionary fees offs et spending at the agency level and are thus subtracted from the discre tionary budget authority of the agency to arrive at the actual appropriated level an example of this is the immigration inspection fee which is collected at ports of entry by customs and border protection cbphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs7 personnel and is used to offset bot h the cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ice appropriations other collections offset an agencys mandatory spending they are typically entitlement programs under wh ich individuals businesses or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility the dhs budget features two mandatory entitlement programs the secret service and coast guard retired pay accounts pensions some entitlements ar funded by permanent appropriations others by annual appr opriations the secret service retirement pay is permanent appropriation and as such is not annually appropriated whereas the coast guard retirement pay is annually ppropriated in addition to these entitlements the dhs budget contains offsetting trust and public enterprise funds these funds

respectively according to dhs the goal of awareness is to identify and understa nd threats assess vulnerabilities determine potential impacts and disseminate timely information out to homeland security partne rs and the american public30 two programs under this goal include ao and intelligence the performance goal for ao is to deter detect and prevent terrorist incidents by sharing domestic situational awareness through national operational communications and intelligence analysis31 t h performance goal for intelligence is 100 percent distribution of sensitive threat information relative to department of homeland securitytransportation security administration components fiel d elements and stakeholders32 budget caveats the fy2007 budget request for ao represents an increase of nearly 46 million and 12 fte howeve r it is important to note that dis aggregating intelligence analysis from opera tions is problematic because the budget of the office of intelligence and analysis an entity of the intelligence community is classified the figures cited above are the combined figures for the office of operations coordination and the office of intelligence and analysis budget implications some observers might argue that the requested ao budget is sufficient given the current stage of development for intelligence and operations within dhs others however might question whether the requested budget can achieve the ambitious intelligence analysis goals as outlined by charles allen dhs chief intelligence officer cio in recent testimony before the house committee on homeland security33 cio allen outlined at least five priorities laden with resource implications including the following 1 improving the quality of analysis across the department 2 integrating the dhs intelligence enterprise 3 strengthening our intelligence support to stat local and tribal authorities as well as the private sector 4 ensuring dhs intelligence takes its full place in the intelligence community and 5 solidifying our relationship with the congress by improving our transparency and responsiven ess these priorities and others might imply that in order to implement the integration of

and processes resulted in 169 incomplete rvs sites67 another potential issue for congress could be the level of in tegration and scope of this border technology program the rvs system mentioned above forms part of larger program that integrates surveillance cameras with sensors this program was originally called the integrated surveillance intelligence system isis but was folded into the broader americas shie ld initiative asi by dhs in 2005 dhs ig richard skinner stated in congressiona l testimony on december 16 2005 that to date isis components have not been integrat ed to the level predicted at the onset of the program rvs cameras and sensors are not linked whereby sensor alert automatically activates corresponding rv s camera to pan and tilt in the direction of the triggered sensor however even if isis was fully integrated due to limited number of operational rvs s ites 255 nationwide inte gration opportunities would be limited to the areas near these sites68 additionally the dhs ig noted in its 2005 report that due to lack of integration isis remote surveillance technology yielded few apprehensions as pe rcentage of detection69 for these reasons the fy2006 dhs appropriations conferees noted that they were not fully funding the departments fy2006 request for asi th conferees stated that it was their understanding that dhs was currently revi ewing the entire

border domain security nd awareness the conferees noted that they expected to be kept informed of the results of this review and encouraged dhs to explore the use of offtheshelf solutions for the

the dhs igs recommendations concerning isis will be carried out and what the overall extent of the technolog ical integration featured in sbi will be hrept 109476 voiced concern about dhs request for

critical point in its deployment of pers onnel and other resources at the border and proposes using private contractors to accelerate the construction of this infrastructure72 potential issue for congress could involve whether using private contractors to cons truct border infrastructure is the most costeffective allocation of taxpayer resources given th at under the current mou with the corps

role of state and local law enforcement officials shoul d be in enforcing federa l immigration laws many have expressed concern over proper tr aining finite resources at the local level possible civil rights violations and the overall impact on communities some localities for example even provide sanctuary for illegal aliens and will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be

security fees establis hed under atsa the proposal would have replaced the current fee stru cture of 250 per flight gment and maximum fee of 500 per oneway trip with flat f ee of 500 per oneway trip although passengers making connections to reach their destination would not see fee increase under this proposal passengers on direct flights would see their aviation security fees double the administration argues that th flat fee proposal mo re closely parallels passenger utilization of the aviation security system since passengers and their baggage are typically screened only once regardless of how many connections they might make to reach their destination106 in this regard the administrations pr oposed aviation security fee changes for fy2007 differed significantly from those previously proposed in the fy2006 budget request that prior proposal which was not widely supported in congress would have kept the persegment fee structur in place and raised it to 550 per trip segment with maximum of 800 per oneway flight that proposal however was opposed in congress not only because it was vi ewed by many as detrimental to the airline industry as whole but also because it was seen as disproportionately impacting certain passengers particularly those using smaller airports who are more dependent on connecting flight s it is notable however that this

passenger and property screening costs april 2005 gao05558imbalance in the aviation security fee structure stems from the original collection authority enacted under atsa which presently requires passengers taking connecting flights to pay twice as much in aviation security fees as passengers taking direct flight the administration projected that if the newly proposed fl at fee of 500 per oneway trip were enacted the increase in fee collections from passengers on direct flights along with rise in the numbers of air travelers would have boosted aviation security fee collections in fy2007 by about 1726 million dollars or roughly 85 compared to expected fy2006 revenues if this measure were enacted the administration expected the new fees to cover about 70 of co re aviation security costs compared to contribution of about 38 in fy2005107 the administration asserts that having users pay for aviation screening and security is what congress intended when it enacted the aviation security fee under atsa and doing so would free up general funds for spending on other homeland security needs that are more generally pplicable to all citizens critics of the proposal on the other hand argue that all citizens benefit from aviation security measures that are intended in part to prevent another terrorist attack like the attack of september 11 2001 and theref ore aviation security should be funded at least in part through general fund c ontributions critics of the proposal also maintain that tacking the aviation security fee on to passenger tickets hurts airlines by increasing the overall ticket cost which may prompt some passengers to seek alternative transportation particularly for shorter trips these critics go on to argue that airlines are already burdened by other ticket taxes and higher fuel prices that can negatively impact passenger revenues also industr experts believe that the proposed fee schedule would have greater relative impact on lowcost carriers that offer more direct flights108 the current fee schedule arguably has greater relative impact on legacy carriers that route passengers on connecting flights to much greater extent using hubandspoke service model the administration also proposed to collect 644 million from security fees paid directly by the air carriers known as the av iation security infrastructure fees asif this sum includes 448 million in projected fy2007 collections plus 196 million in retroactive fee collections using revi sed prioryear airline contribution amounts based on gao analysis109 housepassed hr 5441 housepassed hr 5441 would have provided gross total of 6364 million for the tsa in fy2007 this amount was 65 million more than the presidents request and 20 million more than fy2006 enacted appropriations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs58 the housepassed bill woul d have appropriated 4704 r oughly 74 of the total tsa budget on direct spending for aviation security including screening operations security direction and enforcement and the mandatory 250 million appropriation for the aviation security capital fund the housepassed appr opriation for aviation security was roughly 50 million higher than the presidents request this amount however did not include appropriations for the federal air marshals service fams for which the housepassed bill would have provided 699 million matching the presidents request the amount for aviation security also did not include aviationsecurity related threat assessment and credentialing programs such as secure flight and the registered traveler program the housepassed bill would have provided 74 million for the tsas transportation threat assessment and credentialing ttac mission area in all transportation modes which includes the following programs secure flight aviation crew vetting aviation transportation worker identification credential twic currently limited to marineseaports registered traveler aviation hazmat commercial driver credentialing highway freight trucking nd alien flight school vetting aviation under the housepassed bill ttac funding for aviationrelated functions included 55 million in direct appropriations and an add itional 37 million from fee collections largely anticipated to be derived from the registered traveler program adding the housepassed funding for fams and aviationrelate d threat assessment and credentialing programs would have yiel ded total spending package for aviation related functions of 5495 million or 86 of total tsa funding included in the bill the housepassed bill would also ve provided 37 million for tsa surface transportation security functions the same as the presidents request the committee report hrept 109476 also directed th tsa to use prior year unobligated funds designated for surface transportation staffi ng and operations on rail and mass transit security screening pilot programs in rge metropolitan areas the house bill would also have appropriated 20 million for the twic program in addition to the 20 million that the administration expects from fee collections and inline with the presidents request anticipated 19 llion in fee collections for hazmat commercial driver credentialing gene ral provision in the bill sec 520 would have prohibited any funds designated fo r the twic program from being used to develop any type of credentialing program that is decentralized and not universal and would have required that existing govern ment card production f acilities be used to carry out production of twic credentials with regard to the administrations proposal to modify the passenger fee schedule this request was not considered in the hous epassed bill because it sought to modify existing law that falls under the jurisdiction of the house committee on homeland security the appropriations committee estima ted fy2007 passenger fee collections under the existing fee schedul to total 2124 million this included an initial 250 million to be deposited in the av iation security capital fund plus an additional 1874 million to offset tsa spendi ng on aviation security in addition the house committee projected aviation security infrastructure fee asif collections directly from the airlines including retroactive payments from fy2005 and fy2006 to total 546 million in fy2007 98 million less than the administration projection while the housepassed bill was based on the assumption of collecting significantly less in passenger and airline fees than administration projections the only tsa program that was specifically reduced to derive cost savings was for headquartershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs59 110 hrept 109476 p 46 111 ibidadministration which was reduced by 4 million housepassed funding for the federal flight deck officer ffdo prog ram and flight attendant cabin crew training was also reduced by 5 million compared to the presidents request however this cut was attributed to high unobligated balances of prior year appropriations for the program rather than as specific cost cutting measure the housepassed bill otherwise set funding at levels equal to or greater than requested amounts the appropriations committee howev er indicated that reductions to key funding proposals throughout dhs were made to make up for the shortfall in the presidents budget brought on by this untenable fee proposal110 in report language the house appropriations committee encouraged tsa to develop innovative approaches and incentives for airports to pursue private screener operations instead of federal tsascreeners111 general provision in the bill sec 536 would have prohibited the tsa from hi ring nonscreener personnel at airports whose duties would be re dundant with t hose performed by any nonscreener personnel employed by contract screenin g company participating in the screening partnership program spp as in past years language in the housepassed bill capped tsa screener staffi ng levels to 45000 fulltime equivalents the committee noted that this cap has been kept in place in part to ensure that the tsa accelerates technology deployment in itiatives for passenger and baggage screening report language also directed the tsa to report on its efforts to decentralize screener hiring and how these efforts might be encumbered by centralized financing of the hiring process the committee also wanted the tsa to complete study to identify those airports where passenger wait times at screening chec kpoints are continually above systemwide averages the housepassed bill would have pr ovided 45 million more than the presidents request for eds purchase the housepassed bill also included an additional 10 million not included in the pres idents request to begin refurbishing and upgrading eds equipment with the caveat that only those machines that manufacturers are willing to place back unde r warranty should be refurbished the committee however emphasized that it did not believe that explosive trace detection etd should be refurbished and sought th long term reduction in the use of etd equipment for baggage screening house passed language also required the tsa to develop standards and protoc ols for increasing the use of eds to screen air cargo and requires the tsa to use existing eds equipment and screeners to screen cargo on passenger aircraft to the greatest extent pr acticable at each airport the bill further would have required the tsa to provide congress with air cargo inspection statistics by airport and by air carrier on quarter ly basis and would have reduced aviation security appropriations by 100000 for every da that the required report is late sec 519 as in previous years the housepassed bill would have prohibited the full deployment or impleme ntation of secure flight bey ond its testing phase until the dhs certifies and the gao reports that the system satisfactorily addresses specific statutory requirements pertaining to syst em performance data protection privacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs60 and redress for aggrieved pa ssengers language in the housepassed bill sec 513 also would have prohibited th development of algorithms to assign passenger risk using any means other than official govern ment watch lists and prohibits the use of commercial or nonfederal databases in the secure flight system senatepassed hr 5441 the senatepassed bill would have provided 6562 million in total budget authority for the tsa 198 million more than the housepassed amount and 276 million more than the requested funding amount the senate approved total appropriation including the aviation security capital fund for aviation of 5002 million 48 milli on above the housepassed funding level and 97 million more than the president s request like the house the senate did not include the presidents proposed in crease to passenger aviation security fees and projected total collections from pa ssengers and the airlines to equal 2420 million in addition to the 250 million designated for mandatory spending in the aviation security capital fund for most budget activ ities the sena tepassed bill matches f unding levels requested by the president and passed by th house notable exceptions to this are discussed below the senate approved 181 million for air port checkpoint support functions 8 million more than the requested level that was agreed to by the house while the committee did not specifically signate what this additional funding was to be used for its report srept 109273 indicated that the overall appropriation amount for this budget activity included funding fo r the development and piloting of an advanced checkpoint portal soluti on and re port language directed the tsa to develop strategic plan and timeline for ploying emerging technologies to screen passengers for explosives the sena tepassed bill also proposed bringing transportation security research and velopment functions back under the tsa rather than in the science and technolog directorate st where they has been for the last two years much of these activities are directed at improving explosives detection capabilities in the aviation envir onment the senate agreed to 92 million for these aviation security research and development activities the senatepassed bill would have provided 141 million for eds and etd purchase 50 million more than the presiden ts request and 5 million more than the housepassed amount the senate committee report sr ept 109273 expressed concerns over the presidents budget request that would have cut this function by more that 50 the report specified that out of the total funding amount for eds and etd purchase 20 million or more s hould be put toward acquiring and deploying nextgeneration eds machines noting that the newer machines are potentially more efficient than currentgeneration units and may yield significant improvement in installation integration and lifecycle co sts the senatepassed bill also included 172 million for eds and etd installation 127 million more than the fy2006 appropriated amount nd 78 million more than both the presidents request and the housepassed bill srept 109273 indicated that this sizable increase in funding would ensure that eds and etd inst allation is carried out in an expedited manner the senatepa ssed bill however recommended 24 million less that the presidents request for eds and etd maintenance noting that the tsa has already achieved sizable savings on maintenance and encouraged the tsa to continue tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs61 work with contractors to further reduce maintenance costs the bill language also limits the obligation of 25 million of these f unds until the committee receives report responding to the dhs igs findi ngs regarding contractor fees the committee report also includes language supporting the tsas expanded used of refurbished eds equipment and directs the ts to work aggressively to save costs by maximizing the refurbishment of eds equipment however unlike the house passed bill the senate passed bill did not include specific funding amount for eds and etd refurbishing the senatepassed bill in cluded 23 million for the federal flight deck officer ffdo program for armed pilots and for crew security training 7 million less than the fy2006 appropriation and the fy2007 request and 2 million less than the housepassed funding amount like th house committee report the senate committee report srept 109273 cited high unobligated balances in this program rather than specific costcutting initiatives as the reason for this proposed reduction the senatepassed bill specified 15 million for the secure flight program 25 million less than the amount requested and ag reed to by the house the senate committee report asserted that this amount in conjunction with available carryover balances should be sufficient to meet fy2007 program requirements while the committee expressed its general support for th additional layer of aviation security that would be provided through the secure flight program the committee concluded that the shape and size of the program still remains unclear because of continuing delays and another effort to rescope the program the committee indicated that it was therefore reluctant to provide any resources beyond the proposed 15 million also regarding secure flight the senatepassed language was identical to the housepassed bill requiring dhs certification and gao oversig ht to confirm that the system is secure protects the privacy of personal data and has an adequate redress process for passengers that ar erroneously flagged by the system like the house passed bill this language would have prohibited the use of commercial databases in the secure flight system for any purpose including authenticating passenger identity or assessing passenger risk in add ition samdt 4635 directed the tsa to work more closely with the airlines to provide technical data and othe r assistance to better align their reservation systems with terrorist databases to minimize travel delays and inconvenience associated with mistaken iden tification until the secure flight system or successor system is fully deployed also samdt 4619 would have required the dhs to establish revised procedures fo r clearing individuals whose names are mistakenly placed on terrorist watch list or whose names are similar or identical to individuals included on terrorist watch list often these false positive identifications are made when an individual attempts to board flight and is singled out for additional screening or denied boarding based on use of the nofly and selectee lists provided by the tsa to the airlines the senate also agreed to several amendments related to aviation security samdt 4608 would have required the ts to provide passenger and baggage screener and related resources at the ne w castle airport in wilmington as long as commercial air service is provided at that airport it is uncertain whether the wording of this amendment would have sp ecifically restricted the use of private screeners contracted by tsa under their screening partnership program spp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs62 sometimes referred to as the optout progra m under which airports can elect to use private screeners instead of tsa screeners if so this provision could be highly controversial as it c ould set precedent for legislators to seek similar restrictions at other airports which could be viewed by advocates for private screening as potentially undermining the intent of th optout provision of the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 another agreedto amendment samdt 4582 would have required tsa to report on the effectiv eness of screening operations resulting from its modification of the list of prohibited items in december 2005 senatepassed samdt 4592 would have required air carriers to develop plans to comply with provision of atsa that gave emergency service personnel such as firefighters police officers and medical technicians au thority to voluntarily provide emergency services on commercial air flights during emergencies the senate also agreed to samdt 4552 which would ve removed the tsas exemption from federal procurement law wh tsa was established as part of the department of transportation under atsa it was given authority to operate under the faas acquisition management system which was statutorily exempt from many aspects of federal procurement law in order to provide for more timely and costeffective acquisitions of equipment nd materials to meet unique challenges in responding to the needs of the aviation industry als in contrast to the house and prioryear appropriations language th at capped the number of tsa screeners at 45000 the senatepassed samdt 4558 would have prohibited an statutory limitation on the number of tsa employees or any administrative rule or regulation limiting the recruiting or hiring of tsa personnel pl 109295 pl 109295 provides gross f unding of 6374 billi on for the tsa that amount includes 4731million for aviation security plus 250 million for the aviation security capital fund this combined with 714 million for the federal air marshals service fams and 67 million for aviationrelated threat assessment and credentialing functions namel secure flight registered traveler alien flight school fees and crew vetting brings the to tal direct appropriation for aviation securityrelated f unction to 5762 billion this amount comprises roughly 90 of the total tsa budget by compar ison tsas surface transportation security account was funded at 37 milli on and related threat ssessment and credentialing functions namely the twic program and hazmat commercial driver fees totaled 39 million these activities collectiv ely account fo r less than 2 of the tsas total appropriations while some in congress have argued that increased funding for surface and maritime transporta tion initiatives is needed this funding distribution is roughly inline with prior year funding allocations airport checkpoint explosives screenin g of passengers and carryon items has been priority highlighted in 911 commission recommendations and recently spotlighted by the foiled terrorist plot to down united statesbound aircraft from the united kingdom using liquid explosives although the conference report encouraged the deployment of emerging airport ch eckpoint technologies it funded checkpoint support at 173 million consistent with th housepassed amount instead of the 181 million funding level origina lly passed by the senate this was due to large unobligated carryover balance of 56 million from previous fiscal years for this activity that can be used to support fy 2007 checkpoint support initiatives these initiatives remain high priority and the conference report directs the tsa to develop strategic plan for screening ll types of explosives on passengers and inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs63 carryon baggage the act however did not include the senatep assed language that would have moved aviation security research and development activities back within the tsa with regard to checkpoint screen ing report language also directs the tsa to review airport checkpoint wait times over the past thr ee years and provide report identifying airports with above av erage wait times with the fy2008 budget conference report language also direct the tsa to provide screening at 24 commercial airports and heliports that ve requested tsa screening but continue to operate with temporary scr eening or none at all the report further directs the tsa to consider contracting out screening functions at these locations if it does not believe it would be efficient to deploy tsa pers onnel to these sites conference language also directs the gao to study the effects of changes to the pe rmitted and prohibited items lists made in decembe r 2005 on public safety and scr eening effectiveness the act keeps in place the long standing cap on fulltime quivalent tsa screeners of 45000 provision of the act section 514 reitera tes prohibition on using funds for the secure flight passenger prescreening program in other than test basis until the tsa demonstrates and the gao certifies that certain conditions pertaining to data security privacy and redress have been ad equately addressed while the presidents signing statement indicates that the executive branch considers this section to only be advisory in nature the tsa has been cooperating with the gao to address these unresolved issues the cct further requires the tsa to submit detailed plan of secure flight program milestones and certification within 90 days of enactment the act provides 141 million for eds purchase as initially agreed to by the senate and 5 million above the housepassed amount report language specifies that up to 6 million may be used for refurbishing existing eds equipment so long as the manufacturers are willing to place th machines back under warranty this is 4 million less than the direct appropriation for eds and etd refurbishing passed by the house while the senate report language expressed support for the tsas eds refurbishment efforts it did not specify an appropriation level for this activity the conference report further specifies that eds purchase funding is not to be used to procure etd equipment unless necessa ry for secondary baggage screening as replacements at airports prima rily dependent of etd technol ogies or for use at small airports and heliports where screening operations are newly federalized the act includes total of 388 million for eds installations including 250 million from the aviation security capital fund nd separate appr opriation of 138 million this amount is 34 million less than the orig inal senatepassed amount but it is 44 million more than the original housepa ssed amount the act also includes 222 million for eds and etd maintenance an even split between the original senate and house amounts conference report lang uage directs the tsa to combine maintenance costs for all equipment incl uding eds etd and checkpoint screening equipment into one budget activity in fy 2008 to provide more complete picture of the total maintenance costs for security equipment deployed at the nations airports the conference report also directs the tsa to develop performance measures and targets with regard to alternative screening procedures track the use of these alternative screening procedures at airports assess their effectiveness conduct covert tests at airpor ts using these procedures and develop plan to stop the use of these alternative screening procedures which are sometimes used in lieu of eds and etd screening general provision of the act section 524 specifies thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs64 recovered or deobligated funds for tsa aviation security administration security support from prior fiscal years shall onl be available for procurement and installation of eds equipment for use in air cargo checkpoint and baggage screening however separate provi sion section 537 rescinds roughly 5 million of these prioryear unobligated funds the act provides 714 million for the federa l air marshals service fams 15 million above the original amounts passed in both the house and senate the increased funding is designated for travel and training conference language states that the pilot program using fams in transportation modes other than aviation goes beyond what has been authorized for fams the report further states that it is imperative for fams to focus on protecting aviation assets particularly flights deemed to be high security threat before further expanding the role of fams the act also maintains the federal flight deck officer ffdo program and crew training initiatives at appropriated level of 25 million consistent with the original house passed amount and 2 million bove the original senate passed funding level the act provides 55 million for air cargo security consistent with original housepassed and senate passed and requested amounts while this funding is the same as fy2006 appropriations levels the conference report noted that the tsa has been slow to obligate air cargo security f unding and expected that onetenth of the total fy2006 appropriation w ould be carried into fy2007 the conference report language directs the tsa to use these ca rryover funds to hire additional staff to enhance the tsas air cargo security analytic capabilities separate provision section 518 of the act direct s the tsa in consultation with industry stakeholders to develop standards and protocols for increasing the use of eds for screening air cargo when appropriate with regard to surface transportati on security the act provides 37 million consistent with both the original house passed and senatepa ssed amounts the act also appropriates 20 million for the twic program which is expected to be recouped through credentialing fees conf erence report language notes that due to the tsas reprogramming of twic an dditional direct appropriation for fy2007 was not necessary the twic is regarded as high priority issue in response to public attention directed at seaport secur ity over the past year and conference

during debate over the fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 an amendment to that resolution offered by senator lautenberg samdt 3137 that would prohibit the pr oposed changes to aviation security fee

subcommittee on economic security infrastructure protection and cybers ecurity on march 9 2006 representative lungren offered an alternative aviation secu rity fee proposal that is similar to the presidents proposed fee structure this lternative fee structure agreed to by the subcommittee for inclusion in hr 4439 includes 400 fee per oneway trip that would directly fund the tsa plus an optional 100 fee that could be charged by the airport of origin for funding qualif ied aviation security projects passenger aviation security fees under this plan w ould be capped at 500 per oneway trip and 1000 per roundtrip under the proposal howev er security fees paid directly by the airlines the asif would be eliminated noting that going along with the presidents proposed passenger fee restructuring would not be in order as part of the appropriations process because it would require modifications to existing law the housepassed appropriations bill does not address the issue of modifying passenger security fees the status of the secure flight program to prescreen airline passengers against the consolidated terrorist watch lis t may be considered during the fy2007 appropriations deba in prior years appropria tions legislation has contained language directing the gao to review th program and making full implementation of the system beyond the testing phase contingent on the gao finding that information security privacy protection and passenger redre ss issues have been adequately addressed th gao recently reported that these issues still largely remain unresolved and the program still faces many management hurdles112 while the tsa has indicated that it is rebaselining the program before entering into the operational sting phase113 as previously noted the housepassed bill would keep the restrictions on full deployment of secure flight in force it also would prohibit the tsa from using methods other than government watch lists for assessing passenger security risk and would prohib it the use of commercial databases for vetting passengers during the fy2007 ppropriations process congress may also examine the related registered traveler program scheduled to be launched on nationwide basis in fy2006 the status of the registered traveler program may be of particular interest to congress since the airline i ndustry which once championed

in tr ansportation resources science and industry divisionanother aviation securityrelated issue th at congress may consider is the ongoing debate over resources and schedules for integrating checked baggage explosives detection equipment with airport baggage handling systems although deploying these inline baggage screening systems is projected to significantly increase baggage throughput and reduce tsa manpower requi rements for baggage screening these capital projects are costly and will take several years to complete on systemwide basis at current appropriations levels somewhat related issue is the tsas effort to mitigate workplace injuries among tsa baggage screeners which may benefit from inline baggage screening systems and related ergonomic design considerations to the extent that they can eliminate or minimize the lifting and handling of baggage also as previously discussed the physical screening of passengers and their carryon items for explosives and nonmetallic threat s remains high priority and congress may debate whether availa ble technologies and tsa in itiatives to deploy these technologies adequately re spond to this stated need in timely manner recent interest in seaport security stemming from the proposed acquisition of terminal operations at several large us seaports by dubai ports world dpw may prompt more detailed examination of tsas efforts to assess security risks at seaports as well as progress on the transportation worker identification credential twic program according to the tsa the twic program which is currently in prototype testing phase will be rolled out to ports utilizing the national port criticality list that prioritizes posts based on risk threat and vulnerability analysis although initial deployment of twic wa s planned for fy2006 it has been delayed until fy2007 to accommodate program re view and related rulemaking115 in light of the current interest in port security the twic program scope st atus and deployment schedule may be of particul ar interest during the appr opriations process more generally congress may examine the tsas initiatives to address security in other surface transportation modes such as passenger and freig ht rail and hazmat trucking and perhaps interm odal and supplychain security issues in the context of the appropriations framework united states coast guard116 the coast guard is

approved by the house the senate would have provided almost 37 million less for the disaster relief fund drf than the house and the senate would have provided roughly 15 million less than the house for administrative and operating activities as approved by congress and signed by th president the legislation appropriates approximately 450 million less than requested by the administration and roughly 100 million less than the amounts approved by the house and senate the difference primarily rests in the amount ppropriated to the drf as noted below this reduction is arguably insignificant

to appropriate 525 million for the ipis budget activity see table 12 for how those funds were allocated between programs the senate report did not provide rationale for the specific increases or d ecreases made to the budget request the report called for an enhanced and coordina ted national bombing prevention effort and directed the undersecretary for preparedness to request the state homeland security directors to work with their state chief information officers to develop state cybersecurity strategies for information technology needed to support state and local services the report also directed the secretary to submit the report required by pl 10990 identifying the resources needed to implement mandatory security requirements for the nations chemical sect or and to audit nd ensure compliance with those requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs85 on the senate floor amendments were added requiring the secretary to submit report on efforts to comply with reco mmendations made in july 2006 inspector general ig report on issues associated with the national asset database that report noted that the database has an abundance of assetsw hose criticality is not readily apparent first among the igs recommendations is that the ip directorate evaluate the criticality of the assets in the database and eliminate those that are out ofplace or extremely insignificant another amendment passed on the senate floor forbids the use of certain funds for tr avel by officers of the department until the undersecretary for preparedness has imple mented the recommenda tions or reported to congress on why the recommendations have not been fully implemented third amendment passed on the nate floor expanded in statute the role and responsibility of the national infrastructur analysis and simulation center in essence the amendment requires any federal agency with critical infrastructure responsibilities as establishe d by homeland security pr esidential directive number 7 to enter into formal relationship with the center including an agreement on information sharing the purpose of which is facilitate the use by those agencies of the centers modeling and simulation capabilities pl 109295 both houses approved the conference committees recommendations with the passage of pl 109295 the committee recommended 547 million for the ipis budget activity see table 12 for how those funds were allocated between programs it so recommended withholding 10 million presumably from the management and administration program until the department reports to congress on the

mandatory security requirements for the chemical s ector were mandated in section 550 of the bill the bill reported from the conference committee also restructured fema within the department all of

contentious floor debate concerning the attachment of the anwr provisions to the defense appropriations bill both divisions c and d were removed from the bill by sconres 74 the enrollment correction measure and are not included in pl 109148 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs100 appendix ii dhs appropriations in context federalwide homeland security funding since the terrorist attacks of septembe r 11 2 001 there has been an increasing interest in the levels of f unding available for homeland s ecurity efforts the office of management and budget as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act has published an annual report to c ongress on combating terrorism beginning with the june 24 2002 edition of this report homeland security was included as part of the analysis in subsequent years this homeland security funding analysis has become more refi ned as distinctions and account lines between homeland and nonhomeland security activities have beco more precise this means that while table 15 is presented in such way as to allow year to year comparisons they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis as outlined above with regard to dhs funding it is impor tant to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts in fact while the largest component of federal spendi ng on homeland security is contained within dhs the dhs homeland security request for fy2007 accounts for approximate ly 48 of total federal funding for homeland security th department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29 of all federal spending on homeland security the department of health and human services at 78 the department of justice at 56 and the department of energy at 29 round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security these five agencies collectiv ely account for nearly 93 of all federal sp ending on homeland security it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classi fied as pertaining to homeland security activities the legacy agencies that became part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related therefore while the fy2007 requests included total homeland security budget authority of 277 b illion for dhs the requested total gross budget authority was 398 billion the same is true of the other agencies listed in the tablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33428crs101 table 15 federal homeland security funding by agency fy2002fy2006 budget authority in millions of dollars department fy02 fy03 fy04
