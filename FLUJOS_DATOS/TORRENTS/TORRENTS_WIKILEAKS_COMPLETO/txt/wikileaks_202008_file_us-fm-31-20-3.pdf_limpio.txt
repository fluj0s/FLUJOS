reorganization act sof may conduct fid unilaterally in the absence of any other military effort support other ongoing military or civilian assistance efforts or support the employment of gen eral purpose gp forces in the national security strategy of the united states 1991 the president recog nized that even as the threat of eastwest conflict may be diminishing in the new era lower order threats like terrorism subversion insurgency and drug trafficking are menacing the united states current us policy is to deal with these threats through the indirect use of military force in concert with the political informa tional and economic elements of national power direct use of military force is the exception rather than the rule this approach relies on supporting the efforts of the government of the nation in which the problem is developing internal defense and development internal defense and development idad is the full range of measures taken by nation to promote its growth and protect itself from subversion lawlessness and 11fm 31203 insurgency it focuses on building viable institutionspolitical economic mili tary and socialthat respond to the needs of the society development programs carefully planned and implemented and properly publicized can serve the interests of population groups and deny exploitable issues to the insurgents security pro grams provide an atmosphere of peace within which development can take place the idad strategy is founded on the assumption that the host nation hn is re sponsible for the development and execution of programs to prevent or defeat an insurgency the fundamental thrust of the idad strategy is toward preventing the escalation of internal conflict anticipating and defeating the threat posed by insur gent organizations and working to correct conditions that prompt violence are ef fective means of prevention if insurgency occurs emphasis is placed on holding down the level of violence the population must be mobilized to participate in idad efforts thus idad is an overall strategy for the prevention of insurgency and if an insurgency should develop for counterinsurgency coin activities us army fid operations contribute to the hns overall idad strategy and are based on integrated military and civilian programs us national objectives and policy basic premise of us foreign policy is that the security of the united states and its fundamental values and institutions will be best preserved and enhanced as part of community of truly free and independent nations in this regard the united states endeavors to encourage other countries to do their part in the preservation of this freedom and independence the objective is to support us interests by means of common effort those governments that lack the will to address their social economic or political problems are unlikely to benefit from outside assistance on the other hand gov ernments that do mobilize their human and material resources may find that out side help including us security assistance makes critical difference where significant us national interests are involved the united states may provide eco nomic and military assistance to supplement the efforts of such governments the creation of relatively stable internal environment within which economic growth can occur and the people are able to determine their own form of govern ment is primary us objective economic assistance either supplied by the united states through bilateral agreements or by several nations through multilat eral agreements may help achieve this objective the primary responsibility for creating stable atmosphere through the commit ment and use of all its internal resources rests with the threatened government der certain conditions however us policy supports supplementing local efforts to maintain this order and stability these conditions are as follows the internal disorder is of such nature as to pose significant threat to us na tional interests the threatened country is capable of effectively using us assistance the threatened country requests us assistance 12fm 31203 special operations imperatives understand the operational environmentsf commanders must incorporate the special operations so imperatives into their mission planning and execution if they are to use their forces effectively these imperatives although developed to guide sof apply to any unit orga nization agency or activity that may be involved in fid the so imperatives are listed below in fid there are two aspects of the operational environment with which sf must be familiar the hn and the external factors the first aspect is critical to applying resources and skills to accomplish the mission the second aspect is critical to guiding actions in fluid and unstructured situation host nation sf personnel must know the enemy weather and terrain as in any military operation in addition they must understand the insurgent or criminal as with drug traffickers movement to include the underlying causes demographic composition of the movements membership history objectives claims to legiti macy methods and any other pertinent information they must also have thor ough knowledge of the hns government military and other institutions that formally or informally exercise power normally associated with the functions of government this knowledge should include strengths weaknesses vulnerabilities functions actual power centers as op posed to what appears on organization charts of the organizations interrelationships among these organizations goals and motivating factors for each organization relationships with the united states other advisors or foreign influence the populace is critical factor sf personnel must understand the demography culture taboos beliefs customs history goals and needs ethnic composition and expectations of the populace most important they must be aware of the dynamics of the interrelationships among these various aspects of society they must be aware of who can influence whom and how that influence is achieved and exer cised they must also be aware of incidental effects of the actions of any one factor upon the other external factors sf personnel must understand the us command relation ships both military and interagency that affect them in addition they must understand the scope and limitations of each agencys influence and programs the legal and political restrictions on their activities the sources and assistance available to further mission accomplishment the role of the united states and the international press the intent and goals of the us government the applicable rules of engagement roe to include their intent and the spe cifically enumerated provisions 13fm 31203 sf personnel must react to unforeseen circumstances therefore they must have clear understanding of their charter and the goals of the us effort it is impossible to predict every situation and write specific roe or courses of action coas that address each situation if sf personnel understand the commanders intent they can respond intelligently and correctly to unforeseen circumstances recognize political fid is essentially apolitical activity every act from military activities to casual implications offduty conversation has political impact sf personnel do not anticipate conventional environment where expected military concerns dominate whether conducting operations independently or in coordination with conventional opera tions they must consider both short and longterm political effects facilitate interagency activitiesfid by definition is an interagency effort in which the military represents only one aspect usually not the most important one of the overall program in many nations however the military is often the most effective if not the sole function ing bureaucracy the economic programs the us agency for international velopment usaid administers for example represent the central element of the us fid effort and will have greater impact than any purely military program yet for usaid to carry out its programs the active cooperation of the hn mili tary will normally be required sf must be aware of all programs and agencies that comprise the fid effort sf may also act as the liaison between the hn military us agencies and other dod components to ensure that efforts are synergized when participating in an interagency and often combined effort sf must strive for unity of effort recognizing the difficulty in achieving it sf must anticipate ambiguous missions conflicting interests and objectives and disunity of effort lacking unity of command sf personnel promote unity of effort by requesting clear mission statements and the decisionmakers intent actively and continuously coordinating activities with all parties involved us and hn military and nonmilitary engage the threat discriminatelythe sf commander must know when where and how to employ his assets based on short and longterm objectives this imperative contains three messages for sf involved in fid effort resources the first message concerns the selection and distribution of resources both personnel and material appropriateness not mass is the standard sf must ensure that personnel selected for the mission are qualified trained and neces sary to the effort minimizing the us presence while maximizing the impact is desirable training advice and assistance resources normally are restricted in fid vironment and must be applied wisely to maximize their impact based on an derstanding of the operational environment and its internal dynamics sf must carefully select which training and advice to give impact is as much considera tion in selecting training and advice as are the political implications of the type of subject and assistance given 14fm 31203 consider long term effects ensure legitimacy and credibility of special operations anticipate and control psychological effects apply capabilities indirectly develop multiple optionstactical considertions tactical operations in fid whether directed against in surgents criminal activities lawlessness or subversion must be carefully tar geted to avoid alienating the populace being defended populace and resources control prc measures in particular must be carefully weighed for potential gain versus potential cost the use of force in prc measures should be minimized most fid efforts are inherently longterm their goal is to alleviate the root causes of the current situation not just treat the symptoms this imperative also has messages for sf tactics tactical victories are of little value unless they contribute to the overall op erational scheme the operational scheme to which they relate may be nonmilitary in nature military measures are inherently shortterm and directed against the symptom insurgents and not the root cause environment this message concerns placing each problem in its broader po litical military and psychological context sf personnel develop longterm approach to solving the problem they accept legal and political constraints such as less than optimal roe to avoid strategic failure while achieving tactical suc cess they do not jeopardize the success of hn national and theater longterm ob jectives by the desire for immediate or shortterm effects policies plans and operations must be consistent with national and theater priorities and the objectives they support significant moral and legal considerations exist in fid effort legitimacy is the most crucial factor in developing and maintaining internal and international support without this support the united states cannot sustain assistance to for eign power without legitimacy and credibility operations will not receive the support of foreign indigenous elements the us populace and the international community all operations and activities in fid environment will have significant psycho logical effects prc measures combat operations and civic action programs are examples of the type of operations or activities with obvious psychological ef fects some operations and activities may be conducted specifically to produce desired psychological effect tactical victory may be totally negated or over shadowed by negative psychological effects recognizing that perceptions may be more important than reality in this arena sf must ensure all audiences understand sf operations loss of control of perceptions may cause distortion of the facts and may diminish andor destroy the gains of even the best planned and executed operations the primary role of sf is to advise train and help hn forces the foreign govern ment or group must assume primary authority and responsibility for the successor failure of the combined effort successful us efforts reinforce and enhance the legitimacy and credibility of the supported foreign government or group sf personnel engaged in fid operation must be aware of and be prepared for possible contingencies and followon missions the team or individual must first 15fm 31203 ensure longterm sustainment provide sufficient intelligence balance security and synchronizationplan to use his full range of capabilities even if not specifically tasked to do so change of operational environment may dictate change of roe or mission sf personnel maintain operational flexibility by developing broad range of options and contingency plans they can shift from one option to another before and dur ing mission execution sf personnel involved in fid effort must avoid advising or training the hn forces in techniques and procedures beyond their capabilities to sustain us tac tics techniques and procedures for everything from tactical communications to logistics must be modified to fit the culture educational level and technological capability of the hn forces sf personnel must recognize the need for programs that are durable consistent and sustainable both by the hn and the united states they do not begin programs that are beyond the economic or technological capacity of the hn to maintain without us assistance usfunded programs are counterproductive if the populace becomes dependent on them and funding subse quently is lost intelligence forms the basis for all coin activities and programs sf fid opera tions depend on detailed nearrealtime allsource tactical intelligence products these operations also depend on detailed and comprehensive intelligence on all aspects of the operational environment and its internal dynamics sf personnel tablish priority of effort when identifying intelligence requirements they note which are mission essential and which are nice to have without realistic priori ties to guide it the intelligence community can quickly become overcommitted sf personnel ensure each operation is conducted using accurate realtime intelli gence internal security requires an alert organization with special police functions that can assess the insurgent threat warn the government take action to penetrate the insurgent organization and assist in neutralizing it sf personnel in fid vironment need intelligence that identifies the enemys location and intentions to guide them for combat operations they consider aspects of the society not directly related to the tactical combat situation the information they gain allows them to advise train and help hn counterparts and ease interagency efforts sf personnel performing fid mission may be in unique position to help other sof and gp forces accomplish their mission so are often compartmentalized due to security concerns but compartmentation can exclude key personnel from the planning process insufficient security may compromise mission but exces sive security will usually cause the mission to fail because of inadequate coor dination sf must resolve these conflicting demands on mission planning and execution the nature of insurgencies an insurgency is an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of constituted government through the use of subversion and armed conflict in some cases how ever the goals of an insurgency may be more limited for example the insurgency 16fm 31203 may intend to break away portion of the nation from government control and tablish an autonomous state within traditional ethnic or religious territorial bounds the insurgency may also intend to extract limited political concessions unattainable through less violent means insurgencies generally follow revolu tionary doctrine and use armed forces as an instrument of policy insurgency may be classified in three general phases according to the level of in tensity phase i ranges from circumstances in which subversive activity is only potential threatlatent or incipientto situations in which subversive incidents and activities occur with frequency in an organized pattern it involves major outbreak of violence or uncontrolled insurgency activity in those nations where potential insurgency problem exists and where us inter ests so dictate security assistance program sap may be designed saps sup port the total us effort to reduce the causes of insurgency initially such program will provide continuing assessment of the threat and allow work toward strengthening the indigenous capacity to combat insurgency us military intelli gence activity in this phase is primarily counterintelligence effort involving the assessment of such potential hostile threats as terrorism espionage and sabotage to us national security interests and the reliability of nonus military resources if security assistance organization sao does not exist the nation concerned should be encouraged to obtain appropriate assistance by requesting establishment of an sao or through mobile training teams mtts the sao or mission should include us personnel specially trained in military assistance it may be supple mented by personnel trained specifically for other fid activities by these means appropriate training can be made available to the hn forces to better facilitate their dealing with the problem phase ii is reached when the subversive movement having gained sufficient local or external support initiates organized guerrilla warfare or related forms of vio lence against the established authority in situations where insurgency develops to more serious proportions us efforts may be expanded to include necessary equipment and training forces specifically trained for activities in fid and instructor personnel under some circumstances unit advisors may be included also the situation moves from phase ii to phase iii when the insurgency becomes pri marily war of movement between organized forces of the insurgents and those of the established authority during period of escalated insurgency expanded us assistance may be pro vialed at the request of the host government this assistance may include selected us gp forces nevertheless the hn government will be expected to provide the bulk of the combat forces causes and dynamics insurgencies arise when the government is unable or unwilling to redress the mands of important social groups these groups band together and begin to use violence to change the governments position insurgencies are often coalition of 17fm 31203 disparate forces united by their common enmity for the government to be suc cessful an insurgency must develop unifying leadership doctrine organization and strategy only the seeds of these elements exist when an insurgency begins the insurgents must continually nurture and provide the necessary care if the insur gency is to mature and succeed insurgencies succeed by mobilizing human and materiel resources to provide both active and passive support for their programs operations and goals mobilization produces workers and fighters raises funds and acquires the necessary weapons equipment and supplies mobilization grows out of intense popular dissatisfac tion with existing political and social conditions the active supporters of the insurgency consider these conditions intolerable the insurgent leadership articu lates its dissatisfaction places the blame on government and offers an alternative the insurgent leadership then provides organizational and management skills to transform disaffected people into an effective force for political action ultimately the insurgents need the active support of majority of the politically active people and the passive acquiescence of the general populace framework for analysisthere are seven elements common to all insurgencies leadership ideology objec tives environment and geography external support phasing and timing and or ganizational and operational patterns these elements provide framework for analysis that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the insurgency although they can be examined separately one must understand how they interact to fully understand the insurgency leadership insurgency is not simply random political violence it is directed and focused political violence it requires leadership to provide vision direction guid ance coordination and organizational coherence the leaders of the insurgency must make their cause known to the people and gain popular support their key tasks are to break the ties between the people and the government and to establish their movements credibility they must replace the governments legitimacy with that of their own their education background family social connections and ex periences shape how they think and how they will fulfill their goals these factors also help shape their approach to problem solving leadership is both function of organization and of personality some organiza tions deemphasize individual personalities and provide for redundancy and re placement indecision making these mechanisms produce collective power and do not depend on specific leaders or personalities to be effective they are easier to penetrate but more resistant to change other organizations may depend on char ismatic personality to provide cohesion motivation and rallying point for the movement organizations led in this way can produce decisions and initiate new actions rapidly but are vulnerable to disruptions if key personalities are removed or coopted ideology to win the insurgency must have program that explains what is wrong with society and justifies its insurgent actions it must promise great improvements after the government is overthrown the insurgency uses ideology to offer society 18fm 31203 goal the insurgents often express this goal in simple terms for ease of focus fu ture plans of the insurgency must be vague enough for broad appeal and specific enough to address important issues the ideology of groups within the movement may indicate differing views of stra tegic objectives groups may have ideological conflicts that need to be resolved before an opponent can capitalize on them ideology may suggest probable objec tives and tactics it greatly influences the insurgents perception of his environ ment this perception of the environment in turn shapes the movements organizational and operational methods objectives effective analysis of an insurgency requires interpretation of strategic operational and tactical objectives the strategic objective is the insurgents sired end state that is how the insurgent will use the power once he has it the re placement of the government in power is only one step along this path however it will likely be the initial focus of efforts typically the strategic objective is criti cal to cohesion among insurgent groups it may be the only clearly defined goal the movement presents operational objectives are those the insurgents pursue as part of the overall process of destroying government legitimacy and progressively establishing their desired end state tactical objectives are the immediate aims of insurgent acts for example the dis semination of psyop products or the attack and seizure of key facility these ac tions accomplish tactical objectives that lead to operational goals tactical objectives can be psychological as well as physical in nature for example legiti macy is the center of gravity for both the insurgents and the counterinsurgents gitimacy is largely product of perception consequently it can be the principal consideration in the selection and attainment of tactical objectives environment and geography environment and geography including cultural and demographic factors affect all participants in conflict the manner in which insurgents and counterinsurgents adapt to these realities creates advantages and disadvantages for each the effects of the environment and geography are most visible at the tactical level where they are perhaps the predominant influence on cisions regarding force structure doctrine and tactics techniques and procedures external support historically some insurgencies have done well without exter nal support however recent examples such as vietnam and nicaragua show that external support can accelerate events and influence the final outcome external support can provide political psychological and material resources that might otherwise be limited or totally unavailable there are four types of external support moral acknowledgement of the insurgent as just and admirable political active promotion of the insurgents strategic goals in international forums 19fm 31203 resources money weapons food advisors and training sanctuary secure training plus operational and logistical bases accepting external support can affect the legitimacy of both insurgents and counterinsurgents it implies the inability to sustain oneself in addition the coun try or group providing support attaches its legitimacy along with the insurgent or the counterinsurgent group it supports the consequences can affect programs in the supporting nation wholly unrelated to the insurgent situation phasing and timing successful insurgencies pass through common phases of velopment not all insurgencies experience every phase and progression through all phases is certainly not requirement for success the same insurgent movement may be in another phase in other regions of country successful insurgencies can also revert to an earlier phase when under pressure resuming development when favorable conditions return some insurgencies depend on proper timing for their success because of their lim ited support their success depends on weakening the governments legitimacy so that it becomes ineffective then an opportunity to seize power exists when these insurgencies move to seize power they expose their organization and intentions if they move too early or too late the government may discover their organization and destroy it timing is critical organizational and operational patterns insurgencies develop organizational and operational patterns from the interaction of many factors as result each in surgency organization is unique however knowing the commonly accepted gen eral patterns or strategies of insurgency helps in predicting the tactics and techniques that may be employed against the supported government insurgent strategies there are three general strategies of insurgency foco massoriented and traditional foco insurgency foco spanish word meaning focus or focal point is single armed cell that emerges from hidden strongholds in an atmosphere of disintegrat ing legitimacy in theory this cell is the nucleus around which mass popular sup port rallies the insurgents build new institutions and establish control on the basis of that support for foco insurgency to succeed government legitimacy must be near total collapse timing is critical the foco must mature at the same time the government loses legitimacy and before any alternative appears the most famous foco insurgencies were those led by castro and che guevara the strategy was quite effective in cuba because the batista regime was corrupt and incompetent the distinguishing characteristics of foco insurgency are the deliberate avoidance of preparatory organizational work the rationale is based on the premise that most peasants are intimidated by the authorities and will betray any group that cannot defend itself the development of rural support as demonstrated by the ability of the foco in surgency to strike against the authorities and survive the absence of any emphasis on the protracted nature of the conflict 110fidel castrocuba in 1952 fidel castro began his revolutionary movement in cuba after an successful attack of ft moncada he was imprisoned upon release in 1955 he fled to mexico to train new group of guerrilla warriors in 1956 castro and 82 of his followers returned to cuba on yacht of this group only 12 of castros followers made their way to the sierra maestra mountains from his remote mountain base he established 100 to 150man nucleus as castros orga nization grew small unit patrols began hitandrun type operations while castro continued to expand his area of influence the popularity of the corrupt batista government waned in may of 1958 the government launched an attack on the sierra maestra stronghold castro withdrew deeper into the mountains while spreading his message on national reform batistas continu ing repression of the country led to general strikes and continuing growth in popular support for castros small cell of revolutionaries finally batista fled the country on 1 january 1959 and castro established junta and became the prime minister and president massoriented insurgency this insurgency aims to achieve the political and armed mobilization of large popular movement massoriented insurgencies em phasize creating apolitical and armed legitimacy outside the existing system they challenge that system and then destroy or supplant it these insurgents patiently build large armed force of regular and irregular guerrillas they also construct base of active and passive political supporters they plan protracted campaign of increasing violence to destroy the government and its institutions from the outside their political leadership normally is distinct from their military leadership their movement normally establishes parallel government that openly proclaims its own legitimacy they have welldeveloped ideology and decide on their objec tives only after careful analysis highly organized they mobilize forces for direct military and political challenge to the government using propaganda and guerrilla action the distinguishing characteristics of massoriented insurgency are political control by the revolutionary organization which assures priority of po litical considerations reliance on organized popular support to provide recruits funds supplies and intelligence primary areas of activity especially in early phases in the remote countryside where the population can be organized and base areas established with little in terference from the authorities reliance upon guerrilla tactics to carry on the military side of the strategy these tactics focus on the avoidance of battle except at times and places of the insur gents choosing and the employment of stealth and secrecy ambush and sur prise to overcome the initial imbalance of strength phased strategy consisting first of primarily organizational phase in which the population is prepared for its vital role in the second phase armed struggle is launched and the guerrilla force gradually builds up in size and strength the third phase consists of mobile more conventional warfare conceptually this 111fm 31203 third phase is accompanied by popular uprising that helps overwhelm the re gime it is concept of protracted war vietnam conflict the vietnam conflict 19591975 is one example of massoriented insur gency in december 1960 under the leadership of ho chi minh the national liberation front was formed in north vietnam its main goal was to establish shadow governments at all levels in south vietnam to take control of the popu lation from the south vietnamese the national liberation front also used pro paganda and guerrilla action expecting the south vietnamese population to rally to their side and overthrow the government the insurgency was actually failure because the mass uprising of the population envisioned by the com munist leaders never occurred relentless guerrilla attacks did serve to weaken the government of south vietnam but they did not cause it to fall in the spring of 1975 north vietnam launched massive conventional invasion of south vietnam using armored vehicles saigon the capital city fell on 30 april traditional insurgency this insurgency normally grows from very specific grievances and initially has limited aims it springs from tribal racial religious linguistic or other similarly identifiable groups the insurgents perceive that the government has denied the rights and interests of their group and work to establish or restore them they frequently seek withdrawal from government control through autonomy or semiautonomy they seldom specifically seek to overthrow the government or control the whole society they generally respond in kind to government violence their use of violence can range from strikes and street dem onstrations to terrorism and guerrilla warfare these insurgencies may cease if the government accedes to the insurgents demands the concessions the insurgents demand however are so great that the government concedes its legitimacy along with them huk rebellion the huk rebellion in the philippines can be considered traditional insurgency despite its communist origin the huks first surfaced as an armed force resist ing the japanese occupation of the second world war after the war when other resistance bands disarmed the huks did not after the american libera tion the huks saw chance to seize national power at time when the newly proclaimed philippine republic was in obvious distress as result of mone tary crisis graft in high office and mounting peasant unrest by 1950 the huks had built force of 12800 armed guerrillas with thousands of peasant support ers on central luzon they were defeated in series of actions by the armed forces of the philippines led by ramon magsaysa by 1965 they were nearly extinct down to 75 members largely agrarian the huks do not view the government as totally in need of re placement but believe that many of the people in it need to be replaced re cently the huk movement has been gaining popular support once again on the island of luzon 112fm 31203 initiating event it does not follow that an insurgency will erupt if the preconditions for an insur gency are satisfied the conflict must await an initiating event an initiating event mobilizes the energies of the discontented and directs them toward violent action its impact is more psychological than physical and need not follow immediately after the event the event may have little significance but an elite or an organization may at some time give it special significance possible ini tiating events include an event that gains symbolic significance this event may be an economic or so cial disaster particularly antagonizing action by the regime or heroic act of defiance by an individual an event that forces action such as an invasion by foreign power the emergence of charismatic leader fidel castro mao tse tung the perception of tactical or strategic advantage by revolutionary elite the decision by revolutionary elite to issue call to arms the influence of foreign agents or propaganda if situation is explosive almost any event may serve as an initiating event its correct timing may also produce flood of events in short period making it hard to point to single event as the act that initiated the struggle thus it may be more helpful to think of series of acts as an initiating event initiating events may be historical with the insurgents recalling the event for the populace this technique frees the insurgent from waiting for proper event to occur us organization for foreign internal defense to assist country with its idad efforts one must understand the political cli mate social attitudes economic conditions religious considerations and philoso phy or plan of the insurgents and the host government one should also understand how the united states can implement its political economic informational and military instruments in coordinated and balanced combination to help remedy the insurgent situation security assistance is the principal military instrument of the us government in assisting friendly

military plays in the overall effort of the us government to help nation free or protect its society from an existing or potential insurgent threat is referred to as fid us fid operations work on the principle that it is the in herent responsibility of the threatened government to use its leadership and orga nizational and materiel resources to take the political economic and social actions necessary to defeat subversion lawlessness and insurgency the us military can provide resources such as materiel advisors and trainers to support these hn 115fm 31203 coin operations in instances where it is deemed to be in the security interest of the united states and at the request of the hn more direct forms of us military support may be provided to include combat forces when necessary the following principles apply to fid all us agencies involved in fid must coordinate with one another to ensure that they are working toward common objective and deriving optimum benefit from the limited resources that are applied to the effort the us military seeks to enhance the hns military and paramilitary forces overall capability to perform their idad mission an evaluation of the request and the demonstrated resolve of the hn government will determine the specific form and substance of us assistance as directed by the national command authorities nca specially trained selected and jointly staffed us military survey teams in cluding intelligence personnel may be made available us military units used in fid roles should be tailored to meet the conditions within the hn military support us military support to fid should focus on assisting hns in anticipating precluding and countering threats or potential threats emphasis on idad when organizing planning and executing military support to fid program is essen tial this emphasis helps the hn address the root causes of instability in pre ventive manner rather than reacting to threats us military involvement in fid has traditionally been focused toward coin although much of the fid effort remains focused on this important area us fid programs may aim at other threats to an hns internal stability such as civil disorder illicit drug trafficking and terrorism battlefield operating systemsthe army uses seven battlefield operating systems bos as functional check for commanders during mission planning and as tool for force requirements analysis this analytical tool is used continually while planning an operation to ensure completeness of the plan the bos functions are defined below intelligence this function includes the unit tasks that amass knowledge of the enemy weather and terrain features the leader must have this intelligence for planning and execution of military operations maneuver this function allows the unit to move on the battlefield with fire or fire potential to achieve positional advantage over the enemy and to complete the mission fire support this function entails generating and applying direct

the tacti cal and technical proficiency of these forces so they can defeat the insurgency without direct us involvement the emphasis is on training hn cadres who will in turn train their compatriots the capabilities that sf employs to perform its fid mission are those inherent to its uw mission only the operational environment is changed sf has been legislated by congress as primary fid player within dod all sf personnel must understand the political and legal implications of their op erations legal considerations in planning and implementing fid programs are complex and subject to changing

sf can provide advisory assistance in two ways sf teams may give operational advice and assis tance to hn military or paramilitary organizations or individual sf soldiers may be assigned or attached to the sao to perform advisory assistance duties on tem porary or permanent basis in either case assistance is provided under the opcon of the sao chief in his role as incountry us defense

intelligence operations that seek to neutralize or destroy the insurgents political and intelligence infrastructure see appendix b psychological operationsto defeat an insurgency the hn government must retain or regain the confidence and support of its people the objective of an idad program is not to kill or even capture the insurgents it is to convince them to abandon hopeless or worthless

out of country normally der the direct opcon of the appropriate sao military operations the objective of military operations in fid is to provide secure environment in which balanced development can occur military operations should not be inde pendent military actions aimed solely at destroying insurgent combat forces and their base areas military operations must be part of synchronized effort to gain broader goals the sf team commander must convince his counterpart to inte grate intelligence ca and psyop activities into every military operation sf ad visors and their hn counterparts must be aware of the impact their actions have on the populace and other idad programs sf personnel have extensive knowl edge of unconventional warfare uw language and culture that makes them uniquely qualified to advise and assist the hn in how to organize equip train 118fm 31203 sustain and employ combat forces in coin operations sf may participate in the types of operations described below consolidation operations consolidation operations are longterm population curity operations conducted in territory generally under hn government control their purpose is to isolate the insurgents from the populace protect the populace from insurgent influence and neutralize the insurgent infrastructure the people are unlikely to support the hn government fully until the government provides enough longterm security to free its people from the fear of insurgent reprisals consolidation operations are designed to accomplish these objectives see appen dixes c and d strike operations unlike consolidation operations strike operations are short duration tactical operations conducted in contested or insurgentcontrolled areas strike operations are primarily offensive operations they are characterized by smallhighly mobile combat forces operating in dispersed formations to locate and fix the insurgent force upon locating the insurgent force strike force commanders have their forces attack pursue and destroy it if contact is lost the strike forces resume aggressive patrolling to reestablish contact and destroy the insurgent force before it can rest reorganize and resume combat operations the purpose of strike operations is to destroy insurgent forces and base areas isolate insurgent forces from their support and interdict insurgent infiltration routes and lines of commu nication locs remote area operations these operations take place in insurgentcontrolled or contested areas to establish islands of popular support for the hn government and deny support to the insurgents they differ from consolidation operations in that they are not designed to establish permanent hn government control over the area remote areas may be populated by ethnic religious or other isolated minority groups they may be in the interior of the hn or near border areas where major in filtration routes exist remote area operations normally involve specially trained paramilitary or irregular forces sf teams support remote area operations to inter dict insurgent activity destroy insurgent base areas and demonstrate that the hn government has not conceded control to the insurgents they also collect and re port information on insurgent intentions in more populated areas psyop and ca programs help in obtaining local support for remote area operations success is more likely if significant segment of the local population supports the program the hn recruits local personnel for its remote area paramilitary or irregular force hn forces conduct remote area operations to interdict infiltration routes in areas nearly devoid of people in this case sf teams advise and assist irregular hn forces operating in manner similar to that of insurgents but with access to supe rior combat support cs and combat service support css resources border operations border security should be the responsibility of hn police customs or paramilitary border forces however the threat may require combat type border operations particularly in remote areas sf teams advise and assist 119fm 31203 hn forces assigned to prevent or interdict the infiltration of insurgent personnel and materiel across international boundaries the intent is to isolate insurgent forces from their external support to include external sanctuaries secondary purposes are to locate and interdict insurgent land infiltration routes destroy insur gent forces and base areas in areas adjacent to the border and collect and report in formation on insurgent capabilities and intentions border operations normally require restrictive prc measures that are particularly annoying to border tribal and ethnic groups who do not recognize the international boundary the hn govern ment must make continuing psyop effort to gain and maintain the loyalty of the affected populace urban area operations clandestine insurgent activity may be extensive in urban areas it can include terrorism sabotage and psyop in addition to political orga nizational intelligence and logistic operations this insurgent activity may strain the capabilities of police and other civil authorities police internal security and other hn government organizations will be high priority targets for the insurgents the insurgents normally try to exploit local civilian organizations by subverting their goals and objectives to serve the insurgent cause the insurgents strive to create situations that cause hn police and military forces to overreact in manner that adversely affects the populace sfods with assistance from assigned and at tached military police mp and counterintelligence ci personnel advise and as sist hn forces engaged in urban area operations the purpose of these operations is to eliminate the centralized direction and control of the insurgent organization create insurgent disunity and destroy the insurgent infrastructure that threatens the hn government when military forces reinforce police in an urban area they must closely control and coordinate their operations to minimize collateral damage and prevent hostile propaganda victories that occur when us or hn military forces overreact to insurgent actions as result the need for psyop and ca support greatly increases in urban areas support of us combat forces if the hn governments situation deteriorates to the point that vital us interests are in jeopardy the nca may commit us forces in combat role to effect decisive change in the conflict direct us military in tervention can provide hn forces with the time and space to regain the strategic initiative and resume control of tactical operations in this situation the committed us combat force is likely to find incountry sf teams with myriad of formal and informal arrangements the us combat force commander fully exploits sf expe rience and contacts during the critical transition period when his forces are deploy ing into the country he immediately exchanges liaison personnel with the proper sf headquarters to exploit sf advice and assistance the sf headquarters provides all possible advice and assistance to include situation and intelligence updates for incoming

is usually organized widespread and wellresourced it may be exploited by or exploit other violent unrest samples of the type of lawlessness that poses director indirect threats to the united states include drug trafficking and terrorism groups engaging in this type of lawlessness share many characteristics organization and methods of insurgent groups there are however significant differences which are discussed in the fol lowing paragraphs the overthrow of the existing regime is not the primary goal of those involved in lawlessness terrorism being the notable exception if significantly threatened by the existing regime organized crime groups may see the destruction of the current government as need for continued operation they are much more likely to seek compromise with the hn whenever possible their ultimate goal is economic gain if profitability can be reduced adequately while elevating risk the attractive ness of organized lawlessness disappears lawlessness never progresses beyond the characteristics of phase ii insurgency because war of movement does not contribute to profitability often translational organizations perpetuate lawlessness that must be attacked in all locations simultaneously failure to do so only shifts the location of opera tions coordinating the activities of multiple nations is hard challenge success cannot be measured locally but only in terms of the overall program although some lawlessness may be directly attributable to the hn in other cases some of the root causes may be in the united states or third country in the case of drug trafficking for example the demand and high prices that narcotics com mand in the united states is root cause as surely as is poverty and lack of eco nomic alternatives in an hn counterdrug operations

involved several activities operational andor training assessments liaison between us and coalition partners communications support adapting and integrating fire support and close air support training advising assisting and organizing coalition partner forces us military doctrine embraces five combat imperatives or methods to defeat an enemy although they are proven invaluable battlefield tenets none would seem to adequately address the issues unique to coalition operations addressing those issues requires an entirely different set of working guidelines or imperatives the following guidelines need to be applied well before any battle plans are executed cultivate political and cultural awarenesscoalition support demands nothing less than thorough indepth understanding of the operational area and its people sf elements can gain limited awareness of an areas culture through area analysis and area studies detailed understanding however can be achieved only through actual intensive personal interaction with coalition counterparts it is here that knowledge of cultural subtleties is gained and true partnerships are formed grand strategy or technological advantage can be substituted for intensive personal awareness of counterparts politics and culture regional orientation cultural awareness and language skills are neces sity for successful mission accomplishment develop rapport between participantsin the most ideal circumstances synchronized effort is an elusive equation at best rapport is often hardwon among coalition counterparts when cultural and politi cal differences far outweigh any similarities it requires overcoming endemic per sonal prejudices that would otherwise serve as barriers to effective interaction the mutual respect and understanding gained through such intercourse is invalu able in reconciling diverging agendas calming fears and reducing ethnocentrism perhaps most important to the rapport development of any coalition effort is com mitment at all levels the american cocombatants and advisors must be able to assure their coalition counterparts that they are committed to their cause synchronize the force unity of effort and coordinated military operations is imperative and military co operation at all levels of operations is critical sf elements must integrate tactical 123fm 31203 doctrines to meet operational

retraining and retesting and for all collective training and afteraction reviews aars premission training the following paragraphs identify and briefly describe army training doctrine and how it relates to sf units training for fid training principles this section is based on the training principles described in fm 25100 train as combined arms and joint service team commanders at every level must incorporate sister services and other federal agencies in fid training train ing command relationships and coordination with these services and agencies need to mirror realworld conditions these training environments must also in clude other sof units to establish regular attachment relationships and understand the capabilities and limitations of each sof asset train as you fight the goal of effective training is to achieve combatlevel stan dards every sf soldier must strive to attain this difficult goal whether the sf leaders are conducting unit training to support their fid mission or are training hn forces to accomplish their mission there is never enough time to train therefore the maximum amount of training must take place within the allocated time sf sol diers must train themselves as well as the hn forces using multiechelon training techniques use performanceonented training soldiers become proficient in performing critical tasks and missions by practicing their tasks and missions soldiers learn by doing using the handson approach leaders develop and execute training strategy that will provide these opportunities this training concept applies also to the fid mission train to challenge tough realistic and intellectually and physically challenging training excites and motivates soldiers and leaders it builds confidence and com petence by developing and honing skills challenging training inspires excellence by fostering initiative enthusiasm and eagerness to learn trainers and leaders em phasize to their soldiers how and why the training is critical to mission success however safety must not be sacrificed while conducting training in realistic and challenging training environment 28fm 31203 train to sustain proficiency the sfod must be ready to go to war or conduct fid mission on short notice sustainment requires practice and repetition sfod members use mission training plans mtps and individual training evaluation programs iteps to achieve and sustain collective and individual proficiency training must emphasize sustaining skills and correcting identified weaknesses training requirements to support the fid mission are as diverse as the possible fid missions themselves teaching basic infantry subjects to paramilitary force training welldisciplined hn force in advanced military tactics therefore sf unit training to support fid must be wellorchestrated intensive training pro gram that includes additional military occupational specialty mos skills and ex tensive infantry and coin tactics train using multiechelon techniques to use available time and resources most effectively commanders must simultaneously train individual and collective skills at sfod level during companylevel training the commander trains sf soldiers for operations at the next higher level and in joint arena train to maintain due to the unique environment in which fid missions may take place leaders and soldiers at every level must be conscious of maintenance and logistic matters maintenance training designed to keep equipment in the fight is as important to soldiers as being experts in its use the sf unit incorporates maintenance in its training to enhance its capability to sustain operations in austere environments with limited external support when possible the sf unit trains to maintain hn equipment as well as its own organic equipment make commanders the primary trainers leaders at all levels are responsible for the training and performance of their soldiers and units their personal involve ment is essential to training and battlefield success they must be developed into the primary training managers and trainers for their organizations to accomplish their training responsibility commanders must keep the fid mission in focus base training on wartime mission requirements identify applicable army standards and train to army training and evaluation program artep and mtp standards assess current level of proficiency provide the required resources develop and execute training programs that produce proficient individuals lead ers and detachments training based on the group commanders training guidance the battalion commander as signs the missions and approves the draft company metl that supports the as signed missions the company commander must plan conduct and evaluate company and sfod training to support this guidance and the approved metl for the fid missions the company commander prioritizes the tasks that need training since there will never be enough time to train in every area he focuses on the tasks that are essen tial for mission completion he emphasizes building and maintaining proficiency 29fm 31203 in those tasks that have not been performed to standard and sustaining proficiency in those tasks that are most difficult he analyzes and prioritizes these tasks during training meetings with the sfods once the tasks for training are selected the company commander builds the train ing schedule and plan on these tasks he provides the training requirements to the battalion commander after approving the list of tasks to be trained he includes them in the unit training schedule he then coordinates the support and resource requirements with the battalion s3 well ahead of the scheduled training to allow s3 personnel sufficient time to coor dinate for them finally he ensures standards are enforced during training safet ytraining must be to standards standards have been developed to perform the tasks safely trainers do not take shortcuts they adhere to the subtasks and their stan dards soldiers must be aware of the harm they can cause to themselves and to others by the way they operate and train with their assigned equipment they must under stand what can happen when they take unnecessary risks during training leaders do not avoid training because of safety concerns they train to standards evaluation evaluations can be either internal or external internal evaluations take place at all levels and they must be inherent in all training external evaluations are usually more formal and conducted by headquarters two levels above the unit being evaluated critical weakness in training is the failure to evaluate each task every time it is executed the artep concept is based on simultaneous training and evaluation every training exercise provides the potential for evaluation feedback every evaluation is also training session leaders and trainers must continually evaluate to optimize training evaluation must take place as training takes place emphasis is on direct onthespot evaluations however the leader allows the task to be completed first correcting poor performance during individual training or during drills is easy to do in higherlevel exercises it is usually not feasible to make corrections with outside evaluators the habit of leader evaluation at every level makes the difference leaders plan aars at frequent logical intervals during exercises this technique allows the correction of shortcomings while they are still fresh in everyones mind the aar will prevent the reinforcement of bad habits specified training augmentation elements and

the training the sfod uses different training methods depending on the assessment multi echelon training is highly recommended however the sfod determines its train ing method based on metttc combat rehearsals are used to achieve multiechelon hn training these rehearsals are the repeated practice of plans made for the hn forces to execute their specified missions such as an attack on an enemy base camp the sfod uses full force reduced force and briefback re hearsals of these missions to train the required individual crew leader and collec tive skills concurrently at minimum training includes individual leader development and collective training individual training training individual soldiers must include emphasis on physical and mental condi tioning tactical training basic rifle marksmanship first aid combativeness and 34fm 31203 familiarization with the operational environment individual training also in cludes general tactics and techniques of guerrilla operations and orientation on the nature of the motivation operations and objectives of insurgent movements crosstraining personnel need crosstraining on all types of weapons commu nications and other equipment and skills found in the unit because counterguerrilla operations require the use of small selfsufficient units personnel losses must never cause weapons communications equipment or essential skills to be unused because of lack of fully trained replacement personnel personnel also need train ing on civilian military and foreignorigin equipment shoulderfired antiaircraft and antitank weapons boats vehicles physical conditioning the trainer plans and conducts training exercises to hance the physical endurance and aggressiveness of the individual soldier this training conditions the troops to mentally and physically withstand the strain of continuous offensive operations the trainer emphasizes foot marches including speed marches in full battle dress and close quarter battle cqb including hand tohand combat and bayonet drills the trainer includes survival evasion resis tance and escape training in field exercises trainingleader development during counterguerrilla operations in rapidly changing circumstances the small unit leader must be able to plan and execute operations with little guidance there fore the trainer must stress smallunit leadership training which can take place concurrently with individual soldier training tools the trainer uses to train leaders are individual soldiers manuals and mos training tactical exercises without troops tewts battle simulations and unit missions this training develops aggressiveness tactical proficiency and initiative smallunit leaders receive training in forward observer fo and close air support cas procedures leader ship training must also include land navigation in difficult terrain and under conditions of limited visibility mission readiness and the health and welfare of subordinates are also continuous parts of training collective training collective training starts at the squad level squad battle drills are the key building blocks that support operations the trainer can link battle drills and collective tasks through logical tactical scenario in situational training exercise stx although an stx is mission oriented it will not by itself result in training to sion proficiency stxs support operations and battle drills and collective tasks support stxs stxs and field training exercises ftxs need emphasis during these exercises interplay among psychological and tactical prc intelligence and ca including civilmilitary operations must exist the scenarios for each tactical exercise need to include interplay among the various possible aspects of idad guerrillas the enemy guerrillas needs realistic and accurate representation during training exercises the aggressors plan of action must be detailed super vised and coordinated using an opposing force operating at random throughout the area making contact with the player unit at will serves useful training 35fm 31203 purpose when using aggressors during stxs and ftxs the trainer must carefully consider the security risks involved especially in areas where the presence of in surgents is known or suspected civilians civilian populations the trainees can expect in an ao also need adequate representation in training these populations are necessary in all tactical exercises emphasizing ca psyop intelligence and prc materiel inspection and maintenance are stressed during training exercises em phasis is on maintaining weapons communications and equipment in operational condition at all times environment the sfod must understand the operational environment when training hn armies and be flexible in using us doctrine to train allied elements modifications in us doctrine are necessary because the hns level of expertise its command and control the tactical situation and its logistic base may be very different from that required by us doctrine evaluation training evaluation is ongoing the sfod tests hn students after each applicable block of instruction these tests must be as performanceoriented as possible to accurately judge the level of proficiency the hn soldier has attained to gain this judgment the sfod must use tests that accurately measure the ability of the hn students to perform the task to standards identify through testing deficiencies in student performance give remedial training and retest students with deficient performance provide test results to the sfod and hn unit staff sections that maintain the training records integrated training much of the training normally presented in most individual and smallunit combat training programs also applies for combat training against guerrilla forces the trainer continuously stresses the fundamentals presented in combat training of the individual soldier and patrolling designing ftxs properly promotes the mastery of these fundamentals individual training subjects in which counterguerrilla training can be integrated into individual train ing are discussed in the following paragraphs patrolling the trainees learn the organization missions and tactics of counter guerrilla patrols the training stresses the ability to move silently avoid detection and track guerrilla forces guard duty the trainees learn to develop security consciousness of infiltration and guerrilla actions the training emphasizes the need for alertness and defense against surprise attack 36fm 31203 intelligence this training stresses the need for continuous and accurate reporting of information using the size activity location uniform time and equipment salute report it also stresses the need for rapid transmission of information on guerrilla activity field sanitation personal hygiene first aid and evacuation this training stresses the need for proper health measures selfaid buddyaid evacuation meth ods and medevac request procedures unit training the following subjects are suitable for integration into unit training patrolling and smallunit tactical training this training stresses squad fire team and individual movement techniques and battle drills it includes training in detecting and neutralizing mines and booby traps see appendix h it also stresses the need for effective smallunit leadership and aggressiveness after having countered and engaged guerrilla forces crewserved weapons training this training stresses crew drills and emplace ment security and maintenance of crewserved weapons communictions this training includes the operation and maintenance of radio sets and proper communications procedures it stresses communications security comsec and discipline because sophisticated guerrilla units may be able to monitor communications this training must stress the usefulness of field expedient antennas and provide enough instruction to ensure their proper construc tion and use when necessary field fortification training this training stresses building bunkers trenches and individual fighting positions it teaches the use of improvised obstacles to in clude barbed and concertina wire sharpened stakes and punji pits it covers the preparation of positions for and the emplacement of key and crewserved weap ons it also covers manufactured or improvised mines and booby traps and other explosive devices visibility and sound this training emphasizes using camouflage cover and cealment and light and noise discipline it also discusses guerrilla concealment and camouflage techniques squad section and platoon tactical exercises this training incorporates raids and ambushes on guerrilla forces it stresses smallunit tactics and techniques in offensive and defensive operations against guerrilla force infiltrators it empha sizes security intelligence communications and aggressive actions when contact ing guerrilla elements combined arms training when applicable this training provides instruction on the capabilities optimum roles and techniques of using armor artillery aviation and infantry it emphasizes close coordination between all tactical elements this training also stresses the capability of armor particularly armored cavalry units to 37fm 31203 cover large trafficable areas and to perform reconnaissance and security missions it includes air mobility and air cavalry first aid and evacuaton this training integrates first aid training it includes the care of wounds and snakebites cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr manual evacuation carries and improvised splints and litters joint and combined training this training stresses the concepts techniques and procedures to coordinate the activities of units with military and civilian u s hn and allied units and agencies law of land warfare training this training is most successful when integrated with tactical instruction this type of training is closely related to human rights instruction which is required by every deployment order limited visibility training effective operations during hours of limited visibility are essential in counterguer rilla operations the basic ingredient of successful offensive or defensive limited visibility operations is the individual soldiers confidence in his abilities and equipment during the hours of darkness this confidence stems from detailed plan ning and painstaking successful training training program must devote from onefourth to onethird of its total training time to night operations such nighttime training provides troops and units with the knowledge confidence and skill needed for night operations the trainer considers the use of reverse training cyclestraining conducted from 2000 to 0600 the key to successful night operations is scheduled training that shifts from day tonight and vice versa this training is scheduled during an uninterrupted tac tical exercise further the scope of night training must include all aspects of opera tions training stresses exercises involving night movement areas of emphasis in night training are firing techniques during periods of limited visibility and darkness individual and team livefire exercises under all light conditions night relief procedures at smallunit level night movement and security at halts individual and unit light and noise discipline to avoid detection at night individual proficiency in land navigation during limited visibility use of detection devices in offensive and defensive night operations night livefire exercise for squads and platoons use of artillery to support night operations night airmobile operations night aerial delivery 38fm 31203 training area security the training area must be secure from insurgents before training can take place continuous security must be maintained during all training one method to pro vide continuous security is to separate all trainees into three elements each of these training elements receives mission one trains one provides security and one provides support all elements rotate during the training cycle to ensure the security of the training site the sfod must analyze the threat to determine its capabilities to attack or collect intelligence on the training of the hn unit at each site help the hn unit commander prepare estimates of coas that would deny insur gents access to the training sites recommend to the hn unit commander the coa that best satisfies the identi fied need ensure before each training session all personnel us and hn at the training sites understand the defensive actions to be taken in an insurgent or terrorist at tack and the opsec measures to follow monitor the execution of the selected coa hn force disposition and opsec measures to ensure it remains an effective counter to the anticipated threat the sfod commander does not let sfod members conduct training until security has been established at the training site the next higher us commander or sao must be informed of the situation if the issue cannot be resolved with the hn unit commander training area selection the field training area must allow for realistic training special consideration must be given to the local populace living near the training area trainers need to inte grate ca and psyop assets to avoid negative impact on the civilian residents and to avoid or minimize the destruction of property and danger to the indigenous people logistics and transportation are major factors in the selection of training areas ranges need to be as far as practical from builtup areas to prevent accidental inju ries to locals or their farm animals and to restrict observation by curiosity seekers and insurgent sympathizers the ranges however need to be close enough to the cantonment area to allow easy access of troops and equipment for daily training for advanced training trainers need to consider their closeness to airfields climb ing sites and military operations in urban terrain mout mockups afteraction review in any training event the critical link between training and evaluation is the aar it is professional discussion that includes the training participants and focuses 39fm 31203 directly on the training goals an aar takes place after ail collective hn unit training events inherent in an effective aar is the need to review the training goals with the concerned hn unit commander the sfod personnel ask leading questions surface important tactical lessons explore ternative coas keep to the teaching points and make the aar positive encourage the concerned hn unit commander to review the training event with his entire unit or key subordinate leaders as applicable at this review he stresses how he will strengthen his chain of command and place focus on himself as the primary trainer of his unit stress to the hn unit commander the importance of discussing not only what happened but also why it happened he must also discuss the important tactical lessons learned alternate coas the unit could have taken and important teach ing points not criticize or embarrass the hn unit commander if possible aars take place during the field portion of the evacuation when the unit assembles at logical stopping points aars must provide feedback that in creases and reinforces learning all instructors and leaders participate in the final aar each member is key source of feedback this feedback provides richer data base for key points for example leaders reaction to given situation during the aar the senior evaluator draws this information from the unit leaders to form the context for discussing possible alternative coas there are four steps to follow when preparing for an aar and four steps to follow when conducting an aar they are addressed in the paragraphs below review requirements and objectivesthe training objectives are the focus of the discussion during the aar normally the opord and the mission briefing initiate the actions to attain the objectives the evaluators must be familiar with the training requirements and objectives to be able to evaluate the level of proficiency reached by the hn forces observe the exercise this step is an active process the emphasis is on noting the actions that make the difference in the units successor failure since the opord and mission briefing may identify important activities and checkpoints the evaluator must be present when these events occur therefore during the exercise the evaluator must posi tion himself so he can observe anticipated critical events examples of critical events include the mission briefing and preparation movement to the objectives actions at the objectives major command and control failures redeployment to the base postmission activities after the exercise the evaluators hold if possible formal aar at preselected site evaluation must elaborate on standards that were not met and reasonsselect site and assemble participants 310debrief the evaluators organize the participants state the training objectives lead the discussion summarize key pointsfm 31203 they were considered not met there are many reasons for not performing task to standard not all reasons are due to training or skillrelated problems evalua tors always give an aar to the unit at the end of the evaluation the senior evaluator must understand what happened during the exercise there fore he obtains sequential and detailed description of major events during the exercise also he reviews the major events and ranks them in their relevance to the training objectives and their contribution to the outcome of the exercise he then selects as many major events as possible in chronological order to cover in detail during the aar the aar leader assembles all unit leaders separately he ensures all evaluators are present the aar leader briefly states the training objectives of the exercise he describes the objectives as specifically as possible and includes any additional teaching points he intends to cover during the aar he limits the number of teaching points to three or four key points to keep the aar in focus and to prevent it from becoming excessively long the aar leader guides the discussion of major events in sequential order he dis cusses each major event in detail to make teaching points about the units perfor mance during the exercise in an effective aar the aar leader avoids giving critique or lecture asks leading questions to guide the discussion has the unit leaders describe in their own terms what happened has the unit leaders discuss not only what happened but also how it happened and how it could have been done better focuses the discussion so that important operational lessons are clear and understood relates events to subsequent results avoids detailed examination of events not directly related to major evaluation objectives encourages the participants to use diagrams to illustrate teaching points and to show routes phase lines and objectives the aar leader briefly summarizes teaching points for training objectives cov ered in the aar after the summary he may have private conversation with the unit commander on the units strengths and weaknesses and what can be done to improve the units performance in an effective aar the aar leader maintains order and discipline reviews the training objectives discusses the important events to include discussing the events as they occurred and how the unit could have done better 311fm 31203 traces the chain of events so that all participants understand all mistakes one mistake is often the partial cause of another ensures the major events are clearly related to teaching points ensures the summary and training objectives are clear and concise uses sketches diagrams or terrain models to reinforce the points made in the aar section ii advisory assistance within dod the principal element charged with providing advisory assistance is the sao sf personnel may provide assistance in two ways as an sfod provid ing advice and assistance to an hn military or paramilitary organization or as an individual sf soldier assigned or attached to the sao in either case sf personnel provide advisory assistance under the opcon of the sao chief in his role as the incountry us defense representative the sao includes all dod elements re gardless of actual title assigned in foreign countries to manage sa programs administered by dod the us advisor may often work and coordinate with civil ians of other us country team agencies when he does he must know their func tions responsibilities and capabilities since many activities cross jurisdictional borders the country team is composed of us senior representatives of all us government agencies assigned to country together the sf advisor and his counterpart must resolve problems by means appropriate to the hn without vio lating us laws and policies in the process sf advisors operate under very spe cific roe with the purpose of ensuring that advisors remain advisors the sf advisor must understand the scope of sao activities he also must know the functions responsibilities and capabilities of other us agencies in the hn because many sf activities cross the jurisdictional boundaries or responsibilities of other country team members the sf advisor seeks other country team members to coordinate his portion of the overall fid effort although refusing us advisors hn military leaders may request and receive us airmobile and fire support if the insurgency worsens to coordinate this sup port and ensure its proper use us liaison teams accompany hn ground maneuver units receiving direct us combat support languagequalified and areaoriented sf teams are especially suited for this mission see appendix i figure 31 shows possibility for task organizing an sfod b to provide advisory assistance to an hn brigadesized unit figure 32 shows possible c2 and

include radar and re motely monitored sensors and other technical surveillance systems using local people in the development of intelligence collection systems systematically and thoroughly interrogating prisoners and suspects in addition command and staff action in coin operations emphasizes incorporat ing and monitoring government internal development programs in the operational plan these actions include preparing and executing integrated plans that include ca prc and psyop operating with and assisting hn paramilitary and police forces integrating css functions especially aerial resupply into all planning tactical counterinsurgency operations tactical coin operations reduce the insurgent threat or activity in the area and pro vide favorable environment for the hns idad program these objectives are complementary when the insurgent threat is reduced internal development can begin when it works internal development alleviates the causes of dissatisfaction that gave rise to the insurgency by depriving the insurgent of both popular support and reason for fighting basic considerations for successful coin operations are training intelligence framework for combat and welldefined c² arrangement 315fm 31203 by which the civilian government exercises control and coordination of all coin operations there may be need for tactical operations inside or near an urban area to defeat an insurgent attack any insurgent effort to seize and hold an urban area will proba bly involve operations in nearby areas as well when the police or other internal curity forces cannot cope with the attack inside the urban area military forces can participate these forces can set up security around the urban area and deny the in surgents reinforcements or support military forces when military forces reinforce police units to defeat insurgent forces inside an ur ban area they require close control and coordination as soon as the police force can manage the situation the military forces withdraw insurgent forces when insurgent forces seize an urban area proper authorities evaluate from both tactical and psychological aspect whether to recapture it using major military force or other techniques the probable psychological impact on the enemy non combatant civilians and friendly troops influences the amount of force and spe cific techniques used to recapture an area the safety of civilians and friendly troops probable damage to property and the military forces available must be considered the principle of minimum essential force will help reduce casualties in the noncombatant civilian population coordination riot control munitions can be used against targets so that military forces can close with and capture the enemy with minimum injury to the noncombatants

control sfpersonnel provide advisory assistance in the prc area as determined by the local situation among the considerations are attitudes of the populace concept tech niques and control measures of the program and forgiveness and rehabilitation attitudes most of the population of any given target area is initially unresponsive to the ef forts of the incumbent government or the insurgents in some societies there may be traditional distrust of the government as well as dissatisfaction with social and economic conditions however the population may not have any inclination to revolt in other societies distrust of any influence from outside sources may exist in most instances the general desire of most of the public is to be left alone to earn livelihood and to conduct its normal affairs an effective psyop pro gram can exploit this desire for normalcy and direct popular feeling against the insurgents the advocates of revolutionary warfare may be very small but capable and ac tive segment of the population only small minority of the population may have actively participated in or supported the initial efforts of the insurgents the forces of the government and its adherents usually represent countering minority it includes government officials civil servants professional military and police units leading politicians the wealthy and managers of industry commerce and banking firms most of the population remains uncommitted the insurgents have to persuade or force the population into active or passive support of their goals the struggle is therefore not over terrain it is struggle for the support of the populace if the in surgents win popular support among the majority of the populace the hn govern ments military successes are irrelevant concept the design of the prc program complements and supports the other idad pro grams by providing secure environment in which to administer these programs the prc goals are to sever the supporting relationship between the population and the insurgents 322fm 31203 detect and neutralize the insurgent apparatus and activities in the community provide secure physical and psychological environment for the population the hn security forces have primary responsibility for prc operations since civilian communities usually have some system of law and order logical ap proach is to build on the existing law enforcement structure some developing countries use paramilitary forces to help civil police in prc if law enforcement system does not exist in the ao or if the existing structure is corrupt inept or compromised the sfod may have to help the hn organize train and develop capable police force when insurgent activities exceed the capabilities of the po lice and their supporting paramilitary forces hn regular military forces may have to augment the police since the population is more likely to accept control measures enforced by hn personnel than by forces of an outside nation us forces will normally participate in prc operations only when the situation is clearly beyond the capabilities of the hn security forces and only when us assis tance is requested techniques intelligence procedures and psyop apply to sf in prc operations they are dis cussed in the paragraphs below intelligence procedures intelligence must be coordinated at all levels intelli gence procedures must provide high degree of penetration of the target constant pressure collection of information and rapid dissemination of intelligence for quick response by prc forces prc intelligence requirements forma significant part of the overall intelligence effort psychological operations psyop are essential to the success of prc for maxi mum effectiveness strong psychological operations effort is directed toward the

intent is met common operations operations common to fid andor idad may take place during any of the three phases of an insurgency the tactical situations determine the use of these operations movement security sf personnel plan and conduct all movements of troops and supplies as tactical planning operations emphasis is on extensive security measures these security measures may include secrecy when planning and disseminating orders strict noise and light disci pline during movement and varying routes and movement schedules during operations forces organized and equipped to ensure effective front flank and rear security during movement and halts prepositioning security elements along the route helps route reconnaissance and movement security coordination with supporting air units to ensure an understanding of cas used to assist the movement preventive measures and close combat operations the need for secrecy may prevent initial air cover but it will not prevent the use of cas the use of aerial photographs is critical for route planning fire support elements that provide close and continuous fire support for the movement maneuver and counterambush actions these actions may be contingency plans for immediate action against an ambush these actions may also use formations that allow part of the column to be in position to maneuver against an ambush force communications with supporting units adjacent hn forces and higher head quarters varying locations of leaders communications and automatic weapons within the movement formation questions for local civilians along the route to gain information to include pos sible insurgent ambush sites movements by bounds with overmatching fire the use of military working dogs and other ambush detection means coordination of sf personnel coordinate movement plans with military units along the intended movement plans routes they consider the following communications communications are vital to the success of movements air and ground radio communications are planned and available between convoy and 327fm 31203 march units with artillery fos and forward air controllers facs and with units and population centers in the areas along the route of movement units on the move use prearranged visual and audible signals artillery and mortar support units within range of the route of movement may provide artillery and fire support movements requiring artillery and mortar sup port have fos either with them or in supporting observation aircraft sf personnel coordinate call signs frequencies authentications areas of possible use move ment schedules and target numbers route clearing routes may be cleared before certain critical movements the use of routeclearing operations depends on the availability of troops the importance of the movement and the insurgent threat within the area normally the units re sponsible for the area through which the movement will pass are used in the route clearing operation these routeclearing forces normally include both mounted and dismounted elements after thorough reconnaissance of the main route of move ment selectively placed tactical units secure critical terrain near the route reserves ready forces are vital to countering ambushes the insurgent must be convinced that ambushes produce fast relentless and hardhitting response by coin forces motor movements security convoy organization and aircraft support are factors sf personnel must address when preparing for motor marches longrange security measures sf personnel need timely and accurate intelli gence about insurgent ambushes the local population is an important source of such intelligence sf personnel need information about where the insurgent force is operating its size its ambush patterns and its weapon capabilities counterin telligence incorporates the use of alternate routes varied timetables and changes in formations and locations of principal weapons comsec is also vital counter intelligence technique convoy organization sf personnel have reconnaissance elements travel on the ground ahead of and in the air above the convoy to discover or trigger potential ambush normally they request reconnaissance elements from supporting forces if none are available they organize one from within the convoys own resources sf personnel also plot targets on all likely or suspected ambush sites if fire support is available do not overload vehicles in convoys if troopcarrying vehicles are loaded to their maximum troops cannot use their weapons effectively post selected individuals as guards in large vehicles they post man in each corner with assigned sectors of surveillance and fire guards should be armed with automatic weapons and fragmentation and smoke grenades use command helicopter for convoys of two or more elements the helicopter gives the commander good control and communications means and lets him react quickly to all contingencies 328fm 31203 place armored escort vehicles if available in various parts of the convoy use radio communications to link all command elements of the convoy standby ready forces and escort aircraft they also position and distribute crewserved weapons throughout the convoy to provide fire support as needed they ensure the troops can remove these weapons quickly from the vehicles indirect fire weapons must be ready at all times they ensure the proper preparation of vehicles troops in vehicle must have all around visibility be able to fire their weapons without hindrance and be able to dismount quickly the unit hardens vehicles with armor kits or sandbags when possible sandbags placed in single row and stacked five high on each side of the trucks bed protect 2 l2ton truck or other type of truck from smallarms fire one single layer of sandbags on the bed and floor of the cab will reduce casualties from mines detonated under the vehicle the unit removes the tarpaulins and bows and removes or places the tailgate in horizontal position unit personnel place protective wire over the open windows of cargocarrying vehicles the unit also at taches cutting or deflecting bar to the front of vehicles to prevent injury from wire obstacles hung across the road they plan for actions to take when ambushed the basic immediate action is to continue moving if possible the convoy halts only when clear or before entering the kill zone personnel counterattack immediately from flank drivers do not stop once in the ambush but try to reach positions clear of enemy fire personnel in moving vehicles immediately return fire into the ambush positions when clear of the kill zone vehicles stop and occupants take immediate offensive action unit or portion of unit caught in an ambush takes immediate action to return fire and move against the ambush party procedures for dismounting vehicles must be well rehearsed before conducting any vehicular movements aircraft support aerial observers and armed helicopters or fixedwing strike air craft can provide considerable assistance during convoy movements aerial observers can assist the convoy commander with navigation and control the aerial observer can by virtue of his location view much larger area than the convoy commander on the ground he can provide timely information ensuring the correct route is followed and report on incoming traffic unexpected developments and bypasses in addition he can report on march discipline to the commander ideally the lead and trail vehicle should be marked preferably with color panels the aerial observer can check on likely ambush sites one or two kilometers forward of the lead vehicle it is desirable that the aerial observer maintain visual contact with the lead element as much as possible if an ambush occurs the aerial observer can acquire and adjust supporting aerial and ground fires armed helicopters can cover column movements if sf personnel request them these helicopters operate in conjunction with route reconnaissance by scout heli copters or fixedwing strike aircraft planning includes the type number and em ployment of aircraft methods of employment include column cover air alert and ground alert when planning for air support units receive communications in formation on radio frequencies call signs and identification procedures 329fm 31203 foot movements when planning for such movements sf personnel always employ front flank and rear security when operating in close terrain the unit leader ensures these personnel are relieved frequently the unit leader must also assign specific sectors of surveillance to the main body sfod personnel also identify likely danger areas by map or reconnaissance before the units depar ture units clear all danger areas before crossing them plot target reference points trps on likely or suspected ambush positions if ar tillery support is available and the route is determined in advance use reconnaissance by fire on likely or suspected ambush positions where sur prise or secrecy of movement is not important and noncombatants will not be endangered sf personnel base the formation on metttc they organize the formation to maintain unit integrity they distribute crewserved weapons throughout the col umn they habitually assign specific surveillance sectors to all personnel within the formation to include rear and overhead surveillance urban operations because the center of gravity of most developed countries lies in urban areas most coin operations involve urban operations when planning urban opera tions sf personnel must consider the following elements emphasis and techniques operations in an urban environment require different emphasis and different techniques from those in rural areas the presence of many people and the characteristics of the area influence both insurgent and government operations insurgent elements in urban areas may incite rioting seize portions of the city erect barricades and resist military forces entering the area insurgent forces may hold noncombatants in the area as hostages and use them as shields to deter the application of combat power by coin forces use of weapons the population density requires emphasis on the use of nonlethal weapons and the careful use of weapons of destruction detailed planning coor dination and control are essential when applying minimum essential force to mini mize the loss of life and the destruction of property intelligence and police operations covert insurgent activity is extensive in ur ban areas the government must emphasize intelligence and police operations to counter clandestine organizational intelligence logistic and terrorist activities coin operations in urban areas may be part of consolidation campaign idad operations urban areas are crucial and require continuing idad effort whether or not they are included in specific campaign military forces must take part in idad planning and operations in urban areas during all phases of insur gency these forces can then assist national security and law enforcement agencies if required 330postmission activities executio n the sfod must prepare for redeployment after completing its mission if the sfod is to execute mission handoff the relieving sfod ideally arrives before the relieved sfod departs to assure continuity of effort the sfod must firmly establish its external c3i cs and css relationships before carrying out its redeployment preparation for the sfod prior to redeployment from the hn inventories all supplies and equipment jointly if possible to be passed on to the hn unit or the relieving sfod these actions ensure all items are accounted for and the custody chain for property and equipment is unbroken the sfod alsoredeployment prepares final evaluation report showing its estimate of the hn units capabili ties and giving an opinion of its future employment discusses the hn units performance with its

the hn units final evaluation to the hn unit andor the relieving sfod presents debriefings aars and the hn units final evaluation to the higher in country us commander as required redeployment the sfod commander supervises the redeployment preparation he approves prepared redeployment plans or as necessary directs changes to the redeployment plans 41fm 31203 the sfod commander and s3 assess and select if necessary alternatives or changes to the present redeployment coas based on the s2s intelligence estimate they develop and disseminate fragmentary order frago for selected alterna tives or changes the sfod s2 receives the update on the current terrorist or insurgent situation be fore departure he gives the sfod commander and s3 an analysis of significant changes to the situation sfod personnel prepare all accompanying supplies and equipment for shipment iaw regulations fms and tms applicable to the method of shipment and the type of material being shipped they brief ground support personnel truck drivers bus drivers forklift operators on equipment handling procedures routes convoy pro cedures and the actions to take if terrorist or insurgent incident occurs they load personnel and equipment for movement to the departure airfield andor airport iaw the load plan in the sfods opord they also move from the base of operations to the departure airfield load the aircraft at the departure airfield ensure the loading of personnel and equipment in the aircraft is iaw the load plan in the sfods opord maintain accountability for all their supplies and equipment mission handoff during longterm fid operations the sf commander may elect to replace an sfod for various reasons mission handoff is the process of passing an ongoing mission from one unit to another with discernible loss of continuity appendix j provides model fid mission handoff for the incoming and outgoing sfods it is based on 179day requirement and involves two sfods procedures the overall authority for the handoff and assumption of command lies with the commander ordering the change the authority for determining the handoff pro cess lies with the incoming commander since he will assume responsibility for the mission this changeover process may affect the conditions under which the sion will continue the outgoing commander advises the incoming commander on the tentative hand off process and the assumption of the mission directly or through liaison if this advice conflicts with the mission statement or the incoming commanders desires and the conflict cannot be resolved with the authority established for the incoming commander the commander ordering the relief resolves the issue as rule the commander ordering the change does not automatically place the out going sfod under the incoming sfods opcon during the changeover process although this procedure would present clear and easily defined solution to estab lishing the incoming commanders authority it is not the most effective control for us forces should hostile contact occur during the process 42fm 31203 if the incoming sfod or the hn unit it advises is in direct fire contact with the in surgents during the handoff the sfod immediately notifies the higher headquar ters ordering the exchange if the incoming sfod commander has not assumed responsibility his sfod immediately comes under the outgoing sfods opcon and is absorbed into that sfods position the outgoing sfod commander and his hn counterpart will control the battle if responsibility has been passed the outgoing sfod comes under the incoming sfods opcon and the hn unit coordinates its movements with the new sfod considerations the incoming and outgoing sfod commanders must consider eight factors mission the incoming sfod commander must make detailed study of the sfods mission statement and understand the present mission tasks as well as the implied mission tasks knowing the mission and the commanders concept of the mission plus the ccirs pirs and irs required will help him understand the sion after complete indepth study of the operational area the incoming sfod commander should complete the handoff in manner that allows for continued uninterrupted advisory assistance and hn coin operations the changeover must not allow the enemy to gain any operational advantages operational area the incountry sfod provides continuous intelligence updates to the sf commander original pirs and irs were established for the original sion along with operational strategic and tactical information the incoming sfod must become totally familiar with the ongoing pirs and irs as well as the upcoming missions pirs and irs enemy forces the incoming sfod commander must have the latest available in telligence on all enemy forces that affect the mission this intelligence includes data on terrorists and terroristrelated incidents over the past several months in addition to the normal intelligence provided to the incoming sfod commander on regular basis the situation calls for liaison from the outgoing sfod opsec is critical to prevent the enemy from discovering the impending relief and then ex ploiting the fluidity of the change and the concentration of us forces friendly forces to the incoming sfod learning about the friendly forces is as important as knowing the enemy situation the sfod must be familiar with the c structure it will deal with on daily basis the sfod must know all friendly units in adjacent aos and be aware of the gp units and the capabilities of their mission support base the sfod must also be aware of other operations units and their capabilities if at all possible the incoming sfod members should receive bio graphical data on their counterparts to include photographs to familiarize them selves with their counterparts before deployment hn forces the incoming sfod plans and prepares for quick and frictionless transition in counterpart relations however potential or anticipated friction between the hn unit and the incoming sfod may cause the relief to take place 43fm 31203 more slowly than desired therefore the incoming and outgoing sfods need pe riod of overlap to allow for incountry facetoface contact with their counterparts before the mission handoff continued execution of the mission must be achieved within the capabilities of the sfods the hn unit and the available supporting as sets if us combat support units are to be relieved the relief should occur after the relief of the sfods they support civilian populace the incoming sfod must do an indepth area study giving close attention to local problems popular support for us activities taking place within the ao may directly influence changes in the mission statement the outgo ing sfod must provide this critical information and describe in detail all com pleted civic action projects and those that are underway the incoming sfod must understand the functioning of the hn government and the status of any interna tional civilian or government agencies involved in or influencing the situation in its ao terrain and weather some handoff operations may require the sfods to move by foot into and out of the ao the outgoing sfod plans and reconnoiters the routes used for infiltrating the incoming sfod and those used for its own exfiltra tion these routes must provide the best possible cover and concealment if pos sible the sfods make this exchange during darkness or inclement weather time the depth and dispersion of units and the number of operations being ducted will determine the time required to exchange sfods there must be an overlap period to allow the incoming sfod to become familiar with the ao and to establish rapport between the sfod personnel and their hn counterparts how ever the handoff operation must take place as quickly as possible the longer the operation takes the more the sf personnel in the ao become vulnerable and lu crative target for the insurgents quickly executed relief will reduce the time available to the enemy to strike before the incoming sfod has time to consolidate its position the continued and uninterrupted execution of ongoing advisory assis tance and the hn coin operations should not be sacrificed for speed the incom ing sfod needs to have enough time to observe training techniques and procedures and to conduct debriefing on lessons learned postmission debriefing redeployment is not the end of the mission upon arrival at the redeployment loca tion the sfod undergoes an extensive debriefing the battalion s2 officer orga nizes and conducts the debriefing see appendix k for postrnission debriefing guide the s2 coordinates with higherlevel intelligence organizations to take part in the sfods debriefing particularly if the sfod was tasked by other organizations to obtain information all deployed personnel to include attachments must be avail able for the debriefing 44fm 31203 documentation after the debriefing the sf team leader with the assistance of other members of the team and attachments prepares two documents the unit historian prepares third document the first is an aar the aar states the who what when where and how of the operation it is permanent record of the teams major activities from isolation to debriefing as such it is an extremely important template on which past missions may be compared and future missions planned the aar is normally submitted through command channels to the group commander not later than 48 hours after an sf team has been debriefed the intelligence and operations officers at each echelon keep copies of sf team aars the unit historian also reviews the aar and prepares draft report for entry into the unit history shortly after completion of the aar or simultaneously with its submission the team leader submits report of lessons learned this report is the team leaders re flection on his most recent operation and his recommendation for the future he or ganizes the lessons according to the seven bos intelligence maneuver fire support air defense mobility and survivability logistics and battle command it addresses what worked and what did not work on the operation why it did or did not work and what changes or substitutions are needed for existing tactics tech niques and procedures in the unit the unit historian reviews the report of lessons learned and then completes the unit history for the operation subject to the commanders approval the historian is sues an official historical report of the operation in classified and unclassified ver sions as appropriate within 90 days after the completion of the operation noncombatant evacuation operations neo missions are usually conducted under conditions of instability or turbulence and sometimes violence these operations take place when the us government decides it is necessary to evacuate us nationals the unified commander will ei ther form separate joint task force or use his staff to command and control ele ments conducting evacuation operations since conflict with an armed force is not an objective personnel plan evacuation operations to avoid armed confrontation or if that is not possible to break contact as quickly as possible planning for evacuation is continuous process that must allow for rapidly chang ing situations conditions that lead to evacuation operations generally permit plan ning and coordination the site survey team should conduct the initial planning it should include the determination of any existing evacuation plans and the feasi bility of the detachment to be included in

commanders and other fid planners must consult with their legal advisors to ensure they conduct operations iaw everchanging us legislation and policy in general legal considerations on the international level center on the question of describing the conflict in the hn as international or internal insurgency legal considerations for the united states mainly involve using the proper funds for the type of mission being conducted additional country issues and specific us leg islation must also be considered international legal considerations under international law armed conflicts fall into two broad areas those of an in ternational character and those not of an international character international conflicta declaration of war and an invasion of one country by the armed forces of an other clearly result in international conflict the definition of an international conflict is broader however as rule if the combat effects of conflict go be yond nations boundaries and seriously affect other countries the conflict is in ternational all the customary laws of war on hostilities between states govern international armed conflicts the 1949 geneva conventions and all other treaties a1fm 31203 that make up the laws of war also apply as practical matter an important cern of the soldier fighting in this type of war is his right to pw status if captured noninternational conflictsthese conflicts are typically called insurgences clandestine forces usually gage in hostilities their purpose is not to hold fixed territory or to engage govern ment troops in direct combat but to wage guerrillatype war in this war they can lose themselves in the civilian populace by posing as noncombatants insurgents therefore are organized bodies of people who for public political purposes are in state of armed hostility against the established government an important legal aspect of noninternational conflict is that captured combatants do not enjoy the rights of pws they may be prosecuted as criminals under the laws of the hn the fact that an insurgent follows the rules of war or is in uniform will not give him pw status under international law article 3 of each of the four geneva ventions of 1949 provides the primary source of rights and duties of persons in volved in noninternational conflicts common article 3 has two parts first part the first part provides that persons taking active part in the hostili ties including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those out of combat because of sickness wounds detention or any other cause shall in all circumstances be treated humanely humane treatment specifically excludes violence to life and person in particular murder mutilation torture or any cruel treatment hostage taking outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment passing of sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgment pronounced by regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees that civilized peoples recognize as vital second part the second part requires collecting and caring for the wounded and sick common article 3 does not grant pw status to insurgents it does require the gov ernment to grant them fair trial in regularly constituted court before carrying out the courts sentence after guilty verdict common article 3 incorporates basic human rights human rights also include other rights embodied in the phrase life liberty and the pursuit of happiness such as the right of free speech freedom of worship and freedom of the press us

us policy is to maximize us jurisdiction over the armed forces it may deploy to foreign nation the legal status of us forces in foreign nation is usually fined in one of the following types of international agreements emergency wartime agreements sao agreements sofas during military emergencies the united states normally obtained exclusive ju risdiction over its troops in foreign countries emergency agreements have nor mally been short and uncomplicated the classic examples of these types of agreements are the 1950 korea the 1968 lebanon and the 1984 grenada station ing agreements sao agreements provide lower level of diplomatic immunity to us troops sta tioned in countries under these agreements each agreement is individually nego tiated with the country in question and therefore is usually different soldiers on temporary duty tdy in these countries for example fid mission are usually attached to the sao and automatically assume the protection accorded those personnel agreements of this type normally provide the same diplomatic immunity for anything done in the performance of official duty personnel per forming fid mission may come within the scope of the sao agreement itself or be included by the terms of security assistance contract department of defense form 1513 letter of offer and acceptance entered into between the united states and the hn sofas are the most comprehensive type of international agreements sofas are usually used where the united states has stationed many forces for an extended pe riod germany and korea sofas usually provide for sharing of jurisdiction over us forces with the united states having the primary right to exercise juris diction over offenses solely involving us members or property security of us forces actions occurring in the performance of official duty us forces performing fid mission are not automatically immune from hn ju risdiction commanders coordinate with their legal advisor to find out the legal status of their personnel and try to obtain any necessary protection if there is ap plicable international agreement or dd form 1513 a6intelligence operations role of intelligence the primary duty of intelligence personnel engaged in fid andor idad is to pro duce intelligence to prevent or defeat lawlessness or insurgency the sfod must be ready to train advise and assist hn personnel in intelligence operations intelli gence personnel must collect information and produce intelligence on almost all aspects of the fid andor idad environment when they know that insurgents terrorists or common criminals receive aid from an external power intelligence personnel seek information on the external powers role in the insurgency they need information not only on the armed insurgents but also on their infrastructure organizations and their relationships with the populace these relationships make the populace most lucrative source of information sound collection program and proper use of the various collection agencies and information sources will result in very heavy volume of information flowing into the intelligence production element due to the insurgent environment politics and military tactics intelligence requirements can only be met by reporting minute details on great variety of subject areas each detail may appear unrelated to oth ers and insignificant by itself however these details when mapped and chrono logically recorded over long periods and analyzed with other reported details may lead to definitive and predictable patterns of insurgent activity the insurgent recognizes the shortcomings in his military posture he must there fore minimize the weaknesses inherent in using and supporting isolated unso phisticated forces that use ponderous and primitive communications and logistics systems he uses the weather the terrain and the populace employing secrecy b1fm 31203 surprise and simplicity plans and actions these unsophisticated forces will carry out must be simple comprehensive and repetitive therefore the solution to problem is system that as whole is complex but in part is independent having simple logical and uniform characteristics intelligence requirements accurate detailed and timely intelligence is vital to successful fid andor idad operations this dependence on intelligence and counterintelligence is greater in fid andor idad operations than in conventional operations due to the differences addressed below fid operations in fid operations the targets are elements of the populaceeither civilian sup porters or members of the insurgency the differences between supporters and members are usually illdefined complete awareness and intimate knowledge of the environment is essential to conducting current intelligence operations the basic nature of the internal security problem requires an intensive initial intelli gence effort to pinpoint the roots of subversion conventional operationsin conventional operations force may succeed in capturing military objective by attacking with overwhelming strength success can sometimes be attained in these situations without timely and detailed intelligence such success is not the case in fid andor idad the insurgents seldom hold terrain they will not overtly commit themselves except when cornered or when the odds heavily favor their chances of winning most important their base of operations is in the popu lace itself the insurgents therefore cannot be easily detected and overwhelmed they must be subjected to close scrutiny delicate and discriminating analysis and aggressive and accurate countermeasures the intelligence required is of the type quantity and quality that provides goals for daily or major operations intelligence that locates guerrillas for tactical counterguerrilla operations enables hn forces to retain or regain the initiative enables hn forces to put continuous and increasing pressure on insurgent security the intelligence cycle intelligence operations follow continuous fourphase process known as the intel ligence cycle figure b1 the intelligence cycle is oriented to the commanders mission supervision and planning are inherent in all phases of the cycle even though the four phases take place in sequence all are performed concurrently while available information is being processed additional information is being collected and the intelligence staff is planning and directing the collection effort to meet new demands the intelligence staff disseminates the intelligence as soon as it is available or needed b2direction collectionfm 31203 the hn commander through his senior intelligence officer sio directs the in telligence effort the sio supervises collection management before the operation and guides the effective use of collection assets during the operation he develops and maintains data bases through research and ipb ipb coupled with the avail able data base provides basis for situation and target development the ipb and data base provide means for projecting battlefield events and activities in the ao and for predicting coas by comparing these projections with actual events and activities as they occur the sio can provide the commander with timely com plete and accurate intelligence intelligence agencies from national level down constantly develop and maintain intelligence data bases the sio accesses these databases to prepare initial intelli gence estimates and to analyze the ao showing probable coas the sio bases this analysis on the mission requirements and the commanders pir the resulting intelligence estimate is integrated with other staff estimates and presented to the commander so he can decide what actions he must take to perform the mission the commander and his s2 and s3 begin the collection effort by determining re quirements and establishing their priorities they may base their requirements on metttc and the commanders planning guidance pirs are the basis for intelligence operations the commander personally approves them pirs are those intelligence requirements for which commander has an an ticipated and stated priority in his task planning and decision making in essence the sio organizes his pir and ir as follows he subdivides strategic pirs and irs into military political economic psycho logical and social categories focusing on the national or international level b3fm 31203 he subdivides operational pirs and irs into military psychological and social categories focusing on the provincial or subnational level he subdivides tactical pirs and irs into military psychological and social cate gories focusing on the local level within each of the above categories the sio identities the specific discipline or disciplines that can be best used to collect needed information human intelligence humint signals intelligence sigint imagery intelligence imint techni cal intelligence techint and measures and signatures intelligence masint of these humint sigint and imint are usually of greatest use to sf sirs are the specific items of information needed to satisfy pirs and irs they are the basis for collection operations intelligence analysts advise the sio on the pirs and irs they analyze metttc and the commanders guidance and concept of the operation to determine what in formation or intelligence is needed they review the existing data base to identify available information and that which must be acquired they pass requirements for new information to the collection management and dissemination cmd sec tion as collection requirements based on requirements the cmd section manages the collection effort the section develops collection plan keyed to the metttc the commanders cept of the operation and the current situation it continuously updates the collec tion plan in fid andor idad operations the problem is to identify and then locate the enemy as frequently stated in an insurgency the front is everywhere even after identifying and establishing operation patterns of members of the underground the local police or security force must locate the enemy forces before they can capture them there are essentially three methods of obtaining contact intelligence pa trols forced contacts and informants after developing some knowledge of the behavioral patterns of the underground or guerrillas from study of their past movements patrols or police squads can search for physical evidence tracks and campsites if there is consistent pattern patrols can be selectively dispatched based on anticipated movement of the insurgents when the guerrillas are separated from the people their normal underground sup ply channels are cut off this separation forces the guerrillas into the open to tact their underground and auxiliary elements after identifying members of the underground and the auxiliary the police can arrest them the guerrillas will then have to visit the remaining members of the underground and auxiliary more often to get required support using informants is reliable and quick means of obtaining specific data required in contact intelligence through process designed to protect their identity infor mants pass information about movements positions and activities of the insur gents almost immediately the local security force receives this information its commander should be authorized to take immediate action on his own authority with requirement to seek approval from higher authorities b4fm 31203 intelligence personnel must consider the parameters within which revolutionary movement operates frequently they establish centralized intelligence proces sing center to collect and coordinate the amount of information required to make longrange intelligence estimates longrange intelligence focuses on the stable factors existing in an insurgency for example various demographic factors eth nic racial social economic religious and political characteristics of the area in which the underground movement takes places are useful in identifying the mem bers of the underground information about the underground organization at na tional district and local level is basic in fid andor idad operations collection of specific shortrange intelligence about the rapidly changing variables of local situation is critical intelligence personnel must gather information on members of the underground their movements and their methods biographies and photos of suspected underground members detailed information on their homes families education work history and associates are important features of shortrange intelligence destroying its tactical units is not enough to defeat the enemy the insurgents derground cells or infrastructure must be neutralized first because the infrastruc ture is his main source of tactical intelligence and political control eliminating the infrastructure within an area achieves two goals it ensures the governments trol of the area and it cuts off the enemys main source of intelligence an intelli gence and operations command center iocc is needed at district or province level this organization becomes the nerve center for operations against the insur gent infrastructure information on insurgent infrastructure targets should come from such sources as the national police and other established intelligence nets and agents and individuals informants the highly specialized and sensitive nature of clandestine intelligence collection demands specially selected and highly trained agents information from clandes tine sources is often highly sensitive and requires tight control to protect the source however tactical information upon which combat response can be taken should be passed to the appropriate tactical level the spotting assessment and recruitment of an agent is not haphazard process regardless of the type agent being sought during the assessment phase the case officer determines the individuals degree of intelligence access to target avail able or necessary cover and motivation he initiates the recruitment and coding ac tion only after he determines the individual has the necessary attributes to fulfill the needs all agents are closely observed and those that are not reliable are relieved few welltargeted reliable agents are better and more economical than large number of poor ones system is needed to evaluate the agents and the information they submit the maintenance of an agent master dossier possibly at the sfod b level can be use ful in evaluating the agent on the value and quality of information he has sub mitted the dossier must contain copy of the agents source data report and every intelligence report he submitted b5fm 31203 security forces can induce individuals among the general populace to become in formants security forces use various motives civicmindedness patriotism fear punishment avoidance gratitude revenge or jealousy financial rewards as per suasive arguments they use the assurance of protection from reprisal as major inducement security forces must maintain the informants anonymity and must conceal the transfer of information from the source to the security agent the secu rity agent and the informant may prearrange signals to coincide with everyday behavior surveillance the covert observation of persons and places is principal method of gaining and confirming intelligence information surveillance techniques natu rally vary with the requirements of different situations the basic procedures in clude mechanical observation wiretaps or concealed microphones observation from fixed locations and physical surveillance of subjects whenever suspect is apprehended during an operation hasty interrogation takes place to gain immediate information that could be of tactical value the most fre quently used methods for gathering information map studies and aerial observa tion however are normally unsuccessful most pws cannot read map when they are taken on visual reconnaissance flight it is usually their first flight and they cannot associate an aerial view with what they saw on the ground the most successful interrogation method consists of map study based on terrain information received from the detainee the interrogator first asks the detainee what the suns direction was when he left the base camp from this information he can determine general direction the interrogator then asks the detainee how long it took him to walk to the point where he was captured judging the terrain and the detainees health the interrogator can determine general radius in which the base camp can be found he can use an overlay for this purpose he then asks the tainee to identify significant terrain features he saw on each day of his journey riv ers open areas hills rice paddies swamps as the detainee speaks and his memory is jogged the interrogator finds these terrain features on current map and gradually plots the detainees route to finally locate the base camp if the interrogator is unable to speak the detainees language he interrogates through an interpreter who received briefing beforehand recorder may also as sist him if the interrogator is not familiar with the area personnel who are familiar with the area brief him before the interrogation and then join the interrogation team the recorder allows the interrogator more freeflowing interrogation the recorder also lets knowledgeable interpreter elaborate on points the detainee has mentioned without the interrogator interrupting the continuity established during given sequence the interpreter can also question certain inaccuracies keeping pressure on the subject the interpreter and the interrogator have to be well trained to work as team the interpreter has to be familiar with the interrogation proce dures his preinterrogation briefings must include information on the detainees health the circumstances resulting in his detention and the specific information required successful interrogation is contingent upon continuity and well trained interpreter tape recorder or recorder taking notes enhances continuity by freeing the interrogator from timeconsuming administrative tasks b6fm 31203 processing processing is the step in the intelligence cycle through which information be comes intelligence it consists of recording evaluating integrating and interpret ing certain factors are unique to the internal defense environment these factors must be applied to determine insurgent capabilities and coas and provide the in telligence needed for all facets of fid andor idad operations recording like conventional tactical situations fid operations require large amounts of information on continuous basis this information must be promptly compared with existing information and intelligence to determine its significance to large degree the extent of the recording effort will depend upon the insurgent activity in the area depending on the echelon of responsibility the state of insurgent activity in the area and the degree of knowledge of the enemy the current intelligence graphic re quires at least two annotated maps the incident map and the insurgent situation map sitmap each of these recording devices normally is transparent overlay covering largescale topographic map of the area the incident map provides his toric cumulative information on insurgent activity trends or patterns properly maintained entries let the intelligence analyst make judgments about the nature and location of insurgent targets the relative intensity of insurgent interest in specific areas insurgent control over or support from the population and potential areas of insurgent operations the insurgent sitmap represents intelligence much of it is built around the in formation recorded on the incident map it will be difficult to pinpoint insurgent installations and dispositions with the same degree of confidence as in conven tional tactical situation the insurgents can displace on short notice making report outdated before it can be confirmed the sitmap can graphically substantiate the trends or patterns derived from the incident map that improve the economy and effectiveness of the collection effort the sitmap provides ready guide for briefing the commander the civil authorities or other interested parties other annotated maps include the trap map and personalities and contact maps the trap map is used if the insurgent is capable of sabotage or terrorist action it will portray particularly attractive target locations for insurgent sabotage or terror ism insurgent targets could be road and railroad bridges communications centers theaters and assembly halls and places where the terrain favors ambushes and raids these areas are plainly marked on this map directing attention to possible in surgent access and escape routes what is initially known about the insurgent situation may be information on loca tions and activities of individual agents espionage agitation organization and liaison the personalities and contacts map records the appearances movements meetings and disappearances of these agents largescale city street map or town plan is required to track the individuals dated symbols indicate observations and incidents depending on the amount of insurgent activity this map can be com bined with the incident map the intelligence worksheet and the annotated maps serve to isolate problem areas and form ties between items of information and intelligence collected in the early b7fm 31203 phase of an insurgency the enemy is building his own organization his organiza tional procedures and tactics will therefore be unique the intelligence analyst must study personalities and analyze incidents the insurgency analysis worksheet helps identify information and intelligence needed to satisfy pirs and irs it provides guide for analysis of an environment for operations short of war the hot file is the most important working file it includes all available material pertaining to an incident or groups of possibly related incidents of current interest this file contains material on persons agents or suspects or places likely to be in volved in insurgency activity if propaganda is major part of the insurgent effort in the area current propa ganda and psyop file should contain all the pertinent literature background mate rial propaganda speeches and analyses of local grievances the insurgents are exploiting local personality and organization file is maintained on each insurgent person ality if the local police force carries out surveillance they can transfer basic iden tifying and biographical information from dossiers to card file this card file helps train friendly surveillant to recognize key personalities on sight the orga nization section of this file contains information on the history and activities of the insurgent organizations fronts other subversive or suspected groups and their offi cers overlapping directorates membership and liaison among these organizations the area study files contain uptodate and pertinent data on the geography hy drography climate political and economic characteristics civil populace military and paramilitary forces resistance organization targets and the effects of these characteristics resource file contains all material of importance but not of immediate value it may include inactive incident files inactive personality and organization files and photography evaluation evaluation is the examination of information to determine its intelli gence value the intelligence analysts knowledge and judgment play major role in evaluating information therefore he must know the theory of insurgency in considering if fact or event is at all possible he must realize that certain events are possible although they have not previously occurred and have been thought unlikely to occur initially intelligence production starts with unconfirmed in formation that is subsequently supported confirmed or denied by additional and related information as the intelligence analyst obtains more information the in surgent situation capabilities and probable coas become increasingly clearer integration evaluated information becomes intelligence only after it is integrated with other information and interpreted to determine its significance integration involves combining selected data to forma pattern that will have meaning and tablish basis for interpretation in his search for related information the intelli gence analyst checks the incident file the friendly and suspect personality files b8fm 31203 and the organizational file after obtaining all related items of information from the intelligence files he begins to assemble the available information to form as many logical pictures or hypotheses as possible alternative methods of assembly are an essential prerequisite to any valid interpretation the assembly of informa tion to develop logical hypotheses requires good judgment and considerable back ground knowledge in formulating hypotheses the analyst must avoid limitations resulting from preconceived opinions the intelligence analyst uses the ipb process for intelligence production the ipb supports commanders and their staffs in the decisionmaking process the com mander directs the ipb effort through the ccirs which for the sio and his intel ligence analysts include the pirs and irs all other staff elements are active participants in the ipb see fms 3436 and 34130 for detailed discussion of the ipb process interpretation interpretation is the result of deducing the probable meaning of new information and determining its implications about future insurgent activities the meaning of the information is determined in relation to the insurgent situation and the insurgents probable coas dissemination the final step of the intelligence cycle is dissemination intelligence and combat information are of little value if not delivered when needed failure to disseminate this intelligence defeats thorough and successful collection and processing ef fort as result of ipb the sio produces variety of templates overlays associa tion and event matrixes and flow charts appropriate to metttc he provides these products to the hn commander and s3 for approval and guidance as followup the sio provides the correct products promptly to the right consumers he also ensures these products are adequate for and properly used by them where appropriate he must advise and coach nonintelligence personnel in their use he must also use his ipb products to identify gaps in the intelligence data base and redirect his collection effort threat analysis threat analysis focuses on the examination of the insurgents ends ways means vulnerabilities centers of gravity and friendly methods for gaining the initiative exploiting success and achieving early victory insurgents are potentially quite vulnerable in some areas the insurgents are normally outnumbered and outgunned by the security forces although they may have local fire superiority deficient in mobility communications medical and logistic support considered illegal by the government in power lacking in stable political economic and territorial base insurgents are aware of their difficult situation therefore they must protect and overcome their vulnerabilities they must maintain security while building b9fm 31203 strength and support they can do this by developing underground organizations and support systems infiltrating government organizations for intelligence and political purposes gaining the willing or unwilling support of the populace for intelligence logis tics and manpower establishing remote base areas using multiple secret routes using mines and booby traps using caches the insurgents must gain and maintain the initiative by carrying out actions that distract security forces forcing the security forces to take defensive posture they also can gain and maintain the initiative by carrying out actions that weaken the government in power they weaken the government by attacking its political and economic infrastructure through acts of terror military attacks against eco nomic targets and the skillful use of propaganda security is essential for the insurgents success because it provides them the time to make longterm strategy work to do so they must protect their vulnerabilities and weaknesses and maintain the ability to exercise the initiative security is the insurgents true center of gravity the government must use intelligence to expose vulnerabilities regain the initiative and destroy the insurgencydeveloped and intelligenceoriented strategy the hn forces must focus their efforts on planning and conducting operations that reduce the insurgents freedom of action and attack their vulnerabilities order of battle intelligence ob is as important in an insurgency as in conventional combat operations how ever the analyst must recognize some differences in nomenclature and approach the applicability of the ob factors differs in an insurgency from conventional op erations there will also be differences in application between phase i and phase ii insurgency situations the elements of the ob factors are not independent of each other they are closely related and must be considered as whole information on one of the elements will often lead to reevaluation or alteration of information previously received on another element the normal practice of developing and maintaining ob down to and including two echelons below the analysts own level of command does not apply to fid andor idad the nature of the insurgency and the phased development of its forces require much more detailed ob and pertain to much lower echelons the following paragraphs address the ob factors and ex plain their applicability to insurgency situations composition in some insurgent movements military force is only one of several instruments through which the insurgents seek power development of military force has the lowest priority during the early stages of an insurgency as long as the party core b10fm 31203 and civil organizations are established and move effectively toward the goal of the insurgency the military arm may either be dormant or simply exist in cadre form until needed as support arm phase i considerations rather than collecting information on the identification and organization of specific insurgent units the intelligence personnel concentrate on the internal workings of insurgent activity groups knowledge of their composi tion can be key to the entire planned course of the insurgency details of composi tion may include the appearance of new organizations the relative amount of enemy effort in rural and urban operations the internal c2 chain and the organiza tion of the insurgent groups phase ii considerations the concerns of the intelligence analyst will be deter mining the composition of the insurgent combat units including their organization and c2 the degree of sophistication encountered indicates other factors training logistics strength armed platoons or small terrorist cells indicate the overt mili tary portion of the insurgency plan is just beginning armed battalions and large urban terrorist groups indicate there is serious menace to the current government political structures tightly disciplined party organization formally structured to parallel the existing government hierarchy may be found at the center of some insurgent movements in most instances this organizational structure will consist of committed organizations at the village district province and national levels within major divisions and sections of an insurgent military headquarters totally distinct but parallel command channels exist there are military chains of com mand and political channels of control the party ensures complete domination over the military structure using its own parallel organization it dominates through political division in an insurgent military headquarters party cell or group in an insurgent military unit or political military officer combat forces the organization of insurgent combat forces is dependent on the needs the tactics used and the availability of personnel and equipment fre quently subordinate elements of insurgent units are employed independently the intelligence analyst who receives confined report of an insurgent unit operating in his area cannot therefore assume that the parent unit is also present disposition determining the disposition of the insurgents involves locating his operational mining and supply bases locs and areas of political control the intelligence analyst can arrive at the insurgents potential dispositions by developing patterns of activity based on map study and knowledge of insurgent tactics insurgent base areas for instance are normally near areas the insurgents control politically thereby providing an early warning system by plotting insurgent sightings and combining this information with weather conditions time factors detailed inves tigation of insurgent incidents and afteraction reports the analyst can select pos sible enemy dispositions as well as possible areas of tactical deployment these areas while appearing to be under the control of internal defense forces may be under the political control of the insurgents b11fm 31203 phase i considerations this phase considers the location deployment and movements of insurgent organizations or personnel the insurgents strength and tactics may be revealed to some extent by discovering whether they concentrate their effort in few places or disperse throughout the target nation if they initially concentrated their effort in one city or in rural area then the spread of the insur gent organization is key to how long they have been operational and how success ful they have been phase ii considerations how the insurgent forces are deployed can indicate whether the enemy is making widespread show of strength with units scattered about the country or is concentrating forces around few key targets the deploy ment can also show whether the enemy is going to concentrate on such activities as interdicting transportation or actively seeking battle with government forces strength the strength of the insurgent forces must be thought of in terms of the combat forces political cadres and popular support the analyst can apply conventional methods of strength computation to determine insurgent strength the insurgents will try to have their strengths overestimated by the hn security elements to give this false impression the insurgents will rapidly move their units and use multiple designations for single element the analyst views reports from the populace on insurgent strengths with caution and stresses the importance of actual counts of enemy personnel he finds it more difficult to determine the popular support for the insurgents although guide may be the percentage of an area under govern ment control as opposed to the percentage under insurgent control useful indi cator of the extent of insurgent political control is the willingness of the populace to report information on the insurgents phase i considerations the cadre that organizes and activates the movement usu ally consists of highly trained aggressive professionals who exercise an influence out of proportion to their actual numbers the analysts concern is with the number of units in existence in this phase it means identifying and evaluating new groups and organizations that have appeared in the nation and the changes in the size of ex isting groups phase ii considerations the actual number of men available to the insurgency now assumes the importance it lacked to some degree in phase i by knowing the amount of weapons and equipment the insurgents have the analyst can estimate their capabilities against friendly forces the degree of popular support for the in surgents will be manifested in such areas as recruiting for their forces tactics tactics include both enemy doctrine and the conduct of operations according to that doctrine insurgent forces may be more flexible in their application of doc trine than regular military organizations the friendly forces must know and derstand the doctrine that guides the insurgents if they are to counter enemy efforts effectively the choice and application of insurgent tactics is an appraisal of friendly and insurgent strengths insurgent tactics will involve political military psychological and economic considerations all closely integrated speed sur prise and heavy application of firepower and mobility describe military tactics b12fm 31203 phase i considerations an absence of strictly military operations and an empha sis on subversion and organizational development describe this phase although instances of terrorism may begin to occur in the latter stages of phase i military ac tivity is usually limited to recruiting and establishment of military cadres phase ii considerations an increased emphasis on the study and evaluation of insurgent military tactics is required tactics during this phase are usually limited to ambushes raids sabotage and terrorism these activities provide the insurgent with supplies experience and selfconfidence while at the same time they erode friendly morale and reduce friendly economic and military capabilities training insurgent training will be closely related to the tactics they use and will include vigorous political indoctrination both the combat forces and the people within an area under the insurgents political domination receive training the insurgents carefully plan and train for individual operations and phases of movements phase i considerations the insurgents train and indoctrinate their cadre and newly accepted or recruited indigenous personnel during this phase training sists of political indoctrination along with propaganda communications and intel ligence collection techniques some training normally takes place in another country and change in the number and type of personnel traveling to that country may indicate this fact phase ii considerations much attention must now be devoted to locating train ing camps and areas identifying training cadres and interdicting the movement of insurgents to and from outofcountry training areas logistics in an insurgency as in conventional warfare the insurgents effectiveness is very much dependent on their logistical support in an insurgencys early stages the requirements for military equipment and supplies are less than in later stages accurate intelligence of the insurgents sources and availability of supplies and equipment is essential to determine their capability to maintain and expand the insurgency phase i considerations two particular items have always been essential to the phase i insurgents money and printing press if they are highly successful in establishing and motivating their power base they may never really have need for the usual items of military supply money often comes from abroad but bank rob beries unusual or excessive fund drives payroll deduction requests or sudden af fluence among suspect government officials are cause for suspicion equipment to produce and disseminate propaganda printing presses and radio sets is of spe cial nature and the friendly government can easily control its purchase and use phase ii considerations logistics is now larger and more elaborate require ment for the insurgents they must now get store transport and maintain weap ons ammunition explosives signal equipment and medical supplies they now need more people to operate the logistic system insurgent supply caches or supply lines become critical concerns to friendly forces they must control the borders b13fm 31203 and coastlines they must use aerial surveillance over remote areas or areas the in surgents use to detector deter the movement of supplies effectiveness effectiveness describes the qualitative ability of the insurgents to achieve their po litical or military purposes phase i considerations in phase i the term combat effectiveness usually does not apply although the insurgents use words like struggle and front the words do not denote the use of armed forces usually there will be overt indications of the effectiveness of insurgent operations information on these operations may be gathered by careful observation of organizations movements and elections at all levels penetration of these activities by government agents is very desirable and can make significant contribution to the ob picture phase ii considerations the effectiveness factor now expands to include the combat efficiency of insurgent military forces by carefully evaluating the other ob factors and taking note of actual combat experience an analyst can evaluate the insurgents combat effectiveness or lack thereof the analyst can determine their strengths and weaknesses and from this information calculate their capability to follow various coas personalities personalities are not listed as separate ob factor in conventional situation they are of greater importance in an insurgency and as such are listed as sepa rate factor phase i considerations in phase i personalities are an extremely important fac tor during this phase when the insurgency is just beginning to organize and func tion and trying to spread its influence the loss of comparatively small number of men can practically destroy or at least set back its progress the apprehension compromise or exposure of its leaders may destroy the insurgency completely knowing who the insurgent leaders are can also furnish valuable indication of how tactics and training will be conducted and how effective the overall effort will be phase ii considerations as in phase i personalities are important enough to war rant their consideration as separate factor many insurgent units will use their commanders name rather than conventional designation electronic technical datain the early stages there is often lack of uniform communications procedures this fact prevents the development of an extensive electronic technical data base very high frequency vhf citizens band sets may play role in early terrorist op erations equipment available to the insurgents will range from the most primitive to the most modern even equipment not generally available in the armed forces of major world powers such as spread spectrum and frequency hoppers can be easily obtained phase i considerations the propaganda needs may result in insurgent sponsored mediumfrequency or commercial radio am broadcasts transmitters b14fm 31203 may be located outside national boundaries or in remote inaccessible areas these broadcasts frequently use code words to command and control insurgent opera tions later there may be some increased use of vhf transmissions and more organized communications procedures the standardization of communications practices reflects communications training phase ii considerations much more extensive use of communications equip ment characterizes this phase equipment will be captured from government sources purchased or stolen from commercial sources provided by external spon sors or locally manufactured communication procedures may reflect an external sponsors doctrine and training practices miscellaneous other items that contribute to knowledge of the insurgents such as goals and methods are considered here phase i considerations this category can include such items as historical studies of people and parties involved in the insurgency code names or numbers and any other information that does not fit under the other nine categories phase ii considerations several miscellaneous items now become vital adjuncts to the other factors weapons insignia code names and numbers types and colors of uniforms and flags help identify enemy units they also help identify the source of outside aid the source of weapons and equipment smuggled into or purchased in the target nations and the morale and effectiveness of the insurgent armed forces note remember the following points when applying the ob factors to an insur gency the insurgents methods may change but their principles do not the previously discussed ob factors are closely interrelated and cannot be ana lyzed separately when an insurgency escalates to phase ii situation the ob effort must be ex panded considerably the enemy combat units must now be considered in addi tion to the various phase i organizations and activities that will still be active special intelligencegathering operations alternative intelligencegathering techniques and sources such as doppelganger or pseudo operations can be tried and used when it is hard to obtain information from the civilian populace these pseudo units are usually made up of exguerrilla andor security force personnel posing as insurgents they circulate among the ci vilian populace and in some cases infiltrate guerrilla units to gather information on guerrilla movements and its support infrastructure much time and effort must be used to persuade insurgents to switch allegiance and serve with the security forces prospective candidates must be properly screened and then given choice of serving with the hn security forces or facing prosecu tion under hn law for terrorist crimes b15fm 31203 government security force units and teams of varying size have been used in in filtration operations against underground and guerrilla forces they have been especially effective in getting information on underground security and commu nications systems the nature and extent of civilian support and underground liai underground supply methods and possible collusion between local government officials and the underground before such unit can be properly trained and disguised however much information about the appearance manner isms and security procedures of enemy units must be gathered most of this in formation comes from defectors or reindoctrinated prisoners defectors also make excellent instructors and guides for an infiltrating unit in using disguised team the selected men should be trained oriented and disguised to look and act like au thentic underground or guerrilla units in addition to acquiring valuable informa tion the infiltrating units can demoralize the insurgents to the extent that they become overly suspicious and distrustful of their own units insurgent counterintelligence and security since counterinsurgency is basically the restoration of internal security in the ao it demands vigorous and coordinated counterintelligence effort insurgents generate broad counterintelligence and security programs to thwart government penetrations they set up security and early warning nets in rural and urban areas these systems are composed of carefully recruited individuals chosen primarily because their work places them near sensitive insurgent installations typically lookouts may be newspaper vendors building janitors housewives young students farmers small shopkeepers or fishermen these lookouts report possible government raids or other operations to liaison men chosen because they can travel without attracting notice these are often postmen taxi drivers or traveling vendors who pass the information to insurgent officials the security and counterintelligence wing of the insurgent political organization produces false birth certificates identification papers and travel permits the agents require for travel jobs and other activities to make it difficult for the police to check the authenticity of forged document the fictitious birthplace listed is often in location that cannot be checked easily identity papers frequently list the bearer as peddler freelance writer or artist because these occupations are difficult for the police to check insurgents sometimes avoid the forgery problem by stealing or buying genuine documents from some individual who then may be killed meeting sites are security problem insurgents prefer sites in which the arrival of several persons at about the same time will not attract attention or arouse suspicion they favor woods and other secluded areas when they must hold meetings at house or apartment they try to avoid those neighborhoods in which wellknown antigovernment agitators live such areas may be under surveillance they change meeting places frequently when possible they arrange meetings to coincide with b16fm 31203 some outwardly legal proper reason for bringing individuals together they stag ger the arrivals and departures family members answer the door guards stay after the meeting to look for incriminating items left behind insurgent groups routinely conduct security checks of members potential mem bers and collaborators normally they do not accept recruit until they have in vestigated his present and past family life jobs political activities and close associates probationary period follows if they urgently need person with spe cial skills he may be brought in but assigned very limited tasks until the investiga tion is completed clandestine agents are tested regularly the insurgent security personnel may without warning summon an individual to test his reaction if he is guilty of dis loyalty he may sense possible exposure and desert suspect may be kept in igno rance of change in meeting place if government security forces show up at the original site the insurgent organization knows the suspect is government infor mant strict conformance with security procedures is required cell members are subject to punishment if they do not report violations security sections discover and liquidate hostile agents they spend as much time if not more watching their own personnel as they do the enemy s friendly forces counterintelligence and security the techniques pertaining to friendly clandestine collection operations also ap ply to covert counterintelligence activities the emphasis however is on informa tion of counterintelligence interest rather than intelligence interest but during counterintelligence operations information of intelligence interest may also be obtained and should be passed to interested agencies most of the counterintelligence measures used will be overt in nature and aimed at protecting installations units and information and detecting espionage sabotage and subversion examples of counterintelligence measures to use are background investigations and records checks of persons in sensitive positions and persons whose loyalty may be questionable maintenance of files on organizations locations and individuals of counterintel ligence interest internal security inspections of installations and units control of civilian movement within governmentcontrolled areas identification systems to minimize the chance of insurgents gaining access to installations or moving freely unannounced searches and raids on suspected meeting places censorship b17consolidation andoperations techniques consolidation phases the fid consolidation process usually begins with tactical operation that goes through three major phases each involving the use of different forces first phase in the first phase security forces secure the area targeted for consolidation the goal of these forces is to systematically destroy the enemy force structure and the individual insurgents since the area to be consolidated is usually populated the use of firepower must be limited to reduce civilian casualties and property dam age after their initial efforts to destroy or drive away the guerrilla force the friendly forces break down into smaller elements the elements then carefully search for individuals trying to escape by mixing with the populace the security forces publicize their victories through psyop activities to intimidate or vince enemy infrastructure members to surrender at night small units setup am bushes around the village or town to prevent enemy forces from escaping under the cover of darkness normally after two to three days the security forces deploy to adjacent areas to expand the consolidation effort they strike into enemy bases and locs to prevent the enemy from staging comeback friendly forces prevent the return of insurgent forces by destroying all enemy fortifications trench and shelter systems minefield and booby traps in addition to manpower and fire power they use bulldozers to clear all obstacles within the area engineer units can then start to build and repair roads and to rebuild the village without altering its configuration or boundary second phase while friendly forces shift their activities farther away to ensure complete protec tion for the village or town police or paramilitary forces enter the village to take c1fm 31203 over control and replace the operational forces the true consolidation effort be gins at this time the friendly forces have now either destroyed or neutralized the insurgent forces and their infrastructure in the village however some elements still may be hiding in underground shelters the mission of the police or paramili tary force is to search and root out any remaining enemy they separate the enemy from the people through process of investigations screenings classification and checks of identification papers hn ca teams then begin organizing civic action programs they explain the purpose and merits of the consolidation program as security conditions improve people return to the village and the teams organize them into civil defense forces they take census and coordinate elections to choose officials who will make up the village administrative council they also make plans to return those officials who fled the area to their original village meanwhile paramilitary forces start to build watchtowers and other fortifications to consolidate the defense system the goal is to demonstrate to the villagers the credible presence of the security forces and to reaffirm that the force will stay in the village as long as required to protect them in some cases it be may necessary to install permanent security force in the area the presence of regular friendly troops will inspire more confidence among the local populace government troops conduct constant patrols in and out of the area to maintain security these activi ties gradually eliminate the enemy infrastructure rehabilitate the roads and build ings and pave the way for the next phase of reopening the area third phase the final phase is devoted to developmental work it begins as soon as the village is secure and free from enemy interference or harassment either by the insurgent infrastructure or the insurgents hn ca teams begin longterm projects such as building school maternity ward an information office or marketplace and repairing roads or erecting bridges the goal of these efforts is to bring security and prosperity for the populace and allow them to appreciate the contrast between government action and empty promises made by the insurgents note the division of the consolidation effort into three phases is theoretical phases are not normally identified by time but by actions taken all three phases can begin simultaneously if conditions permit also an operation might never get beyond the initial or securing phase the succession of the phases is based on the security situation and the counteractions of insurgent forces in the area coordination of security activities the success of security activities depends on coordination and cooperation of all participants scarce military forces must be shared and deployed as needs dictate because the consolidation effort involves security activities by wide variety of security forces coordination is vital to its success aside from tactical coordination among operational forces most important is coordination between operating forces and the local government since military activities that support consolidation generally take place in populated areas c2fm 31203 normally the shortage of military forces is the most difficult problem the hn curity forces encounter in providing support for the different regions or provinces during consolidation operations there are several ways departmental or regional commander can solve this problem without asking for additional forces he can redistribute territorial force allocations request additional authorized strength in territorial or police forces allocate the authorized spaces to the more needy areas redeploy regular forces from one area to another for short durations the redistribution of force allocations is more widely used since the departmental or regional commander normally has this authority consolidation techniques populated geographically important and economically prosperous areas urban centers villages or towns near vital locs normally receive first priority in consolidation as soon as these areas are consolidated the effort shifts to adjacent areas the idea is to spread from secure areas into less secure or semisecure areas and from these into insecure areas semisecure or insecure areas targeted for consolidation usually interconnect with secure areas to make communications more convenient hunterkiller friendly forces can use this technique in consolidation operations particularly during the securing phase they use this technique to hunt down and destroy small isolated enemy elements the hunterkiller teams consist of two elernents the hunters and the killers the hunter element is lightly equipped and highly mo bile its mission is to track down enemy forces while maintaining constant com munication with the killer element that is on alert and ready for action when the hunter element makes contact it notifies the killer element the killer element moves into the target area by the fastest means available normally helicopters with tactical air and artillery support to prevent the enemy from breaking contact and escaping village festivalcounty fair or this technique is combination of cordon and search civic action and intelli gence collection it requires the formation of special task force that includes cor don units search elements and village festival organization the village festival organization consists of regional development cadre the national police and paramilitary or civil defense forces the regional development cadre is the princi pal actor in the village festival show the missions of the cordon and search elements are the same the village festival organization adds another dimension winning the hearts and minds of the popu lace using psychological and ca operations the village festival technique is mainly used in those villages where the government wants to maintain permanent control and presence the emphasis of the whole effort is on winning the sympathy of the populace and gathering information about the enemy all gather information c3fm 31203 on the insurgent infrastructure at the same time it usually consists of the follow ing teams psyop team this team organizes film shows distributes psyop materials and holds education sessions for the villagers to promote the governments cause and policies whale countering enemy propaganda intelligence team this team is made up of former guerrillas if possible who serve as guides and informants to the police and security forces they can pinpoint families that have members working with the insurgents or families that sympa thize with the enemy and enemy weapons caches underground shelters and mes senger routes cultural team this team organizes games and sports agricultural team this team provides guidance to farmers on improved tech niques of crop planting and livestock breeding artist group this group performs progovernment songs variety shows and short plays cordon and search operations these operations are normally combined civil and military venture based on good intelligence ideally the intelligence sources should determine specific tar get rather than an entire village or town the operation should be planned in detail and rehearsed its main goals are the localization and destruction of the insurgents and their infrastructure planners and participants take every step to maintain crecy and achieve surprise the plan must be simple and easy to execute and the methods and techniques used must vary constantly detailed searches detailed search is carried out to gain information on the identity and location of insurgents as part of the intelli gence effort check on family census cards issue identification id cards and locate caches of materials as part of the prc program make the people aware of the governments intentions and win their willing cooperation harass the insurgents and hamper their offensive capability by forcing them to be constantly on the defensive support strike and consolidation campaigns as part of prc operations search may be oriented toward people material buildings or terrain it usually involves hn police and military personnel search considerations searches must meet legal requirements and be properly recorded the proper use of authority in searches helps maintain the respect and support of the people although abusive excessive or inconsiderate search methods may temporarily c4fm 31203 suppress the insurgent forces they also alienate the populace and increase the sympathy for and support of the insurgents search operations must be conducted at pace slow enough to allow an effective search but fast enough to prevent the insurgents from having time to react to the threat of search if resistance to the search operation develops police or military must take proper action to overcome the resistance after an initial search the friendly forces should consider return ing to the searched area in doing so they surprise guerrillas or members of their supporting organizations who were identified earlier or who returned to the searched area command andcontrolthe areas size the relative police and troop strengths and an estimate of the type of resistance that may be encountered will determine who will control the opera tionthe police or the armed forces although the police may best control small search in controlled area it is more common for the military forces to command and control all operations outside controlled areas with available police acting as support in many situations police may not be available in the numbers desired in these cases trained and prepared indigenous armed force must carry out tasks the police force should ideally conduct tasks in cordon and search operation the following divisions of responsibilities are normally considered the military plan and exercise c2 they cordon the area escort police search parties and guard and escort detained suspects they also provide helicopters if applicable to locate enemy movement the police if available in sufficient numbers carry out plainclothes reconnais sance if permitted they provide required guides for the cordon troops give any instructions to the inhabitants after the cordon is in position carry out the actual search and screen suspects difficulties one of the difficulties normally experienced in large cordon and search opera tion is the risk of irritating the populace and winning further support for the insur gents other problems are preserving security and meeting high manpower costs principles the principles of cordon and search operations include selecting specific target within the capability of the cordon elements too large an area results in leaks in the seal that the enemy is quick to discover and exploit surrounding the area use all possible speed in completing the seal to prevent the enemy from escaping establishing checkpoints and roadblocks to prevent entrance to or exit from the area to be searched preventing an attack or interference by personnel coming from outside the area searching houses and individuals as necessary to identify suspects and locate contraband material escorting apprehended persons and evacuating confiscated material to desig nated locations c5fm 31203 organization when sufficient forces are available security search and reserve elements are organized security elements surround the search area to prevent anyone inside from getting out the cordon must not be continuous line of troops but must be organized in depth for example platoon would normally have two squads forward and one in depth members of the inner security element orient primarily upon evaders from the populated area the outer security element deploys at selected points some dis tance from the main cordon to prevent an insurgent attack or interference from out side the isolated area search elements consist of the police andor troops who search houses and inhabit ants in the isolated area these elements conduct the mission assigned for the op eration normally they will be organized into search teams special teams may be formed for some search operations in searching small areas few buildings small units can conduct search without special teams for each function search teams may require capability for physical or visual searches fire support road block control prisoner detention and mine detection search teams may also re quire capability for scout dogs riot control tunnel reconnaissance interrogation screening documentation and psyop the reserve element is mobile force whose specific mission is to assist the other two elements if they meet resistance they cannot handle in addition it must be able to replace or reinforce either of the other two elements if the need arises if he licopters are available the reserve element may be positioned outside the area with helicopters on standby to lift them air observers can assist by detecting and giving early warning of any largescale insurgent movement toward the occupied area approach approach is tactical movement to the objective it may be executed by foot ve hicle or aircraft the intent is to surround the area before the inhabitants realize what is happening movement by vehicle may compromise the element of surprise by limiting ap proach routes and concealment and by creating particularly at night light and noise it also provides an attractive ambush target thus dictating the need to move the whole distance by foot or helicopter if the friendly forces must use air trans port they dismount some distance from the area to be cordoned and approach stealthily by foot when vehicular movement is considered to be the best means in the circumstances it may be advisable to drive right into the area this quick mo bile method has the best chance of success when moving by vehicle an approach by foot or helicopter is normally preferred the forces approach by as many different routes and as silently as possible cor don established in darkness must be unbroken however it can be thinned out after daylight and maintained by chain of observation posts using patrols to cover the gaps normally it will not be possible to maintain continuous cordon for any length of time due to the large number of troops required in some cases units can reduce troop numbers by cordoning off roads that run through swamps or flooded areas ideally cordon troops should dig in taking advantage of natural cover and c6fm 31203 using wire to help maintain their line however the need for silence will often pre vent digging the amount of light and the thickness of the vegetation will dictate the density and depth of the cordon road movement if the risk of ambush is slight and the force commander decides to use road move ment he must consider control of the convoy routes to be taken and the element of surprise the force commander needs forward rendezvous rv to keep control for as long as possible and to reduce the chance that traffic may delay part of the convoy dur ing the final move forward the rv needs to be close to but out of sound and sight of the cordon area it is not dismounting area traffic control will be required at the forward rv so the convoy will have clear run to the cordon area if several side roads lead into the route selected between the forward rv and the cordon area units must block them civilian traffic must not infiltrate the convoy or block the route normally the force moves to the forward rv by single route such move is the easiest way to coordinate the simultaneous arrival of the whole convoy from the forward rv to the objective the force uses all available routes to set up the cordon around the objective as quickly as possible with maximum surprise the element with the most distance to travel departs first this move can take place on time basis or the necessary gaps can be left in the convoy at the forward rv the ve hicles however must not stay at the rv for more than two or three minutes other wise the element of surprise may be lost surprise will be lost if police searchers arrive in the cordon area before the cordon is in position they are at the rear of the military convoy this fact must be made clear during the planning stage of the operation timing exact timing is the most important factor affecting the success of cordon and search operation and it is the most difficult to achieve the area must be sur rounded simultaneously if this action does not happen and troops are late cordon ing part of the area an alert enemy will slip out and escape actions in cordon areaas soon as the troops arrive they quickly identify the area of the cordon and deploy if anyone in the cordon sees suspect approaching he quietly alerts those personnel on each side of him he challenges the suspect when he is close enough subsequent action will depend on the reaction to the challenge and the established roe prearranged signals are necessary to prevent clashes between friendly troops on arrival at their areas troops take up firing positions that give the best possible fields of fire over the cordoned area if strengths permit patrols move be hind the cordon in each sector to act as pursuit parties if anyone breaks through the various sectors of the cordon must be in radio contact with the headquarters controlling the whole operation the police warn the inhabitants that house curfew is in force after the cordon is in position they tell them what to do if for urgent reasons they must enter or c7fm 31203 leave the area the military commander must tell the police where he wishes the gate the transport vehicles if used are sent to nearby secure area as soon as practical the drivers or force designated for this purpose guards them movement among the cordon force is restricted to minimum until first light if the cordon is established during darkness commanders make an early tour of the area and personally ensure the cordons pe rimeter is complete likely escape routes may be sealed with wire and kept under observation wire may reduce the overall number of sentries required commanders select an area where reserves can rest it should be outside the cordon area but near enough for the reserves to act quickly and immediately occupy alarm positions based on the need for security and protection the strength of the cordon is reduced sentries are posted in pairs on dominating points as soon as possible their posts must provide good allaround observation and consequently ample warning of any breakout try through the cordon figure c1 search techniques police and military forces operating in populated areas must perfect their search techniques they may search either few isolated huts or buildings or search well developed urban sections their search should include underground and under water areas any freshly excavated ground can be hiding place they must learn to deploy rapidly especially when guerrilla force is still in the search area the forces must physically surround the entire search area simulta neously if possible observed fire must cover any portion not physically covered search operations in builtup areas require thorough preparation and rehearsal special emphasis should be given to dividing the search area into zones and assign ing search party to each search party consists of search element security element and reserve element the officer commanding the search party operation informs inhabitants that his troops will search the area that house curfew is in force and that all inhabitants must remain indoors he may also have the inhabitants gather at central point and then have the search party move in and begin the search house search is delicate activity searchers must respect and protect peoples pri vacy and property during the search each search party assigned to search an occu pied building consists of at least one local police officer security element and female searcher if appropriate the search party must first assemble everyone in one room the civil police may give the necessary orders and do the actual search ing the object of this search is to screen for suspects apprehended persons are evacuated as soon as possible the search unit must plan in advance for escort par ties and transportation to move the apprehended persons when the inhabitants are gathered at central point the head of the house should accompany the search party when it searches his house if he is not with the search c8fm 31203 party he can deny knowledge of anything incriminating that is found or he can ac cuse the troops of theft and looting in small searches it may be practical to ask the head of each household to sign certificate that the search party did not remove anything illegally this action may be impractical in very large search however to avoid accusations of theft witnesses must be present during the search prominent member of the community accompanies each search team c9fm 31203 the search party searches buildings from top to bottom they use mine detectors to search for arms and ammunition they make every effort to avoid unnecessary damage they use code to mark each house or building they searched they can use this same code to list the occupants who must be accounted for in later searches such code also helps ensure that they did not overlook any building in the current search if house is vacant or if an occupant refuses entry the search party may have to make forced entry if they search house containing property while its occupants are away they must secure it to prevent looting before the troops depart the com mander makes arrangements with the community to protect empty houses until the occupants return village search is complicated operation it requires detailed planning and coor dination and flawless execution before conducting search operations in village the commander sends reconnaissance patrol to gain information about the village and its inhabitants the patrol takes care to avoid detection part of the patrol sur veils the village while the remainder returns with the information this action tects any changes that might take place before the security element goes into position information of value to the commander includes the villages size and ex act location fortifications and warning and tunnel systems knowledge of where the insurgent lives is also valuable information does he live in the forest at night and inhabit the village during the day does he inhabit one building or several throughout the village how many people are in the village the security and search elements use the most appropriate method of movement based on metttc if aviation support is available quick strike airmobile op eration can be employed speed characterizes this type of operation if the elements conduct dismounted operation they normally use predesignated routes secure and rapid movement characterizes this type of operation if the inhabitants appear hostile the commander has all persons assembled in central location this method allows maximum control over civilians makes the search easier denies the insurgent the chance to conceal evidence and allows more thorough search and interrogation it has the disadvantage of taking the in habitants away from their dwellings thus encouraging looting that in turn will create ill feelings second method is to restrict the inhabitants to their homes this method prohib its civilian movements and discourages looting the disadvantages are that it makes control and interrogation difficult and gives inhabitants time to conceal evi dence in their homes third method is to have the head of each household remain in front of his house while all others are brought to central location during the search the head of each household accompanies the search team through the house this method minimizes looting since the head of the household can see the search team did not steal property this method controls the populace while conducting the search cl0fm 31203 search teams check thoroughly for insurgent personnel equipment escape tun nels or caches they also search cattle pens wells haystacks gardens fence lines and cemeteries search teams must be constantly alert for booby traps after completing the house search the teams search the perimeter and the area be tween the security element and the village if the security element has not been dis covered the search teams form into sections each section searching portion of the perimeter if any section flushes insurgents out of the vegetation or tunnel exit the security element will be able to apprehend them if the security element has been discovered it conducts the perimeter search part of this element will keep the village isolated while the remainder conducts the search such search could take hours if the terrain is extremely dense regardless of the terrain the searching unit checks every possible location for caches of material or personnel in hiding conducting tunnel searches is difficult and dangerous during the early phases of insurgency the insurgents will begin supply buildup where the terrain permits they may construct tunnels caves and underground storage areas in which to store supplies and take refuge these underground installations can be extremely diffi cult to detect from the surface gardens animal pens brush or piles of straw or re fuse usually conceal the entrances and exits entrances may be below the waterline in banks of streams and rivers or in large wells guerrillas may boobytrap all entrances to tunnel systems also they may be able to eject grenades through trapdoors and ventilation holes causing casualties among the search party size and depth of tunnel complexes vary great deal figurations vary according to specific purposes number of personnel to be housed types of equipment to be stored types of material and equipment used in construc tion and the terrain and soil textures in the area village tunnels may run over 1500 meters in length are 1 to 5 meters below ground level and rarely exceed 1 meter in diameter they may have connecting tunnels cache rooms and underwater exits village tunnels will have air vents they may have disguised entrances such as religious shrines their entrances may be concealed under huts haystacks or trapdoors that blend with the terrain trances may be mined or boobytrapped cache or spider tunnels are usually located in difficult terrain are well concealed and are accessible only by foot they may be guarded they may be short and in clude false connecting tunnels and be in the side of hill fortified tunnels are usually detailed and complex they may have connecting tun nels with an excess of 1 meter of overburden they may have firing positions and bunkers located tactically for mutual support and may be well fortified against smallarms and indirect fire fortified tunnels may provide minimum protection against heavy artillery and air bombardment these tunnels are usually defended search teams search tunnels for intelligence information they secure and defend the area around the tunnel complex during search and destruction operations searching and clearing tunnels is slow and deliberate procedure that can be costly c11fm 31203 in casualties in areas where tunnels have been reported the searching unit must have tunnel reconnaissance team attached specially trained volunteers makeup these teams actions the teams take include locating the tunnel using powerdriven blowers to force smoke into the tunnels the smoke may rise through additional openings giving estimates as to the tun nels length direction air vents and exits flushing the tunnel clear of smoke before entering using small flexible adventurous individuals to form tunnel search teams using the buddy system for search teams whenever possible using wire communications between the search team and the surface members they tie communications wire to the searchers ankle to aid recovery of the body if he becomes casualty equipping the search team with pistols or revolvers knives or bayonets and handheld flashlights if possible the weapons have silencers to prevent damage to the search team members eardrums the use of silencers however can hinder maneuverability within the tunnel confines wearing special masks with an oxygengenerating system if the tunnel lacks ade quate oxygen being alert for booby traps and insurgents still in the tunnels charting and mapping the tunnel layout removing intelligence information from the tunnel they confiscate or destroy supplies and equipment useful to the insurgents tunnels may be destroyed by cratering charges high explosives may require large quantities or any innovations designed for the collapse or destruction of tunnels and caves search units mounted in armed helicopters can use both the mobility and firepower of these craft in search operations they are extremely effective in engaging the enemy from the air or on the ground airmobile combat patrols conducting an aerial search reconnoiter an assigned area or route in search of guerrilla forces when combat patrol locates guerrillas it may engage them from the air or may land and engage them on the ground this technique has little value in heavily vegetated areas the use of these patrols should be in conjunction with ground operations and limited to those operations in which enough intelligence exists to justify their use in ground search operations helicopters drop off troops in an area suspected of containing guerrilla elements with the helicopters overmatching from the air troops search the area the helicopters then pick up the troops who repeat the pro cess in other areas members of airmobile combat patrols should be trained in tracking procedures and may follow guerrillas to their base if the patrol encounters large guerrilla force the reserve forces are committed plans must provide for the evacuation of prison ers casualties and material c12fm 31203 screening center screening centers figure c2 can be established for an area or for specific op eration they are organized to identify and classfiy the populace produce informa tion of immediate tactical value and provide ready force to exploit such information mission the screening centers mission is to screen all detainees conduct preliminary interrogations channel selected persons to the proper area for further interroga tion and provide the ground commander with information of immediate tactical value the district intelligence and operations center dioc or provincial intelli gence and operations center pioc will be able to provide the guidance necessary to establish screening center for each particular operation organization the screening center has three main elements the screening element the interro gation element and the reaction element and functions screening element the screening element receives all captives civilian detain ees and innocent civilians as these personnel pass through the screening center they are identified and classified when suspect is identified record of his cap ture is made and only pertinent information taken the police force is the primary operator of the screening center they are trained in identifying suspects and they have blacklists that help identify insurgents criminals and other wanted person nel intelligence personnel familiar with the area and the people coordinate mov ing into another area to react to information obtained from detainees census personnel are used for fast document readout and assigned to whatever unit can best use their services census personnel usually have an intimate knowledge of the area and possess valuable information on the population the center also has doctors and interpreters if necessary c13fm 31203 interrogation element as detainee continues through the screening center he goes to field interrogation unit according to his classification civilian detainee pw here the element interrogates the detainee for immediately exploitable in formation and gives the information to the proper s2 after finishing the field interrogation this element releases the detainee or if suspected has him trans ported to the proper detention facility for further processing and interrogation ci vilian detainees are turned over to the police depending on the arrangements made for the operation interrogators must not automatically regard children as innocent since they may have been trained to be hostile children under the age of 12 should be kept with the women reaction element the reaction element is normally made up of police and military units its function is to react to information that would not require the use of regular forces for example locating individual members of the insurgent infra structure this reaction force is not to be confused with the operations reserve force this force reacts immediately to information gathered by the screening cen ter however its use must be coordinated with the overall operation commander sequence of action 0415 0430 0455 first lightthe participating forces carry out cordon and search operation according to welldefined sequence of action the following paragraphs describe the succession of events in typical cordon and search mission beginning at 0415 blocking forces assume final positions on the line of encirclement times vary according to the situation locale and intelligence they also vary to prevent set ting pattern local hn civil andor police elements poise at the line of encirclement prepared to advance toward the objective key

government civilian andor police elements tighten the line of encirclement and start moving toward the objective village search teams deploy into assigned areas to search carefully and thoroughly for insurgent c14fm 31203 personnel and contraband materials control groups equipped with battery powered portable loudspeakers direct the villagers to assemble at selected cen tral collection area the collection area must be clearly identifiable to avoid confusion the security forces maintain tight cordon sound the village allow ing one to enter or leave at the proper time the security force commander leads civil and military elements into the village and establishes command cen ter at the central collection point the elements contact village authorities inform them of the nature of the operation and invite them to assist they ask the villag ers to assist in establishing the collection point erect tents construct detention closures and prepare feeding facilities as required in the presence of friendly or passive population force is applied with caution all personnel emphasize that the operation is to help the people the processing interrogation and segregation of villagers sequence is as follows during the initial screening local government authorities identify those persons known to assist the insurgents the also identify all strangers to the village police administrators carefully examine individual and family identification documents they reissue documents as required this examination seeks census type and family background information persons with inadequate identification papers or who are otherwise questionable undergo interrogation military or police personnel equipped with polygraph should be available persons completing the screening are marked on the forearm with special stamp to make identification easier after the screening the villagers attend the psyop program to include news reel propaganda movies newscasts taped messages daily newspapers skits an effort is made to provide this program as entertainment which makes the propaganda messages more palatable villagers requiring medical assistance are treated by the medical civic action program medcap local government officials address the people emphasizing the concern the gov meal hoursernment has for the people the governments future plans and the assistance the people can provide staple food ration should be prepared and distributed to those villagers dislo cated by the operation or otherwise unable to prepare or provide food recessing continues until all the villagers have been screened all dwellings and family members searched and all suspected hiding places examined for insur gents or weapons the security forces maintain the cordon until the operation ends intelligence aspectsconclusion the intelligence andor police agencies located within the area usually gather the best intelligence available for cordon and search operation the primary function c15fm 31203 of these agencies is to acquire all intelligence on the area they make this intelli gence readily available for planning and conducting timely operations against the insurgent infrastructure and local guerrilla units they also increase coordination by bringing together representatives within the intelligence community at the local level to work and coordinate on daily basis to improve the quality and timeliness of the intelligence the insurgent infrastructure is the political and administrative organization through which the insurgents control or seek to control the people concept of operations during preliminary planning every available source of information on the target must be exploited planners request specific information blacklists census over lays and special studies on several different targets to select the most promising one and not disclose the primary area of interest they normally determine the most promising target on an analysis of collected information that indicates the in surgents are in the area and can be identified through blacklists photographs in formants guides or combination of these sources execution after establishing the cordon and designating holding area the screening point or center is established all civilians in the cordoned area will then pass through the screening center to be classified national police personnel will complete if census data does not exist in the police files basic registration card and photograph all personnel over the age of 15 they print two copies of each photo one is pasted to the registration card and the other to the village book for possible use in later operations and to identify ralliers and informants the screening element leader ensures the screeners question relatives friends neighbors and other knowledgeable individuals of guerrilla leaders or function aries operating in the area on their whereabouts activities movements and ex pected return the screening area must include areas where police and military intelligence per sonnel can privately interview selected individuals the interrogators try to vince the interviewees that their cooperation will not be detected by the other inhabitants they also discuss during the interview the availability of monetary rewards for certain types of information and equipment followup the tactical unit can retain all ob information of tactical nature for use in future operations the unit can also turn over this information to the sector s2s the unit also provides all information on the insurgent infrastructure to the police for inclu sion in their files and distribution unexploited information on insurgent meet ings indoctrination sessions and other activities will be turned in to the nearest intelligence agency for exploitation dismantling the insurgent infrastructure the task of dismantling the insurgent infrastructure should be carried out with cor don and search and consolidation operations making full use of psyop tech niques and resources this effort is supported by military units in combined c16fm 31203 the problem is even more acute in rural areas where village officials operate in constant fear of retaliation by the terrorists or insurgents these officials often lack the required enthusiasm to eliminate the infrastructure they often fail to act against it even when they know the enemy agents living in the village this fear of retaliation can lead to an accommodation between the insurgents and the village officials and finally develop into philosophy of live and let live in some ex treme cases some of these officials turn out to be the very infrastructure members that the program is designed to arrest and neutralize the role of the police in consolidation operations police units play an important role in consolidation operations an effective police force organized in every secured village acts to prevent the reemergence of the in surgent infrastructure during the consolidation process police units are established in villages as they become secure the strength of the police force in each village varies according to the size of the village population and the perceived insurgent threat village po lice units mission is to maintain law and order and protect the lives and property of the villagers it coordinates activities with military paramilitary and civil fense units to destroy or arrest members of the enemy infrastructure it controls and screens the village populace and develops and maintains an agent net it also inves tigates and interrogates those suspected of being insurgents and controls village re sources during periods of consolidation the police can make significant contributions in destroying the enemy infrastructure and in maintaining law and order in the villages police field force pff can be organized to support the consolidation effort the pff can be equipped and trained in the same way as other police forces with spe cial emphasis given to antiterrorist and antiguerrilla training and operations with the required organization and equipment the pff can acquire combat capability similar to that of regular military force pffs can be attached to province or re gion to support the overall consolidation effort they should however remain der their police chain of command and receive administrative support from the police central command pff representative whose mission is to coordinate the pff effort and assist the local civilian authorities should be assigned to every military district or region the authority to use the pff remains with the civilian authorities the police element in cordon and search operation usually consists of three teams interrogation identification and special police the mission of the police element is to check identification papers and family re cords take photographs and fingerprints search suspect areas for enemy docu ments organize agent nets interrogate suspects and supply information to friendly forces c18civilian self defense forces principles the specific purpose of civilian selfdefense force csdf is to involve the popu lace in the hns overall idad effort the csdf program is designed primarily as denial operation rather than as populacecontrol method or offensive counterin surgency program although the latter are incorporated into the overall concept two basic principles make the csdf program an effective counterinsurgency tool the first is that defensible villages or towns area barrier to the insurgents and an effective way to isolate them from the populace their main source of support this principle also requires an active commitment to the government by the populace the second principle is that the defended village or town offers protection to the populace so they can cooperate with the government without fear of reprisals this action serves as an economyofforce measure since it frees security forces to duct offensive operations when village accepts the csdf program the insurgents cannot choose to ignore it to let the village go unpunished will encourage other villages to accept the gov ernments csdf program the insurgents have choice they have to attack the csdf village to provide lesson to other villages considering csdf in sense the psychological effectiveness of the csdf concept starts by reversing the insur gent strategy of making the government the repressor it forces the insurgents to cross critical thresholdthat of attacking and killing the very class of people they are supposed to be liberating to be successful the csdf program must have popular support from those di rectly involved or affected by it the average peasant is not normally willing to d1fm 31203 fight to his death for his national government his national government may have been succession of corrupt dictators and inefficient bureaucrats these govern ments are not the types of institutions that inspire fighttothedeath emotions in the peasant the village or town however is different matter the average peas ant will fight much harder for his home and for his village than he ever would for his national government the csdf concept directly involves the peasant in the war and makes it fight for the family and village instead of fight for some far away irrelevant government advantages and disadvantages intelligence network public relations vested interest involvement of the wealthycsdf operations have many advantages and can be an effective tool in combatting and defeating an insurgency some of the advantages involve an intelligence net work public relations vested interest and involvement of the wealthy csdf personnel are local residents familiar with the people and regional current events their access to the bamboo telegraph can be of great value for early warning of insurgent or terrorist activities an sfod that enjoys the trust and fidence of the csdf has relatively sophisticated information collection network in place the ca projects carried out by the hn government to improve the quality of life for the populace directly contribute to an improved public image of the hn gov ernment as security improves and lawlessness abates the local populace realizes the benefits provided by their csdf organization and the projects carried out as part of the overall effort the csdf consists of local people protecting their own families friends and property when guarding water supply for example they are guarding their own water and will protect it with great tenacity the csdf is directed at protecting common property the citizens use for the betterment of the entire community ex amples of facilities to be protected are bridges water towers shrines railroads public buildings and anything that if destroyed would cause an adverse effect on the social economic or general welfare of the people often the poor fight the wars csdf programs provide the wealthy class chance to achieve direct involvement and personal participation in the struggle against lawlessness and insurgency businessmen and professionals participate in csdf out of sense of civic duty pride and necessity to protect their assets their active involvement lends credibility to the program and reinforces the governments gitimacy and reduces class friction wealthy personnel may help finance the out fitting of their units however they must not be allowed to provide salary to the participants the major disadvantage of csdf program is its potential for abuse careful trols must be enforced to prevent the operation or even the perception of death d2fm 31203 squads or armed bandits the sfod with hn officials must constantly monitor the behavior of csdf personnel and halt abuses early in the program regular announced inspections are good tool to control csdf elements csdf leaders conduct personnel inspections the advisors with hn security forces conduct more technical inspections on weapons defensive plans communications equip ment and records they must establish system of checks and balances to keep the csdf leadership honest another disadvantage is that participation can often put members at risk of reprisal by the insurgent forces the reprisals could be financial or physical if the situation is dangerous to csdf members the leadership considers ways to protect their identity from the insurgents passive protective measures could include not posting rosters in the open and maintaining low profile on and off duty although none of the above methods provides complete protection the insurgents find it more dif ficult to collect information on the csdf and its members development aspects the development of the csdf program requires the initial organization of the area and the organization orientation and buildup of its forces initial organization in cludes coordination with the military and civilian agencies initial contact with the populace and access to psyop personnel to provide information for the program interagency coordination must take place between civilian agencies such as us aid and the hn government to arrange for selfhelp projects that the citizens will identify as their own such projects may ultimately form the base motivation for citizens to forma csdf csdf elements are not offensive forces they area consolidation tool csdf proj ects and operations must be fully coordinated with hn security forces to assure their security csdf units can and should form part of larger cmo effort the csdf units are usually organized trained and armed sufficiently to maintain security within their village or city and defend against enemy smallunit attacks although capable of light resistance to protect their assigned objectives csdf units are designed to resist for short periods and to alert the better trained and equipped police or military to protect the populace and combat the insurgents the security force response must be timely the csdf must not be left to fend for itself during an insurgent attack recruitment proceduresrecruitment of csdf personnel is through wellplanned and directed psyop campaign assisted by family chiefs and religious and political leaders civil ser vants exservicemen and individuals employed in important establishments are particularly desirable for early induction into the csdf these persons can draw additional citizens into the organization based on economic and cultural factors all male citizens between the ages of 16 and 50 who are not eligible for recruitment into the military should be considered for csdf recruitment in addition older persons disabled veterans women and d3fm 31203 youths under 16 can be volunteers these volunteers can construct defenses em place booby traps or warning devices perform messenger duties collect intelli gence provide medical aid if it is culturally acceptable ablebodied women may serve in the csdf on voluntary basis for the csdf program to be effective the service must be truly voluntary pay and benefits members of the csdf receive pay for their civil duties in most instances however they derive certain benefits from voluntary service these benefits can range from priority of hire for cmo projects to place at the head of ration lines in salvador csdf personnel they were called civil defense there were given usfunded life insurance policy with the wife or next of kin as the beneficiary if csdf member died in the line of duty the widow or next of kin was ceremo niously paid by an hn official the hn administered the program and us ad visor who maintained accountability of the funds verified the payment the hn exercises administrative and visible control responsiveness and speedy payment are essential in this process since the widow normal does not have means of support and the psychological effect of the gov ernment assisting her in her time of grief impacts on the entire community these and other benefits offered by or through the hn government are valuable incen tives for recruiting and sustaining the csdf leadership selection the local csdf members select their leaders and deputy leaders csdf groups and teams in elections organized by the local authorities in some cases the hn appoints leader who is specially selected member of the hn security forces trained to carry out this task such appointments occurred in salvador where the armed forces have established formal school to train csdf commanders extreme care and close supervision are required to avoid abuses by csdf leaders discipline law the csdf members are civil not military forces therefore they are subject to and order civil not military law under the civil law they have special provision for legal immunity for offenses committed while performing their duties they must exercise the same precautions against civil violations as any civilian in salvador the csdf members had the authority to make civil arrests since they sometimes were the only authority in village or town if csdf mem bers have this authority they must refer the arrested persons to the proper civil judicial organ organization and operations csdf units are organized trained and equipped to maintain internal security in their village or hamlet and defend it against attack by small enemy units defense against larger enemy forces as mentioned before requires the presence of or prompt reinforcement by hn security forces the csdf can operate with the na tional police or military forces in relatively secure areas the csdf can maintain security against terrorist activities and against small groups of enemy infiltrators d4fm 31203 they can also help maintain public order when used in this role however they must be closely monitored to avoid abuse if the csdf operates in less secure vil lages and towns the hn security forces must protect them as the area becomes more secure the csdf takes full responsibility for security of the village such an action frees the hn security forces for use in other conflict areas this action is key sequential step in the consolidation of the csdf program and one that must be followed if the csdf program is to succeed organization the organization of csdf can be similar to that of combat group this orga nization is effective in both rural and urban settings for example basic group having strength of 107 members is broken down into three 35man elements plus headquarters element of 2 personnel each 35man element is further bro ken down into three 1 lman teams and headquarters element of 2 personnel each team consists of team leader an assistant team leader and three 3man cells this organization can be modified to accommodate the number of citizens available to serve the csdf program has many activities in which all citizens can participate all citizens from young children to old men can perform specific tasks and organize into various support groups the widest possible participation is encouraged full community participation is the ultimate goal each support group female elders and young people has specific functions female support group volunteers between 16 and 50 years old may join this group they organize into the following teams of 5 to 11 members medical education team its members take part in medical activities they publicize disease prevention and treatment and first aid they help evacuate the wounded social welfare team its members join social welfare activities they take care of children and needy families musical entertainment team its members teach and perform dramas and music shows economic development team its members raise livestock and engage in handi crafts such as embroidering weaving sewing elders group older persons may participate voluntarily in this group they make up the following teams according to their abilities age and interests each team may range from 5 to 11 members medical education team its members can act as advisors and guides in education campaigns to eradicate illiteracy and superstition social welfare team its members guide and assist the csdf members in joining social welfare activities they nourish morality and traditional ethics economic development team its members advise and urge participation in proj ects to enhance the villages economic development such as raising livestock farming and engaging in handicrafts young peoples group participation in this group is available to all volunteer citizens male and female who within their culture are the general equivalent of d5fm 31203 teenagers 13 to 15 is good sample age group their abilities and interests may place them in the following 5 to 1 lmember teams social welfare team its members join in the light activities of charitable social welfare they initiate public sanitation campaigns distribute gifts and encour age the csdf combat members sports team its members participate in sports and games and organize excur sions and camping trips information and communications team its members spread information and news in the village and act as communications links among the csdf units musical entertainment team its members join entertainment activities with singing folk dancing and drama shows operational missions the following are specific tasks that can be assigned to the csdf establish guard posts and warning systems conduct limited patrols defend the inhabited areas and key facilities public works telephone ex changes markets government buildings provide information conduct fire prevention and fire fighting support community selfdevelopment projects provide first aid operational procedures the local csdf commander commands all csdf elements assigned to his vil in rural areas lage or town when hn security forces are collocated with the csdf element they exercise operational control of the csdf element the hn security force commander must fully understand that he cannot use the csdf elements to duct unilateral offensive operations outside the immediate area such operations are normally beyond the scope of their capabilities the specific functions and responsibilities of the forces that may be available to provide security to village are as follows csdf the csdf normally operates inside and on the edges of villages or towns it should only be used outside the village or town in case of emergencies in some cases however welltrained and equipped csdf members can be integrated di rectly into hn military activities to serve as scouts or guides they may also rein force other csdf sites during emergencies csdf members deploy in small groups two or threeman listening posts lps and observation posts ops at night on the boundary of the village or town these manned lps and ops detect and interdict enemy movements and provide warning of an impending attack the lps and ops make maximum use of the available firepower and the element of sur prise the csdf must closely coordinate such deployments with the hn security forces in the area they must change their deployment patterns frequently to avoid setting routine they do not group together in single place at night where they could become an easy target for the insurgents d6fm 31203 hn military forces these forces provide reaction force to the csdf element in case of attack by major enemy forces this response must be timely the reaction force however must use extreme care to avoid possible ambushes along the route common tactic used by some insurgent groups is to stage small diversionary at tack that forces the csdf to call for help when the reaction force is route to the csdf site they fall into large wellplanned ambush the csdf commander organizes the defense of the site using the csdf element and any other force under his control the most efficient defensive concept for the village or town involves defense whose outer warning perimeter is far enough from the defended area to allow time to alert defenders the commander places pa trols lps and ops and small ambush teams on likely enemy avenues of approach these groups provide early warning and may be able to delay the enemy approach however they do not become decisively engaged they occupy the positions after dark and change their locations frequently if attacked personnel on patrol and lps andor ops fall back to the village centrally located reaction force stays ready to move to prepared positions on the village perimeter to meet the threat rehears als by the reaction force are essential for taking positive and rapid defensive action the csdf element is responsible for inner security posts and interior patrols when other forces are present when there are not enough weapons to equip all defend ers unarmed members can man the surveillance positions operational procedures operations in urban areas differ from those in rural areas because they do not in in urban areas volve defending isolated inhabited areas such as villages and hamlets in most cit ies and large towns large numbers of security forces defend against major ground attacks from outside the city limits the csdf is oriented toward internal protec tion against enemy infiltrators and terrorist activities the exception to this orientation is csdf unit located along the edge of an urban area this type unit may provide early warning and serve as temporary blocking force to support curity forces who will rapid reinforce the specific functions and responsibilities of the forces involved in the defense of urban sites are as follows csdf the csdf defends its neighborhood it establishes stationary posts and pa trols its own areas it maintains day and night vigilance to prevent terrorist attacks its alertness to the movement of strangers in the neighborhood lets it detect infiltra tors and suspicious vehicles and objects that it reports to the authorities it is not expected to provide reaction forces outside its neighborhood however in certain operations it will operate with hn forces within its area police forces the police provide internal security for the city they are expected to control any disturbance to the limit of their ability before calling in military reac tion forces hn military forces these forces provide protective defensive ring and patrol outside the city limits they prevent the approach of major enemy forces and limit the infiltration of small units and individuals some forces have static defensive d7fm 31203 missions at key installations and are not meant to be used as mobile reaction force other csdfs specifically reinforce threatened sites the csdf static posts and local patrols within the neighborhood with the police form network to detect and react against terrorist attacks or enemy infiltration ac tivities one of these two forces will probably make the initial contact with the ter rorists or enemy infiltrators when contact has been made csdf reaction squads or reserves are shifted within the neighborhood to reinforce the threatened outpost or patrol threats greater than the local csdf element or police force can handle are reported to hn security forces to summon reaction force local csdf units assist the police and military reaction units within their own neighborhoods by pro viding detailed data on the residents and aos rather than as fighting element training the csdf training program should be designed to train csdf members to defend their village from insurgent attack if faced with overwhelming forces they resist as long as possible and evade if their positions become untenable training nor mally takes place when individual members have free time from their occupation or livelihood the most important part of the csdf training program relates to the defense of the village the csdf holds practice sessions on defensive operations for example some csdf members make mock attacks on the village while others act as defend ers regular practice sessions of this type will reveal weaknesses in defensive plans such practice sessions will also build up their confidence and morale as they become trained in how to react if attacked by insurgents in some situations it will be tactically or logistically necessary to train the csdf element away from the village in these cases the hn armed forces must provide security to the village and its inhabitants while the csdf volunteers are undergo ing training village that places all its manpower into training cycle is highly vulnerable to insurgent attacks and intimidation an hn armed forces unit is sent to occupy secure and defend the village until the training is over not only does this force patrol the nearby area it conducts psyop and civic action functions as well its personnel supervise and help the villagers prepare their defensive posi tions place protective obstacles and establish lps ops and withdrawal routes when the trainees return the hn unit remains at the village for at least one week during this period they accompany the villagers on local patrols stand guard with them and continue to educate them in the csdf program this support strength ens their morale gives them extra confidence and improves their effectiveness as csdf members csdf units must be ready to defend themselves immediately upon their inception insurgent or terrorist forces know that overrunning new site can break the peoples will to resist and destroy any chance of reforming the unit all training is directed at making the csdf members proficient in the specific skills needed to perform their tasks training time must be used wisely and training d8fm 31203 goals set the intensity of the training and the prevention of administrative delays increase the effectiveness of the program scrutiny of the training program re moves many nonessentials the trainers must consider the availability of weapons ammunition and suitable training areas they must also consider the trainees edu cational levels civilian work schedules and personal security the trainers present the training in the simplest and shortest form possible they use the simplest terminology with strong emphasis on practical exercises they base the training objectives on the trainees mission they only teach those sub jects essential to performing the mission trained indigenous cadre is the most important training consideration for csdf program the sfod must apply the train the trainer concept as much as possible at this point the hn training cadre can take the form of an mtt made up of highly qualified and motivated security force members their sole mission is to conduct on site training of csdf units the most obvious advantages of an indigenous training cadre are longterm sustainment of the training program by providing continuity of effort more effective use of training time there is need for an interpreter to trans late the instruction increased comprehension of the subject because the cadre presents the training in fluent coherent manner without loss of continuity which often occurs when using interpreters standardized training mass training the trained indigenous cadre can cover multiple sites and serve as force multiplier the support of the hn governments legitimacy indirect application of the sfods capabilities weapons training for the csdf personnel is critical skill at arms decides the out come of battle and must be stressed of equal importance is the maintenance and care of weapons csdf members are taught basic rifle marksmanship with special emphasis on firing from fixed positions and during conditions of limited visibility also included in the marksmanship training program are target detection and fire discipline training ammunition is usually allocated to the csdf on the basis of specified number of rounds for each authorized weapon supporting hn government force or an established csdf logistic source provides the ammunition to support re fresher training weapons distribution is based on availability ratio of one weapon per every two to three csdf members is not uncommon in this situation csdf members make common use of the weapons each on different shift during night guard duty all village officials and the local csdf commander must be aware of the need to keep every weapon on duty all night every night csdf members are constantly reminded to protect their weapons at all costs csdf member must always have his weapon with him while on duty there are generally three options d9fm 31203 relative to weapons accountability these options have the following advantages and disadvantages first all csdf members turn in their weapons to the unit military commander for safekeeping after their tour of duty this action maintains strict accountability of weapons however it can hinder the implementation of the reaction plan during an emergency all csdf members must congregate in one location for weapons is sue also if the insurgents attack and capture the weapons storage site all weapons can be lost the second option is for each csdf member to take the weapon home after his tour of duty using this option the csdf members can immediately react in case of an attack the disadvantage of this option is that the weapon can be misused lost or captured by the insurgents the third option is combination of the first two given number of weapons are kept ready at the csdf command post to supply the reaction element while the extra weapons are issued to key csdf leaders and members living on the outskirts of the village the situation will dictate which option is the most applicable csdf personnel must receive training in human rights legal restrictions andor authorities and the law of land warfare hn officials preferably representatives of the civilian government must give these classes in addition the csdf element must receive military training in weapons basic and defensive tactics and techniques communications first aid and intelligence weapons training includes assembly disassembly and maintenance principles of marksmanship zero and familiarization firing and firing techniques during peri ods of limited visibility basic tactics and techniques subjects include individual movement techniques and two and threeman patrols within village other subjects are squad and fire team tactics and control of rate and distribution of fire csdf members also get training in the use of cover concealment and camouflage subjects covered in defensive tactics and techniques include preparing and occu pying lps and ops setting ambushes and organizing and emplacing obstacles and booby traps csdf training also includes guarding of fixed installations and constructing bunkers and fighting positions procedures for reacting to an insur gent attack are drilled to perfection in communications csdf members get training in radio procedures operation and maintenance and opsec first aid training includes personal hygiene preventive medicine first aid proce dures and sanitation for successful intelligence training csdf members must understand the need to report intelligence information and the channels through which it must pass train ing should also address debriefing sources d10fm 31203 communications physical visual audiblecommunications are extremely important to successful csdf operation the general requirements are that the radio communications equipment be reliable du rable simple to maintain and operate and easily employed communications methods used by the csdf element during normal or emergency operations are categorized as physical visual and audible the use of messengers is one of the oldest types of communication runners still perform this task in some primitive societies and in all societies when other means fail messengers can be used to communicate between fighting positions with other villages or with nearby security forces outposts during emergencies this type of communications transmits messages as well as alarms some of the methods used are smoke signals flags flares and flashing lights the visual sys tem uses prearranged signals so that the person receiving the signal can under stand the message this method is also used for alarms and depends on prearranged signals it uses such signals as gun shots whistles sirens gongs bells and drums the security forces continuously monitor the csdf communications net to speed the reaction of reinforcements if the csdf comes under attack or discovers ongo ing insurgent activity csdf net receives separate primary and alternate frequen cies to avoid confusion or preempting by other units radio contacts are made on scheduled basis with at least one contact daily it may be necessary to increase the frequency of contacts as the program develops critical and emergency in formation is transmitted anytime during emergencies and where available tele phones can serve as an alternate means of communication the reaction force must be able to enter the csdfs net and link up under fire particularly at night this ac tion requires detailed and continuous coordination outlying elements may require retransmission capability to communicate with hn security forces care should be taken when setting up such system to mini mize the degeneration that can occur by relaying messages from one operator to an other electronic retransmission equipment can be emplaced and camouflaged however it can also be easily located with radio directionfinding by sophisti cated guerrilla force intelligence the most important consideration for the csdf intelligence effort is that of detect ing who the insurgents and their supporters are after the penetration and compro mise of the insurgent infrastructure by informers it loses much of its effectiveness rewards and other types of incentives are offered to people reporting information information must be given voluntarily for it to be effective the entire populace d11fm 31203 must practice intelligence collection the armed defender the children in the vil lages the women in the marketplaces and the farmers in the fields they are the eyes and ears of the csdf intelligence effort they must be encouraged to report all they see and hear the csdf relies on the cooperation of the local populace for obtaining timely intelligence information the csdf must investigate all informa tion regardless of how insignificant it may appear they must report this informa tion in timely manner to the hn armed forces through an established information reporting channel the csdf is an excellent source of information because its members come from the general population of the villages and towns there will be times when the csdf member will be the source of information himself for example direct ob servation of an insurgent unit usually however csdf member may receive in formation from another village resident who often provides it during casual conversation csdf members are in good position to receive such information because of their status as members of the community they prefer to be neighbors first and csdf members second the local csdf commander notifies the au thorities of sources within the village who provide good information on regular basis his purpose is to enroll the sources as regular informants and ensure they are handled by professional intelligence agency other potential sources can include evacuees or dcs leaders of fraternal civic religious or patriotic organizations market vendors pharmacists traveling salesmen and truck and bus drivers the csdf intelligence role is primarily one of information reporting not active collection while each csdf member is expected to report all information that be comes available to him the csdf is not an intelligence collection organization csdf units will not be given specific information collection tasks except in spe cial circumstances csdf intelligence reporting should not include surveillance and clandestine intelligence gathering informant handling or requests to village residents to carry out intelligence gathering tasks the csdf can assist the police force in prc csdf members can learn about the control of foodstuffs clothing medical supplies and related items that may be used to support insurgent activities they can be on the alert for the sale of certain items or products in large quantities antibiotics and antiparasitic medication by pharmacist which could indicate the presence of insurgents or their collaborators they are taught that an information collection system using direct telephone hot line linking certain vendors pharmacists grocers and shoe store personnel to the security forces s2 could serve as means of gathering immediate information on possible insurgent logistic activities csdf members receive training from security force members or the police in the following areas obligation to report the csdf members must understand the need to report in telligence information and the channels through which it must pass proper debriefing of source this training concentrates on thorough debrief ing of source to gather all the information known to the source d12fm 31203 information reporting the trainers emphasize reporting as opposed to formal collection they also warn against overzealous debriefing of sources because it might discourage them from future disclosures of information the close relationship that csdf personnel establish with the local civilian popu lace and officials places them in favorable positions to collect information how ever csdf personnel must be extremely careful not to sacrifice their credibility and jeopardize their ability to accomplish their mission by overemphasizing their information collection efforts psychological operations psyop personnel or psyoptrained sfod members make cooperation between the local populace and the hn military easier when qualified or capable hn per sonnel are available us personnel work through them csdf elements need training on the use of psyop to inform the populace of the benefits they will rive by cooperating with them psyop themes must adhere to national andor the ater themes to present unified policy it is critical that psyop first be directed at the local populace to end their support of the insurgents and to gain their accep tance and cooperation for the csdf program civic action projects can be described as psyop intended to gain support of the cal target populace ideally the people themselves must conduct these civic ac tion projects emphasis is on those programs required to fulfill the basic needs of the people these are shortrange projects modest in scope and easily attainable the people must be incorporated into the selection planning and execution of these projects to magnify the effects of the effort hn military and civilian agencies can provide technical expertise and aid to the people so they can acquire building materials and funds for these construction projects communal services such as fresh running water or wells health clinics schools and town activity halls can also be established csdf projects should be tied in with civic action projects to increase the effects of civic action projects within the ao people working on civic action projects that improve their economic and physical environment make good recruits for the csdf when the insurgents threaten their hard work toward com munity improvement workers are usually willing to take up arms to protect their sweat equity the intent of these programs is not to replace or conflict with the hn ca programs but to supplement and complement them the active popular support and defense of governmentsponsored civic action projects equals acceptance of the governments legitimacy and effectively sepa rates guerrillas from the people prc measures are more acceptable to the popu lace when csdf personnel conduct them since they are locals and recognized as neighbors the csdf members need to emphasize the advantages of the commu nity protection controls ultimately to succeed the csdf effort requires the sup port of the populace more than populace control antagonistic attitudes toward the populace do little to enhance the program human rights training and close supervision are extremely important for the csdf since the negative psychological effects of misbehavior can be devastating if the d13fm 31203 populace perceives csdfs as death squads or bullies all government legitimacy can be lost and the csdf program as well as the overall fid andor idad cam paign could be badly damaged medical programs the hn civilian agencies and the sfod start the medical program as soon as pos sible since it is the most effective of all the hearts and minds civic action pro grams the socioeconomic scale of the people determines their needs and is the starting point in introducing medical program to an area the sf medic advises the sfod commander of all medical and sanitary matters relative to the csdf program the needs of the populace are the basis for develop ing the medical program to improve their living conditions the sfod can contribute significantly to the hn rural health efforts by coordinat ing with other us agencies for the establishment of medcap in their ao the us forces must organize sick calls and dispensary services for the local civilian populace the most effective effort is one that trains indigenous assets in basic health care procedures health care projects must be longrange and not character ized by quickfix solutions the csdf program should receive medical support in immunizations personal hygiene preventive medicine first aid and sanitation medical program is vital to the csdf program it signifies to the armed defender that he will be taken care of if he becomes casualty it is the sf medic who through individual effort makes the medical program success csdf logistic support established administrative and logistic channels normally provide logistic support to the csdf the csdf normally receives weapons the hn armed forces longer need that can be supported logistically additional weapons come from other sources as they become available the following criteria will be used in the issue of weapons the csdf must have been trained in the use of weapons and the hn authorities must have approved plan for the defense of the village the village administration must have agreed to accept responsibility for the weapons and the local political authorities have agreed the csdf is competent to maintain control and accountability the village population has in the opinion of the local government representa tive demonstrated commitment to the hn government and to the defense of the village the number of weapons issued to the csdf will be kept to minimum consistent with the villages population and security conditions in the area the csdf d14fm 31203 receives weapons to meet the specific needs of the site rather than specified num ber of weapons for each site for the sake of simplicity however it may be more practical to issue one simple standard weapon and equipment packet for each site common use of individual weapons by csdf members will be required to keep the number of required weapons to minimum unserviceable weapons are returned through channels to maintenance facilities established logistic channels supply all materials for the maintenance of weapons cleaning patches lubricating oils cleaning rods in response to requests from the local csdf commander cleaning rods are issued on the basis of at least one per every ten weapons defense plan for csdf site mission enemy terrain troops time available civiliansduring the initial planning of the defense the csdf commander must use the key word metttc the mission is usually to use defensive rings to protect the populace against the insurgents the number of defensive rings depends on the particular site and situation the csdf commander identifies insurgent units operating in the area he tries to determine the type and size of the units the enemys tactics weapons equip ment and probable collaborators and the peoples attitude toward the insurgents the csdf commander can use the ocoka acronym bservation and fields of fire over and concealment bstacles ey terrain and venues of approach toc k plan for the defense of his site the csdf commander must consider available equipment the csdfs reaction time reaction forces communication assets organization of his troops and medi cal support if available this factor is critical since the villagers must be ready to respond to an insurgent attack with little or warning the csdf commander also must consider nonbelligerent third parties in the vil lage such as dcs personnel of international businesses and relief organizations the media and so on every csdf commander must prepare csdf site overlay that shows as mini mum the location of his command post churches or shrines health clinics or dispensaries d15fm 31203 telephone and telegraph exchanges government offices police stations and army outposts defensive positions primary alternate and supplementary sectors of fire primary and secondary key weapons lps and ops command posts the reserve force rally points inside and outside landing zones evacuation points for civilians avenues of approach preplotted targets with coordinates if fire support direct or indirect is availablekey terrain with corrdinates the patrol overlay must depict the following primary secondary and alternate routes location of the patrol leader fields of fire for every position rally points withdrawal routes evacuation routes for the wounded the defense of csdf site should include prepared fighting positions providing adequate cover 360degree security one or more defensive rings protective obstacles covered by fire withdrawal routes with rally points mutually supported positions with interlocking fields of fire an aid station extensive patrolling operations near the site during periods of limited visibility lps and ops and command posts with preplanned withdrawal routes the csdf commander uses the key word ocoka not only while planning the towns or villages overall defense but also during the selection and preparation of each individual or group of fighting positions observation and the csdf commander must determine where to place his weapons to cover the fields of fire whole perimeter observation is necessary to adjust indirect fire when available and to get accurate direct fire against the insurgents messengers can relay in formation from position to position personnel improve the fields of fire by cut ting away undergrowth weeds and limbs they only cut the weeds that obstruct d16cover and concealment obstacles key terrain avenues of approachfm 31203 the view they cover all cuts on trees and bushes forward of their positions with mud or dirt and remove all debris or use it for concealment sector sketches must include primary and secondary sectors of fire the fields of fire must be longer than hand grenade range the sketch must include the distance between positions and also indicate if the positions to the left or right are visible one way or an other the csdf must maintain the whole area under observation the fighting positions must provide protection from direct frontal smallarms fire by natural or manmade frontal parapet high and thick enough to protect the oc cupants while they man their weapons and from the effects of indirect fire the positions must not be easily detected from the front they need to blend with the surroundings well enough that the enemy approaching from the front cannot tect them in preparing fighting positions to defend csdf site cover is more im portant than concealment because most fighting positions will be of permanent nature and the insurgents will probably know their locations their locations must not cause the destruction of the town or interrupt the daily activities of the people critical point when considering the location of the positions in the in ner perimeter the key point to remember is never construct fighting position without adequate cover natural and manmade obstacles stop impede or divert the insurgents move ment examples of obstacles are streams fences dense vegetation felled trees the csdf unit always covers obstacles with fire key terrain is any feature or area that when controlled offers marked tactical ad vantage key terrain offers good cover and concealment and observation and fields of fire the key terrain roads trails hilltops and bridges in front of the positions must be covered with fire and included preplotted in the fire support plan these are areas in which projected enemy activity is likely to occur and dictate the routes an attacking force must take to its objective the local commander must analyze the avenues of approach to the csdf site available to the insurgents this analysis is the basis for positioning troops and weapons reaction scenario for csdf site the csdf element must adopt defensive concept based on the members skill levels and available assets in case of an insurgent attack the csdf element must take three basic actions it warns and mobilizes the village members and friendly forces it notifies the security forces and it takes defensive measures anyone from village resident to an lp or op can detect and give warning of the presence of insurgents near the village this information must be passed to the vil lage residents who then take up concealed positions and prepare for passive resis tance if the insurgents succeed in entering the village d17fm 31203 the csdf will notify friendly forces of the insurgents presence by any avail able means radio messengers gongs or rifle shots the csdf requests tacti cal support from friendly units as soon as possible using the available communica tion assets in the meantime the csdf members collect their weapons and ammunition from their safekeeping places and take up defensive positions outer ring iaw the tablished defense plan as the insurgents approach the csdf harasses and snipes at them enemy attrition should be constant if the insurgents break through the defenders retreat to the inner defensive perimeter here they continue defending the site and wait for the hn reaction force to arrive field inspection guide the sfod inspects the areas addressed in the following paragraphs when inspect ing csdf site leadership the sfod notes whether the local csdf commander or team leaders are exerting their authority and actually guiding the group or whether they are incapable or willing to do so the sfod makes sure the leaders understand the nature and ex tent of their authority and responsibilities the sfod also makes sure the leaders understand they are accountable for the conduct of their groups or teams the sfod finds out whether the leaders actually know what to do and whether they have plan or schedule for accomplishing their mission if leader is evidently in competent plans are made to replace him equipment the sfod has all csdf members or as many as possible fall out with all their weapons and equipment and inspects them as it would military unit the sfod checks for missing or unserviceable items the sfod checks magazines for dirt and weak springs from having been kept loaded too long the sfod checks weapons for cleanliness the sfod reports to the responsible authorities any sing or unserviceable equipment including the name of the local leaders or com mander unit designation and the item so that replacement can be made promptly performance the sfod determines whether the leaders are actually performing their assigned tasks and doing good job the sfod also checks to see if the leaders are in volved in projects that are not planned or are waste of time after checking with the local commander the sfod personally observes unscheduled projects the leaders may be doing and why they are doing them villager cooperation the villagers must play large part in the program to aid their village the sfod asks the local commander to what extent the villagers are taking part in the pro gram the sfod checks whether they have been helpful uncooperative or apa thetic the villagers will have to expend some time on their own business especially during planting or harvesting season villagers should not have to pro vide tools the hn government should provide them the sfod asks some of the d18fm 31203 villagers what they think about the work the local commander and the leaders are doing and how they have acted since arriving at the village intelligence one of the local commanders tasks is to get information from the villagers on the insurgent infrastructure supporters or relatives in the village the csdf com mander must first win the villagers confidence before he gets information from them the sfod asks the csdf commander whether he has collected any in formation from the villagers and whether he has attempted to do so if not the sfod explains this task to him and directs him to carry it out if he has any in formation to report the sfod advises him how to proceed with the parties in volved and report the information to the proper authorities security the sfod checks whether the site is secure and has good fighting positions and fields of fire the sfod checks the patrol procedures and routes the position of sentries and the overall defensive plan the sfod also checks whether the csdf commander knows what other forces will be able to help him the sfod checks the condition of the groups radios whether needed antennas are erected and whether the site can communicate with the nearest security forces garrison or unit the sfod checks on alternate communication methods tele phone messenger the sfod also checks on other communication and signal methods smoke ground panels the sfod notes the amount and type of radio

mission of the hn and sfod within an ao and for force protection they are normally established with hn security forces or indigenous personnel of selected geographic area the sfod trains and equips these personnel to conduct military operations although it may take 6 to 9 months to establish base camp actual construction of major base camp facilities is usually completed within 60 to 90 days after the sfods arrival into selected area improvements however continue throughout the life of the base camp in addition to its mission of advising and helping hn personnel the sfod must be aware of political and geographic characteristics of particular area surveil ling providing buffer to enemy infiltration and advising local government offi cials are typical sfod functions that may require emphasis the camps exact configuration and facilities depend on the mission requirements and the metttc factors facilities to consider may include dzs lzs ranges and training areas before reaching the decision to establish base camp in particular area the sfod must consider the following factors extent of enemy activity in the area topography availability of supplies availability of air support population resources political implications f1fm 31203 of the above factors the extent of enemy activity in the area and topography are normally the most critical the political implications however also need careful consideration and the use of ca and psyop must be stressed to minimize any negative effects caused by the construction of the camp the sfods mission its scope and the degree of available indigenous support as indicated by intelligence reports will be determining factors in establishing abase camp opening phases from beginning to end the steps in opening base camp can usually be classified into the planning construction and opening phases phase i planning during this phase the group staff performs the functions addressed below group s2 the s1 ensures personnel assets are

planning and coordinating assistance to prepare the sfod for conducting or participating in ca activities in the ao type i camp construction sequence possible construction sequence for hy pothetical type i camp is at figure f2 the sfod may have to vary add to or shorten the sequence to suit the particular circumstances on arrival the immediate requirement is to set up defenses communications with base and first aid facili ties sanitary waste disposal facilities and water supply are next in order of ur gency in most areas where sf operate digestive and other illnesses are endemic much of the trouble stems from the unsanitary practices of the native populace maintaining healthy environment can contribute to the vitality and military effec tiveness of the personnel involved both native and sf in the case of camp set up in previously uninhabited location the occupants must follow sanitary practices from the beginning since it is difficult to sanitize polluted area equipment requirements for certain tasks are shown in figure f3 page f8 they are based on the sf base camp needs and the tentative base camp construction quence in figure f2 earthmoving equipment is used to quickly and efficiently clear and grub trees and brush level areas for buildings build airstrips and dig trenches and holes for derground bunkers crawler tractors with dozer andor frontend loader attach ments are designed for this task small maneuverable tractors with frontend loaders can also be very effective in constructing base camps when used with chain saws and rototillers the proposed campsite can be cleared with explosives chain saws brush cutters and tractors equipped with sickle bars to remove obstructions trees underbrush gasolinepowered capstan can help remove the felled obstructions one way to f6fm 31203 prevent regrowth of underbrush after clearing the site is to cover the ground with opaque plastic like the black polyethylene plastic farmers use some experimental work will be needed to determine the best material and gauge and to find way to anchor the plastic so that it will not be blown away this method of preventing re growth should be particularly effective in mined areas under barbed wire or other areas inconvenient to keep clear by any other means an adequate water supply the insurgents cannot readily get to and poison is essen tial to the maintenance of the camp the builders can use small portable gasoline powered drills to drill water wells and boreholes for explosive excavation piping systems may be needed for water distribution waste collection surface and rainwater drainage and petroleum oil and lubricants pol handling in gen eral plastic pipes polyvinyl chloride pvc are light tough easy to install and corrosionresistant their lightness and ease of handling allow for rapid lowcost installation the use of adhesives to join pipe sections is not recommended when building sf base camps where the work is done by native personnel because of the need for certain level of technical skill joints must be clean and must not be f7fm 31203 f8fm 31203 disturbed while the adhesive is setting for these reasons the use of mechanically sealed piping is preferred mechanical joints are available they allow for some relative longitudinal movement to compensate for thermal expansion and contrac tion of the pipe and settling of the soil in which it is laid desirable design for an sf base camp structure or building has as few different independent parts as possible such design simplifies onsite assembly and re duces the chance that large quantity of delivered material could be lost to enemy action or few major components stolen underground and surface structures and food preparation facilities are discussed in the following paragraphs the conex container has demonstrated its effectiveness in the construction of subsurface and hardened surface fighting camp facilities it can support heavy static overburdens and withstand the blast resulting from direct hit by an 81mm mortar round it provides ventilation plus adequate drainage through its floor sign it can provide single entrance in the floor of hardened surface facility or in wall for subsurface facility it provides firing slits two or more can be com bined into structure by removing the facing walls general criteria apply when building surface structures for base camp in tropi cal environment the building should be about 6 meters wide with 3 to 6meter long modules that can be joined to make shelter 9 to 18 meters long they must have floors to minimize dust rodent and drainage problems storage buildings must be lockable to discourage pilferage the structure should be well ventilated or effectively airconditioned considerable economy of time and personnel can be achieved in preparing food us ing modem equipment relatively small efficient installation can feed many people proper sanitary conditions and proper garbagehandling facilities are im portant to the general health and military efficiency of the camp completely pre fabricated foodpreparation facilities should be provided garbage grinders should be included to reduce the health and vermin hazard due to the temporary storage of garbage near foodpreparation areas phase iii opening this phase normally lasts more than 60 days dday to d60 at the end of this phase the camp is considered capable of accomplishing its assigned mission with supplementary forces or assistance by this date all nonorganic troops will have been withdrawn and all logistic support will come through normal channels on request basis the camp is now considered operational staff re sponsibilities during this phase are addressed below group s2 he continues to monitor the personnel situation and provides replace ments

commander shifts emphasis from camp construction to expanding the operational capabilities he identifies problem areas and seeks assistance if neces sary he establishes an sop for the operation of the base camp by this time the sfod has been on site for 90 to 120 days and its members are familiar with the operational area and local personalities he develops routine for nonoperational activities and divides responsibilities among members of the sfod he lays the ground work for the next sfod f10fm 31203 the fighting camp at the beginning of the vietnam war sf had little or authority to choose the site of proposed base camp in south viemam as result of this policy many camps were poorly situated relative to terrain and available indigenous personnel the uprooting and relocation of indigenous people to establish camp proved ineffec tive due to the general discontent of the civilian irregular defense group cidg and subsequent high rates of desertion the fighting camp figure f4 is based on the concept of independent hardened mutually supported platoon positions surrounding hardened central control fa cility there are facilities at the campsite for the sf team and hn military orconcept and principles f11fm 31203 paramilitary forces the overall defensive posture of this camp is enhanced by continual aggressive offensive operations conducted by camp personnel in their tactical aos the fightingcamp concept embodies the principles of speed of installation austerity and defense in depth speed of installation the camp is completed in 60 to 90 days sooner if assisted by engineers reinforced with selected items of construction equipment depending on airstrip requirements its size is such that onethird of the assigned strength can defend it it follows standardized design austerity construction costs of the camp are held to minimum it has frills personnel use local materials whenever possible and the use of skilled labor is held to minimum defense in depth characteristics of defense in depth include the following ops and lps for early warning starts with local security andor camp defensive measures and final protective fires fpf alternate and supplementary positions used to provide depth to the battle area ability to limit and seal off penetrations types the fighting camps fall into three basic designs these designs are based on the aos ground water table gwt type i subsurface in those areas having low gwt all structures are in hard ened underground bunkers type ii surface the entire camp is on the surface in areas where the gwt is usu ally within 1 meter of the surface an earth berm mayor may not enclose the camp two construction variations of the surface fighting camp are standard and conex crewserved weapons positions ammunition bunkers and emergency medical and communications facilities are in hardened conex containers if available all other structures are wood frame all facilities to include living quarters are in hardened conex containers if available type iii floating each structure in the camp rests on the ground during the dry season and rises with the water during periods of flooding each floating base camp should have boat docking facilities and floating helipads that can support fully loaded utility helicopter common requirementsall three basic fighting camp designs have common facilities that are standard in camp construction each person has 2 by 3meter area of floor space for sleep ing quarters there is rule that personnel of the same mos do not live in the same billet ideally the sleeping quarters are in the various buildings so that an in dividuals billets are in or near the building in which he works cover that is high enough to protect sleeping personnel from an 81mm mortar burst at 15 meters f12fm 31203 surrounds all sleeping quarters overhead cover for sleeping quarters is desired but not required each sfod requires one bathhouse and one latrine in addition common facili ties include mess hall day room and office facilities supply facilities communications bunker its design must withstand direct fire from small arms and an 81mm burst 5 meters away dispensary this building must have waiting area an admission and disposi tion area for records and an examination area it must have minor surgery room with water supply sterilization area and secure drug and equipment room it must also have bed space for at least eight patients emergency medical burker this bunkers design criteria are those of the com munications bunker generator shed an opensided generator shed must

andor idad environment the majority of friendly casualties result from mines and booby traps mines and booby traps are an inexpensive expedient and relatively riskfree means the insurgents use to produce casualties deny terrain provide security to rear areas and base camps and channel delay and disrupt pur suing forces mines and booby traps have terrifying psychological effect on troops the insur gents goal is to make the friendly troops overly concerned about being maimed or killed by mine or booby trap to the detriment of their mission insurgent forces have developed high degree of expertise in the use of mines and booby traps in their own familiar environment employment techniques include using mines and booby traps in offensive and defensive tactics all available ma teriel manufactured or locally produced friendly or enemy is used to the best advantage insurgent mine warfare doctrine to the inexperienced observer most insurgent groups do not appear to have clearly defined mine warfare doctrine such an evaluation of insurgent capabilities is completely erroneous and leads to serious security and tactical errors insurgent groups have adapted the use of mines to the terrain and to their particular tactical operations h1fm 31203 the mine warfare problem faced by security forces is unique nuisance mining on massive scale is accomplished by ingenious capable personnel these personnel have detailed knowledge of the terrain and environment they also have the addi tional benefit of being able to move and operate in small groups at night with rela tive freedom most insurgent groups lack artillery and use mines in its place insurgent groups do not normally lay minefield as such and cover them with fire as gp force would instead they interdict locs and respond to security forces operations with quick and indiscriminate mining although they benefit directly by causing combat casualties and vehicle losses the insurgents consider the real benefit as psychological most insurgents doctrinal and training documents stress the use of pressuretype mines in the more isolated or less populated areas they prefer using command type mines in densely populated areas these documents stress that when using noncommanddetonated mines the insurgents use every means to inform the local populace on their location commensurate with security regulations in reality most insurgent groups suffer from various degrees of deficiency in their c2 systems their c2 does not permit them to verify that those elements at the op erational level strictly follow directives and orders in the case of the frente farabundo marti liberation nacional fmln in salvador the indi vidual that emplaces the mine is responsible for its recovery after the engagement there are problems with this concept the individual may be killed or the security forces may gain control of the area therefore the recovery of the mine is next to impossible vehicular traffic in most underdeveloped parts of the world is to large extent restricted to roads and trails road networks are not extensive and most roads will not support heavy traffic without constant maintenance bypassing disabled ve hicles or obstacles in the road is difficult and often impossible this situation allows for effective nuisance mining with relatively small investment of mate rial resources proper placement of one or two mines can disrupt an entire convoy immobilize administrative and patrol vehicles or trigger an ambush many anti tank or antipersonnel mines need not be and seldom are employed in one location few mines can effectively harass and slow vehicular traffic and tie down troops in periodic minesweeping operations likewise few carefully sited and em placed mines and booby traps can slow movement of foot elements such as patrols and sweeps types of mines antipersonnel mines present the major threat in fid andor idad environment this fact is due to the high proportion of dismounted operations and the influence of north vietnamese training tactics and doctrine on some insurgent groups par ticularly the fmln in salvador antipersonnel mines are either the blast or fragmentation types blasttype antipersonnel mine causes casualties through the direct blast effect of its explosive charge the mine is detonated in place and its destructive impact is h2fm 31203 primarily upward the radius of the blast depends on the amount and type of explo sive and the method of emplacement fragmentationtype antipersonnel mine has fragmenting material that sur rounds the explosive the force of the blast creates shrapnel from the fragmenting material and the high velocity shrapnel causes casualties there are two basic forms of fragmentation mines directional fragmentation mine is normally referred to as claymoretype mine the mines destructive capability is concentrated in specific direction an omnidirectional bounding fragmentation mine sprays fragments in circle it is normally detonated above the ground homemade antipersonnel mines are used extensively in salvador guatemala and malaysia eighty percent of all salvadoran armed forces casualties in 1986 were due to mines in 1987 soldiers wounded by mines and booby traps averaged 50 to 60 per month the important point to remember is that any homemade mine is the product of the resources available to the insurgent group therefore two antipersonnel mines may be the same in their configuration and materials insur gent groups depend to great extent on materials discarded or lost by security forces personnel the insurgents not only use weapons ammunition mines gre nades and demolitions for their original purpose but also in preparing expedient mines and booby traps the antitank and antivehicular mines used by insurgents vary considerably they may use any encased explosive charge of adequate size explosive charges range from crude locally produced items to artillery shells captured us mines and soviet and chinese communist mines insurgents have shown considerable inge nuity in fabricating simple yet effective mines the insurgent is known to reuse extracted bulk explosive from captured duds and ordnance due to the minute amounts of metals used the most difficult antitank and antivehicular mines to tect are blast mines with electrical firing devices such devices are usually powered by common flashlight batteries mine components basic mine consists of an outer casing and three major parts that cause the mine to explode triggering device also called fuse actuator or firing device detonator which might include booster and the main explosive charge triggering devices devices used to trigger mines are typically electrical mechanical or chemical an electrical triggering device is some form of switch that closes an electric circuit attached to blasting cap mechanical device is firing pin released to strike detonator chemical device is vial of chemical compound that when broken or pulled reacts with another substance to generate heat which ignites the deto nator most of the triggering devices used by insurgents fit into one of these groups pressure activates some of the devices an individual stepping on the vice closes the switch or breaks chemical vial pulling activates other devices h3fm 31203 an individual walking into trip wire the release of pressure or tension acti vates other devices detonating devices every mine requires device to detonate the main explosive the detonating vice is normally the most sensitive part of the mine it amplifies and transfers its initiating explosive force to the main explosive charge commonly used detonat ing devices in mines are electric blasting caps percussion caps and nonelectric blasting caps electric blasting caps homemade mines employed in central america typically contain commercial electric blasting cap the cap detonates when power from an electrical source battery or hand generator reaches the electric blasting cap the most common power supply used in central america is the commercial flashlight battery percussion caps manufactured mines frequently use percussion caps when the springloaded striker firing pin is released it moves forward and strikes the per cussion cap to initiate the firing chain nonelectric blasting caps other types of triggering devices are based on friction or chemical reaction for initiation each of these devices generates heat that initi ates nonelectric blasting cap chargemain explosive many types of explosives are used as the main charge of mine explosives fall into two groups manufactured and homemade manufactured explosives can tain trinitrotoluene tnt dynamite or composition 4 demolition block c4 tnt also called trotyl or tolite ranges from light grey to dark yellow dynamite is used in l2pound paperwrapped sticks c4 is white with puttylike consis tency sometimes homemade mine will contain salvaged explosive manufac tured from military ordnance homemade mines usually have homemade explosive as the main charge the most common homemade explosive is alumi nized ammonium nitrate silver dust casing material the manufactured mines have metal or plastic outer casing some mines have wood or cardboard casings the casings of homemade mines can be readily avail able materials metal pipes metal cans sheet metal pvc pipe wood cardboard boxes cloth bags use of mines the following paragraphs discuss the use of antipersonnel mines antitank and antivehicular mines water mines and mines against helicopters antipersonnel mines although antitank mines present hazard to vehicles on roads and trails antiper sonnel mines present greater hazard to foot troops in fid andor idad envi ronment since most operations are conducted on foot the nature of the terrain h4fm 31203 and the tactics of the war provide almost unlimited techniques and chances for in surgents to use antipersonnel mines insurgents can be expected to use antipersonnel mines anywhere troops might walk area can be assumed to be clear simply because it had been clear at some previous time some of the most likely places of use are along trails in high grass in front of defensive positions and in and around likely helicopter landing sites other places are near shaded areas where troops may congregate near fruit trees on bridges at fording sites over streams and in drainage ditches other locations are along roads at possible ambush sites that appear to be the easy way through dense vegetation near cave and tunnel entrances near caches in and around vil lages and on fence lines and gates as rule friendly troops can suspect the min ing of choke points of any terrain feature that channels movement the ambush is favorite tactic of most insurgent groups they effectively use both antitank and antipersonnel mines for this purpose they use antitank mines to trig ger an ambush by stopping or disrupting convoy as troops deploy off the road to attack the ambush force they set off antipersonnel mines adding to the confu sion the insurgents use trip wire and commandinitiated mines in most situa tions they do not use many mines few wellplaced mines supplement an equally wellplanned and placed ambush the insurgents can achieve the intended result with minimum risk materiel and effort widely used antipersonnel mine by insurgents against friendly troops is the claymore mine and its many variations his mine will produce casualties at 200 meters among personnel who lack some kind of protection such as body armor in surgents usually place it on flat or elevated ground having an unobstructed field of vision to the target area they frequently hang or place the mine against wall tree road embankment or some other obstruction in most cases it is command detonated by electrical means they bury the detonation wires deeply under firm packed earth the insurgent ambush element sometimes two men can be 300 ters from the ambush site making it very profitable and lowrisk operation antitank and antivehicular minesthe placement of antitank and antivehicular mines varies depending on the type of road or trail major types are dirt and paved roads one technique insurgents use is to dig up one or more sections of dirt road and leave after friendly forces fill in the dugup sections the insurgents return and mine the filledin sections the insurgents may dig many holes in dirt road but only mine few in addition they often bury metal fragments and objects in the re paired holes craters or trenches to further confuse minesweeping efforts variation of this technique is to bury many randomly spaced groups of metal fragments in the road such action requires extensive probe operations and may lead to complacency in minesweeping teams at later time the insurgents either bury amine under previously placed metal fragments or insert mine into the ran dom pattern hoping it will pass as fragments in another related technique the insurgents dig holes at night in compacted roads and fill the holes with loose dirt minesweeping teams notice the loose dirt but on h5fm 31203 checking find nothing after the team moves down the road the insurgents quickly install the mine in the hole minesweeping teams must carry can of used oil to cover holes containing loose dirt if the insurgents disturb the earth it will be obvious to the team on its return trip likely sites for mines with pressurefiring system include road junctions by passes wheel tracks and bridge approaches other likely sites are rough or newly repaired roads culverts and narrow roads between swamps and mountains it is not uncommon to find mines placed in the corners of junctions where vehicle is likely to cut the corner frequently some insurgent groups have shown tendency to mine the wheel tracks ruts or depression made by traffic on dirt roads another tendency often used with the above is to use pressureactivated electric road mines timed to explode under the belly of the vehicle insurgents use dud captured or discarded munitions to include artillery and mor tar ammunition bombs and locally manufactured items for instance insurgents have been known to bury electrically or pressuredetonated 105mm rounds in the ground at about 75 cm most often they have buried pressureactuated mortar shells on roadways or in road shoulders with the nose pointing upward they usu ally bury the actuator 25 to 127 cm under the road surface the use of mines on hard surface roads presents problems not found in dirt roads this fact does not deter the insurgents from effectively mining paved roads and eliminating most evidence of mining activity one technique they use is to smear the road with mud in many places day after day but place mines after estab lishing familiarity with the condition they lay mines in some mudsmeared sec tions another technique is to remove an asphalt patch and place one or more mines they then resurface the hole with the piece of asphalt they removed intact from the road surface they reposition the asphalt and pour sand into the cracks if the asphalt section crumbles they position apiece of board covered with loose as phalt they cover hastily emplaced mines with straw grass dung or other matter found on the road water mines the insurgents water mining efforts normally include harassment and interdic tion of both friendly patrol and support craft and land and water supply routes by destroying bridges and surface crafts they attack moving surface craft moored surface craft and bridges they use electrically actuated commanddetonated bottom or moored mines for most attacks on moving surface crafts swimmers at tack moored surface craft and bridges by placing timedelayed or command detonated water mines the insurgents transport the moored bottom or floating mine to the proposed tar get position and plant it on the bottom or lash it to an anchor at least three times the mines weight they attach floating marker that rides on the surface preferably small item peculiar to normal floating debris in the area for daytime detonation or clear receptacle containing fireflies or luminous material for night detonation if they do not use floating marker they place guide stake on the opposite bank h6fm 31203 if using floating marker they usually detonate the mine when the target is within 3 meters of the float if they do not use floating marker they detonate the mine when the target passes between the detonating point and known mark on the op posite bank floating mines may be commanddetonated by using firing wire from the mine to the firing position the insurgents usually place weights on it every 2 to 3 meters not only to keep it on the bottom but also to counter minesweeping operations by friendly forces swimmers can also bury the detonating wire in mud if time and bottom conditions permit the firing mechanisms consist of electric blasting caps inserted into booster or the main charge they attach the electric wire to battery pack or handheld generator where the depth of the water remains at 2 to 3 meters the insurgents may use bottom mine however the situation may require moored floating mine when the range of the tide or the draft of the target ships dictates changing the depth of the mine the insurgents have two options they can send out swimmer to adjust the mine as necessary or they can rig mobile mine they make the mine ver tically mobile by running line from the mine through pulley on the anchor and then to the bank by pulling or slackening this line from the bank they can lower or raise the mine this type of mine is especially susceptible to minesweep ing operations if due to the waterways extreme width the insurgents want to move the mine lat erally to detonate it successfully under target they use the following technique drive an anchoring stake into the bank beneath the waterline on both sides of the waterway stretch heavy line taut below the water surface between the two stakes suspend wire beneath the line on pulley that rides freely over the line by using guy line from the mine to man on each bank the mine can traverse the width of the waterway viet cong minings series of successful minings carried out by the viet cong insurgents on the cua viet river quang tri province demonstrated their resourcefulness in countering minesweeping tactics initially chaindragging sweeps took place morning and evening after several successful mining attacks it was apparent that they laid the mines after the minesweepers passed then the boats using the river formed into convoys and transited the river with minesweepers 914 meters ahead oft he convoy nevertheless boats of the convoy were success fully mined in midchannel indicating that the mines were again laid after the minesweeper had passed possibly by using sampans several sampans were observed crossing or otherwise using the channel between the mine sweepers and the convoy the convoys were then organized so that the mine sweepers worked immediately ahead of the convoy one convoy successfully passed the next convoy had its minesweepers mined and ambushed close to the river banks the command or timedelaydetonated mines are used against anchored ships and usually emplaced by threeman team the team transports the mine downstream and attaches the line with hook on its end to the target vessels anchor chain the h7fm 31203 length of the line is such that when the mine floats with the current it will stop at point alongside or under the engine compartment the insurgents usually buoy the mines with enough pneumatic rubber tubes to maintain desired depth if the mine is to be detonated by timing device the previous action completes the em placement if it is to be commanddetonated the swimmers string the firing wire from the mine and detonate it as soon as they are clear of the ship and in safe posi tion they then reel in the command wire and withdraw if there is heavy boat traf fic near the anchorage they may transport the mine to the target by boat they transport it by sliding the mine under the boats keel and move as close to the target vessels anchor chain as is necessary to attach the hook after attaching the hook they cut the mine free from the boat and allow it to float with the current to the sired position under the target another mining technique for an anchored ship is to attach the mine directly to the target magnetic mines with antihandling devices are excellent for this purpose the above techniques are representative but by means exclusive the size of the mine target location security measures time of day weather avenues of approach and escape and insurgents daring and courage are factors that can and do result in technique variations the insurgents sometimes use sympathizers in the area to provide some of the re quired intelligence and to help with the work and afteraction escape after com pleting the reconnaissance and preparation they place and detonate the mine as quickly as possible documents captured from viet cong insurgents stated that their sappers could plant 50kilogram commanddetonated water mines in about 10 minutes thus the ideal insurgent tactic was to wait until just before the target vessels arrival before laying the mine such an action allowed little or time for minesweeping tactics used against moored ships and rivercraft depend on the location of the tar get to include its proximity to other anchored ships and whether it is moored to pier visibility of the water light data tides speed of the current boat traffic and security measures mines against helicoptersthe insurgents normally confine their mining activities against airmobile opera tions and helicopters to potential lzs they use obstacles and mines to restrict po tential lzs to those where they have defensive advantage this advantage does not mean however that they would not use obstacles on lzs they decided to fend the following paragraphs describe some techniques insurgents have used against helicopters in the past grenades wrapped with puffed safety pins in paper and placed in the lz as the helicopter lands the prop wash forces the paper into the air releasing the pres sure on the safety lever and setting the grenades off in variation of this technique they place pieces of sheet metal in the lz the prop wash from the landing helicop ter presses the sheet metal down exploding mines placed beneath it hardwood or bamboo poles placed 2 to 6 meters high in the lz the poles pierce the skin of the helicopters and sometimes disable them they also emplace h8fm 31203 punji stakes pointed bamboo or hardwood stakes placed on the ground and cam ouflaged in lzs to obstruct helicopters and troops disembarkation communication wire strung across the lz the pilots have very difficult time seeing the wire which can down helicopters in addition the insurgents may rig grenades to the communication wire in such way that they are activated by the movement of the wire as the helicopter strikes it booby traps hand grenades multiple highway obstacles boobytrapped cachesa booby trap is an explosive or nonexplosive trap cunningly contrived to be acti vated by an unsuspecting person who disturbs an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act the number and types of booby traps that insur gents may use are almost limitless many explosive booby traps have been inge niously employed against security forces and their continued use can be expected the important lesson to learn is that many insurgent groups make extensive use of booby traps cleverly improvised with all types of materials booby traps can have psychological effect much greater than the weight of num bers would indicate used discriminately in many carefully selected applications they demand the individual soldiers constant attention and alertness they can create state of fear in the inexperienced and untrained soldier that is both debili tating and demoralizing friendly troops can expect to find booby traps in the same areas in which the insurgents regularly use antipersonnel mines although hand grenades are designed as weapons to be thrown in either defen sive or offensive role insurgent forces make even wider use of them as booby trap devices insurgents use homemade hand grenades extensively since they are nor mally more readily available however insurgents appear to prefer manufactured grenades the insurgents often remove the delay element from the grenade fuse so that the booby trap detonates instantly the insurgents take advantage of the normal soldiers dislike of repetitious mo notonous tasks in their boobytrapping efforts for example the insurgents may construct and position series of two or more highway obstacles that will proba bly require one crew or team to move the entire series they then construct booby trap in one of the obstacles that will be moved later in the clearing opera tion the obstacle will be similar in construction to further associate it with its mined predecessors only conscientious careful mine search of each obstacle will prevent casualties when clearing road obstacles some insurgent groups frequently place booby traps in caches that they anticipate will be discovered typical booby trap in this instance is grenade with an instantaneous fuse and its safety pin removed they hide this grenade under weighty material to keep the safety lever depressed when searchers remove the material above the grenade it frees the safety lever and the grenade detonates h9fm 31203 cache searches should be conducted using one man at time to preclude multiple casualties treemounted booby trapsthe insurgents make excellent use of mortar and artillery rounds in treemounted booby traps they suspend and camouflage them in trees and commanddetonate them as friendly forces move under them this technique is particularly effective against troops who do not habitually look overhead booby trap disquised as minethe insurgents can deliberately disguise hand grenade with pin removed as mine they bury it under enough scrap metal to register on the mine detector they pack enough dirt to hold the safety lever over the scrap metal the mine tector team detects the scrap metal as soldier probes for the mine he loosens and removes enough dirt to release the handle and detonate the grenade punji stakes are designed to injure or kill personnel who step or fall on them the insurgents often treat the pointed ends with human excrement or poison so that the wounds become infected and cause death the insurgents often use them on pro spective lzs to wound personnel as they jump from helicopter to the ground they often emplace them on the banks of gullies and streams where friendly troops might jump from one bank to the other they also use them along roads and trails at entrances to villages and at ambush sitespunji stakes explosive booby trapsinsurgents use explosive booby traps in all phases of their operations simplicity and ingenuity best describe many of the techniques used by various insurgent groups they exploit any chance to trap the unwary inexperienced and even care less opponent the simplest form of boobytrapping used by the insurgents is either pull or pres sure release device attached to an antitank mine or other charge used as mine this technique is different from the us doctrine of placing antihandling vices in antitank mines the explosive charges in booby traps are usually the same as those used in mines booby traps use standard antitank and antipersonnel mines hand grenades mortar and artillery projectiles and miscellaneous improvised explosive charges except for special applications such as terrorist activities the fuses and firing vices used in booby traps are similar to those used in mines booby traps and other explosive devices used in terrorist activities often employ more sophisticated fir ing systems the insurgents often boobytrap areas in and around villages in the past they have boobytrapped gates fences hedges trails paths shrines wells dead bodies and abandoned supplies and equipment supply areas from which insurgents have been forced to withdraw are almost cer tain to be boobytrapped friendly troops must approach weapons ammunition clothing and food supplies with caution h10fm 31203 in addition to placing antipersonnel mines near cave and tunnel complexes they also boobytrap the entrances themselves it can be fatal to open and enter these trances hastily some insurgent groups like to use booby traps or mines in pairs often after the first explosion the troops will concentrate on helping the wounded thus the troops become lucrative target for second attack especially if the insurgents can commanddetonate the mine insurgents mine or boobytrap route or trail that patrol used to leave its base of operations patrols or similar groups do not return along the same route by which they left their base nonexplosive booby traps have the same purpose as antipersonnel mines and ex plosive booby traps inflict personnel casualties and hinder troop progress insur gents use these booby traps far less frequently than explosive booby trapsnonexplosive booby traps nearly all nonexplosive traps are improvised from locally available materials and take advantage of natural camouflage bamboo which is readily available in many areas of the world is used in the construction of many traps the insurgents usually use bamboo or other similar material to make poles whips pit frames and covers punji stakes and various other trap components the insurgents extensively use punji stakes in traps on revetments or on streams and ditch banks to hinder assaulting troops the placement of punji stakes is such that man running or jumping from one stream or ditch bank to another will be im paled by the stakes the insurgents often emplace nonexplosive traps with mines or explosive booby traps they may also use them at ambush sites in insurgent defensive positions camps or villages it would not be unusual to find together all the tricks known to the insurgents tunnels antitank mines antipersonnel mines explosive booby traps and nonexplosive booby traps the insurgents usually position mantraps whether simple spike boards or deep pits where an individuals attention is likely to be focused elsewhere careful re connaissance of trail for trip wires may cause an individual to overlook well camouflaged pit trap while investigating gate for grenade trap an individual may fall prey to any one of number of spike or pit traps defense against mines and booby traps despite the insurgents high use of mines and booby traps in some parts of the world and their ingenious methods and techniques for using them security force personnel can learn to combat such tactics through proper training and strict disci pline in the field the insurgents do make mistakes the materials they use in their mines and booby traps are rarely 100 percent reliable instead they rely on careless h11fm 31203 and hasty detection and removal methods by security forces for success for exam ple in 1968 us army elements in vietnam unintentionally set off 50 percent of all enemy mines and booby traps they encountered there is room for careless mistakes in mine warfare every soldier must be familiar with the methods of fending himself and his unit against mines and booby traps through an under standing of the insurgents use of mines and booby traps soldiers can develop proper defensive measures the soldier however must diligently apply these fensive measures in the field for them to be of any value unit leaders and com manders at all levels must establish proper countermine procedures sops indoctrinate their personnel in these procedures and enforce their application an important precaution is to prevent material and equipment from falling into the hands of insurgents who inevitably use this equipment and material against the curity forces security forces must ensure proper security of stocks careful police of the battle area and strict enforcement of the unit supply discipline to prevent the loss of material unpoliced explosive litter in the battle area will obviously be verted to booby trap or mine applications security forces take additional steps not to leave such apparently harmless items as dead batteries communications wire and other such materials from being obtained for mine and booby trap application the individual soldier must be aware of the need for meticulous control of am munition abuse of ammunition control includes improperly attached grenades that fall off during movement another abuse is discarding ammunition considered unserviceable because of tarnish dirt mud or other avoidable conditions or minor imperfections local commanders establish and maintain safe intervals during troop and vehicle movements many antipersonnel mines and hand grenades the insurgents use will cause more than one casualty within the effective casualty radius this fact is espe cially true because insurgents mine areas in which the troops habitually bunch up such as breaks during movement or paths through heavy vegetation soldiers are normally eager to go to the aid of fellow soldiers who become mine casualties they must however do so with extreme caution the insurgents often emplace secondary mines or booby traps to inflict additional casualties on the per sonnel grouped around the wounded the man nearest each casualty must carefully clear his way to the individual and give first aid unit leaders do not let soldiers crowd around the wounded and present another lucrative target if possible they briefly search the immediate area for other explosive devices and observe the in surgents tactic of grouping mines in interrelated multiples soldiers place sandbags on the floors of their vehicles to protect mounted person nel personnel riding in the vehicles must keep arms and legs inside the vehicle for maximum protection as an additional recommended precaution they place heavy rubber mat over the sandbags to reduce fragments stones sand shrapnel and pieces of the bags to further reduce the chance of fragments they use sand bags filled only with sand and not sand with rocks in it the element uses varied speed and spacing of individual vehicles to make the tim ing of commanddetonated mines more difficult key personnel prime targets for h12fm 31203 commanddetonated mines must not congregate in one vehicle but be dispersed throughout the column whenever possible vehicles do not travel alone as they are targets for insurgents seeking weapons and other equipment patrols must follow different routes to and from their patrol bases to avoid set ting pattern insurgents can use to emplace mine or attack target they must carefully choose random times and various routes for their patrols and other movements the best mine and booby trap detector is an alert and observant point man he must be rotated frequently or the stress of his job will make him ineffective detection and search techniques mine and booby trap detection requires constant alertness and careful observation the efficiency of the detection effort depends on the security force soldiers knowl edge of the insurgents methods and techniques although some elements such as mine detection teams will have deliberate search missions most troops must be trained to detect mines or booby traps in the normal course of daily activities the following paragraphs provide tips for soldiers to remember in detecting mines and booby traps in the later search technique tips emphasis is given to more delib erate actions for detection beyond those in the normal daily course of activities detection techniques be especially alert for trip wires across trails and along the shoulders of roads at likely ambush sites look for them near known or suspected antitank or antive hicular mines and across the most accessible route through dense vegetation look for them at the approaches to and within village and in and around likely helicopter landing sites also look for them at the approaches to insurgent posi tions and at bridges fords ditches and across rice paddy dikes look for smears grass sticks dirt dung or other substances on roads many of these areas may be mined look for evidence of apparent road repairs new fill or paving road patches ditch ing or culvert work such areas often conceal mines avoid tire marks ruts or skid marks on the roads these areas may conceal mines and must be investigated be alert for any sign placed on trees posts or stakes most of these signs are small and inconspicuous although they dont all indicate the presence of mines they must be investigated watch for markings the insurgents could use to mark or aim mines and booby traps these signs are normally inconspicuous but they appear as regular pattern not present in nature these signs may be sticks or stones in line or broken stick carefully placed on road or trail they may be clumps of grass at regular intervals or sticks placed in the ground in an unusual manner they may also be innocent looking strings hanging over doorway h13fm 31203 watch for wires leading away from the side of road some wires may only be par tially buried or not buried at all be alert for suspicious items in trees branches or bushes these items may be hand grenades or mortar or artillery rounds trip wires across trail may be diffi cult or impossible to detect however the charge usually alongside the trail or overhead may be more readily apparent observe the movement of civilians particularly in insurgentoccupied areas the civilians usually know where the insurgents placed most mines and booby traps in and around their villages they avoid these areas they may walk on one side of the road avoiding the other side they may walk in the middle of the road avoid ing the side and shoulders they may avoid road entirely if the civilians do not use certain facilities or buildings in the village it is good sign that these locations are mined or boobytrapped watch for flags banners and miscellaneous insurgent equipment and supplies these are frequently boobytrapped and must be investigated look for nonexplosive traps placed at or above ground level these are usually well camouflaged but may be detected by careful observation look for pieces of wood boards and bamboo or other debris on road they may indicate the presence of pressuredetonating devices for antivehicular mines these devices are either placed on the surface of the road or partially buried in ei ther case they are usually camouflaged hasty emplacement or weather conditions often reduce the effectiveness of the camouflage so that they may be detected by careful observation vehicle operators are cautioned against driving over wood sticks or other debris on road use scout dog teams to detect booby traps the dog detects the scent left by the em placing personnel not the scent of the device itself the dogs ability to detect the scent diminishes with the passing of time how long after the emplacement the dog can detect the area depends on various environmental factors wind terrain and weatherwet or dry the scent will be detectable for 1 to 4 days depending on those conditions search techniques in addition to watching their movements question the civilians to determine the specific locations of mines and booby traps investigate all gates for boobytrapping with hand grenades or other explosives devices carefully observe whatever is overhead and the flanks of route through dense vegetation for hand grenades shells and other devices or traps placed either on the ground in bushes or in trees investigate entrances to caves tunnels and buildings for booby traps and search the approaches to and the area near these facilities for antipersonnel mines investigate potential souvenir items for booby traps firearms knives binoculars uniforms and miscellaneous items of clothing and equipment h14fm 31203 investigate the area near suspicious signs and other markings that may indicate the presence of mines and booby traps immediate action upon mine activation when device is tripped little reaction time exists once the detonation chain starts the maximum delay for some foreign grenades ranges from 4 to 9 seconds if the delay element has been modified the minimum fuse delay will be less than 15 sec onds however since the time available cannot be predicted certain immediate ac tions can help reduce casualties and the degree of personal injury these actions are designed as reaction to minimum time delay the following steps are the immediate actions to take when mine or booby trap device is activated be alert for the exploding caps pop the trip wires tug or another soldiers warning sound warning so that others may take cover drop to the ground immediately when dropping to the ground present the smallest target to the force of the explosion by pointing your feet in the direction of the charge trying to outrun the explosion is not immediate action some grenade fragments have an initial velocity of 1524 meters per second individuals should not rush im mediately to aid their wounded friend frequently there is second booby trap near the first they should conduct brief but careful search for other explosive vices nearby before moving on methods to disarm the first essential step in defending against insurgent mines and booby traps is tecting mined and boobytrapped areas or facilities and locating the devices once this action is done the safest procedure is to avoid or bypass these areas or facili ties however it is seldom tactically possible to do so although some mines and booby traps can be bypassed temporarily most of them must be dealt with immedi ately complete neutralization of an explosive device is highly skilled technique requiring specially trained personnel neutralization neutralization is simply making mine or booby trap safe to handle it involves two basic steps the first is disarming or replacing the safeties in the firing assem bly the second is defusing or separating the firing assembly from the main charge and the detonator from the firing assembly destruction in place is the preferred means of neutralization destruction in place is the preferred means of dealing with any explosive hazard personnel may destroy mine or booby trap in place if some damage is acceptabledestruction in place h15fm 31203 and the tactical situation permits the device can be initiated by its own mecha nism and riggings or by detonating an explosive charge near the mine or booby trap the sfod must consider the damage that will be caused to any structure or road by detonating mine or booby trap in place before taking any action against the hazard charges placed on bridges in builtup areas and indoors must usually be removed rather than destroyed in place mine removal if destruction in place is not an available option mines may require hand removal before trying to remove any mine the area around it must be carefully probed to locate and neutralize antihandling devices to avoid becoming casualty person nel must identify the type of firing mechanism and replace all safety devices af ter emplacing safety devices pull the mine from the ground by remote means grapnels and ropes are useful tools for remotely removing the hazard caution when using grapnels be sure that the mine is not magnetically fired hand disarming only trained specialists should try hand disarming unless the characteristics and disarming techniques of the mine or booby trap are well known only trained specialists inspect and destroy unusual or complicated devices dud mortar and artillery shells hand grenades and devices equipped with chemical fuses are par ticularly dangerous part of mine booby trap or other explosive charge should be touched with out first examining it thoroughly locate all firing devices and their triggering mechanisms when tracing wires look for concealed intermediate devices that impede searching and clearing do not disturb any wires while examining the explosive device cut loose trip wires only after careful examination of all connecting objects and af ter replacing all safeties trace all taut wires and disarm all connected firing devices by replacing safeties taut trip wires are cut only after eliminating the danger at both ends replace safeties in all mechanisms using nails lengths of wire cotter pins and other similar objects never use force in disarming arming devices without disturbing the main charge cut the detonating cord or other leads between the disarmed firing device and the main charge cut wires leading to an electrical detonator one at time when using probe push it gently into the ground stop pushing when the probe strikes any object it may be pressure cap or plate once separated remove mine or booby trap components to safe storage or dis posal area expedient lane cleanerclearing mine fields by hand is slow dangerous process the following system can be used to clear lanes in boobytrapped andor mined fields prepare detonat ing cord in 15meter lengths tape three strands together at 3meter intervals to h16fm 31203 form lane clearer tie hand grenade to one end of the cord as weight affix blasting cap time fuse and fuse lighter to the other end of the cord roll the detonating cord lariat style hold the blasting cap end and using an underhanded motion throw the grenade in the direction of travel the grenade is not activated set off the detonating cord to clear lmeterwide by 15meterlong lane of trip wires and antipersonnel mines methods to clear nonexplosive booby traps in addition to explosive booby traps and mines nonexplosive traps must be cleared although there is specific doctrine for clearing or neutralizing these traps many of the procedures and precautions for neutralizing explosive devices apply be alert for mines and booby traps in the area ensure individual traps are not fur ther boobytrapped if you must bypass traps mark them clearly or guard them for the safety of friendly personnel following from safe distance pickup and dispose of spike boards and other loose spike vices that were sprung to prevent further use by the insurgents use extreme caution in clearing or neutralizing tripwireactuated traps angled ar row trap suspended spikes and bamboo whip after having cleared personnel from the area use grapnels to activate these devices from safe position to the side or rear of the point of impact active mine prevention methods the variety of techniques and procedures to detect mines and booby traps indicates that single positive countermeasure exists to nullify the mine threat after its em placement methods are needed to prevent the successful emplacement of insur gent mines in the first place or provide the key to effective countermeasures if the insurgent is successful in placing mines and booby traps the available courses of action are limited indicating the inherent advantages that mine warfare offers to guerrilla force first requirement is combat intelligence mine reporting and information system to establish insurgent patterns of employment by frequency area type and trend experience shows that adequate summary information reveals definite preferred areas for mine activity defining the mine threat leads to the commitment of re sources to counter the threat economizing the forces available the most effective tactical countermeasure is the constant physical presence of tac tical security forces in the immediate area this presence is costly in troop employ ment but such security forces have prevented enemy mine activity in the past not as expensive in terms of troop employment but still quite effective is aggressive h17fm 31203 and widespread patrolling especially at night this move prevents the enemy from gaining easy access to potential mine sites ambush patrols are by far the best means to counter regular mining other techniques can be used from night vision devices to aggressive actions against the enemy improvised munitions workshops h18advisor techniques application the advisor techniques outlined in this appendix apply to both the individual ad visor and an sfod in fid operations in some instances in the past us advisors were not selected on the basis of language skills or ability to deal effectively with their counterparts they were selected on the basis of mos and availability for an overseas hardship tour the us military services have demonstrated their profes sional excellence in training foreign personnel and units in technical skills how ever they have not performed well in advising in politicomilitary matters because of their lack of background training and competence in these areas influencing hn military institutions to support democratic process can only be done with the longterm presence of us military personnel working alongside hn forces personnel who arrive for short visits will be treated as visitors and will not penetrate the fabric of the hn culture or its institutions although short visits can serve other useful purposes the longterm presence of us military personnel is required to strengthen hn democratic institutions and convince the hn military institutions to reform hn officials are not normally confused over moral ground rules however because of the dangerous situation confronting the nation they are convinced they must ignore these ground rules an advisor must strive to transmit the concept of democratization to his counter part this concept is often considered common sense or common decency and so basic it is not discussed much in training the most important mission of an ad visor is to enhance the military professionalism of his counterpart he must influ ence the hn military and prepare them to deal with the changing environment by i1fm 31203 emphasizing civilian control and demonstrating the advantages of democratic system of government major cause of an advisors failure is his inability to maintain good working relationship with his counterpart the unsuccessful advisor often fails to under stand why his counterparts do not feel the sense of urgency that he does he is unable to realize that his counterpart will remain and continue to fight the enemy long after his tour is over and he returns to the safety and comfort of the united states the advisor must be aware of the scope and limitations of the principal saps au thorized by the faa and aeca particularly the prohibition of security assistance personnel performing any duties of combatant nature to include any duties re lated to training and advising that may engage us personnel in combat activities the environment plays big factor in an advisors role the following paragraphs address what the advisor needs to know to prepare for his role stage of development in situations where the hn government may have been in existence only short time the administrative machinery may still be developing the advisor must be aware of such situations and not be overly critical in an insurgency the hn gov ernment is experiencing major problems to begin with the money needed for so cial and economic programs is mostly directed toward security needs in an ideal situation the hn government would use this money to cure the societys eco nomic and social ills organizational the advisor must know hn sociopolitical and military organizations and their in makeup terrelationships to include personalities political movements forces involved and social drives he must impress upon his counterpart the need for an integrated civilmilitary effort to defeat the insurgents his counterpart must learn that mili tary actions are subordinate to and supportive of the economic and social actions required to remove the insurgencys causes the advisor must fully understand his status in the hn agreements between the united states and the hn spell out his status these agreements may provide full diplomatic immunity or very little immunity without an agreement the advisor is subject to local laws customs and the jurisdiction of local courts regardless of the diplomatic immunity afforded him the advisor observes local laws as well as the applicable laws of war and army regulations and directivesstatus of advisor rapport rapport is sympathetic relationship between people based on mutual trust derstanding and respect personal dislike animosity and other forms of friction characterize the lack of rapport the need to establish rapport with hn counterparts is the result of unique mili tary position in which the advisor has direct authority or control over their i2fm 31203 actions however an advisor can influence or motivate his counterpart to act in certain ways by using the proper advisory techniques effective rapport must exist to gain the control needed to execute the mission the successful advisor establishes rapport that allows influence over the counterparts actions despite the absence of formal authority rapport results when each individual perceives the other as competent mature re sponsible and compatible working toward common goal if the advisor can vey this attitude to his hn counterpart longlasting effective rapport will exist techniques an advisor must constantly bear in mind that he is an advisor and not com mander he is not there to lead troops having the counterpart select particular coa is possible only if he perceives the advisors professional competence to give sound advice if the counterpart does not believe the proposed solution to problem is effective or realistic he will question the advisors competence the advisor must explain to his counterpart why the ad vice is sound the advisor does not use bribery or coercion since results achieved from these ac tions are only temporary as soon as the payment is made or the force is re moved the counterpart has reason to comply in practice these techniques are not efficient and will not achieve the longrun goal of developing proficiency com petence and initiative in the counterpart the advisor must be careful not to bribe or coerce counterpart unintentionally he must be aware that as an american soldier he might have privileged status in the hn the advisors presence may garner personal benefits for the counterpart through his position of having oneonone association with an american versely the advisor may make counterpart afraid of offending to the point of complying with every suggestion the advisor makes psychologically pressuring the hn counterpart may sometimes be successful forms of psychological pressure may range from the obvious to the subtle the ad visor never applies direct threats pressure or intimidation on his counterpart indi rect psychological pressure may be applied by taking an issue up the chain of command to higher us commander the us commander can then bring his counterpart to force the subordinate counterpart to comply psychological pressure may obtain quick results but may have very negative side effects the counterpart will feel alienated and possibly hostile if the advisor uses such techniques offers of payment in the form of valuables may cause him to become resentful of the ob vious control being exerted over him in short psychologically pressuring counterpart is not recommended such pressure is used only as last resort since it may irreparably damage the relationship between the advisor and his counterpart advising works both ways the advisor sets an example for the counterpart by ask ing his advice the advisor must realize that the counterpart is the expert in his country and that he can learn much from him i3fm 31203 the advisor must avoid giving the counterpart the impression that status reports and administrative requirements are the most important items such an impression may cause the counterpart to become aloof because it may be difficult and time consuming for him to get this information the advisor must treat his counterpart as an equal he must also give the respect he himself expects to receive he must take care not to make this fellow soldier feel like an errand boy the advisor transacts important business directly with his counterpart to assure full understanding of difficult subjects he uses the soft approach to request official information the advisor does not present too many subjects at one time or unnecessarily pro long the discussion of one subject the advisor schedules another conference at later time if needed the advisor corrects the most important deficiencies first upon his arrival in the ao he will find many matters in need of immediate corrective action he avoids telling his counterpart that everything is all wrong rather he looks for the good systems and policies and praises his counterpart on his successes at this point the counterpart will normally point out deficiencies that need correction as his idea and joint problemsolving process can begin in some cases it may take month or more to sell one idea when making recommendations the advisor phrases them in way that will not impose his will on the hn commanders decisions the advisor leaves enough room for his counterpart to exercise his prerogative one of his counterparts great est fears is that his troops will see him as dependent upon his advisor the advisor carefully chooses time and place to offer advice during combat operations the advisor advises the commander but never usurps his command or authority the amount of advising during combat operations is small the advisor does most of his advising while preparing for combat he bases his ad vice on his observations or those of his subordinates during past operations he holds private critique with the commander upon completion of an operation the advisor must not be afraid to advise against bad decision he does it tactfully however he acts as staff member who recommends change of action to an american commander he respects and with whom he works daily the advisor approaches the subject under discussion from different directions and with different words to make sure the advice given is clearly understood he doesnt accept yes answer at its face value yes may mean the person under stands but does not necessarily accept the suggestion it may also be used to cover lack of understanding the advisor always exercises patience in dealing with counterpart he never ex pects job to be done at the snap of finger and he doesnt snap finger the advisor cannot accept information from his counterpart in blind faith he checks it discreetly and diplomatically but he must check it after the advisor plants an idea he lets his counterpart take credit for it as if it were his own idea i4fm 31203 advisors are transients the advisor tries to learn what the previous advisor had tried and has or has not accomplished he asks him for his files and thoroughly briefs him to prevent reinventing the wheel the advisor keeps an open mind and judges matters himself the advisor starts preparing folder about the advisory area and duties as soon as possible he maintains worksheettype folder during the tour to better understand the job followon advisors will have complete file to assist them in completing projects the advisor doesnt hesitate to make onthespot corrections he must be ex tremely tactful above all he doesnt make the person he corrects lose face in front of his peers or subordinates embarrassing the counterpart in most cultures can cause serious loss of rapport and possible mission failure the advisor respects the almost universal custom and desire of saving face an advisor must never make promises he cannot or must not carry out he never pledges us assets unless he has the authority and capability to deliver them psyop support for military advisors the introduction of military advisors requires preparing the populace with which the advisors are going to work before advisors enter country the hn govern ment carefully explains their introduction and clearly emphasizes the benefits of their presence to the citizens it must provide credible justification to minimize the obvious propaganda benefits the insurgents could derive from this action the countrys dissenting elements label our actions matter how wellintended an imperialistic intervention once advisors are committed their activities should be exploited their successful integration into the hn society and their respect for local customs and mores as well as their involvement with ca projects are constantly brought to light in for mulating realistic policy for the use of advisors the commander must carefully gauge the psychological climate of the hn and the united states personal qualities advisors must rely on their abilities to sell the most indefinite commoditythem selves the traits of an advisor encompass all the traits of leadership plus the ability to adapt to his environment this environment changes with the assignment area to sell himself the advisor must prove his value and present favorable person ality in the eyes of his counterpart this selling occurs in time by gradually demon strating his capabilities in an unassuming but firm manner the advisor avoids rushing personal acceptance by the counterpart overselling himself will arouse suspicion and delay acceptance time spent developing healthy relationship will pay large dividends later i5fm 31203 an advisor must be extremely flexible patient and willing to admit mistakes he must persevere in providing sound advice he must also be diplomat of the high est caliber and possess an unusual amount of tact an advisor must be honest he must maintain high moral standards and be under standing and sincere he must present good military appearance stay in good physical condition and lead by example the advisor must know thoroughly the organization equipment and tactics of the unit he advises he must be professional and proficient he must demonstrate an awareness of his counterparts problems the advisor must be positive but not dogmatic in his approach to any subject if however he is not sure of the subject matter he says so and takes the steps to obtain the correct information he doesnt try to bluff his way through problem persistence balanced with patience is favorable trait of an advisor if he discov ers problem he tries to solve it he recommends the proper measures to take and then follows through patience is of utmost importance he continually brings the matter to his counterparts attention until he sells him on taking the measures to solve the problems or correct the deficiency ultimately the goal is to advise his counterpart in such way that he takes the desired action feeling that it was through his own initiative rather the advisors successful advisor must have subject knowledge the ability to demonstrate his capabilities in an unassuming but convincing manner and the clear indication of his desire to get along with counterparts and other associates common sense is possibly the greatest asset of the successful advisor ultimately this uncommon commodity separates the effective advisor from the ineffec tive one with common sense everything is possible without it failure can be expected advisory goals the advisor emphasizes inplace training when the units return to garrison focus on battle drills and sops twentyfivemeter firing ranges are ideal to conduct marksmanship training zero reduced range qualification night firing instinctive firing techniques the advisor spends maximum time with the unit so that the troops get to know and trust him he talks to and gets to know the troops not just the unit leaders he gets excellent feedback in the common soldiers candid comments such comments often reflect troop morale and operational effectiveness he stays abreast of what is going on in the unit he also stays in close contact with the commander and staff the advisor encourages frequent command inspections by the commander in some hns this action is anew concept or an uncommon practice many hn com manders are reluctant to inspect they rely solely on correspondence and reports to evaluate the units effectiveness i6fm 31203 the advisor continually stresses the obvious advantages of good militarycivilian relations to avoid the idea of military arrogance which easily imitates the civilian populace the development of proper soldiercivilian relationship is critical factor in idad and in counterinsurgency improper behavior by soldiers toward ci vilians must be immediately corrected the advisor constantly strives to raise the hn units standards to the level needed to complete the mission he guards against lowering his standards but realizes most hn units needing advice may not have the logistic educational or nutritional base to perform to us standards and in that sense may not be expected to meet our standards the advisor keeps training standards high enough so that the unit is prepared for combat at all times he doesnt use training time for housekeeping matters the advisor stresses human rights and the consequences of mistreating suspects and prisoners the advisor constantly promotes the units esprit corps to sustain the unit in the face of difficulties the advisor persuades the hn personnel to pass information up down and laterally personal attitudes and relations becoming accustomed to the native food and drink in somewhat varying degrees poses problem to the advisor an advisor establishes and maintains rapport more easily by drinking in moderation and eating with counterparts iaw culturally ac ceptable rules refusal to accept their drink and food is often considered an insult the advisor doesnt become discouraged all advice will not be accepted some will be implemented at later date the advisor cannot forget that careless word or action can cost the united states dearly in good will and cooperation that may have been established with great ef fort and at considerable cost the advisor doesnt criticize hn policy in front of hn personnel it is the advisors obligation to support the incumbent government just as he does his own this ac tion is us national policy the advisor studies his counterpart to determine his personality and background he makes every effort to establish and maintain friendly relationships he learns something about his counterparts personal life and demonstrates an interest in his likes and dislikes he sets good example in dress posture and personal conduct and in professional knowledge and competence he emphasizes the importance of doing things on time by demonstrating punctu ality many cultures have very casual attitude toward time he realizes however i7fm 31203 that he will never change their culture but may succeed in modifying their behavior to meet mutually recognized mission needs he develops sense of responsibility toward the unit he advises to the degree that he senses personal fulfillment for job well done he avoids the pitfall of becom ing so involved with the unit that he cannot readily recognize failures the advisor accepts invitations to dinners cocktail parties and ceremonies he gages in cordial social conversation before discussing business matters he only discusses business matters if appropriate the advisor recognizes and observes military courtesy and local customs and cour tesies when in doubt he leans toward the polite the advisor doesnt get caught in personality clashes between hn officers who may concern themselves more with persontoperson relationships than with orga nizational frameworks advisor considerations the following lists of suggestions hints and considerations will benefit advisors in mca programs and tactical intelligence and prc operations military civic the advisor considers the following applications in the different areas addressed in the paragraphs below action programs communications the advisor must get his ideas and intentions across through his counterpart programs can be publicized by community meetings
