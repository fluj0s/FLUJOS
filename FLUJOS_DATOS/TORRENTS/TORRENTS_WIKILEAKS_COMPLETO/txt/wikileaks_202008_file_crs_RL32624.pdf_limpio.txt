agricultural policy summary green payments are generally defined as payments made to agricultural producers as compensation for environmental benefits that accrue at levels beyond what producers might otherwise achieve under existing market and regulatory conditions they may support both envir onmental and farm income objectives modern us agrienvironmental progra ms began in 1985 by paying farmers to retire land and limiting conve rsion of wetlands and highly erodible land to cultivation thereby reducing negative nvironmental effects associated with production agriculture these initial prog rams focused on single agricultural benefit limiting erosion since then these pr ograms have proliferated in number and overall funding and now pay farmers to provide additi onal conservation benefits either while maintaining ag ricultural production on working lands or by retiring land from production these environmental bene fits include stemming wetland loss and wildlife habitat deteri oration protecting fa rmland from conversion to other uses and improving water and air quality the conservation security program csp enacted in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 is the most recent step in the evolution of us agrienvironmental policy csp pays pr oducers to capture nvironmental benefits across their entire agricultural operation wh ile producing commodities it has been characterized by some as the most comp rehensive us green payments program general environmental policy in the european union eu deals with negative externalities from water pollution nitrates and pesticides among other issues and also affects agricultural production eu farm policy since 1985 however has included payments to farmers to compensate for costs incurred or income forgone from undertaking agrienvironmental measur that meet farm policy and rural development objectives such measures include inter alia reducing use of fertilizer and chemical inputs adopting organic production methods main taining countryside and landscape or managing land for leisure activities or public access successive reforms of the eus common agricultural policy cap have placed greater emphasis on such green payments and in creased funding for them as agri environmental measures have been integrat ed into broad rural development policy congressional interest in green payments today is driven by pressure from international trade negotiations and the anticipated development of the next farm bill which will likely contain the us polic responses to the results of these negotiations these negotiations create considerable uncertainty over future farm program options and green payments in some fashion are widely viewed as an option that could be designed so as to satisfy both international obligations and

green payments generally are defined as payments to agricultural producers for providing environmental services on working farms they are designed to encourage producers to provide more nvironmental services than they might otherwise provide in the absence of the payments1 and they are not connected to producers level of production in the united states the term green payments refers to agricultural programs with primarily environmenta l goals although all us green payments programs focus on the environment the types of paym ents range from costs haring for specific conservation practices to incentives for w holefarm management of environmental resources and rewards for good actors for past environmental stewardship this discussion will review us green payments within the context of modern us agri environmental policy which is evolving from programs focusing primarily on land retirement to programs encouraging s ound environmental mana gement on working farms the european union eu views green payments more broadly than does the united states using them to achieve soci oeconomic and rural development goals as well as environmental goals the eu makes agrienvironmental green payments to farmers within the framework of its rural development policy which encompasses not only environmental activities but also investments to modernize farms programs to help young farmers get established or promote early retirement assistance with processing and marketing farm products nd programs to promot the nonfarm rural economy such as agritourism or preservati on of cultural heritage this discussion of eu green payments will focus primar ily on agrienvironmental measures that compensate farmers who take measures to enhance the environm ental benefits from farming but not other aspects of the eus rural development policy the following review of green payments and agrienvironmental policy in the united states and the european union show s that they have become an important aspect of agricultural policy although green payments are only one tool of agri environmental programs2 forces at work in the global economy could tend

the united states has implemented agrienvironmental policies since the 1930s when the dust bowl spurred congress to act laws providing fi nancial technical and educational assistance to farmers to encourage the adoption of soil conservation practices all assistance is provided to vol untary participants as is designed to benefit individual farms toda the united states employs two main types of agri environmental policy tools mandatory crosscompliance mechanisms for those producers who receive federal farm prog ram benefits and voluntary incentives voluntary incentives have been dominant in us agrienvironmental policy and are viewed by most agriculture interests as being central to efforts to improve the environmental performance of producers th few regulatory federal laws affecting agriculture include the use of restrictions and bans on certain pesticides but these have been fairly limited in number and are not topic of this report5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32624crs3 6 economic

farmers fro m converting wetlands into farmland and from farming highly erodible land unless the land is protected by implementing an approved conservation plan from excessive soil erosion producer must comply with these programs to receive federa l commodity price and income support to participate in federal voluntar conservation programs and to be eligible for federal agriculture loans or loanrelated guarantees and other agriculturerelated federal benefits6 farmers who do not comply may still farm but are ineligible for these substantial government benefits it is estimated that about 50 of the countrys 2 million farmers currently recei ve federal farm program benefits those who do not receive these benefits are not affected by cross compliance as currently designed us

conservation called swampbuster7 land is defined by the natura l resources conservation service as highly erodible when it may erode at or at more than eight times the soil loss tolerance level this is th rate at which soil can erode without losing its productivity over time much of this highly erodible land is located in the great plains states conservation compliance under this program farmers producing agricultural commodities on highly erodi ble land that was cropped from 1981 to 1985 must implement an approved conservation plan the plan must provide for 75 reduction in erosion as

ession in the concep t of multifunctionality farmers are viewed as producing not only food and agricultural products but also positive environmental and other benefits externalities agrienvironmental policy focuses mainly but not exclusively on promoting positive externalities associated with agricultural production these in clude among others landscape rural amenities and cultural heritage the pr emise underlying agrienvironmental policy is that these externalities are public goods that are undervalued by the market and therefore require social or public funding to induce farmers to produce them more broadly the eu maintains that support of commodity production and farm incomes that also engenders these positive externalities is also justified critics of the concept argue that multifunctionality is inte nded to justify substantial income support for farmers and that support for the public goods produced by agriculture should be specifically targeted in addition to meeting desirable social goals eu agricultural policymakers view shifting funds from co mmodity support to rural development including agrienvironmental programs as being more compatible with multilateral efforts in the world trade organizati on wto to curb domestic support while maintaining support that is not or is at most minimally tradedistorting19 since 1985 agrienvironmental green pa yments as defined above have been available to eu farmers successive re forms of the eus common agricultural policy cap in 1992 2000 and 2003 have placed increasing emphasis on green payments to meet farm

surpluses make agricultural products more compe titive in world markets secure farmers incomes and conform the cap to anticipated wto rules and disciplines with respect to domestic support the essential element of the reform was to reduce price supports to farmers while making direct payments to farmers to compensate them for loss of income due to price reductions at the same time the reform gave additional emphasis to agrienvironmental measures agrienvironmental measures were dea lt with in two ways in the 1992 cap reform first some agrienvironmental measures were included in commodity support programs second specific agrienvi ronmental measures were introduced as measures accompanying the market reform s examples of the former include compulsory setasides for large farmers primarily to manage supplies but also to foster the rotational release and recovery of arable land limits on stocking density per holding or per hectare in order to qualify for payments extensification premiums for further reducing stocking density per hectare and payments to fruit and vegetable producers made c ontingent on the adoption of environmentally sound production practices the three accompanying measures in the 1992 cap reform were agricultural production methods comp atible with the requirements of the protection of the environm ent and the maintenance of the countryside27 early retirement from farming28 and afforestation of agricultural land29 for the agrienvironmental accompanying measures assistance in the form of payments would be made to farmers or

ffagrienvironmental programs in agenda 200031 the process of agricultural policy reform and of integrating agrienvironmental measures into agricultural policy was tinued with the agenda 2000 reforms the primary rationale for further reforming the cap was to adapt it to the enlargement of the eu by another 10 member stat within existing budgetary and other limits second rationale was to prepare th eu for new wto agricultural trade negotiations that were to have been launched in sea ttle in 1999 but were launched subsequently at doha qatar in 2001 agenda 2000 established adoption of agri environmental measures as the only compulsory element of eu ru ral development policy memb er states have to include agrienvironmental measures such as those identified in the 1992 regulations in their rural development programs to ta p funding available from the guarantee section of the eaggf agenda 2000 also established rural development including the agri environmental accompanying measures

review of us and eu current agrienvironmental policies reveals both similarities and differences see table 4 following this section many of the major environmental topics dealt with by us and eu policy and programs are much the same soil and water quality wildlife habitat farmland preservation and protection and wetlands protection and re storation but how they are addressed is different in many significant ways one major difference is the extent to which crosscompliance measures are used in relation to receipt of commodity support payments although us agrienvironmental policy has emphasized voluntar participation farmers or ranchers with erodible lands or wetlands must comply with crosscompliance measures as condition for receiving commodity payments in the eu on the other hand all farms as of january 1 2005 ar required to meet certain statutory environmental management requirements and observe good agricultural and environmental practices in order to recei ve support payments provided as single farm payment37 in the united states the federal gove rnment is primarily responsible for program administration and funding it pr ovides technical assi stance and financial or costsharing assistan ce developing and implemen ting conservation plans in contrast eu member states are primarily responsible for administering agri environmental programs which are cofi nanced generously by the european commission farmers receive technical assistance to able them to meet the compulsory agrienvironmental standard s and financial aid as they implement activities to meet the standards in the united states integrating agrienvironmental programs with rural development policy and shifting funds from commodity to agrienvironmental effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32624crs19 are at issue to date united states po licy makers have not chosen to make this linkage or to transfer funds eu polic ymakers seem to have made decision to integrate agrienvironmental programs into broad rural development policy the eu as part of its most recent reform of the cap has also made policy decision to shift increasing amounts of funds from co mmodity to agrienvironmental support part of the difference between the united st ates and the eu with respect to funding derives from different approaches to budge ting for agricultural programs in the eu and the united states while the eu operates on sevenyear fixed budget for agriculture with inflation factors built in the united states operates with budgets decided in annual appr opriations legislation although programs are authorized for multiyear periods further developments in agrienvironmental policy in both the united states and the eu will likely depend at least in part on outcomes from ongoing multilateral agricultural trade negotiations if these negotiations result in further restrictions on tradedistorting domestic commodity support farmers ranchers and policymakers may view increased funding for green paym ents as an attractive alternative for providing support to agriculture if furthe r restrictions are re quired it seems more likely that the united states and the eu will look at the others policies and experiences more closely if such an examination demonstrates that historic and current differences are extensive and difficu lt to overcome it may be that broad and imprecise definition of green payments will serve the interests of diverse parties who participate in farm policy debates for us policy the status of these negotiations in early 2007 when crafting the next farm bill is likely to start in ear nest will be particularly important b ecause designers of this legisla tion and interest groups will likely give the status and direction of these negotiations strong consideration as they contemplate farm bill options if the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain while the farm bill is being debated this uncertainty will compound the intensity of the debate and possibly result in the inclusion of language in legislation giving the department greater flexibility in implementation congressional discussion of green paymen ts may become contentious for other reasons as well one source of that conten tion may be the translation of the concept into policies and programs most inte rests involved in farm policy who have expressed an opinion support the general c oncept of green payments but as the discussions become more specific participants may find that they have different views about program desig n funding allocations admin istrative responsibilities and similar questions making it difficult to hold together coalitions of supporters among the most difficult of these questions may be deciding whether such program should include significant income support component and contribute to the bottom line of each participant or should it be limited to covering costs to install and maintain conservation practices related question may be deciding what is to be accomplished through green payment approach some may view it as meeting international obligations and seek minimal program with limited impact to current domestic efforts while others may view it is major new and positive direction in farm policy and seek to make it large and farreaching one aspect of discussing these options may be over whether paymen ts should be based on costsharing for individual practices which has long hist ory in agrienvironmen tal policies or onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32624crs20 the level of improved environmental performance that results from installing practices consideration of green payments may so include debate over questions of scale to this point all conservation programs are implemented at the scale of an individual farm green payments could in clude additional incentiv for coordinated and collective action that have much larger cumulative benefits than actions on individual farms are likely to result in ch programs could be designed around the magnitude of the benefits that the group pr ovides and grow or shrink for all members of the group as the participation nd therefore the benefits change differences between the united states and the eu in how green payments have been defined and translated into policy nd programs may make consideration of eu agrienvironmental policy as model or s ource of ideas problematic some aspects of eu policy eg compulsory crossco mpliance with agrienvironmental measures as condition for receiving price and in come support differ substantially from historical us practice in which crosscompliance has been far more sparingly applied spending on agrienvironmental programs in the united states has been relatively less than in the eu both as portion of total federal spending for agriculture and as an amount spent identif ying sources of increased funding for agri environmental programs even in the cont ext of possible new wto restrictions on other forms of farm support might still be difficult given projected budget deficits even with new multilateral restrictions on farm subsidies agrienvironmental programs might compete unfavorably with the more conventional forms of farm support or with other wtocompatib programs apart from funding considerations consensus for linking ag rienvironment and ru ral development with more traditional farm program measures has not emerged in the united states as it apparently has in the eu so the extent to which eu agrienvi ronmental policy could serve as model or source of ideas for u s agrienvironmental policy remains to be seen table 4 comparison of current us and eu agrienvironmental policies key policy aspects us eu overall purpose of policyencourage voluntary adoption of
