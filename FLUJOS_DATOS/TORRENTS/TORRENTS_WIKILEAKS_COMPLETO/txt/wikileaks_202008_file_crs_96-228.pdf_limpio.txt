social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228davisbacon employment of helpers on federal contract construction summary the davisbacon act of 1931 as amende d requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage not necessarily the union rate be paid to workers engaged in contract construction work to which the government of the united states or of the district of columbia is party the coverage threshold is 2000 under davisbacon the secretary of labor makes wage rate determinations for the various classes of laborers and mech anics employed on covered work the secretary has through regulation recognized apprentices and trainees registered in formal programs as special categories and allowed special reduced wage for these workers some contractors however have created yet another category of worker ie helpers these may be informal trainees or they may simply be general utility workers employed outside of craft classi fication these workers are most often not recognized as separate category fo r wage rate dete rmination purposes through the years the department of labor dol had rigorously adhered to this general worker classification system as necessary to assure that not less than the locally prevailing rate would be paid to the various classes of laborers and mechanics on project were helpers indiscriminately substituted for journeymen or laborers dol holds wage rates would be depressed and the intent of congress in crafting the davisbac on act would be subverted in 1979 the carter administration began general review of davisbacon including the helper issue new regula tions were issued in january 1981 before they could be implemente d they were withdrawn and rewritten by the reagan administration 1982 through the next decade these new davisbacon regulations were largely implemented but the helper segment remained in litigation when in 1992 following series of legal mane uvers judicial approval of the helper regulations was finally s ecured congress blocked their enforcement through the appropriations process va riously denying funding for their implementation in mid1996 the associated builders and contractors sought court assistance to require enforcement of the helper regu lation dol responded by returning to the rulemaking process s ubsequently dol published proposed rule april 1999 defining the concept of helpers and soliciting comment the proposed rule essentially reaffirmed depar tmental practice of the 1970s with respect to the use of helpers the issue had come full circle this final rule was issued by the department and took effect on january 19 2001 administrative initiatives found count erpart in legislative proposals introduced periodically up through the 109th congress such proposals have as yet been introduced

administration agreed to review and ultima tely to revise the federal regulations governing administration of the statute this set in motion quartercentury of administrative rulema king litigation legislative oversight and proposed amendment of the act the pro cess continued through the reagan and bush administrations to the close of the clinton administration and beyond to large degree the core issues from the 1970s and 1980s associated with the davisbacon act remain c ontroversial among these is the question of the employment of helpers on davisbacon covered fe deral and fede rallyassisted contract construction work for example how is the concept of helper to be defined for davisbacon purposes what distin guishes helper fro m other construction workers on davisbacon work should they be integrated into the regular construction crew should help ers receive training to enha nce their skills and if so how should such training be structured how should their wage rates compare with those of other project workers these questions quickly b ecame source of contention through more than 2 decades employment of helpers as separate category of worker on projects covered by the davisbacon ac t remained matter of di spute then in april 1999 the department of labor published proposed rule on the use of helpers that would essentially revert to the 1970s practice of the department so far as the use of helpers was concerned comment period on the proposal closed on june 8 1999 meanwhile legislation was introduced th at would have provided statutory definition of helper but legislativ action was taken under date of november 17 2000 the depa rtment issued final rule on the helper issue to take effect on janua ry 19 2001 during the cl osing hours of the clinton administration in effect the fina l rule reaffirmed partmental practice of the 1970s the issue had come full circle although the new ru and confirmation of ongoing practice is now in place some appear to be unhappy with the outcome thus the issue may not yet be entirely resolved introductory comment speaking broadly of the construction indus try helper might be viewed as general utility employee who assists more skilled or specialized construction worker normally the helper would be unsk illed though in fact he or she could have wide range of skills but not having gone through formal training

helper could also be craftsman journeyman down on his luck and forced by economic necessity to accept general utility work below his level of training normally the helper is unlikely to be trade union member or if member not em ployed under collectively bargained contract he may usually be paid wage lower than that of skilled worker though for particular types of work he may perform equally as well as skilled craftsman because he is cheaper to employ and more flexible in the types of work he may be willing to accept working outside of craf t he can be useful addition to work crew where manager carefully supervises the work to be done the less expensive helper can be assigned to perform narro w aspects of an otherwise complex task this process has been referred to as craf t fragmentation at the worksite one might expect to find in the absence of workrules that would preclude it battery of helpers working under the guidance of more highly paid journeyman whether such an arrangement is economical in terms of productivity and quality of workmanship is subject of intense and ongoing debate an apprentice or trainee enrolled in formal program could be expected to rotate throughout the worksite receiving on thejob training and in the case of the former outside instruction as well in contrast the helper would normally receive the narrowest possible training more exte nsive than is absolutely required for the task at hand and in large measure the helper is regarded as temporary worker rather than permanent member of his em ployers crew as the davisbacon act has been implemented by the secretary of labor the department has recognized apprentices and trainees in formal progra ms as classification of workers for wage rate purposes it has not generally reco gnized the category of helper however on the assumption that to do so would undercut the locally prevailing wage structure and skills system that the davisbacon act was designed to protect helpers under davisbacon the context of the issue the davisbacon act 1931 as amende d requires that the advertised specifications for construction contr acts in excess of 2000 to which the government of the united states or of the district of columbia is party shall contain provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics which shall be based upon the wages that will be determined by the secretary of labor to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of character similar to the contract work in the city town village or other civil s ubdivision of the state in which the work is to be performed1 emphasis added congress left to the secretary the task of working out the precise manner in which the act should be applied it also left

concepts as wages and prevailing and project of character similar and the scope of the locality in which the work was to be performed each of these concepts has been intermitten tly focus of contention and often of litigation of rulemaking and of congressional debate through more than 60 years2 question of definition similarly contentious has been the concept of the term helper and further whether the use of helpers has been common practice in the area in which federal construction work was to take place as with other aspects of the act congress had legislated in broad strokes the origin act referred to classes of laborers and mechanics employed on public construc tion projects and to the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employ ed on comparable work in the nonfederal sector3 it made reference to helpers nor for that matter to trainees apprentices or other skill groups further defin ition if such were required was left to the secretary of labor although the act has been amended through the years it still refers only to various classes of laborers and mechanics the phrase being repeated with slight modifi cation throughout the statute4 through the years the secretary developed such definitions as seemed appropriate and necessary the evolving regulations focused upon apprentices and trainees registered in fo rmal training programs for example those under the supervision of the bureau of apprenticeshi p and training within the dol the term helper did appear in the regulations but seems to have been used casually without precise definition and with hint as to how it might be applied in wage rate determinations or at the worksite this situation prevailed up through the late 1970s5 an industry perspective business economist armand thieblot wr iting in 1975 observed that the davis bacon regulations were filled with words of art which must in turn be defined by way of example he pointed to the phrase classifications of laborers and mechanics and added openshop firms bidding on covered cons truction in predominantly union areas might find that some of their own cla ssifications notably helpers would not be considered prevailing classifications as such therefore prevailing wages would be determined for them unde r such circumstances the helpers would have to be reclassified as journeymen or laborers journeymen if they use the tools of the tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs4 6 armand j thieblot jr the davisbacon act philadelphia the wharton school university of pennsylvania 1975 pp 2021 hereafter cited as

61thieblot noted that many firms are using or would like to use semiskilled labor for uncomplicated aspects of some tasks6 but unless such workers were enrolled in formal dolapproved apprenticeship pr ogram they must be considered for pay purposes journeymen of the trade in wh ich they are apprentices helpers he explained will be recognized for davisbacon rate purposes only in those geographic areas where the prac tice of employing them is prevalent enough that their classification becomes prevailing one th is recognition he adds will only apply in areas where open shop firms predominat because unions rarely recognize the helper category7 trade union perspective recalling the origins of davisbacon tr ade unionists view dols restrictions upon employment of apprentices trainees or helpers at subcraft rates as central to congressional intent and pres ervation of labor standard s in the building trades otherwise they note c ontractors seeking to undercut the prevailing wage would merely designate the workers by one of these titles and claim that since they are not fully skilled they are not entitled to the prevailing rate further they say by working his employees out of classifica tion he the employer can undercut the prevailing wage rates that he committed himself to pay when he bid on the davis bacon covered project8 apprentices and trainees recognized as such by dol cause few problems in the view of the building and construction trad department bctd aflcio it is the informal and often imprecise titles of helper and trainee the bctd notes that have provoked conf lict there is evidence that most of these trainees and helpers are anything but temporary employees who are released when their work on the project is completed dols restricti on on the use of helpers strikes at one of the wagecutting devices by which nonunion contractors can achieve the advantage they need to be able more frequently to underbid union contractors on federally funded work and the bctd adds the us of helpers at subcraft wages was one of the abuses the davisbac on act was intende d to remedy9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs5 10 federal register december 28 1979 pp 7702977030 11 ibid p 77083administrative reform of the helper provisions by the late 1970s campaign was underway for reform or repeal of davis bacon ultimately the effort would take two forms direct legislation or conversely reform through the regulatory process the former of course would require action by congress wh ich while it had often revi ewed the davisbacon act had not altered it substantia lly the latter regulatory reform could be undertaken unilaterally by the administration the carter administra tion regulations 19791981 in late december 1979 the carter ad ministration published proposed rule revising the administration of davisbac on and among other elements adding the following language section 17d d classification and wage and fringe benefit rates will be issued only for identifiable classes of laborers and mechanics distinctions between classifications are based upon differences in the work performed not upon skill and supervisory functions semiskilled classification of laborers or helpers for example is issued when the classifica tion as utilized in the area performs scope of duties which distinguishes it from other classifications in the area prevailing wages for apprentices and trainees are not issued on wage determinations but their use is permitted10 emphasis added thus the proposed rule would establish tw tests for designation of special wage rate for helpers first that helpers are utilized in th area of the proposed work and second that the helper is distinguishable fro m other classificati ons of laborers and mechanics later the proposed rule sp ecifically defined laborer mechanic apprentice and trainee but for what ever reason omitted any definition of helper11 in midjanuary 1981 as the carter admin istration was drawing to close final rule was published in an introduc tion dol explained its position concerning the use of helpers numerous comment ers shared the opinion that the policy of permitting only employment of apprenti ces and trainees under bat bureau of apprenticeship and training approved pr ograms was denying job opportunities to youths minorities and women the department noted however that recognized programs of apprenticeship and other type s of training were available to young persons minorities and women and affirmed that through that vehicle it could be assured that the training is real and is not subterfuge through which to lock such workers into low paying unskilled jobs the department stressed that payment of reduced wages to apprentices and trainees was an exception to the requirements of the davisbacon act and that strict c onditions must be maintained in order tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs6 12 dlr january 19 1981 p g2 13 ibid pp g8 g10 14 ibid p h9 15 ibid p h5 16 dlr august

circumvention of the acts requirements12 but while the terms apprentice and trainee were defined in th final rule once again helper was not13 in its discussion of wage determinations the dol expl ained that differences in rates would be based upon d ifferences in the work performed not upon skill and supervisory functions14 and further dol explained in any given classification individual skill levels will vary from employee to employee and any attempt to measure and issue rates on that basis is administratively impossible and could throw the procurement into complete confusion15 from this assertion one might infer the difficulties that the department anticipated were it to recognize the use of helpers and to determine an appropriate locally prevailing wage rate for these workers three weeks into the reagan administration on february 6 1981 the department announced delay in implementation of the davisbacon regulations then it withdrew them for further review the reagan administrati on regulations 1981 ff consideration of the helper issue during the reagan era falls into three periods issuance of proposed rule august 1981 publication of final rule may 1982 and subsequent litigation continuing through the remainder of the reagan administration the proposed rule 1981 on august 14 1981 the reagan administration issued new proposed ru governing the davisbacon act and called for comment the department agreed to allow helper classification on wage determinations when the classification is identifiable in the locality it noted implementation of this proposal would pr ovide recognition of widespread practice in the construction industry and thus allow wage deter minations to reflect actual classification practices and rates16 the dol pointed out that it had long recognized the helper category under certain carefully defined circumstances but it concluded the practice had been too restrictive the new proposed regulation would issue helper wage dete rminations when they can be identified in the locality not only when they are found to be prevailing as in prior practice it noted that the concept of helper would be broadly defined in the regulation and permitted in ratio of one he lper to five journeymen17httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs7 18 ibid p e11 19 ibid p e10 20 ibid p e15 21 ibid p e17 22 dlr may 28 1982 p a4 23 ibid p e4 24 ibid p e8 25 ibid

administration the new regulations stated that the purpose was to provide for the increased use of helpers whenever they are utilized in the area19 the concept of helper was now specifically defined as component of the terms laborer or mechanic helper is semiskilled worker rather than skilled journeyman mechanic who works under the direction of and assists journeyman under the journeymans direction and supervision the helper performs variety of duties to assist the journeyman such as prepar ing carrying and furnishing materials tools equipment and supplies and main taining them in order cleaning and preparing work areas lifting positioning and holding materials or tools and other related semiskilled tasks as directed by the journeyman helper may use tools of the trade at and under th direction and supervision of the journeyman the particular duties performed by helper vary according to area practice20 where worker is on the payroll as helper but does not meet the regulatory definition of helper or helper on the job site is in excess of the ratio permitted he or she would be paid the rate for the classification of wo rk actually performed21 following publication of the proposed rule august 1981 the department received approximately 2200 co mments more than 1000 dealt specifically with the helper issue22 the final rule 1982 final davisbacon ru was issued on may 28 1995 dol explained that its prior restric tive approach with respect to the use of helpers had been inappropriate23 in setting forth new standard dol rejected the concerns of trade unionists while concurring in the views of industry going beyond the rule as proposed in august 1981 dol ffirmed that it had decided to raise the ceiling from one helper for every five jour neymen to two helpers for every three journeymen the higher ratio will better reflect the wide diversity in practices among different types of construction and localities24 the new ratio would allow up to 40 of

in the new regulation also noting the projected cost savings30 the american farm bureau federation commended the reagan administration for its revision of the regulations31 and the us chamber of

that the business community is hailing as major improvement the new davis bacon rules32 litigation 19821983 in late may 1982 the aflcio executive council reviewed the entire new davisbacon regulation and noted that of particular concern was the new treatment of the helper classification it is our view that the redefinition of helper is derogation of the statutory requirement that the secretary of labor determine the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics on federallyfunded and federally assisted construction projects furthermore the changes in the helper requirement will adversely impact upon minority construction workers and will lead to the practices of wagecutting and misclassification which the davis bacon act is designed to prevent33httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs9 34 dlr june 11 1982 pp a9a10 e1e5 35 building const trades dept aflcio v donovan 543 fsupp 1282 1982 the secretary of labor at this time was ra ymond j

court 1982 the final rule was scheduled for implementation on july 27 1982 on july 22 judge harold h greene of the us district court for the district of columbia issued preliminary injunction against the secretary of labor35 and among other things addressed at length the issues raised with respect to the helper provision judge greene said at the time of enactment of the davisbacon act congress was acutely conscious of efforts by some employers to classify workers as helpers in order to avoid paying the skilled laborers wage the senate committee report noted that wage standards had been largely broken down by intermediate classifications of labor and failure to retain the strict lines of demarcation intende d to be drawn and maintained between skilled and unskilled labor the whole tendency has been for wages of the skilled group to descend toward the level of the unskilled group this by reason of intermediate classification devices the report concluded by r ecommending that construction contracts contain provision stating that the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics shall be base d on wages prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics the lang uage ultimately adopted in 1935 the new regulations will permit precisely that which congress intended to halt in 1935 the concept of classes of laborers or mechanics was and is central to the statutory scheme under exis ting and longestablished industry and administrative practice class of work ers is one that has been historically recognized as such and whose members perform welldefined tasks helpers have therefore been recognized as class only when their use has been prevailing in an area and they have formed distinguishable group performing discrete tasks under the new regulations helpers not onl are not defined in traditional terms but they may perform any task throughout the entire construction field they are general helpers as consequence ch individuals would be allowed at the discretion of the contractors to perform the tasks of laborers of journeyman mechanics and of laborers and mechanics on crosscraft multitrade basis obviously if contractors coul d thus assign helper to perform the tasks of any and all classes of laborers and mechanics and they could do so at lesser pay they will do just that and the requirement that wages be based on corresponding classes will effectively be read out of the law as the wage appeals board said in fry brothers corp 123 wab 766 june 14 1977 at p 1516httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs10 36 543 fsupp at

classifications of work at which the majority of employees in the area are working is free to classify or reclassify grade or subgrade traditiona l craft work as he wishes such contractor can with respect to wage rates take almost any job away from the group of contractors and the employees w ho work for them who have established the locality wage standard there will be little left to the davisbacon act moreover under existing administrative practice helper classification is recognized only if it is prevailing in particular area under the new regulations the use of helpers need only be identifiable to be recognized yet the statute itself refers to wages prevailing for classes not to wages identified for classes the effect of th is change will be that when there is single helper or small group of helpers in town or metropolitan area helpers may be employed in substituti on of traditional craft workers throughout that area in all aspects of construction work in that respect again the new regulations will depart both from prior practice and from the central purpose of the act for these reasons it is unlikely that when th merits are reached this regulation can be allowed to stand36 judge greene noted that eight presidents and 15 secretaries of labor of many political and ideological persuasions had interpreted the davisbacon regulations without the fundamental changes that are brought about by the regulations adopted two months ago and had continued to in terpret and enforce the laws precisely in accordance with the original understanding judge green concluded such consistent unwavering administrative construction must be accorded very substantial weight by the court37 on december 23 1982 judge greene having further reviewed the case issued permanent injunction against implementation of the helper rule38 the decision was promptly appealed39 us court of appeals 1983 through the spring of 1983 the us court of appeals district of columbia circuit reviewed judge

projects mirror those locally prevailing further the appeals court pointed to the potential for downgrading classification of work for example making carpenter work into carpenters helper work and in the process reducing the wages to be paid after reviewing the legislative hist ory of the act it observed what is clear is that congress regarded underclassification as contrary to the purposes and most probably to the terms of the act again we have concluded that the secretarys identifiableclassification regulation woul d virtually ensure underclassification in uniondominated areas41 with respect to the definition of helper the appeals court found that the secretary of labor was entitled to try to co closer than his predecessors have to making wage rates on davisbacon projects accurately reflect local practice it found that shift from definition based upon the use of tools to one based upon the element of supervision was reasonable the change may mean that some unscrupulous contractors will find it easier to shift journeyman work onto helpers it noted but we find it difficult to secondguess the secretarys view that he can catch them42 therefore the appeals court split on the helper issue sustaining judge greene on the question of identifiable versus prevailing practice but accepting the secretarys new definition of helper since the regulation was in effect unit the result blocked implementati on of the helper rule helper rule is cleared by the courts the unions appealed the decision of the appeals court but in ja nuary 1984 the supreme court declined to hear the case43 thus the decision of the app eals court stood and the secretary of labor was left to restructure the helper re gulation in order to win judicial approval on january 31 1985 dol implemented the

suggested that simply to state that the helper classifi cation is prevailing because mo st of the contractors in local area use helpers is an oversimplificati on therefore in the proposed rule the

permitting dol to implement the helper regulation47 almost immediately october 2 1990 the building trades unions filed an appeal48 on december 4 1990 the department served notice that the helper rule would become effective february 4 199149 thereafter it would begin surveying for helper use contractors were asked toreport the number of helpers apprentices and trainees they employ in each craft as well as their wage rates 50 at this point congress interceded the dire emergency supplemental appropriations bill of april 10 1991 pl 10227 provided that funds shall be expended by the secretary of labor to implement or administer the helper regulations title iii section 30351 thus dol was barred from further activity through the end of that fiscal year with re spect to the helper regulation whether the restriction was temporary or permanent became subject of dispute in late september 1991 bctd president robert georgine urged labor secretary lynn martin to withhold implementation until th judicial appeal had been completed52 when dol sought funding in its fy1992 budget request to implement the helper regulation the request was turned dow n both in the house and the senate53 the new dol

ruled that the ratio of helpers to journeymen two helpers to three journeymen was arbitrary and capricious and theref ore this one provision was declared invalid55 in the opinion of the court the ra tio was purely arbitrary choice without rational decision making it noted such an unsubstantiated imposition of fixed ratio in regulatory scheme based on statute designed to implement pr evailing practices represents the very essence of arbitrariness it is true that regulation must be sustained as long as the agency has articulated reasonable basis for its decision here however all the agency has done is to state that 23 ratio better reflects industry use of helpers than did the 15 ratio to state conclusion is not to reason the matter was sent back to the department56 two months later on

loss of not implementing the regulations at over 250000 jobs62 senator harkin opposed the nicklescr aig proposal recalling that the helper regulations were already decade old to delay their implementation for one year would allow the new clinton administration time to evaluate them he protested that the helper regulations as drawn w ould have disproportionately high impact upon employment of minority workers and an adverse impact for apprentice training programs these minority and female labor ers will face an immediate reduction in employment or they will be reclassed sic as helpers by the contractors who seek to remain competitive on federa l construction again with an accompanying reduction in wages and fringe benefits finally the senator from iowa mr harkin disputed

intended to help66 conversely representative w illiam ford declared that the davisbacon requirement prevents wages and benefits in local communities from being undermined ensures quality construction and saves money in the long run representative ford stated that implementation of the regulation would allow contractors to shift work from highly productive journeymen to lower stilled and lower paid helpers this would under mine apprenticeship training programs he argued because contractors would substitute helpers for apprentices both of these practices run contrary to the goal of creating high skilled high paying jobs in the nation instead of low skilled dead end work finally representative ford noted that the department had dvised him of its intention to issue revised helpers regulations within the upcoming fiscal year the appropriations language he stated will allow the conclusion of the administrative process and he urged that the delay amendment be defeated67 following review of the issues the delay amendment was defeated by voice vote the language prohibiting implementation of the helper regulations was retained in the bill68 legislative initiatives of the 104th congress

department it appears responded qui ckly month later in late july 1996 assistant secretary of labor bern ard anderson affirmed that the current helper regulation approved but still suspended simp ly is nonadministrable anderson explained that the distinction be tween helpers and other workers in terms of their role and duties was insufficiently clear and that the department had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form77 the policy voiced by anderson was set forth in more detail few days later in the federal register of august 2 1996 the dol observed fourteen years have passed since the department first promulgated the helpe r regulation and more than four years have passed since the department last attempted to put revised version of that regulation in effect during the extended period of time in which the regulation was suspended dol note d additional information has become available which warrants review of the suspe nded rule the rule had originally been crafted in part the department explained in the belief that it would result in construction workforce on fede ral construction projects th at more closely mirrored the private construction workforces widespr ead use of helpers and at the same time effect significant cost savings in federal construction costs the federal register notice continued data developed from the departments experience implementing the helper regulation which was not available during the rulemaking proceedings and upon which the public has had opportunity to comment reveals that the use of helpers might not be as widesp read as previously thought the department expressed concern tha t the helper regulation may create an unwarranted potential for abuse of the help er classification to justify payment of wages which are less than the prevailing wage in the area it also expressed concern about the possible impact of the helper regulations on formal apprenticeship and training programs for these and other reasons including the obvious congressional controversy over the regulation dol conc luded that the basis and effect of the semiskilled helper regulation should be reexamined78 dol recalled that there had been pub lic comment upon the helper regulation as revised to meet court re quirements further it sugge sted were the courtapproved rule implementation of whic h had been withheld by action of the congress to be given effect on an interim basis during further review of the issue by the department such action would create unw arranted disruption and uncertainty for both federal agencies and the contracting community therefore dol determined that the suspension would continue while the department engages in substantive rulemaking concerning the helper regulations79 the department requested comment from the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs19 final suspension december 1996 nearly five months passed during which the department received and evaluated comments solicited in its august federal register notice some 47 submissions were received from interested industry nd trade union groups and others few of the comments the department noted addressed the issue immediately at hand namely continuing interim suspension of the helper rule most dealt with the substantive issues embodied in the rule itself on the question of the interim suspension the building and construction trades department aflcio concurred in the view of the department that the interim suspension was the most prudent and re sponsible action under the circumstances the associated general contractors agc disagreed arguing that implementation could be effected relatively quickly perhaps 60 days and with little disruption and further that the reevaluation process oug ht not to be prolonged dol at some length disputed the agc contention the department believes that it would take substantially longer than 60 days to fully implement the helper regulations this view is fully supported by the departments past experience with the helper regulations if the department were to begin implementation of the suspended rule immediately the rule itself would provide 60day effective date to allow affected parties time to come into compliance and would apply only to cont racts for which bids are advertised or negotiations concluded after that date bid solicitations to which the regulations will apply must be advertised for at least 30 to 60 days before contract is awarded thus following the effective date of the regulations there will be another 30 to 60 days before contracts potentially containing helper contract clauses could be signed the department noted further confor ming changes in government procurement regulations and standard c ontract forms would also be needed process which has sometimes taken several months but that aside dol suggested certain other factors contractor can use helpers in accord ance with the helper regulations only if 1 the contract contains wage determ ination with helper classification and rate or 2 the contractor awarded the contract requests that helper classification be added to the wage determination and the department determines that the use of the helper classificati on is prevailing practice in the area in which the work will be performed the time necessary for the department to perform wage determination and prevailing practice surveys would further lengthen the period before contractors c ould lawfully pay their workers at helper rates furthermore it continues to be the departments intention to complete substantive rulemaking action within approximately one year because of the substantial length of time it would take to implement the helper regulations any saving that might be gained from implem entation of the helper regulations during the rulemaking period would be minimal particularly in light of the disruption and uncertainty which would be caused by implementing the rule while the department is engaged in rulemakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs20 80 federal register december 30 1996 pp 6864168643 81 ibid p 68644 82 ibid p 68645 83 ibid p 68646finally the department conc luded that the comments had provided information which would change its belief that the suspension of the helper regulation should continue80 on the broader issue of the use of helpers per the department affirmed that it had not decided to repeal the helper regulations nor has th department made final decision to amend the regulations the department s it stated concluded that the basis nd effect of the semiskilled helper regulations should be reexamined it noted that in due cour it would decide if any changes in the existing rule were in order and if s it would then publish proposed rule for public comment on its substance meanwh ile however the depa rtment appeared to have reached several tentative conclusions new data it noted suggest that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought fu rther the department expressed its concern that administration of the helper regulation and the policing of potential abuse of the helper classifi cation may be more difficult than initially anticipated and finally the departme nt expressed concern about the potential impact of the helper regulation on formal apprenticeship and training programs81 while the department expressed its willingness to explore further the extent of private sector helper utilization and related costssavings impacts the potential for abuse appeared to present rger problem dol explained the department notes that the helper cl assification as currently defined is unique in being based on subjective standards such as skill level and supervision rather than an objective test of work performed the department is concerned that such subjective standard may be more difficult to enforce82 the department observed that the helper classification alone under davisbacon is defined with duties that are specifically intended to overlap with the duties performed by other classifi cations thus rendering forcement and administration likely more difficult than the authors of the various versions of the helper regulation anticipated83 critics of the regulation t hen suspended expressed concern about its potential impact for apprenticeship and training they claim that the ability to pay apprentices wage lower than that paid to journeymen is significant incentive for contractors to participate in formal trai ning programs they also claim the department noted that the availability of lower paid helpers would cause contractors to withdraw from such programs and would threaten private funding for apprenticeship and training dol summarizi ng this perspective observed that this could pose threat both to industry wh ich would face shortage s of skilled trained labor and to the individual workers who would find themselves in deadend low skilled jobs without adequate opportunity to increase their skills at the same timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs21 84 ibidthe department also observed that bot h the abc and the agc believe such concerns are unfounded some in indus try dol pointed out regard helpers basically as entrylevel workers th use of the helper classification it was suggested would allow such workers to gain experience provide the semiskilled with an opportunity to gain experience nd provide the unskilled with first step to higher paying jobs some it was not ed viewed the helper option as pre apprentice opportunity for unskilled workers to acquire the skills necessary to enter an apprenticeship program these divergent opinions seemed to confir m the departments judgment that the helperapprentice relationship is not fu lly understood and should be revisited through further rulemaking therefore the helper regulation is suspended until the department either 1 issues final rule amending and superseding the suspended helper regulations or 2 determines that further rulemaking is appropriate and issues final rule reinstating the suspended regulations84 indefinite suspension confirmed by the court during the summer of 1996 the associated builders and contractors abc filed suit to force the dol to implement the helper regulations year later in july 1997 the us district court fo r the district of columbia ruled that the department had acted properly in instituting an indefinite suspension of the helper regulations in summary judge stanley sporkin observe d that the department in the fall of 1993 had good cause for its suspension of the regulations given the prohibition by the congress of any expenditure for their implementation that he suggested was not in dispute but recognizing the good cause for the departments action in 1993 he noted the next question is wh ether the suspension of these regulations remained valid once the emergency th congressional prohibition expired on april 26 1996 the plaintiffs abc argued that dol was compelled to implement the regulations once the spending ban had ex pired judge sporkin disagreed holding that rather than being bound by an automa tic requirement for imp lementation of the regulations the department was free to review the regulations to ascertain whether any changes or updating would be appropriate twoanda half years roughly late 1993 to spring of 1996 passed between the suspension of the revised helper regulations and the expiration of the congressional ban during this time judge sporkin noted the defendants dol had collected new data on the prevailing employment of helpers wh ich the department argued seriously undermined key assumption underlying the development of the revised helper regulations thereby creating substantial doubt about whether these regulations would result in the previouslyprojected costsavings on fede ral construction projects he explained the department was not required to ignore changed circumstances new concerns or new

anderson was dated april 1 1999suggests that one of the fundamental base s of the revised helper regulations the widespread use of helpers longer holds true ther efore assuming rational basis for the departments findings not only was it committed to the departments discretion to seek an indefi nite postponement of the effective date it arguably was its duty to do so judge sporkin pointed out that the departme nt ought not to have waited three months between the expiration of the congressiona l spending prohibition and the publication of notice of intent indefinitely to suspend implementation of the regulations but since the department had u ltimately published such tice the claim attacking that delay is now moot judge sporkin reviewed the contentions of each side noting that while the plaintiffs were clearly oppos ed to the actions taken by the department they had tended to focus upon the substan ce of the helper regulations per rather than the procedural issues that were before the court they had offered judge sporkin observed little evidence that the delays on the part of dol were arbitrary and capricious instead he noted they argu that none of the reasons cited by the department justify such reexamination of the helper regulations on the contrary the court found that the rationale offered by the department was on its f ace reasonable even the assertion that imple mentation of the help er regulations would reduce the costs of government construc tion by more than 600 million was called into question by more recent data nd altered assumptions the court found ultimately judge sporkin ruled in behalf of the dol with the concurrence of the courts the helper regulation was indefinitely suspended85 proposed restoration of the pre1980s standard in the federal register for april 9 1999 dol published notice of new proposed rule on the use of helpers on da visbacon projects the wage and hour division affirmed that the rule would reinstitute its longstanding policy on the helper issue86 and would reflect current practice87 it would allow the use of helpers on covered projects only where 1 the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of the jour neyman or laborers 2 the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and 3 the term helper is not synonymous with trainee in an informal training program88 the notice reviewed the various depar tmental initiatives the proposals and counterproposals the fate of each before the courts and the restraints imposed by the congress upon implementation of new he lper rule even when sustained by the courts it recalled that in craftin g the helper proposals of the early 1980s dolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs23 89 federal register april 9 1999 p 17444had operated on the expectation that the new policy would more closely reflect private sector industry practice b that it would effect si gnificant savings in federal construction costs and c that it woul d provide additiona l job and training opportunities to unskilled workers in particular women and minorities however after nearly 2 decades of hearings and analysis the agency had come to quite different set of conclusions namely that the suspended rule the result of the various earlier proposals likel cannot be enforced eff ectively b that the use of helpers in the private sector is not so widespread as had earlier been assumed and c that the suspended rule if fully imp lemented could have negative impact on apprenticeship and training89 new perspective the assumptions and findings of the dol under the clinton administration appear in some measure different from those of the reagan and bush administrations thus the agency that had developed the susp ended regulation and that had defended it vari ously through decade and half now found little in it with which to concur essentially it would reve rt to pre1980s practice difficult to administer the suspended regula tion dol now concluded posed significant administrative difficulties and cannot be effectively enforced in manner consistent with the goals of the statute the department critiqued the definition of helper used in the earlier rule traditionally semiskilled worker as internally inconsistent and not distinguis hable from that of general laborer it explained wage and hour has traditionally identified and differentiated among job classifications on the basis of the task s performed by each classification among the issues wage and hour struggled with in trying to develop enforcement guidelines were 1 what it means to be semiskilled 2 how to identify the line between semiskilled and skilled journeyworkers 3 whether at some point semiskilled helper could acquire sufficient skills to qualify as skilled worker and how to determine when that had occurred 4 whether skilled worker could accept position as semiskilled helper and therefore be paid the lower helper wage rate without viol ating the regulation or the intent of the act and 5 whether hiring as semiskilled helper skilled worker who failed to disclose his skill level would violate the regulations or the act one by one the department dissected the provisions of the suspended rule supervision by journeyworker is not pr actical standard for distinguishing semi skilled helpers from others on the worksite as even laborers and journeylevel construction workers may work under the direction and superv ision of other journeyworkers dol argued the finition does not indicate the nature or amount of direction and supervision that helpers must receive to distinguish them from others on the worksite the definition in the suspended rule it contended provides little meaningful guidance for distinguishing between semiskilled helper who used the tools of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs24 90 ibid pp 1744417445 later the department stated that it would be necessary to develop clear definitions of the duties or ta sks that helpers to each journeylevel craft worker would be allowed to perform this would involve extensive occupational analysis and further rulemaking to promulgate helpers duties descriptions this the department pointed out would result in uniform nationwid definitions departing from the principle that classifications are determined based on cal area practice see p 17448 it could also involve substantial monitoring to enforce compliance 91 federal register april 9 1999 pp 1744517446 92 here the concept of trainee is of one enga ged in structured program not simply an unskilled or lowskilled worker who follows more highly trained worker and who may informally acquire some knowledgetrade and journeyworker with little experience that it allowed significant overlap between the duties of helpers and those of laborers increases the difficulty of identifying helpers as distinct cl assification this overlap it suggested increases the likelihood that helpers will displace laborers or that laborers will be misclassified as helpers further it stated the term helper has multiple quite different meanings within the construction industry the department pointed to the subjectiv ity of the helper definition in the suspended rule and questione d whether any regulatory finition of helpers would adequately reflect the actual and varied practice in the construction industry as whole or even in any particular area it concluded that conducting meaningful wage determination pr ocess concerning helpers w ould be difficult given that contractors responding to area wage survey s would ascribe very different meanings to the term helpers90 use of helpers not widespread while the suspended rule had been based upon the assumption that the use of help ers was widespread the department now concluded that the assumption had been in rror or at least overstated during the later stages of litigation prio r to implementation of the rule survey data convinced the department that such use was substa ntially lower than it had thought here again the problem of definition arose thus survey data may be problematic91 negative impact for apprentice training through the years the department has assumed that formal structured training programs are more effective than informal onthejob training alone it explained worke rs enrolled in formal apprenticeship training programs are more likely to achieve journeylevel status and to do so more quickly than workers trai ned informally who may become stuck in lowpaying jobs apprenticeship progra ms it added are also more likely to produce better skilled more productive and safetyconscious workers one objective of departmental policy as it has considered davisbacon implementation has been to encourage training for unsk illed and semiskilled workers including in particular wome n and minorities by permitting under that act lower rates of pay in structured progra ms for training apprentices and trainees92 employers are encouraged to enter into such programs wage and hour believes that the suspended helper regulations c ould undermine effective training in the industry it reasoned if contractors use

insisted on dutiesbased approach the bctd of the aflcio seems to have concurred industry spokespersons to have dissented the latter r easoned that the department should be able to identify helper classes through area practice surveys as easily as it differentiates among the various trade classifications95 the department reasoned that laborer or mechanic is entitled to be paid the prevailing rate for the work performed according to the local area practice and therefore is classified based on the du ties the worker performs it continued because under the suspended definition helpers may perform the duties of other classifications both journeylevel workers and laborers without any limitations other than that they be supervised by and assist journeyworker it would be extremely difficult for the depart ment to identify the work of helper in any given area both for enforcement and wage determination purposes further the department affi rmed the suspended rule would allow the duties of helper to overlap with those of other classifications that prevail within the locality possibly leading to the employment of helpers to perform the work of other classifications at lower wages thus the suspended rule it found would have undermined the prevailing wage structure96 indicative of change of policy within the department dol pointed to the vague subjective criteria of its definition of helper in the suspended rule that it had earlier proposed the departme nt stated that it does not believe it dol could draw the line effectively between semiskilled and skilled work especially given that in todays construction market skilled craft workers may perform whole range ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs27 97 ibid pp 6967869679 98 ibid p 69679 dol summarized the dissenting view of business economist and davis bacon critic armand thieblot dr thieblot st ated that surveying for helper rates presents special difficulties since it is wage and hou rs practice to accept the rates and job titles as submitted by the contractors who paid them whatever those titles might be without analyzing job content it should be more difficult dr thieblot stated as summarized by dol for wage and hour to determine if the job title masons helper prevails in given area than to determine if the job title masons tender prevails the department denied thieblots assertion holding when faced with more than one name for the same type of work wage and hour must determine whether the workers with the various job titles in question perform the same basic duties in which case the data for such work will be combined for the purpose of determining the prevailing classification and issuing single prevailing rate for the particular work performed 99 federal register november 20 2000 p 69680duties from unskilled to semiskilled to skilled and laborers often perform what may be considered semiskilled work as well even the element of supervision would not be helpful in this respect the departme nt insisted laborer s and journeyworkers dol stated like helpers under the susp ended rule also may work under the direction and supervision of other journeyworkers it described supervision on construction worksite as often an amorphous concept and that it does not lend itself to objective evaluation further it stressed the defin itional ambiguities of the suspended rule97 dol expressed concern that under the suspended rule the wage and hour administration would not be able to c onduct meaningful wage determination process using the suspended definition of helpers in light of the likelihood that contractors responding to area wage survey s would ascribe very different meanings to the term helpers98 the impact of the suspended rule was raised by the mercatus center at george mason university while it acknowledged the difficulties the rule would pose with respect to enforcement and administration it cautioned that they must be balanced against the productivity and costsaving bene fits the suspended rule would provide the department countered that although cost saving features are certainly desirable they cannot be determinative where regu lation cannot be fair ly and effectively administered in manner consistent with the goals of the statute that is to protect prevailing wages for the corresponding classes of work performed further dol recalled that the purpose of the davis bacon act was to set floor on wages so that wages would not be reduced below the prevailing wage in the locality of construction not to secure the cheapest possible labor99 second dol found and argued that helpers are used less widely than had been supposed the department explained that during its initial rulemaking process with respect to employment of helpers during the reagan administration it had been projected that the us of helpers would be found to be prevailing practice in from twothirds to 100 percent of all craf t classifications surveyed except where collectively bargained rates were found to prevail and did not provide for helper classification with more recent experi ence dol found that this was not the casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs28 100

apprentices can be paid lower wage than skilled craftworkers thus providing an incentive for contractors to hire and to train such persons it might be noted that in survey conducted by the asso ciated

1763 classi fications issued was it found that the use of helpers prevailed it went on to cite other estimates nd while there was some variation in the statistics the percentage of helpers estimated as employed in construction was extremely low bls projection set the figure at 12 others marginally higher the issue would seem to have been imp acted in part by the assumptions made about the structure of the constructi on industry and the manner in which such concepts as widespread and prevailing or identifiable etc are defined after lengthy discussion of conf licting methodologies the depa rtment affirmed that it continues to believe that helpers are not as widespread as it had previously assumed100 third the department found that the susp ended helper rule could have an adverse impact for formal apprenticeship and training programs dol expressed its belief that the suspe nded helper regulations coul d undermine effective training in the construction industry if contract ors were permitted to substitute lowwage helpers who may never be come journeylevel workers for more highly paid apprentices in formal structured progra ms under the fitzgerald act the national apprenticeship act 29 usc 50 et seq 101 the building trades unions argued as summarized by dol that contractors and subcontractors who participate in and provide financial support for formal apprenticeship and tr aining programs would be placed at competitive disadvantage visavis contractors using he lpers and that the use of helpers thus would undermine the apprentice training program the unions also expressed concern dol noted that the suspended rules failure to encourage formal craft training would eventually lead to severe shortage of skilled craft workers in the industry this contention was disputed by employers both the associated builders and contractors and the associated general contractors commented that there is basis for the partments concern various employer oriented spokespersons suggested pref erence for helpers over apprentices or at least that employment of he lpers was useful alternative102 the department however held that form structured training programs are more effective than informal onthej ob training alone dol like the unions expressed concern that imp lementation of the suspende d rule would discourage thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs29 103 federal register november 20 2000 p 69684growth of such programs and result in the replacement of dbracovered davis bacon projects of apprentices and trainees enrolled in formal programs by helpers who the department state d could perform the same work as apprentices and trainees at lower cost to the constructi on contractor and without any restrictions as to how helpers are used it concluded that the incr eased use of helpers under the suspended rule poses significant risk that formal appren ticeship and training programs on dbracovered pr ojects would be undermined103 final definition of helper after more than 2 decades of consideration the definition of helper was restored essentially to its original meaning the final rule effective january 19 2001 provides 4 distinct classification of helper will be issued in wage determinations applicable to work performed on construction projects covered by the labor sta ndards provisions of the davisbacon and related acts only where i the duties of the helper are clear ly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as trainee in an informal training program helper classification will be added to wage determinations pursuant to 55a1iia only where in addition the work to be performed by the helper is not performed by classification in the wage determination legislative interest during the new century at the beginning of the 21st century the last outsta nding rule from the reagan administration had been dealt with however interest in restructuring the regulation dealing with helpers continued in the congress in the 107th congress on may 23 2001 representative norwood again introduced legislation dealing with the he lper issue the helpers job opportunity act hr 1972 action was taken in the 107th congress on the norwood proposal on june 2 2003 the 108th congress representativ marsha blackburn r tn with representatives norwood and steve king ria introduced hr 2283 again the helpers job opportunity act the proposal mandated that helpers of laborers and mechanics shall be considered to be separate cla ssification for davis bacon purposes and shall be paid the prev ailing wage of helpers and laborers orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs30 mechanics employed on projects which are of character similar to the project in question in the locality of the construction work under the blackburn proposal helper was defined as semiskilled worker other than skilled journeyman mechanic who works under the direction of and assists journeyman b who under the journeymans direction and supervision assists the journeyman in series of specified ta sks and c who may use tools of the trade at and under the dir ection and supervision of the journeyman the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections but action was taken on the proposal on september 27 2005 the 109th congress represen tative blackburn with representative norwood reintroduced the helpers job opportunities act hr 3907 the measure was assigned to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections but action was taken on the measure thus far the specific issue of helpers does not appear to have reemerged during the 110th congress though davisbacon has frequently emerged concluding comment the davisbacon act had been subjected to substantive review by the congress in the early 1960s and has remained focu s of public policy deba since that time frequently the subject of congressional h earings reports from gao and expressions of concern by the parties directly at in terest contractors and the building trades unions the only major change in the act however that this oversight produced was the expansion of the concept of prevailing wage to include fringe benefit component 1964 new round of review of davisbacon occurred in the late 1970s during the carter administration resulting in rulemaking process th at continued to the final days of the carter presidency and carried over into the reagan administration the carter regulations were withdrawn and in 1981 new re gulations were proposed these dealt in part with the issue of helpers litigation followed portions of the proposed rule won court appr oval and through the years were implemented the helper provision won such approval only in 1992 decade after it was first proposed at that point congress intervened and th rough the appropriations process blocked enforcement of the helper regulation until the middle of 1996 by that time dol was having second thoughts bout the us of helpers on davisbacon construction th regulation now was simply not enforced indeed dol declared the regulation to be nonad ministrable and suspended it for further review when the associated builders nd contractors sought court order for enforcement of the regulation summe r 1996 the department reopened the rulemaking process and in december 1996 suspended impleme ntation of the regulation until further notice in so doing dol reverted to the status quo prior to the reagan administration that is to the late 1970shttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96228crs31 in issuing its final december 1996 susp ension of the helper regulation the department indicated that new evidence had been developed that would make it advisable for the agency to reassess the basis upon which the original rule and its subsequent amended editions had been i ssued during july 1997 the united states district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department had acted appropriately in its withdr awal of the helper regula tion then on april 9 1999 the department published in the federal register notice of new proposed rule essentially the new rule would reinstate th departments longst anding practice with respect to the use of helpers comment period was set expiring after june 8 1999 on november 20 2000 the department publis hed its final helper rule which took effect on january 19 2001 just hours before the end of the clinton administration to this point the process of defining appropriate wage tr eatment of helpers employed on davisbacon projects had c onsumed over 2 decades through that period the regulation had never fully b een implemented though through brief period in the mid1990s implementation was allowed between 1981 and 1993 the department defended at times vigorously different versions of its proposed administrative reforms then after 1993 it began to reassess its position becoming increasingly critical of its own earlier efforts with publication of its new rule in april 1999 the department woul d revert to its longstanding 1970s practice where helpers were concerned with the rel ease of final rule in november 2000 dol would largely repudiate its helper po licy of the 1980s and 1990s and the documentation upon wh ich it was based congress had followed the administrativ proposals dealing with the helper issue variously it had entered into the debate and at times had endorsed the new helper classification in the 109th congress legislation hr 3907 was introduced by representative blackburn with re presentative norwood once again proposing recognition of separate helper classi fication on davisbacon projects however the blackburnnorwood bill died at the close of the 109th congress to date the issue has not reemerged in the 110th congress
