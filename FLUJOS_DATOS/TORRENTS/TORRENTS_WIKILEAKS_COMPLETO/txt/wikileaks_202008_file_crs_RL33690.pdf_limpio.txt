vehicles and to limit state options to make public assistance recipients automatically eligible for food stamps provision to increase benefits for those with very high shelter costs recommendations to open up work requirements for ablebodied adults without dependents chan ge to allow states to conform their method of reviewing households food stamp eligibility to the method used for other public assistance programs and proposal to allow food stam ps to be used for dietary supplements overall the basic themes of the nutrition title of the 2002 farm bill were expanded eligibility for legal

program provisions of the 2002 farm bill have been made since at each stage major provisions affecting food stamps and other nutrition programs were included this contrasted with the previous farm bill of 1996 in 1996 virtually all of the changes in law affecting food stamps the largest of the food assistance programs and other nutrition programs were made in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 the farm bill of that year included only appropriations authority extensions and minor revisions affecting nutrition programs

inclusion of food stamps and other nutrition programs in farm bills has historically been viewed as way of garnering support for farm legislation from nonfarm sectors however the balance of any new spending or spending cuts between domestic food assistance provisions and other parts of each farm bill has been subject of negotiation and contention in the case of the 2002 bill this was particularly true in may 2001 congress agreed to budget resolution hconres 83 that allowed for substantial added funding for programs covered by the upcoming farm bill the availability of this new money and how it would be divided up among the various farm bill components dominated much of the farm bill debate that began in earnest in july 2001 for example the senate version of the farm bill provided more new funding for nutrition programs than the house bill see the last portion of the table at the conclusion of this report and the fact that the ability to tap the new funding would end in the spring of 2002 pushed the agriculture committees to take up the farm bill earlier than would normally be the case in the end the nutrition title of the enacted farm bill claimed between 5 and 6 of the total estimated new spending in the enacted bill depending on which congressional budget office projection wa s used also see later discussion of nutrition program spending under the farm bill g16g158g157g155g146g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g8g138g155g150g561g4g146g149g149g561 in addition to the debate over how much new spending would go into nutrition programs significant substantive debate arose with regard to food stamps tefap the csfp and support for initiatives to increase the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in meal programs like the school lunch program g8g152g152g141g561g21g157g138g150g153g156g561 three developments were basic to the farm bill food stamp debate the relatively low level of program participation at the time frustration with federal food stamp eligibility benefit and administrative policies and the concerns of some over ineligibility of many legally resident noncitizens as provided for in the 1996 welfare reform law although food stamp enrollment was increasing in 20012002 it was well below its peak in the spring of 1994 and only bit over 10 higher than the alltime low more than half of the decline over the 5 years since the last major food stamp amendments was estimated to have come from sharp drop in the rate at which those who were eligible actually participated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33690g8g152g152g141g561 g21g157g138g150g153g156g561g138g151g141 g561g16g158g157g155g146g157g146g152g151g561g18g155

reform law with its goal of moving families from welfare to work maintained that various aspects of food stamp eligibility benefit and administrative rules thwarted participation and effective administrationdenying needed support to working poor families and others in need and interfering with efforts to coordinate assistance they pointed to overly complex policies that burden administrators and applicantsrecipients food stamp rules that differ too much from those applied by states in other welfare programs and inadequate benefits not worth the hassle of applying and maintaining eligibility finally they contended that the programs quality control system for measuring state performance penalized too many states too harshly for erroneous benefiteligibility determinationsthereby pressuring states to overadminister the program and limiting participation food stamp advocates states and welfare reform supporters all expressed their dissatisfaction with this state of affairs but there was not single unified reform agenda and most alternatives for change imposed significant new costs states called for simplified federal food stamp rules much greater state control over policies lifting federal limits on work and training activities and revamped and more standardized benefit and eligibility rules to help administrators and applicantsrecipients they also wanted major revision of the quality control system and more open federal policy as to waiving food stamp rules program advocates emphasized the inadequacy of benefits and the need to grant eligibility to legally resident noncitizens although they supported reform of the quality control system and selective changes to make eligibilitybenefit determinations easier for applicantsrecipients they resisted vesting too much decisionmaking with states and tampering with what they saw as nationally uniform food stamp safety net welfare reform supporters also agreed with quality control reforms but stressed the need to ensure that the food stamp program fulfills major role in supporting the working poor as its first priority within cost constraints the farm bills food stamp provisions responded to many of these criticisms by easinglifting administrative requirements allowing states to achieve greater conformity between rules used by food stamps and other welfare programs reforming the food stamp quality control system increasing benefits and opening up eligibility for noncitizens to large extent the administrations food stamp reform package also recognized the concerns voiced by states advocates and welfare reformers it included 1 modest benefit increase for larger households similar to the final law 2 standardizing or giving states control over several important federal rules 3 liberalizing eligibility rules by excluding the value of one vehicle per adult 4 making eligible all lowincome noncitizens who have resided in the us legally for 5 years similar to the final farm bill 5 restru cturing and reducing spending for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients similar to the final bill 6 ending automatic eligibility for some welfare beneficiaries and 7 significantly reforming the food stamp quality control system to penalize fewer states and give bonuses to states performing well although in different way than the final farm bill advocates and state representatives welcomed the administrations proposals with reservations about the extent of the quality control reforms and restrictions on food stamp eligibility for welfare recipients g22g7g8g3g18g561 while federal food donations under tefap had increased in recent years and privatesector donations to emergency feeding organizations were on the rise many

disagreement over how much new spending to allocate to the nutrition title of the farm bill the house and senate differed over substantive issues with regard to the food stamp program the house bill included significant structural changes intended to increase benefits to families with children and ease burdens on administrators and applicantsrecipients all of which were largely included in the

families tanf program and medicaid and grant transitional food stamps to those leaving the tanf program eased quality control penalties and instituted new bonus payments to states for high performance however it went well beyond the house measure primarily by expanding eligibility for noncitizens more extensively than proposed by the administration setting up state options to establish when eligibility will be redetermined reduce recipient reporting requirements simplify benefit calculations and conform asset eligibility rules with tanf and medicaid standards increasing benefits for recipients with very high shelter costs liberalizing and simplifying work requirements for ablebodied adults without dependents abawds ending limits on spending of worktraining funds and changing the
