sidebyside comparison of s 2845 hr 10 and current law summary the 911 commission in its recent report on the attacks of september 11 2001 criticized the us intelligence communitys ic fragmented management structure and questioned whether the us government and the ic in particular is organized adequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities that the united states will need to counter terrorism and to address the broade r range of national security challenges in the decades ahead the commission made number of r ecommendations one of which was to replace the current position of director of central intellig ence dci with national intelligence director nid who would oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest including national counterterro rism center nctc across the us government manage the national intelligence program oversee the agencies that contribute to it and have hiring firing and budgetary authority over the ics 15 agencies although the co mmission recommended that the director be located in the executive office of the president the commission vice chairman in testimony before congress on septembe r 7 2004 withdrew that portion of the recommendation in light of concerns th at the nid would be subject to undue influence the commission further recomme nded that deputy nid be established to oversee the daytoday operations of the central intelligence agency cia the commissions recommendation to strengthen management authority over the ic is the latest contribution to an ic structural reform debate that dates at least to 1955 when arguments for stronger ic authority began to surface omb deputy director james schlesinger in 1971 first broached the nid concept congress currently is considering two principal bills s 2845 intr oduced by senators collins and lieber man and hr 10 introduced by representative hastert that would establish the nid position f or comprehensive comparison of all recent nid legislative proposals see crs report rl32600 and crs report rl32601 reactions to the concept of an nid have been mixed since its inception supporters argue that the dci cannot mana ge the ic the cia and serve as the presidents chief intelligence advisor and do justice to any of the jobs other than at the cia the dci also lacks hiring fi ring and budget authority they argue that the absence of strong centralized leadersh ip has resulted in di vided management of intelligence capabilities lack of common standards and practices across the foreign domestic intelligence divide structural barriers that undermine the performance of joint intelligence work and weak capacity to set priorities and move resources opponents counter that an nid would lose daytoday control over the cia natural power base and as result influence they also contend that an nid will shift the balance of control away fro m dod risking intelligence support to the warfighter the congressional role incl udes

as soon as the management structure for the intelligence community ic was statutorily established by the pa ssage of the national security act of 1947 since then at least 19 commissions committees and panels created by either the executive or legislative branches ve made numerous recommendations for structural reorganization several of the proposals urge d stronger centralized ic authority and in some cases the establishment of the position of national intelligence director nid the socalled second hoover commission tablished by law to examine the organization of the executive branch in 1953 became the first independent panel to push for stronger centralized ic authority see page 7 for historical review of efforts to centralize and strengthen ic leadership in examining ways to strengthen the ic the commission recommended that an executive officer be named to manage the cia so that the dci could focus attention on the ic eighteen years and several commissions committees and panels after former president herbert hoover ma his recommendations the office of management and budgets omb deputy director james r schlesinger later dci after studying the ics management at the behest of fo rmer president richard nixon blamed the absence of strong central ic leadersh ip for unproductively duplicative intelligence collection systems and the failure to coordinate the allo cation of resources schlesinger considered the establishm ent of an nid but backed away recommending instead strong dci who could bring intelligence to an adequate level of quality nd responsiveness1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32506crs2 2 the 911 commission formally known as the national commission on the terrorist attacks upon the united states was created by congressional legislation and the signature of president george w bush in late 2002 pl 107306 nov 27 2003 it was chartered to prepare full and complete account of th circumstances surrounding the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks including preparedness fo r and the immediate response to the attacks the commission was also mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks 3 see the 911 commission

principal legislative bills s 2845 and hr 10 being considered by congress historically however various proposals generally have named the position director of national intelligence or nid this paper will use the nid nomenclature in one of the most recent iterations of the nid debate the 911 commission2 on july 22 2004 recommended that the position of the dci should be replaced by national intelligence director who would oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest across the u s government and would manage the us national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the commission recommended the establishmen t of the position of deputy nid for foreign intelligence to direct the cias daytoday operations the commission also recommended the creation of national c ounterterrorism center nctc which would be placed in the executive office of the president and be under the control of the nid the nctc would be cente r for joint operational planning and joint intelligence3 congressional proposals concerning nid position there have been variety of proposals concerning the nid4 position following the creation of the intelligence oversight co mmittees in the senate 1976 and in the house 1977 congress considered charter legislation that included among other proposals one that would have created the position of an nid to manage the ic presidentially selected deput would have managed the ci confronted by strong opposition to the overall legislation which so included language governing covert actions the committees did not report the respective bills in 1992 senator david boren and repres entative david mccurdy respective chairmen of the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and house permanent

ic opera as coherent whole6 dci budgetrelated responsibilities and authorities under the national security act of 1947 are seen by some as limited proponents of establishing the nid positi on contend the current ic management structure is characterized by an incoherence they attribute to two flaws first because the dci is dualhatted heading both the ic and the cia they maintain he is too busy to do either job well second th ey argue that the dci s hiring firing and budget authorities are limited from thei r perspective the result is an ic management structure that lacks direction and focus any discussion of the nid concept invariab ly leads to debate over whether the two jobs should be split and whether current dci budget authorities are strong enough to permit effective management of the ic with regard to budget authority the national security act of 1947 authorizes the dci to facilitate the development of an annual intelligence budget 1947 national security act see sec103c1 50

the nid concept argue that the dci who manages the ic and the cia and serves as the principal intelligence advisor to the president has too many jobs and that an nid unburdened by the need to manage the cia must be established if the ic is to be effectively managed12 they also argue that an nid must be empowered with two authorities the dci now lacks the authority to hire and remove ic agency

structural barriers that undermine the performance of joint intelligence work and weak capacity to set priorities and move resources they cite dci george tene ts 1998 declaration of war15 on osama bin

certainly would not have prevented the 911 attacks they suggest that more im portant step would be to hire more capable people throughout the ic18 other opponents contend that rather than strengthening control over the ic the establishment of an ndi would actually w eaken ic management they assert an nid would lose daytoday control over th cia natural power base without it the nid will lose influence according to opponents admiral bobby inman former deputy dci and nsa director said that dcis rely on the cia for their effectiveness and that an nid would be like the drug czar19 position that critics have argued has little management control over us government agencies engaged in counternarcotics other skeptics assert that establishing the position of nid will only add another layer of bureaucracy and risks disruption at time when terrorists continue to threaten to attack the united states critics are likely to also assert that centralized management control will be further weakened if the nid is not gran ted meaningful hiring firing and budget authority they may argue that the dcis relatively robust aut horities to approve ic budgets and control budget reprogramming hist orically have gone largely unused in the face of dod opposition in other words critics say the dcis have had the authority but simply have c hosen not to exercise it some critics have voiced concern bout the 911 commissions recommendations to locate the office of the nid in the executive office of the president they contend that doing so risks the politicization of intelligence would give the white house more direct control over covert operations and would blur the line between foreign and dom estic covert operations20 they also express concern that congress will experience greater diffi culty in conducting oversight of the ic because the proximity of the nid to the wh ite house will more frequently raise the issue of executive privilege some critics contend that the 911 commissions concept of the ndi would shift too much influence over the ic to the defense department because dod would retain most of its roles under the commissi ons proposal and

agencies that collect and disseminate intelligence affecting tactical military operations it therefore is entirely appropriate they argue that the secretary of defense rather than the dci control these agencies and the dollars that fund them given that the n eeds of military commanders often differ from those of policymakers who generally are more interested in strategic intelligence21 history of recommendations to centralize and strengthen ic leadership the issue of centralized ic leadership was first addressed by the second hoover commission in 1955 the following lists those commissions reports individuals executive orders and legislation that have addressed the issue of centralizing and strengthening ic leadership22 second hoover commission 1955 the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government also known as the second hoover commissi on and chaired by former president herbert hoover recommended that management of the cia be turned over to an executive officer so that the dci could focus attention on the ic the schlesinger report 1971 president nixon tasked the office of budget and management to recommend changes in the ics organization deputy omb director james r schlesinger future dci headed the effort and in his report considered the creation of an nid but in the end recommended that strong dc i who could bring intelligence costs under control and intelligence production to an adequate leve l of quality and responsiveness schlesinger criticized th ics failure to coordinate resources blaming the deficiency on the lack of strong central ic leadership that could consider the relationship between cost and substantive output from national perspectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32506crs8 murphy commission 1975 the commission on the organization of the government for the conduct of foreign policy chaired by former deputy secretary of state robert d murphy noted that the dci exercised direct control over the cia but had only limited influence over the ic as whole but rath er than recommending structural change the commission said it was neither possible nor desirable to extend the dcis control to the large part of the intelligence community that lies outside the cia church committee 1976 the senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities known as the c hurch committee and headed by senator frank church did not recommend establishing an nid but urged that dci authorities be strengthened by appropriating intelligence dollars directly to the dci and by defining in statute dci reprogramming authorities the committee also recommended that considerati on be given to enhancing th dcis management of the ic by relieving him of daytod ay management of the cia pike committee 1976 the house select committee on intelligence chaired by congressman otis g pike recommended that the dci shoul d manage the ic as whole and not exclusively the cia the commission
