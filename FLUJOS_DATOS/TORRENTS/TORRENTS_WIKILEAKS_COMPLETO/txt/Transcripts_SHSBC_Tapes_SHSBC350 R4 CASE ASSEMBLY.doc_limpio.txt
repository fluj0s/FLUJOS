r4 case assembly lecture given on 30 october 1963 thank you well you were supposed to have demonstration today got prima donna on your hands i didnt feel like giving you demonstration i just had case repair run on and i was running right on up to lecture time madly developing present time problem because you see end of session must approach at once and also youve got to know more about r4 and im not at all unhappy to give you lecture on the subject this is particularly valuable material to you in actual fact i can see some of you now that havent got any r4 on your checksheets this is what audience twentieththirtieth of october three0 oct 13 all right this is talk on routine 4 and lot of you havent had this on your checksheets you see and actually havent got any bulletins to amount to anything dont you see and not having any bulletins to study and all of the listing bulletins being out of date and although its all the same as r3m2 it is all differenti can see that sooner or later now you thought i was going to say that youd go into confusionthat wasnt what i was going to say sooner or later out of selfdefense you would figure it out thats my little mechanism here for putting you on cause now in actual fact quite few here allegedly running r4 thats alleged thats all very interesting but practically none of the actual hga class iv course exists at this particular moment thats something for you to think about this course is very well grooved in beautifully grooved in for hss class iii and theres some of you caught in bind here having to learn iv without that being smoothly beautifully organized because thats still to some degree on thehas been it isnt nowbut it is so fresh off the research assembly line because r3m2 had to be patched up and smoothed out dont you see although thatall that work was done the communication of it for easy assimilation by student doesnt exist so im making up for that to you in these lectures you perhaps are also youre perhaps fortunate in this not totally unfortunate most of you have tangled with goals one way or the other youve tangled with these things and you know that quite bit of randomity exists on the subject of goals and old r3 and so forth now weve had this around for long time and it has emerged into very precisevery very precise piece of technology its about the neatest piece of technology that has ever been developed in scientology theres more research hours been spent on it and so on in smoothing it out than any other single piece of scientology naturally because its the road to otits the road out its the very backbone of cases and whether you like it or not those of you who are at the moment in w unit and those of you who are at class i level auditing and so forth whether you like it or not you are handling r4 this is an unescapable fact we can turn the blind eye to the telescope and say there just aint bank and we will sit there and listen to the pc rattle on expansively we can take up his session goals we can do this we can do that and we can do everything else but we actually are looking at r4 thatswould be whats at the other end of the telescope if the class i fellow looked not that he will someday get up to point as an auditor where he will be able to handle this technology and that sort of thing were not looking at his study course were looking at the fact that the pc sitting in front of him at that moment and in every session and in any kind of session under any auditors hands anyplace in the world is handling nothing but r4 materials and nothing else you understand that levels i ii and iii are devoted to handling r4 materials without admitting it theyre devoted to getting tone arm action by shoving around gpms items goals locksi dont care what you call these thingsservice facsimiles call them anything you want to well ill give you an example you remember that sessionthis is very hypotheticalyou remember that session you had in an hgc one time or another and you had such marvelous tone arm action and you felt lot better afterwards and so forth you remember that session that was good session wasnt it well you handled an item or lock or goal in r4 you did something to gpm that made you feel better period and you remember that pc you audited back rruh rruah and this pc sat down there and all of sudden wow and there was this terrific result and so forth and then he didnt have any lumbosis and so on you remember that you know that was miraculous somehow some way you ran out keyed out trigged out did something with r4 materials you did something with goals or actual gpms or implant gpms or items or lock items on actual gpmslock items on an actual goal lock item on an actual gpms goal lock item on an actual gpms ri lock item on an implant gpm or an ima lock item on an implant gpms item ri get those various combinations one of those conditions existed and you did something with it now dontive neverive never tried to pull punch with you i have held up i have held up carrots i have given you hope i have kept you rolling one way or the otherall very factually all very factually because the end was attainable but i have never pulled the punches on this sort of thingwhen i know something to be true i tell you and the facts of the case are that its all very well for you to sit and talk about service facsimile and its all very well for to write about service facsimile and its all very well to observe and explain the pcs behavior in terms of service facsimiles and talk about that but youre doing double talk when youre talking about it youre talking about an ri lock on an ri or any of the things i just mentioned to you see youre talking about doing something with those things now theres tremendous liability in doing anything with r4 materials r4 materials are the materials of the bank there isnt anything else in the bank thats it theres tremendous liability you shove gpm north when you should have shoved it south you shove an item out when you should have put it in you do something with this when you should have done something with that and youve got disaster staring you in the face i dont mean youve got difficulty in the session you could very easily have disaster staring you in the face this is the total liability of working in the field of the mind there is other liability of working in the field of the mind there isnt anything else in the mind theres thetan and this is the mind hes got these are the things which that thetan has been up to over the course of god elp us how long these are the things these are the items that are the thingslook theyre items just like this crayon is an item theyre items like the meter is an item theyre mass like this desk is mass dont you see they have various significances they haveeverything in the know to mystery scale is included in these things these things are visual they serve up like hamburgers or they go cold down the drain its stuff its stuff youre actually handling stuff youre not handling now compulsion youre handling the source of compulsions youre not handling an obsession youre handling the source of obsessions youre not handling an aberrated idea youre handling the source of aberrated ideas you see youre not handling insanity youre handling those things that cause insanity all right knowing thatknowing that i have to ask you to be brave and square your shoulders up to your meter and recognize what you are doing if youre auditing in the w unit or doing class i auditing or even class iiyoure sitting there and youre sayingyoure invitingyoure inviting some comm from the pc see and the pc says yippleyapple yipple yapple yippleyapple and yuppleyoppleyoppleyoppleyipple and yipple yippleyippleyippleyipple and you got some tone arm action or you havent got some tone arm action thats the level i type stuff youve got it or you havent got it and the more you chop him up and the less you let him talk why theres luck involved in level i you know theres luck because youre not directing his attention very strongly so therefore not directing his attention of course its sort of luck as to whether or not he talks about problems or talks about solutions and its luck as to whether or not he has suppressed all the things he should talk about because youre not using the suppress button dont you see and this character might have suppressed his lumbosis and youre not using the suppress button to clean it up so how are you ever going to get any tone arm action with him talking about his lumbosis these are the factors in other words those factors make it an element of chance as to whether or not you get tone arm action of course the smoother you audit and the easier you can handle this thing the more likely you are to get tone arm action the less crudity you add into the session why the more tone arm action youre certainly going to get its that but you dont really add tone arm action to the session by auditing dont you see because youre not directing his attention very much theres minimal direction of attention if the pcs going to get some tone arm action hes going to get some tone arm action this is the level of chance in which youre operating at that level and everything that pc is talking about and everything thats wrong with that pc is r4 materials i dont care you sat back and you saidand you said there it is start of session you know and he starts talking and so forth and he says i yippleyappled on the yuppleyup and so forth hes pushing around ris goals gpms implant gpms so forththese are the things which he is shoving around now you get into less trouble at this level simply because the auditor does less shoving around so the mind will wander through these various labyrinthine things and pick up little bit of charge and blow it here and blow it there and the pc feels better you see but its almost its almost by chance but it looks safe and it actually is fairly safe see its safe its safe because the auditors doing practically control the pc cant get himself into very much trouble now we move up into x and we get selectivity we get selectivity of what the pc is to itsa now the crudity of the auditor very much can interfere with the itsaing of it and shove things all out of line and that sort of thing but the element of chance here is what does the auditor choose to itsa and he could pick up his great big gumboots and walk right into the middle of gpm and reactivate it and then in some crude fashion through pushing the pc on where the pc didnt want to talk about something or something like that mix up the fifteenth gpm with the sixteenth gpm pull the sixteenth gpm up to the position of the third gpm and about that time the pc comes down with hyperlumbosis you understand although you are apparently doing prepchecking problems this lifetime yikyak other things you know and its all lined out and it all looks very fine and thats all very smooth and in actual fact you are doing blind juggling act actual gpms implant gpms actual ris locks on actual ris implant ris locks on implant ris locks on implant goalsthese things are what you are juggling with even an engram run runs into ris even running engrams you run an engram this one runs and that one doesnt why7 well ones closer into an ri than the other some engrams wont release till you get the ri thats holding it in place and so forth that was the limitations of dianetics contained right there in that phrase because dianeticsreactive mind dianetics describes the reactive mind and says its full of engrams all right thats good enough for this lifetime because this lifetime is only partially formed ri ordinarily so you can run engrams and clean up this lifetime to good degree you can destimulate tremendous amount of stuff so you get this condition of clear and that sort of thing you can destimulate engrams and that sort of thing all these things are understood but the final truth of the matter is that those confounded goals actual gpms implant gpms all these ris and their locks and everything else are sitting right there and those are in actual fact what youre shoving around those are what youre playing chess with at level ii now in view of the fact the pc has some reality on what hes doinghe has some reality on what he can runthat is to say if he knows about it why hes got some reality on it you understand so youre taking that first line in book three of modern science of mental health and youre taking that first line and you sayif you can parallel what the mind is doing why youve got it made paraphrasing it see find out what the mind is doing and parallel it and youve got it well thats the byword of levels ii and iiifind out what this boy is doing and sort of parallel it and so on and take over automaticities weve had it in the past all this kind of thing you can do this sort of thing youve got prepchecking now and that sort of thing so very safe course here is to have somethingand by the way i didnt happen to think of this it was one of you who thought of it on the basis of well just take his session goals and do something with them thats fine rather obvious step but very clever one you take that now hes got some reality on what he sets as goal right he wouldnt set it as goal if he didnt have some reality on it so therefore you could itsa this and get someplace now of course you uncork prepcheck on the thingthose nice old buttons and you start pushing and around on this particular goal that hes set for the session that gave him little tone arm action when he wrote it down and so on youre going to get some nice tone arm action your pcs going to have win and that sort of thing but we mustnt avoid the fact that in actual fact you are pushing around actual gpms goals actual implant gpms and the ris connected with these various things those are the things youre still juggling with youre throwing those up in the air like somebody on the london palladium theater you know indian clubs this direction and that direction and youre doing it blindfolded which is pretty good i hope im not ruining the nerves of some of the lowerlevel students you can say to yourself what in the name of common sense am i pushing around at levels i ii and iii well awhhhhhhh what is this well what are theseoooh pretty mysterious actually we know what an ri is it has an actual face and it has pointed ears and horns and so forth and its little model thing that sits in the middle of the bank in some fashionthey dont know what this thing looks like and oooh grim what are we pushing around well thats what youre pushing around all right when we talk about r4 then were actually talking about the actual composition of the mind that brings about all and any of the aberrations of the mind how the thoughts postulates get encysted in the middle of energy and mass and influence each other and how they float in time and how they affect the pc and how they group up into large masses which are governed by goal and all of this sort of thing the progress of thetan in aberrating himself youve got sitting on top of this thing overtmotivator sequence youve got lot of shallowdraft actions that take current energy lines youve got youve got shallowdraft activities that sort of handle locks on locks on locks and still give you tone arm action dont you see but nevertheless the thing which is generating the stuff that youre after which has got your pc held down which gives him lumbosis which makes him think that he is turtleall of these various things are contained in the r4 materials so therefore in the final analysis there is substitute of any kind whatsoever for knowing about r4 the way were actually training an auditor from scratch and so forth from all the way through and were going to train him for long period of time and that sort of thing im afraid youd teach him r4 first see so therefore the materials im giving you here are not ungermane to levels i ii and iii of scientology make my point its there if youre auditing the pc youre auditing it now when these things get out of line in lifeand it isnt just auditing that puts them out of line you know i mean that is not the prime villain here in disturbing the bankwhen life starts throwing these things out of line one way or the other and the various environments of the pc youve got sport on your hands man because life does it without an meter life does it very stupidly and unintelligently the guy has got these gpms hes got these ris and life shuffles them around on him like mad groups them up putsand hell have bad accident hes got onetrains or something like this is an ri in the tenth gpm tenth actual gpm but hesbut in that place its an oppterm trains are an oppterm in the tenth actual gpm so trains are terminal in the third actual gpm one fine day trains meet trains headon and there goes the third and the tenthgrouped after this we have somebody who has to be operated on by the medicos and is worth fortune to the medical profession worth an absolute fortune have to have operation after operation after operation have to have things removed and unremoved and reremoved and renovated and polished and dissected and so forth matter what they cut out the somatic is still there see trains and trains thats whats wrong with the guy now this is very extreme view and the medico would not saywould say oh well thats justwell its one school of thought you see and there are many schools of thought there arent many schools of thought we are the school of thought which explains schools of thought see thats the difference were not another school of thought because we are handling the materials which build and create body anybody accusing us of being interested in healing should have his face spat into i mean ifparticularly if hes associated with the main professions see because as matter of factas matter of fact we dont ever heal anything there is particular point in healing something when you can remove the cause of it thats different operation errorsphysical errors are just about the auditors least possible concern even though they are the thing the pc fixes on the most easily if heif his cheek hurts then he is very aware of his cheek hurting and its very up close to him and he would like to have his cheek stop hurting well now healing meansin some extrapolation of the situation solving his hurt cheek well we dont do that you see we dont move around to other side of this hurt cheek and later on the track solve what is wrong with the hurt cheek you can pick up the cause of hurting cheeks and knock that out and he wont have not only that hurt cheek you know its impossible to quote heal just hurt cheek you see because you start working on it and you get the other cheek and you get his headache too you know its very hard becausethats because youre not selectively picking up these things now lets look at this from this basis you are dealing with the stuff which builds universe this is how universes get built all the materials of how the stuff goes together is in that you come far closer to physical scientist than you would medico but i wouldnt even insult you in that direction either youre dealing withyoure dealing with the basic building block of all thetan and your study isand knowledge isof this beast thetan see this breed of cat now what does he do what will he do what does he construct what errors does he make how does he arrange life around him these are the subjects of an auditors interest if we realize that what is wrong with this beast thetanif we realize whats wrong with him is the fact hes been solving everything or curing everything or healing every error which then amounted to fantastic concatenation of error well realize whats going on here you cant go around and give him one more solution thats what he doesnt need aberration is that series of solutions which have had to be solved aberrations are series of solutions each one of which had to be solved in turn you have condition now nothing was wrong at condition unless the thetan considered it he had to consider that the condition there just before was wrong you see before he decided to do anything about it now theres you can have an opinion about any of these things and usually at this stage of the game the fellow doesnt care whether its right or wrong or if there is condition there but just to have some game or interest or something like that he decides that this thing shouldnt be he decides to do something about dancing girls or something like this you see life is dull so there is the condition now there was condition even if it was the condition of simply having nothing to do there was still condition so the first solution is athe resolution of the first condition now out of we get condition two which is dancing girls solved now if you want to know about an overt act just solve all the dancing girls for all time see thats hell of an overt act if youll pardon my french i mean imagine anybody taking off to solve all dancing girls for all time what an overt act see so thats condition two dancing girls solved well that sure reduces the game but it makes lots of problems makes lots of problems if only the problem of the tired businessman coming to town there to be sold wheaties by the carload lot by his business confrere and he hasnt got anyplace to take them dont you see he hasnt got anyplace to take his tired confrere in order to sell him wheaties or something of the sort because hes solved dancing girls see thats it you see so we get solution b solution b solving condition two and this probably is drink see cant havedancing girls have all been solved you see theyre longer dancing theyre sort of in stages of this you see and now weve got to do something for our tired confrere so of course we can solve this status by introducing the item drink see well thats great so thats solution b solving condition two see all right so out of drink out of drink however it becomes surfeit see you get sick drinking and all that sort of thing and too much drink gives us condition three and thats bad condition you see his confrere doesnt want to have anyhave anything to do now with drink when he comes to town to be sold wheaties or something like that because he gets horrible hangovers you see and its bad condition so maybe condition three is hangovers dont you see that actually solveddrink you see solved that but drink led to new evil because you see were alterising these thingslook at themtheyre nothing but alterises of condition so were alterising by solution so we get an alteris problem nobody solves the problem by eradicating it in the first place all they do is alteris it so therefore they get another one of these conditions so we get condition three which is hangovers and therefore hangovers require some solution or another so now in order to get anything done here at all which is the basic impulse weve got to have solution c and solution c is drugs see you drug the guy and hypnotize him or something like this you see in order to sell him the wheaties and out of this you see come bad contracts or something of this sort so now weve got condition four and condition four of course is the fact that he wont come to town at all because hes been slugged and mugged and bugged you see and so on so were still trying to solve this basic problem you see to sell wheaties you see we get condition four which is an absent buyer well thats great so now we have to have solution d which is lures weve got togot to have better lures dont you see and here it goes and finally finally it becomes absolutely apparent that not onlynot only can we not sell wheaties you see but that we better be dead against them ever getting sold see so to sell wheaties eventually becomes as the conditions deteriorate in selling wheaties becomes condition oh eighteen or something like this which is selling wheaties see it actually did wind itself back to the basic goal the guy who was at the last throes of the thing is starting dimly to realize that it was the basic goal that he set in the first place that was getting him into all this trouble and hes now agin it so he solves it by being against the goal oh thats great and you now have the model of gpm thats how it comes into existence you see guy decides he wants to do something there is condition he solves the conditionand of course you recognize in the as bs and csyou recognize those as terminals and the numbers ive given you those are conditions or confusions which are the oppterms you see that well every one of these things unfortunately accumulates great deal of its mass and so forth and if you could get the thing detached from gpm you could roll it around on the floor and its an ri the condition or the solution equally alike form up these balls and mass and theyif you ever tore one of these gpms to pieces visuallywhat i mean withoutyou know i mean without running it out because they discharge fairly rapidly the miracle here is that we have something to run these things back that does discharge them thats the miracle technique that does so we could even understand them and not be able to take them apart but lets just say we took big gpm and we ripped one of these ris out of corner of the thing and so forth wed have some kind of aof mass mental thin and so forth so that it doesnt have any great weight but it nevertheless has weight and it does occupy space and we could roll one of these things around the floor its quite interesting anybodys got them now anybody whos picked up body weight has just got too many of these things plastered on him hes collided with too many of the things your pc whowho leaves the session looking all right and comes back at the end of the session with his eyes as red as fire and his hair being blown back as though in the wind and so forth has simply gotten one of these things into restimulation between sessions i dont care if you get rid of it by putting in the session midbetweensession mid ruds you see since mid ruds that got rid of it but what hit him was an ri or lock on an ri thats what hit him he went down to the post box and he saw woman putting blackedged letter in the box dont you see and this was enough to key in some ri on the track and so it hit him and he comes into session hes got high tone arm and then you put in prepcheck on him since mid ruds you know and what you do is accidentally without identifying it collide with this particular incident and you come near enough to it to key the thing out and the tone arm goes down that is all youre handling these things all the time as an auditor so the final analysis is you should know what they are now im going to askim going to ask somebody here to get us some plasticsome of this stuff they use in kindergartens this plastic claynot the kind that slurps all over your clothes andand so forth but i think you can get it in graygrayblack and i think you can get it in some pale yellow or other but getting two colors of these things and lot of them going to have table built long narrow tableand im going to get you one by one not by six and six to mold whole gpm from one end to the other and then whole channel of gpms and then show some way bank could get disarranged after youve made gpmshow that it is slewed around and its out of gear and so forth because all this is susceptible to visual interpretation its all visual its visual anyhow it doesnt matter if your pc can see them or not thats whats going on in his bank thats all there is to it this isnt peculiar to one pc this is why you are here this is why they are here that is why people get the way they get and this is where guys power is totally absorbed is in the obsessive construction of these things all the time and so on he used to be able to throw lightning bolt lord knows how far he cant do it now why because hes gone the route down these gpms so anyway by taking narrow table maybe two feet wide or something like that with tall edges and quite few pounds of clay you can make alternate gpms you see and then maybe we can get some black clay and you could even dream up fewa few implant gpms and shove them into the flanks of the actual gpms you see and dream it up see you can make bank itll look like bank and that bank then becomes mobile you can move it around you can move these blocks around you can move them out of shape you see you can name these goals and so on you can see how they oppose this thing is terrifically susceptible to visual interpretation we will also take films of these things and do quite job on the situation but i think it would do you personally lot of good to play pattycake with plasticine on board and knock together one of these gpms tisnt enough to sit around and draw pictures of them because they arent pictures see theyre blocks of mass they have very definite shape they have good appearance they do get pulled out of line and they get pulled out of line and pulled into other conditions and these are the strains and stresses which occur in the pc these are your psychosomatic illnesses and so forth you dont get psychosomatic illness because an ri is called to have pain in the head so therefore you get pain in the head you see i mean it would be nice and sweet if this type of thing existed it isnt you see however that it doesnt much matter what the ri is its about as subtle if it gets pulled out of line as hitting the fellow over the skull with croquet mallet see you got this ri and it is just clanged into the side of his head so hes got pain in his head i mean its as simple as that you put him in vise and close thethe screw on the thing just so tight hes going to get pain in his head i mean thats see you can think yourself into lot of complications and people have never understood this because its too simple these masses exist and guys get caught between them for instance just before this session here we were undoingwe were undoing some bank materials and we had couple of errors on repair getting ready to for long run on my case and we found that there was an item which had five or six gpms grouped and we got this item and the tone arm flew and flew and flew and flew and the meter smoked and the tone arm flew some more and more charge came off this thing then some more things were found out about it found to be two items not one which were grouped they were in different gpmshad the gpms grouped interesting condition but this grouping then did not permit an itsa of the sequence of the gpms because you certainly cant take double handful of mud and tell which of that mud is muddier than other bits of that mud do you see what is more mud than mud you see and you cant do it theyve got to have some spatial relationship or be straightened out before you can say its this piece of mud that is later than that piece of mud dont you see youve got to have some recognition of the situation as long as these things were that thoroughly grouped up you couldnt then say for sure what belonged where dont you see but now you could say what belonged where because theyd been ungrouped and an item had been found which was causing the group an item which had duplicate item in another setin another gpm so of course everything between those two things being grouped had smashed all the gpms together apparently the gpms had been riding there for quite while but this one item which was actually two items with the same name or nearly the same name on the two continuously getting restimulated and getting restimulated had pulled the bank together see so thereforetherefore you are operatingalthough later gpms forming you still had the impetus and the keyin of the earlier gpm dont you see so that was making nice big creak pretty gruesome see how this is well now if you knew the exact spatial relationshipstype kindif you knew everything there was to know and actually there isnt any more to learn about it really than there is about kids erector set i mean im telling you the truth now youve got an item thats called cats and it opposan item called dogs dont you see and so on it solvesitscats solve dogs or something like this or dogs solve cats dont you see and these pairs go together and that mass gets all together and in ball of the item cats dont you see anything pertaining to eats accumulates on cats dont you see it was when the pc was going by this particular period that he did the most work on it but it actually never really ceases to accumulate something you probably didnt realize these things arent dead gone buried and so forth they are formed they are nicely put back on the track and all is well and then one day cat goes hccch and theres just that little scrap moves back and adds itself to the item cat got the idea thetan is very neat so these things behave in peculiar ways now you can get restimulation of that item you can get that item misdated now its interesting that merely running them misdates them that is such slight misdating that it passes all the way with just recognition of the fact but it is nevertheless slight misdating of the item its being run at different time than it was formed in thats very faintthats very faint theresthats hardly worth worrying about although you should pay little attention to that but now an item which is really misdateda really misdated itemweve got the itemweve got the item jewel thiefjewel thief by the way this stuff is all fraught with story materialits terribly interesting material i mean its dramatic its this its that ifs fascinating in numbers of ways in fact the significances of it are so great and its so fascinating that people completely overlook its purely mechanical basis you see you got jewel thief and good heavens jewel thief is back there oh its ages old this thing is really old its about 56 gpms back from present time see jewel thief and the pc has been detective in this lifetime and has committed some overts against some jewel thieves and youll find him sitting there then with his bank bent around and the item jewel thief misdated its brought into present time see hes opposing it so he brings the item into present time he doesnt go back to the item so hes got this item grouped up here in present time so that item is misdated thats whats wrong with it actually it isnt that it had more added to it it appears to be in near present time dont you see when is actually its that long long way back on the track do you see that now where we have then ris we have dating we have proper position we have location in the universe for them very unimportant dating actually not terribly important but we have sequence one comes after another not before the other dont you see you can get things twisted you can get one earlier than the other well you can get gpms one earlier than the other when they should be later than the other dont you see the order you think goes 1 2 3 actually it goes 1 3 2 see thats the way its actually sitting in the bank and the pc will have lot of creak on this you findyou find goal 3gpm 3 when you should find goal gpm 2 dont you see whhooh the creaks are out and so forth now its any disarrangement its any disarrangement like this its any miswording particularly of goals ris seldom misword but theybut the goals and so onmiswording misworded goaloh man misworded ri doesnt amount to much but misworded goalow ow ow that is gruesome things out of sequence as i just saidthe various things things that have been left unopposed items that have been found or restimulated when they shouldnt be all these various thingsthey all add up to case repair and what is very very very very very very very interesting is that all you have to do to repair case is to know all the stuff im talking to you about this plasticine you know you make up the bank and you tear it apart into its items and so forth andwell all you have to do is just put the bank together so that it is neatly the way it should be see you know so that it goes from pt goal 1 2 3 not 1 5 7 2 you see and so that ris that have been found for instance in goal 5 and so forth arent hanging up here in present time dont you see and so that an ri which is supposed to belong to the gpm to sell wheaties actually is found to belong to the gpm to sell nothing you see and youve got an implant gpm over here which is to eat and somehow or another this has gotten hung up on to sell wheaties see and theyre substituted one for the other the pc thinks one of them is the other and in other words its just mixup all youve got to do is straighten them up call spade spade its like sorting out deck of cards thats all without really restimulating any more than has been restimulated before thats one of the things you shouldnt bother to do enough has been restimulated now in trying to straighten this out you want them to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9you want all of the gpms to be assigned to their proper sequence and you want the ris assigned to their proper gpms those that have been found you understand lets take 212 ris all right well lets find out where they belong well we dont have to have the name of the gpm in order to assign it we can say the third back from present time or something like that we can count them on the meter dont you see and you can take your meter and the onlythe only inspection port you have unfortunately for you is your emeter but youre fortunate to have that and these things normally will read if the pc can itsa at all on the subject and isnt flying around in circles in pt problems you actually do have port you can say is this before that and is that later than this and you get your answers and you can sort this thing out you get null reads which means and you get flash reads which means yes and you can gradually work this thing out and you can get all these ris back neated up into their proper gpms and the gpms in their proper sequence and find any of those that have been found and misworded and you can just get this whole thing to draw up an analysis sheet for you as an auditor to use on pc is actually an insult to your potential knowingness because you should be able to use some modeling clay and mock up one of these banks and show all the things that go wrong with it and when youre inspecting pc and youre repairing the pc you should know this well enough so that you just say well these various conditions can exist and they just rattle off and so forth now this is nothing to teach level i auditor except at saint hill we expect you to know this at saint hill by osmosisanother learning process that you perhaps werent aware of but there actually is sense at all in your not knowing this its it has more complicationsnot as much complications as kids erector set now that we know it its just like like fitting together some kind of puzzle game and is it out of order andis the first question if it isnt out of order dont try to put it into order and then youve got your next thing is there any goals been given this pc ever does this pc think he has any goals of one kind or another well lets find out does he have them rightly worded or wrongly worded we dont necessarily have to find them but just find out was it rightly worded wrongly worded and if it was rightly worded whywhenwe kind of spot it as to where it was by count how many back down the line that goal was or something like this you see and if it was wrongly worded we simply tell him so you know and he looks it over you knowit was justif it was an implant gpm and he thought it was one of his actual gpms and so on why weve got to straighten that out theres just so many elements that can go wrong if an ri has been found lets find out where it belongs elementary lets say 212 ri in 212 people found lot of ris you know well where do they belong what gpms do they fit with you can actually without finding the gpms find out what gpm they fit with thats pretty good isnt it lets find outwell thats very early one ifeven if its this crude you see thats very early actual gpm this one is lock on an implant gpm and therefore is simply lock on an implant gpm oh yeah well all right that means its not very significant this one well thats an actual ri from an actual gpm and itsits this many back down the track and so forth yeah there it is number 5 that belongs about theabout the 5th gpm and the pc will see tone arm action going here and all sorts of things going on and the banks getting back together again the pcs lumbosis is disappearing theres great deal of magic connected with this type of auditing that im telling you about right now theres lot of magic connected with it pcs got lumbosis like mad and you say well have any items ever been found on you is there anything you were ever audited on that was particularly potential or something or other or in life what waswhat was your main concern or something like this and well i was just never able to clear see check question on the subject never able to clear sec check question on the subject of eating porridge oh is that so well all right was this eating porridge was this see youre taking off from nothing was this eating porridge an ri from an actual gpm was it lock on an ri from an actual gpm was it lock on an implant gpm lock on an ri in an implant gpm was it this was it that where did it fit on the track is it from the helatrobus implants you see is it from the bear is it very early on the track is it fairly late on the trackis it here is it there is it something or other dont you see so that any crossfitting aroundanything you do on this you seeyou get the thing locate it now the funny part of it is you can date it eating porridge all right date it by order of magnitude years ago you see tens of years ago hundreds of years ago see thousands of years ago tens of thousands thousands of thousands trillionsand you finally find its trillions of trillions of years ago eating porridge itll go backbrrrrr back down the track and thats the end of that aberration see you can this is all just putting the bank back together again in other words you can setthis is new aspect of r4 you seethat you can sit exterior to auditing the case consider the case has been audited by life find the various items and gpms and goals that the person has had and just tell them what these things are like you do an arc break assessment see but actually fit them in fairly accurately and kind of slam them here and there on the track and say its here it fits here and it does this and it does that and that sort of thing well that is an enormously broad field of activity probably could experience considerable expansion probably could be improved enormously probably opens up gate to certain type of auditing which is probably more important than anything except r4m2 see now what does thiswhat does this mean then what does this mean it means that you have to know that before you can do anything with r4m2 you got to know how to put case together before you can take the case apart now if you can do that youre very safe auditor indeed now the rules of how you audit r4 how you find gpms and that sort of thing stand entirely independent of this activity of hanging the thing back together again you dont have to know how to audit it at all all you have to know is its composition and what these things are and know that they can be slipped and slapped back into place again by you thats all you have to know about this and you can accomplish miraclesabsolutely miraculous activities may take place as result of this single piece of knowledge so it stands of course separate to then auditing r4m2 its different type of activityits different process you might say you cant even call it case repair but believe if you cant do this you seeyou dont have to know how to run r4m2 in order to do this but let tell you if you dont know how to do this you for sure will never successfully carry off r4m2 youve also got to know how to do this in order to successfully accomplish r4m2 that pair does go together very neatly so the upshot of the thing is that r4m2 and so on comes after in actual fact somebody is able to reassemble bank thats been knocked aboutby life and other things you know and if he could do thisif he could just do this hed be able to do nothing but this for the rest of his existence and make fine way of it and so forth he wouldnt make any ots but hed make some awful comfortable happy people so theres whole zone of auditing in r4 that you might not really look at as auditing now we get to the business of making an ot and that has all sorts of little bits and pieces and ramifications and knowhow and so forth connected with this it all makes it easier and the only reason you need all the bits and pieces and odd bits of knowhow and that sort of thing is because you stray off of the exact relatively simple procedure the procedure r4m2 is so foolishly simpleit is in actual fact so easy to do that it is very very treacherous bog to walk into you read these things why so theres nothing to that you just sit there and you ask the person well goals and present timewhat might your present time gpm be all right well make list and well get it and so forth and thats all there is to that and then we take this and we check it out and then we ask these questions we dont get read onif we get proper reads on these questions why everything is fine and we list for the top oppterm on it and then we gotop terminal ratherand then we go flickerflack back and forth down the bank and it all runs out and everything is fine all wed do is listits the first thing that falls on the list is probably the item we just call it back to the pc theres hardly anything to this you knowsee its very easy you get down to the bottom any idiot can do it the only thing that gets in your road is the pcs itsa of course is not up to the bank thats why youre running it you see so youre running it subitsa and sometimes the subitsabecause the pcs itsa is not very highis not very accurate so you can find in consecutive order five different separate contradictory present time gpms you try to run one you try to run another one and of course you run gpm which isnt in proper sequence youre going to wind somebody up around telegraph pole with dull thud and now is the occasion for case repair dont you see you make mistakeit isnt your mistake its the pcs inability to itsa at that particular level see so you come cropper and now you fall back on the technique called bank formation and you put the bank back together again you find out was it and where does it really exist and was it real one or was it falseyou know was it wrong goal incorrectly worded goal slightly incorrectly worded grossly incorrectly worded not like that at allthis type of thing and you go over this and youre back into the putitalltogetheragainsmoothly department see so you go ahead with this very simple technology which isall you do is make little list and what rocket reads on the list why thats it and so forth and you take that and you go up to the top of that and then you get this and youthe item lists you do the item lists and anything that falls you call it back and you call it and you get your blowdown for the pc circle around and you say is this your item and do your courtesy steps and so forth theres nothing to that sneezenothing to it nothing to it nothing as long as you dont run into any difficulty see the technique itself is idiot simple but its an idiotic technique that takes screaming genius to run it you see that for instance the smarter auditor pulls out quicker from an error and gets pc into less trouble pull out fast you see youre going down this list youre listing all of sudden that list is getting long you call back you see that the fall doesntsomething falls nicely and you call it back to the pc and you cant make it fall for the pc and you getlist little bit further and you get another fall and you call that back and that doesnt do it and you go up on top of the list and you cant get that first fall to fall and you cant get anything to fall and nothing is calling back and so forthwell thats matter of very few minutes of operation you dont make weeks profession out of this thing you just realize whats wrong youre listing from wrong item man and you fall right back into case repair you see you get another item to list from if you cant get another item to list from then you go back and find out if thats the wrong goal youre operating on youre running out of rr and you run it right straight on back but youre into case repair at once second anything goes wrong youre into case repair case repair is not long activity that takes the next five sessions see case repair is as long as is necessary to repair the case and very clever auditor can repair the blunder which he has just committed in an hour or half an hour or ten minutes depending on the magnitude of the blunder dont you see its repaired right nowis detectedimmediately detected whats going on he can straighten that up and so forth and somebody else has gone on with error mounting up on error mounting up on error till hes really got mess to repair and so of course it takes him five six ten hours to repair this thing see you get the idea i mean its how quick the auditor can detect the case running wrong and this is all monitored against another very interesting point just to scare you spitless another interesting point about it is that if you repair case which isnt running wrongly you will mess the pc up also if the case is running just fine and you start to get your ulcers up and start to repair case that doesnt need repair why you are arc breaking the pc because youre invalidating all of his materials of course so you have to know when case is running well and when its running badly case is run badly theyre arc breaky nattery you cant get much on list your lists tend to be kind of cockeyed and long the tone arm is running at different place than where tone arm should runeither very high or very lowyoure not getting much tone arm action per session the needle tends to stick you dont get nice blowdowns all of these various things that case isnt running well but youre running case at 45 ta divisions and youre getting rrs and everything is flashing big blowdowns and everything is just running like startled gazelle pc cheerful happy everything going along swinging and you all of sudden get worried and start to repair the case the fact that you tried to repair the case will now give you high tone arm or low tone arm or nattery or arc breaky pc you get the idea so you have to know when to do these things and you have to be familiar with the anatomy of the thing the anatomy of the thing is very simple there arent any more things in the anatomy than i have named in this lecture it isnt any vast panorama of things there arent this many parts in kidsthere are more parts in kids erector set see theres more to learn about stamp collecting or something like that by far see theres more to learn about parcheesi in actual fact than there is to putting bank back together again but there is something to learn and it is finite and that is it youve got to know that see theres not whole bunch of ramifications you cant have whole bunch of false data about banks and repair bank dont you see you got to know what really is there is there anything else there theres just those things there thats all so the upshot of all of this is this r4r4 then divides into two divisions and one of those divisions is putting bank together without runningor findinggoals or items just assembly in proper sequence theres whole field of that in r4 and the other one is the technique called r4m2 which is how to find goals and run out gpms see those are two broad fields of activity the more useful of the two the more useful of the two of course is the repair area putting everything back together again thats really more useful as technology because its useful at all levels on all cases and the only difficulty is it merely makes people comfortable it doesnt make ots so it has more limited target and broader application see and probably lot of things can develop out of this but r4m2 is the onlythe onlytechniquethe only technique there is other technique there is biochemical assist there is electrical shock assist there is peyotesquirt in the gluteus maximus assist there is hocuspocus dormaphone yourself to clear there is nothing there is hypnotize yourself into insanity so forththere is none of none of any of this see that will get anybody to ot see matter how widely advertised i wish to point out to you the number of people who arent and the length of time these things have been around implant yourself by installments you see that doesnt lead to ot it stands there as the single isolated lonely technologyas the only route to operating thetan been worked on for long time that it exists at all is absolutely miraculous that it functions is fantastic and it nevertheless exists it however in the absence of the first broad field of how you assemble case you see how you assemble gpms and so on triedif you try to handle that r4m2 in the absence of knowing how to assemble casehuup youve had it youve had it you dont know how to assemble case youre going to run r4m2 dont make laughive got sore lip your pc is going to be in agony agony that is absolutely unbelievable you as an auditoryour hair is just going to turn gray minute by minute as the sessions wander on worse and worse youre going to dig yourself into more holes because you dont know the first broad sphere of how you assemble bank see you dont know how bank looks you dont know where it should go together and so forth youre operating too blindfoldedly and operating too blindfold and there is way that anybody can be taught this as you stick key in the hole in the side of an auditor and wind it up you see wind it up and the auditor sits there and turns on the emeter see and says what is your present time goal i will write it down its not that kind of technique it is that kind of technique as long as nothing goes wrong but one pebble slips on the path and it instantly reverts to this broad knowledge of the bank youve got to have broad knowledge of what the bank is all about now you understand audience uhhuh this is how this stuff works this is how this stuff goes together you can do some miraculous things itsjust to give you carrotnot intending you to you can actually do some miraculous things i dont care whether the pcim not interested now in the communication barrier between you and the pctry to do this on raw meat but i can think of one you could have bunch of plastic clay over in the corner yourself and say to the pc now thats what we call soandso and finally put him through drill hes handling the stuff with his paws that hed be handling in his bank and it looks exactly the same to him you see and it means the same in othertranslate it into english teach him how to talk bank see and the second you teach him how to talk bank why then you could communicate this and you could put it all back together again thats crude solution but is solution dont you see now you have to do that anyhow i dont know how pc an uneducated pcthis is scientologist process man everything ive been talking about is scientologist process today you might carry on this education after youve educated the guy thoroughly why hed be partially scientologist the situation that youre involved with then is the real mccoy all there is to know about it in form of anatomy of bank you see thats it and that is combined with the technology of how you handle that anatomy and you have to know both sides of this in r4 to have anything really like success and not disaster and r4 is peculiar in that it is the one technology which can lead to disaster that is the source of this thing called classification this is why auditors are classified because somebody who has acquaintance with this at all or minimal acquaintance with this who are trained out in keokuk or podunk and is trying to wrestle with this stuffnahaha he going to kill somebody thats all hes just going to kill somebody it isnt that hell get away with it with one case or two cases he wont even get away with it with one case see i mean it isnt that sooner or laterit isnt adjudicatedclassification isnt based on well sooner or later hes liable to make mistake on pc and hurt somebody where r4 is concerned if he uses it on pc pc sooner or later is going to hit the long chute see sooner or later maybe in the first session maybe in the tenth session dontdont minimize it see youre looking at the stuff which can aberrate body and make two headed monkey practically see this stuff is velocity its got scrunch in it find wrong goal on somebody you know the guyshas an actual gpm of something or other he oh has lots of themjust find one wrong goal not to sell wheaties but to buy wheaties or something like this you see all right you say to buy wheaties all right thats your goal he agrees with it you check it on the meter at the moment he hadnt had chance to itsa itthe thing is still charged up you see like mad and your meter doesnt give you the straight dope you start to run to buy wheaties tada dadadadadada you battle your way up to the top of the bank you battle your way up to the top of the bank and you find the top gpm of the bankmeter says so pc says so it all appears so and you start to run it and then find out its the tenth gpm well break out your violin brother because this pc is going to be in mess right now right now tisnt the arc break its the creak its very funnyi mean the darnedest thingsthe darnedest things but theyre all just disarranged elements from the materials ive just been telling you about you disarrange or miscall one of those elements getting its wrong relationship to some other element find something out of the fourth bank and infer that its out of the first bank dont you see you get these things disarranged or you get bank 3 and bank 2 out of sequencethat is to say so that one is where the other should be in sequence you get these little elementary actions and those things result in lumbosis scrumbosis and medicalosis and this stuff in untrained unskilled noncomprehending hands and so forth could make doctors absolutely rich and im agin it im agin it i think they ought to be paid for exactly the good they do i think medicos should be paid for the good they do i think they should be held exclusively to our code on this and so forth and in view of the fact that they would then be paupers why we wouldnt have to worry about them at all i sound bitter im not particularly bitter but i do hear every once in while how they gouged out the kidney or theor thetook off half the head of somebody or other trying to do what trying to get rid of somatic of some kind or another see this gorgan or ear or something has been under constant pressure you see from the bank and so has managed to infect or become aberrated in some particular fashion as physical aberration then they start in with surgery well their surgery did not cut out even one tiny chunk of an ri and that ri unless by some accident is still pressing against that ear area quack is somebody who is fraud and i think theyre doing well to conduct their campaign for doctor quack i think they do well conducting campaign against quacks i think they should do more of this they should conduct more campaigns against quacks im glad they are conducting that campaign because we dont have to quack is somebody who is paid for something he doesnt do or claims he is doing something he doesnt do in the final analysis what they are curing is caused by misalignments of the reactive bank and the anatomy of the reactive bank is just as i have given it to you and nothing more than that now you say well there is such thing as germs yeah there is such thing as germs there is such thing as matter yes there is such thing as matter there is such thing as this universe yes there is such thing as this universe yes thats all true theres doubt about that of any kind whatsoever there is an actual gpm called the physical universe the only question im asking is whose is it but this is the level scope breadth and what you should know on level iv tisnt really very much when you come down to look at it the technique itself is idiotically simple to do and repair is something you learn simply by knowing the parts and being imaginative as to how manyhow many ways they can go out of gear how many ways they can get scrambled and how to put them back together again these things you can learn these things you can do and the reason they can learn them and can do them is 1 they are simple and 2 there is other route okay thank you
