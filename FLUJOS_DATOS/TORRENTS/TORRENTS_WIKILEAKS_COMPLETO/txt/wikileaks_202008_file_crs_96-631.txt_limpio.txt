risks and technical benefits jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division summary during the negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt india blocked the draft treaty from becoming an official conference on disarmament document subsequently india and pakistan have refused to sign the treaty nonetheless entry into force requires ratification by 44 specified nations with nuclear knowhow the list includes india and pakistan india holds that the ctbt must be step toward disarmament and insists that treaty include commitment by the five nuclear states to eliminate their nuclear weapons by set time pakistan has declined to join the treaty unless india does although this position was under review in mid1998 this impasse could doom the treaty by not signing the ctbt india and pakistan preserved their option to conduct nuclear weapon tests while they incurred diplomatic costs by testing test program would appear to offer india in particular large technical benefits the pursuit of which might help explain its nuclear weaponsrelated efforts and diplomatic strategy these potential indian technical benefits may also help explain pakistans unwillingness to sign the treaty unless india does and pakistans unwillingness to test first this report discusses what appears to be the technical logic of both nations nuclear programs to introduce key terms it describes how nuclear weapon works it describes each sides weapons programs and explores possible links of indian and pakistani strategic goals to those programs finally it examines potential technical gains from testing and concludes that india may feel the stronger compulsion to test nuclear weapon operation in simple nuclear weapons of the type pakistan is thought to be working on layer of chemical explosive surrounds hollow pit containing fissile uranium235 or plutonium239 detonating the explosive creates an implosion wave that compresses the congressional research service the library of congress crs2 pit making it go critical and causing nuclear explosion1 thermonuclear weapons which india may be pursuing have two stages the primary stage is simple nuclear weapon but with hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium inside the pit the heat of the fission reaction makes them undergo fusion releasing neutrons that enhance the fission reaction and boost explosive yield sharply the secondary stage containing lithium6 deuteride and uranium adds most of the yield2 xrays from the primary explosion flow through metal radiation case to the secondary they transfer energy to compress and ignite the secondary causing fusion of tritium generated from lithium6 and deuterium and fission of uranium indian and pakistani strategic goals and weapons programs india and pakistan have differing strategic goals that shape their nuclear weapon programs pakistan primarily feels the need to deter india this goal could arguably be met with modest number of simple nuclear weapons on bombers or shortrange missiles as some major indian cities are near the border new delhi is about 350 km away bombay is roughly 600 km away partly because of its limited resources and small science and technology base pakistans program is thought to be focused on simple fission bomb using uranium235 bulkier design than one using plutonium2393 the program is becoming more sophisticated however china is said to be helping pakistan build nuclear reactor suited for making plutonium for use in more powerful and compact nuclear weapons4 both for reasons of deterrence and perceived international status india has long felt need to acquire nuclear delivery capability against china as well as pakistan deterring china would be formidable task the long distance from india to many major chinese cities would give chinas large air force and air defenses few hours in which to intercept bombers rendering them of uncertain deterrent value longrange ballistic missiles are more credible and indias large space program provides technical infrastructure of use in developing them missile accuracy however tends to decrease as range increases missile inaccuracy and the characteristically low yield of fission warheads raise questions about the utility of this combination for destroying distant chinese targets the range requirement also places premium on lightweight highyield warheads the us department of defense reports indias agni missile currently under 1 an even simpler weapon in which two subcritical masses of uranium235 are assembled

to reach beijing shanghai and much of chinas populous eastern coast5 reducing the weight of warhead for agni would extend its range to deter china which has dozens of missiles that can reach indian targets6 india might want some tens of thermonuclear warheads and the missiles to deliver them but building this force would be costly would india invest large sums in nuclear deterrent without the assurance test provides that the warheads would work by the same token while indias peaceful nuclear test of 1974 and its conventional force superiority may suffice to deter pakistan it is less clear if an upgraded indian deterrent would be credible to china without one or more nuclear tests demonstrating that its weapons work india has taken steps that advance the development of modern thermonuclear weapons william webster director of central intelligence testified in 1989 before the senate governmental affairs committee that certain indicators tell us that india is interested in thermonuclear weapons capability he said that indias research on lithium separation of stable isotopes is just another indicator of interest leading toward capability he noted india was producing plutonium in reactors not subject to international safeguards7 other reported details of indias weapons program include pro duction of tritium and uranium and an inertial confinement fusion icf program at barc bhabha atomic research center an icf facility would be useful in the study of phenomena associated with hydrogen blast8 how testing may help indian and pakistani weapons development from technical perspective it appears that india and pakistan could both learn much by testing testing confirms that design works this is more important for sophisticated weapon such as india may be pursuing than for simpler one such as pakistan may be developing testing also provides information on explosive yield proliferant could not extrapolate from the behavior of materials during conventional explosion to the behavior of materials during nuclear explosion because temperatures and pressures in the latter case are so much greater as result yield calculations would be unreliable without testing confirming the yield is probably more important for india where yield has greater strategic significance and is less predictable given the type of 5 us department of defense office of

weapon design than for pakistan in addition primary must have minimum yield and other characteristics to drive specific type of secondary computer models codes are the heart of nuclear weapon design effort because they enable weapon designer to examine and predict how design might work codes are built from weapons physics equations and integrate data from nuclear tests and nonnuclear experiments to model weapon behavior nuclear testing is the only source of much of the data needed to build codes9 for example test can provide such data on the progression of an explosion as the shape of the implosion wave and the flow and density of xrays from primary to secondary code development and empirical understanding are iterative with each supporting advances in the other indias icf program at barc might aid in developing codes for thermonuclear weapons ray kidder retired lawrence livermore national laboratory physicist with extensive experience in icf and nuclear weapon physics argues that weapons codes and icf codes share much of the same physics require similar mathematical numerical and computer programming skills and are sufficiently similar themselves that knowledge of one can be very useful in developing the other he states further consequence of these similarities is that an icf implosion design group comprised of physicists numerical analysts and computer programmers constitutes significant facto nuclear weapons design capability that is such group regardless of its present intentions could modify its computer programs for weapons use and adapt its skills and experience to the design of nuclear weapons on relatively short notice10 similarly the us department of energy notes some of the computer codes that are used to predict behavior of an icf target have much in common with codes used to design boosted primaries and secondaries11 key weapon characteristic is the yieldtoweight ratio explosive yield per unit of warhead weight increasing this ratio increases the yield of warhead of given weight or reduces the amount of weight to produce given yield testing can help increase yield toweight it can generate data for computer codes it can confirm calculations on how design changes affect yield boosting enhances yieldtoweight at least one test is probably needed to have confidence in design testing can answer questions relevant to boosting such as the maximum compression of fissile material under an implosion wave and the flow of neutrons through compressed fissile material thermonuclear design also increases yieldtoweight testing may be needed to develop such weapons and is essential for having confidence in and for refining the design testing can provide data to help calculate the minimum primary yield needed to drive secondary and can 9 there is an iteration between codes and tests codes help with weapons design but code development requires test data conversely weapons could be developed without codes relying only on experimental data from testing but that approach would be much more costly and time consuming 10 ray kidder the international inertial confinement fusion icf program and its relation to the

examine the performance of the radiation case in transferring xray energy from the primary to the secondary if india is working toward the development of boosted primaries and thermonuclear weapons testing could greatly increase confidence in its designs such designs could be expected to result in lighter higheryield warheads for missiles whose carrying capacity over given range is fixed and whose range can typically be extended by using lighter warhead12 for pakistan since simple fission weapons gain yield by using relatively large amounts of fissile material modest improvement in yieldtoweight would enable given amount of scarce fissile material to make more or higheryield bombs testing could aid technical development in this area few tests and little time may be needed to develop boosted primaries and thermo nuclear weapons according to lewis and xue china conducted its first atomic bomb test in october 1964 test of may 1966 proved the feasibility of boosted fission weapon uranium device containing lithium6 test of december 1966 examined thermonuclear explosion fundamentals in device using uranium and lithium and in june 1967 china tested multistage thermonuclear bomb threemegaton device13 there are reasons to believe that india might be able to develop thermonuclear weapon in less time from decision to proceed than it took china indias 1974 test its work on weapons and on inertial confinement fusion its extensive nuclear infrastructure14 and the tremendous advances in computing over the past three decades it also appears that pakistan could deploy simple fission bomb without testing but that few tests could improve the performance of its weapons test program could contribute to indian and pakistani weapons program technology in narrower ways it could help weaponize design ie turn it into workable weapon with required military characteristics such as safety weight volume ruggedness yield and compatibility with the bomber or missile carrying the weapon testing may be crucial for mating weapon with its casing ie missile reentry vehicle or bomb case testing would provide data of use in improving diagnostic equipment which provides data from test and in containing debris from an underground test and would provide seismic data that could be used to help determine how to detect or hide future tests conclusion 12 as an example of the relation between range and payload indias prithvi missile is designed to be deployed with payload of 1000 kilograms to range of 150 kilometers or 250 kilometers with 500kilogram payload us department

press 1988 p 197 201 14 spector et tracking nuclear proliferation p 9295 crs6 in theory indias twotrack strategy diplomatic stance of linking ctb to nuclear disarmament by date certain while apparently continuing work on thermonuclear weapons has certain logic but given the virtual impossibility of the disarmament condition being met the indian approach appears to many to be mainly designed to create rationale for not signing the treaty or even effectively blocking it and for protecting its option to test some observers believe that an advanced weapons development program would support indias regional power aspirations and underscore its adamant opposition to acquiescing in chinas local nuclear monopoly whether indias strategy placing the ctb at risk threatening to resume testing and trying to deter china actually serves its best interests is another matter pakistans strategy of not testing unless india does also has certain logic pakistan can have high confidence without testing that its simple weapons would work if india tests much smaller pakistani weapon development and testing program might suffice to deter india yet it appears that indias strong technical lead would enable it to test and deploy sophisticated weapons quickly pakistan would come out second in race to develop nuclear warheads of increasing sophistication so it has every incentive not to start one pakistani nofirsttest policy would deny india an easy excuse to test might focus world attention on barring indian testing and would likely force india to bear the blame if it resumes testing george perkovich an american analyst of international affairs argues for non weaponized deterrence for india and pakistan in which deterrence derives from the power of each to construct nuclear weapons quickly for this to be effective both nations would have to undertake rather demanding set of confidencebuilding measures to assure each other and the international community that they have not built weapons15 they would seek to verify that nuclear delivery systems were not deployed to bar nuclear weapon preparations going beyond what both agree is permissible and to promote crisis stability verifying ban on certain types of weapon preparations would be difficult at best the preceding discussion implies that the conduct of nuclear testing may well offer meaningful clear and readily verifiable dividing line between permissible and impermissible weapon preparations while testing would help pakistans weapons pro gram somewhat that nation is unlikely to test first under present circumstances should india decide to pursue thermonuclear force testing would be crucial technical step india has in place various pieces needed to quickly design assemble and test thermonuclear devices so that with relatively modest test program it could arguably weaponize thermonuclear force testing by india would likely lead pakistan to test and could prompt china to increase its nuclear weapons efforts and its nuclear aid to pakistan at issue then for both nations is whether the potential costs of conducting nuclear test program as part of nuclear arms race costs that include heavy fiscal burden economic sanctions international opprobrium and the risk of nuclear war outweigh the technical advantages that testing offers 15 george perkovich nuclear third way in south
