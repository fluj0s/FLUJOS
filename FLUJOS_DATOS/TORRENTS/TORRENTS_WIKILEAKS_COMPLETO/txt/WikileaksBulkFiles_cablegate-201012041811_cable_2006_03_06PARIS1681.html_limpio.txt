of villepins presidential chances ref paris 953 classified by polmc josiah rosenblatt for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary former industry minister and close sarkozy advisor patrick devedjian predicted march 15 that student and labor union opposition to the first employment contract cpe was spreading and might yet become major test for the government in any event he believed that pm villepin was finished as potential presidential candidate devedjian blamed the current impasse squarely on villepins impetuousness and autocratic methods which while leaving the governing party and sarkozy choice but to support him publicly had given the opposition socialist party potent rallying call for coalescing against the government he thought it possible but not likely that villepin would be replaced but ruled out sarkozy prime ministership as suicidal devedjian nonetheless judged that knowledge of sarkozys differences with president chirac and villepin despite his official support for the government would spare him most of the electorates wrath and leave him well positioned to win the 2007 party nomination and presidential elections devedjian saw segolene royal as the opponent to be most feared on the left although he thought she might selfdestruct if nominated by the ps and believed that the ps would probably prevent her from winning its nomination in any case comment devedjians views reported here are four parts hard analysis one part wishful thinking end comment and summary 2 u patrick devedjian former industry minister and close advisor to interior minister and ump president nicolas sarkozy met march 15 with embassy reps from the us the uk austria germany italy spain and russia to discuss the state of play with respect to the first employment contract cpe and its impact on the current government under pm villepin as well as the lineup for the 2007 presidential elections cpe and spreading unrest 3 c devedjian described growing public opposition to the first employment contract cpe and declared he was not optimistic for the future even if there was some hope that unemployment figures would begin to improve again he predicted turbulent period ahead beginning with the large demonstration planned for march 18 which would last at least one and onehalf to two months and judged that the governments only real option would be to try to ride out the storm in the hope that public opinion would eventually turn against the protesters although the government had promised few amendments to the law to appease public opinion and was now expressing willingness to engage in dialogue devedjian expressed concern that the manner in which the government had proceeded had resulted in uniting or in his word coagulating its adversaries he concluded that developments had now moved beyond the cpe more important than unrest in suburbs 4 c devedjian noted ironically that the students currently protesting against the cpe were relatively privileged and much more likely to find jobs than the uneducated and unemployed youths in the suburbs whom the cpe was intended to help he saw nothing particularly unusual about this state of affairs saying this was what always happened in france he termed the november unrest in the suburbs revolt without message sans discours concluding that it was primarily cultural revolt by thirdgeneration immigrants at the same time he argued against multiculturalism saying that the real problem lay in frances failure to inculcate adequately french culture and values into these unemployed youths and in the governments longtime policy of effectively ghettoizing immigrant populations in lieu of dispersing them throughout french society he called for some kind of affirmative action and stressed the importance of demonstrating visibly that members of minority can make it to the top in sum he did not appear to take last falls suburban violence all that seriously while the images of the unrest were spectacular he said they had little real political import villepin to blame 5 c devedjian viewed villepins impetuous personality and autocratic style as largely responsible for the current impasse villepins decision during the recent debate in the national assembly to let other ministers respond to hostile questioning and distance himself personally from the cpe would not succeed in attenuating this perception devedjian blamed villepin for his refusal to engage in dialogue with the labor unions before proceeding in paris 00001681 002 of 003 particular with the generally proreformminded cfdt that had supported raffarins pension reforms and which had now turned against him he criticized villepin for repeating balladurs mistake of 1994 of singling out one specific segment of the french public for reform which to the french electorate smacked of discrimination and violated the principle of equality devedjian especially castigated villepins recourse to article 493 of the constitution to put stop to parliamentary debate as very dangerous and blow to the strength of democratic institutions he decried frances monarchical mentality which viewed decisions in terms of decrees and offered solutions before discussing the questions ump trapped but villepin finished 6 c devedjian described ump trapped by villepin forced to support him on the cpe without enthusiasm because it was obligated to support the government he believed that the government having closed the doors to dialogue longer had any escape paths villepins decision not to allow the opposition to debate the issue in parliament if only as venting exercise had ineluctably moved the debate into the streets devedjian judged that the current unrest would spell the death knell for villepins presidential aspirations if things got bad enough he held out the possibility that chirac would have to appoint new prime minister probably either defense minister michele alliotmarie or employment and social cohesion minister jeanlouis borloo while judging in the end that chirac would probably stick with villepin devedjian firmly ruled out the possibility of sarkozy accepting the job as prime minister which he said would be suicidal he did not believe that president chirac would withdraw the law and suffer yet another loss of face but whether the cpe remains or is jettisoned devedjian concluded this would be the last reform pushed through by the current government socialists smell blood 7 c devedjian said that the socialist party ps had now smelled blood and had come to the conclusion that its views and not those of the governing party were more representative of majority of the french electorate moreover this was the latest in string of setbacks that included inter alia the failed referendum on the eu constitutional treaty growing opprobrium directed against chirac and the recent wave of social unrest in the suburbs sarkozy he asserted was the best positioned to overcome this alienation since the public and press largely understood that he supported the government but was different from it solidaire mais different this would remain so despite efforts by ps presidential hopeful dominique strausskahn to paint villepin and sarkozy with the same brush sarkozy still the one to beat 8 c devedjian expressed certainty that sarkozy would be nominated to represent the governing party during the first round of the 2007 presidential elections and that he would fare well enough to be one of two candidates in the second round he judged that sarkozys lawandorder reputation would ensure that most farright national front fn supporters would vote for sarkozy in the second round adding that the fn would die out with the passing from the scene of pen devedjian acknowledged that sarkozy having first consolidated his right wing would need to do more to attract centrist voters he argued there was still time for this noting that sarkozy had already come up with number of proposals that one normally would have expected to originate on the left for instance that immigrant permanent residents be allowed to vote in municipal elections segolene royal the best on the left 9 c asked whom he feared most among the socialist candidates devedjian named segolene royal citing the difficulty of running against an image comment throughout the discussion devedjian stressed the importance of running on projects for the future rather than past accomplishments one he said won elections out of gratitude for what they had done jospin despite his record of reducing unemployment was proof of that end comment fortunately he said only half in jest the ps would likely refuse her the nomination and thereby spare sarkozy the need to defeat her himself they will take care of her for us devedjian said her candidacy could fall apart if she continued to commit gaffes such as calling on regional leaders to block government subsidies to mayors who apply the cpe which was against the law also making fun of her repeatedly expressed admiration for british pm tony blair paris 00001681 003 of 003 devedjian judged that royal known for her support for family values and the work ethic tended to demobilize the farleft which would hurt her chances in the second round since communist party supporters would not vote for her note devedjian said that to win party has to mobilize its own voters and demobilize those of the opposition asked who would be the candidate if royal did not run devedjian named former pm lionel jospin but he predicted that jospins age and history would tend to work against him comment by contrast socialists often predict that voters will react with nervousness to the supercharged sarkozy and gravitate toward more reassuring figure end comment sarkozys plans if elected 10 c asked whether sarkozy if elected would attempt to push through whole series of ambitious reforms in the early months of his office before french opposition to change blocks further reforms devedjian said this would not be the case the one exception would be the judiciary where he saw need for deepreaching changes he said he was also interested in changing the constitution to abolish article 493 and reduce or abolish the possibilities for censure of dissolution or the parliament he believed move to either more presidential with the us as model or parliamentary system as in the uk could be accomplished by amending the existing constitution devedjians plans 11 sbu devedjian said he would expect to be part of sarkozy government but he refused to speculate in what capacity although he subsequently launched into discussion of needed judicial reforms note pundits predict sarkozy would name him as justice minister in departing he recalled warmly his february 3 meeting with eur pdas volker and pol mc reftel comment 12 c devedjian was friendly and animated and in hurry to leave sarkozys circle has come to the conclusion that villepin is now effectively finished as potential presidential candidate even though this clearly also represents wishful thinking on their part noteworthy was devedjians judgment that the cpe may yet prove to be major test for the government which contradicts the perception of many that opposition to the cpe has not reached crisis proportions well know more following the march 18 demonstrations please visit paris classified
