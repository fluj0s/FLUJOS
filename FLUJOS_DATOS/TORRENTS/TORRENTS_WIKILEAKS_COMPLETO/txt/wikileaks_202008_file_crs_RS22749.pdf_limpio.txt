issued proposed regulations implementing uigea 72 fed reg 56680 the proposal invites commentators to suggest alternatives before the close of the comment period on december 12 2007 and explains why the two agencies did not propose listofunlawful internetgamblers approach similar to that used to deny drug dealers and terrorists access to american financial services it proposes to exempt substantial activities in those payment systems in which tracking is not possible now and in which it may ultimately not be feasible it also notes that the two agencies feel that they have authority to compel payment system participants to serve lawful internet gambling operators 11 uigea calls for regulations that require each designated payment system and all participants therein to identify and block or otherwise preven t or prohibit restricted transactions through the establishment of policies and procedures reasonably calculated to have that result 31 usc 5364a the proposal identifies five relevant payment systems automated clearing house system ach cards systems check collection systems money transmitting business and wire transfer systems proposed 12 cfr 1323 the proposal directs participants in the designated systems unless exempted to establish and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions proposed 12 cfr 1325a and then provides examples of reasonably compliant policies an d procedures for each system proposed 12 cfr 1326 participants may comply by adopting the policies and procedures of their payments system or by adopting their own proposed 12 cfr 1325b of the five systems card system as understood by the regulations is one that settles transactions involving credit card debit card prepaid card or stored value product and in which the cards are issued or authorized by the operator of the system and used to purchase goods or services or to obtain cash advance proposed 12 cfr 1322d merchant codes are standard feature of the system which permits the system to identify particular types of businesses 71 fed reg 56684 october 4 2007 there are car d system exemptions examples of reasonably compliant policies and procedures feature due diligence and prophylactic procedural components the standards involve screening merchants to determine the nature of their business clause prohibiting restricted transactions within the merchant agreement as well as maintaining and monitoring business coding system to identify and block restricted transactions proposed 12 cfr 1326c money transmitting businesses are entities such as western union and paypal that are in the business of transmitting funds 71 fed reg 56684 october 4 2007 they too are without exemption examples of the uigeaacceptable policies and procedures for money transmitting businesses feature procedures to identify the nature of subscribers business subscriber agreements to avoid restricted transactions procedures to check for suspicious payment patterns 11 some payment system operators have indicated that for business reasons they have decided to avoid processing any gambling transactions even if lawful because among other things they believe that these transactions are not sufficiently profitable to warrant the higher risk they believe these transactions pose the agencies do not believe uigea authorizes them to countermand such decision 72 fed reg 56688 october 4 2007

termination to be taken when restricted transactions are found proposed 12 cfr 1326e the proposal contains exemptions in varying degrees for the other payment systems in essence because of the difficulties of identifying tainted transactions they limit requirements to those who may deal directly with the unlawful internet gambling businesses in the case of check collection systems the coded information available to the system with respect to particular check is limited information identifying the bank and account upon which the check is drawn and the number and amount of the check 72 fed reg 56687 october 4 2007 information identifying the payee is not coded and requirement to analyze each check with respect to the payee would substantially reduce the efficiency of the check collection system 72 fed reg 56687 october 4 2007 consequently the proposal exem pts all but the first us institution to which check is transferred in this case the institution receiving the check deposit from the gambling business72 fed reg 56687 october 4 2007 proposed 12 cfr 1324b banks in which payee deposits check are covered by the regulations as are banks which receive check for collection from foreign bank the proposal offers examples for both circumstances in the case of check received from foreign bank an example of reasonably compliant policies and procedures would include methods of conducting due diligence to ensure the prevention of tainted transactions and of remedial steps to be considered collection services denied or correspondent account closed should the foreign bank be found to be presented tainted checks proposed 12 cfr 1326d2 in the purely domestic cases examples of reasonably compliant policies and procedures would include 1 due diligence in establishing and maintaining customer relations sufficient to identify the nature of customers business and to provide for prohibition on tainted transactions in the customer agreement and 2 remedial action refuse to deposit check close an account should tainted transaction be unearthed proposed 12 cfr 1326d1 wire transfer systems come in two forms one involves large volume transactions between banks the second customerinitiated transfers from one bank to another 72 fed reg 56685 october 4 2007 like the check collection systems under current practices only the recipient bank is in realistic position to determine the nature of the payees business the agencies sought comments on whether additional safeguards should be required of the initiating bank in such cases but in the interim exempted all but the bank receiving the transfer 72 fed reg 56687 october 4 2007 proposed 12 cfr 1324c banks that receive wire transfer are covered and examples of reasonably compliant policies and practices resemble those provided for check collection system participants in purely domestic cases know your customer have notainted transaction customer agreement clause have remedial procedure transfer denied account closed when tainted transactions surface in the case of transfers from overseas know your correspondent bank partner have notainted transaction agreement have remedial procedure transfer denied correspondent account closed when tainted transactions surface proposed 12 cfr 1326f the automated clearing house system ach is system for settling batched electronic entries for financial institutions the entries may be recurring credit transfers such as payroll direct deposit payments or recurring debit transfers such as mortgage payments 72 fed reg 56683 october 4 2007

according to whether they are transferring credits or debits but according which institution initiated the transfer ie originating depository financial institutions odfi and receiving depository financial institutions rdfi id the proposal exempts the ach system operator the odfi in credit transaction and the rdfi in debit transaction proposed 12 cfr 1324a odfis in debit transaction and rdfi in credit transaction are not exempt under the theory that in any tainted transaction they will be in the best position to assess the nature of the business of the beneficiary of the transfer and to identify and block transfers to unlawful internet gambling operators 72 fed reg 56686 october 4 2007 the examples of ach system reasonably compliant policies and procedures are comparable to those for check collection and wire transfer systems in purely domestic cases know your customer have notainted transaction customer agreement clause have remedial procedure fines imposed disallow origination

explained why they do not find suitable model in watch list approach similar to that administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac 72 fed reg 56690 october 4 2007 the ofac system is product of the international economic emergency powers act ieepa which grants the president extraordinary powers to deal with foreign threats to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states 12 the presidents have exercised their powers under ieepa to bar financial dealings with various identified drug dealers and terrorists among others13 ofac maintains an online list of the dealers and terrorists subject to the freeze14 it might be thought that assembling list of known unlawful internet gambling operators and their fiscal accomplices might work just as well the agencies argue that maintaining such list would be timeconsuming effort for which they lack the expertise and which would be made more difficult by the complexity of the law in the area and by the ability of gambling operators to take evasive measures 72 fed reg 56690 october 4 2007 critics might respond that the same arguments ought to apply with at least equal force to drug dealers and terrorists certainly the offshore open and notorious publicly traded internet gambling operators that the justice department has prosecuted and with whom it has entered deferred prosecution agreements
