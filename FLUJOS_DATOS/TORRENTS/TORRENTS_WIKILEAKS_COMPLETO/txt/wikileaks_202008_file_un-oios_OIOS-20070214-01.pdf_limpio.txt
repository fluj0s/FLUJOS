internal oversight services administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the united nations peacekeeping operations report of the office of int ernal oversight services on the audit of the management structures of the department of peacekeeping operations summary pursuant to general assembly resolution 59296 the office of internal oversight services oios conducted an audit of the management structures of the department of peacekeeping operations the main objectives of the audit were to determine whether the departments exis ting organizational structures strategies and key management functions adhere to sound management principles and practices and b whether the departments c oordination and cooperation with other departments agencies funds and programme s in peace operations are efficient and effective the oios audit focused on reviewing issues such as governance accountability doctrine organizational structure delegated authority in key administrative functions training ssion support and partnering in peace operations since the issuance of the recommendations of the special committee on peacekeeping operations and the panel on united nations peace operations the department has made various changes aimed at improving its management structures and has successfully launched and supported number of field missions pursuant to decisions of the security c ouncil the departments logistical and administrative support for the missions and its coordination and cooperation with the partners in peace operations are generally satisfactory but could be further improved according to the heads of missions and the partments partners in peace operations surveyed by oios in order to fulfil the challenging responsibilities of the department while endeavouring to make the most efficient use of budget resources provided by the a61743 0723882 2 member states the departments management structures must ensure that operational and management processes are fu lly integrated with strong internal control framework and effective governance and accountability mechanisms it is matter of serious concern that the organization including the department of peacekeeping operations has not adopted an internal control framework including an enterprisewide risk management process in accordance with good practices in publicsector organizations coordination and interaction with the departments agencies funds and programmes partnering w ith the department in peace operations also need to be effectively managed for this reason in the opinion of oios the department needs to make improvements in the following areas developing comprehensive doctrine governing the work of the department in the form of established business processes and procedures the doctrine should be part of the departments internal control framework designed to contain risks within risk tolerances and sure that the control environment promotes integrity and ethical values as require d by the charter of the united nations b identifying for review by the department of management those rules and regulations governing peace operations that the department of peacekeeping operations believes may need revision to meet the increased complexity and changed environment in managing and supporting peace operations in recent years c better utilizing the resultsbase d budgeting framework as the main performance measurement system and as the framework to strategize and govern the departments work d strengthening internal controls within an established framework and managerial accountability for administrative and logistical support functions such as procurement recruitment information technology finance and budgeting as recommended in prior oios audit reports developing systematic enterprisewide risk management mechanism as part of the internal control framework review of risk management within the department needs to be undertaken in the context of enterprisewide risk management f establishing based on the risk assessment appropriate internal controls to mitigate risks that may prevent the achi evement of the depa rtments objectives g enhancing the monitoring of the departments subprogrammes by strengthening the office of the unde rsecretarygeneral for peacekeeping operations h establishing single point of communication in the department and clearly defined terms of reference for interaction between the department the missions and partners in peace operations the key interaction strategy of forming interdepartmental task forces has not been sufficiently implemented oios commends the department for its efforts to improve current management structures the departments reform pr ogramme peace operations 2010 launched in 2005 included many initiatives to improve its management structures in key areas for change such as people doctrine partnerships resources and organization in the departments current functional organizational structure individual outputs of each specialized unit within the five subprogrammes must be well a61743 3 0723882 integrated in order to provide maximum value to the department as whole in this regard the department has initiated plan to reorganize itself by adopting matrix structure in which integrated project teams comprise staff from different subprogrammes in supporting field missions in the view of oios by deploying integrated teams if properly designed and implemented the department could realize advantages such as the ability for integrated teams to serve as onestop shop function in supporting field missions and communicating with partners providing them with direct links to headquarters b enhanced accountability in supporting field missions c increased flexibility of the departme nt in assigning necessary talent to specific projects without reorganization whenever new project is initiated however should the department decide to adopt an integrated matrix organization it needs to ensure that the doctrine of the department is fully developed and staff members obtain necessary training b expected outcomes responsib ilities and delegation of authority empowerment of integrated teams and functional line managers are adequately defined c comprehensive plan is developed showing offices and officials responsible for implementing the reorganization d proper and fair performance evaluation mechanism is developed to institutionalize dual reporting of the team members to the team leader and functional managers due care is given to strengthening and better structuring the management function within the office of the under secretarygeneral to be responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementatio n of the action plan for the reform of the department peace operations 2010 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted all of the recommendations of oios and commented that while the audit did not fully reflect the secretarygeneral s new initiative to realign the department it confirmed the value and the need for consolidation and rationalization of headquarters resources in support of the field as an important aspect of the secretarygeneral s initiative in this regard oios points out that in view of the general assemblys request the main objective of the present audit was to assess whether the departments current structures adhered to sound management practice in providing political logistical and administrative support to peace missi ons led by the department the scope of the audit did not include review of the organizations overall management structure in guiding and supporting all other pea ce operations including peacemaking peacebuilding and special political field operations a61743

in its mandate the department of peacekeeping operations serves as the operational arm of the secretarygene ral for all united na tions peacekeeping operations and is responsible for the conduct management direction planning and preparation of those operations 1 2 the implementation of the recommendations contained in the august 2000 report of the panel on united nations peace operations 2 known as the brahimi report was the most important driver responsible for the current management structure of the department the secretarygeneral convened the panel in 2000 to assess the shortcomings of the existing systems and to make recommendations for change the panel provided advice on the minimum resource requirements of the department and other departments involve d in peace operations which the member states have generally approved the secretarygeneral subsequently issued comprehensive reports discussing the implementation of the recommendations of the brahimi report 3 the recent reform initiatives of the secretarygeneral included in his investing in th united nations reports4 are also in part rooted in the brahimi report the office of internal oversight services oios considered relevant issues discussed in those reports 3 in october 2005 the department initiated the peace operations 2010 reorganization programme in which series of reforms were proposed in response to the reality of present day peacekeeping and the ssessment of the cycle of changes started by the brahimi report oios supports the selfevaluations and the spirit of the reform the department is undertaking and is cognizant that the task of reinvigorating the department is necessar but also challenging the present report considers the findings of the departments five working groups on people doctrine partnerships resources and organization wh ich were established as part of the peace operations 2010 reform programme 4 oios conducted an audit of the departments management structures pursuant to general assembly resolution 59296 the audit objectives were to determine whether the departments existing organizational structures strategies and key management functions adhered to the principles of sound management practice to effectively guide peace ope rations and provide logistical and administrative support to missions b whether the departments interac tion coordination and cooperation with other secretariat departments agencies funds and programmes in peace operations are efficient and effective 5 owing to the wide range of issues related to the subject the scope of the audit was limited to reviewing the departments management structures for governance accountability organizational structure doctrine delegated authority for key administrative functions training mission support and partnership with other departments offices funds and programmes __________________ 1 see stsgb20009 2 see a55305s2000809 3 a55502 and a55977 4 a60692 and corr1 and a60846 and add

organizations overall management structure in guiding and supporting peace operations including peacemaking peacebuilding and special political field operations not led by the department th critical findings and recommendations concerning the departments management structures and interaction with other partners in peace operations outlined in pr ior reports of the board of auditors and oios especially the oios report on the comprehensive management audit of the department conducted in 2005 5 were taken into account the audit also analysed and validated the views of department personnel heads of missions and key partners in peace operations as solicited through survey questionnaires and interviews ii mandate and changes to th organizational structure of the department 7 the department of peacekeeping operat ions was created in 1992 and replaced the office for special political affairs6 to better meet the needs arising from general shift in the purpose of pea cekeeping missions from the traditional monitoring and observer operations to larger and more complex mandates in 1993 the administrative and logistical support capacity for the field missions was transferred to the department of peacek eeping operations from the department of management and is currently housed in the office of mission support of the department of peacekeeping operations 8 another significant change to the departments organizational structure resulted from the implementation of the recommendations of the brahimi report 7 total of 184 additional posts were provided to the department significantly enhancing the military and police divi sions the personnel management and support service and the office of operati ons among others the peacekeeping best practices section and the change manageme nt office were also established under the office of the undersecretarygeneral 9 in recent years the departments operations and responsibilities have been further expanded the total peacekeeping budget under the departments responsibility increased from 27 billion in the period 200102 to 5 billion in 200506 including resources for the departments support for 15 active peacekeeping missions with more than 84000 personnel combined as shown in table 1 __________________ 5 a60717 6 see stsgb248 7 see a58746 a61743 7 0723882 table 1 trends in peacekeeping operations

676 54 375 66 806 77 076 84 581 source a60696 10 the security council has instructed that more mandates of field missions should be of multidimensional integrated nature in addition the department has been providing logistical and admini strative support to the political and peacebuilding missions managed by the depa rtment of political affairs there are 14 such missions including four for which the department has both substantive and political responsibility in previous report oios recommended that the departments mandate be revised to reflect its substantive responsibility for special political missions 8 the department accepted that recommendation 11 at the same time the departments organizational structure has undergone significant change since 20 01 for example the military and police divisions and the mine action service have been reorganized to report directly to the under secretarygeneral also the integrated training service was created as recommended by the special committee on pe acekeeping operatio ns to combine multiple training units9 as result of these changes the respective roles responsibilities and reporting lines of these important activities have changed significantly 12 the departments organizational co mponents are arranged into five main subprogrammes the office of operations the office of mission support the military division the police division and the mine action service the subprogrammes consist of various divisions services sections and units responsible for furtherdefined speciali zed activities forming typi cal functional organizational structure as shown in the annex below 13 the results of oios surveys and interviews indicated that despite the efforts of senior management some staff members of the department did not believe that they were adequately informed of the refo rm changes and initiatives likewise the departments organizational structures were not clear to most of its partners and field missions in the opinion of oios this was due mainly to the fact that the __________________ 8 see a61357 9 official records of the general assembly fiftyninth session supplement 19 a5919 part one 123 a61743 0723882 8 secretarygenerals bulletin officially promulgating changes in the functions and organization of the department had not been updated since 200010 iii governance accountab ility and delegated authority 14 in order to fulfil the challenging responsibilities of managing peace operations while efficiently using budget resources provided by the member states the departments management structures must provide strong governance and accountability as pointed out in the report of the secretarygeneral investing in the united nations for stronger organization worldwide accountability11 comprehensive system of accountability is based on the premises that responsibility must be clearly defined managers and st aff must have the resources capacity and authority to carry out their respective responsibilities and accountability must be established at all levels through appropriate mechanisms oios found that the governance and accountability provided by the departments current management structures should be strengthened in number of areas doctrine development 15 one of the main responsibilities of the departments management is to ensure that all staff receive proper guidance and ar informed about what they are expected to achieve how they should perform assigned tasks and what they are accountable for in carrying out their duties this should be accomplished by establishing formal processes and procedures governing the work of the department to serve as the foundation for the multidimensional peacekeeping doctrine and management culture formal processes and procedures should also serve as control tools contributing to improved consistency in th departments operations and successful achievement of its objectives the doctrine should be part of the departments internal control framework designed to c ontain risks within risk tolerances and ensure that the control environment promotes integrity and ethical values as required by the charter of the united nations 16 however the department does not have comprehensive doctrine that includes formal standard processes and pr ocedures as result the departments staff have had to improvise and use ad hoc processes and procedures that are sometimes not harmonized among its various offices although the brahimi report and related reports of the secretarygenera l have pointed out this weakness it still has not been fully addressed the departments working group on organization issues of the peace operations 2010 refo rm programme pointed out in its april 2006 report that the departments staff xpressed concern that their tasks and outputs are often vague and openended pparently complicating the planning and implementation process and making it more difficult to hold staff accountable the staff also stated that accountability is hi ghly diffused in the department and that the accountability and responsibility of senior managers in the department should be more clearly defined __________________ 10 stsgb20009 11 a60846add6 a61743 9 0723882 17 in addition the lack of formal processes and procedures governing the internal delegation of authority has undermined th effectiveness of the departments decisionmaking processes the report of the secretarygeneral on the implementation of the recommendations in the brahimi report 12 stated that the departments management culture was riskaverse and did not encourage initiative at the midmanagement level resulting in authority and decisions too often being passed up the chain of command the departments working group on organization also reported there is widely held view that efficiency is hampered by the lack of delegation of authority throughout the depa rtment and the senior managements ability to focus on strategic activities nd guidance could be enhanced by the downward delegation of certain administrative and routine tasks 18 the processes and procedures governing integrated efforts among cross divisional work and interaction with the departments partners were also largely informal and needed further development as discussed in paragraphs 56 to 65 below 19 oios acknowledges that in the context of the peace operations 2010 initiative the department has defined doc trine as key component for putting in place comprehensive system of guidan ce on united nations peacekeeping that reflects best practices elaborates policy and establishes standard operating procedures in response to recommenda tion contained in prior oios report 13 the departments peacekeeping best practices section added many directives existing standard operating procedures and other guidance to the departments website and continues to assist in organizing and updating policies and procedures with other offices of the department 20 for example the office of mission support initiated farreaching effort to develop strategy and management framework governing the execution of procurement for peacekeeping missions task force was established in april 2006 to develop and implement by the beginni ng of 2007 streamlined procedures with strong internal controls clear definition of responsibilities and standardized organizational structure for all entities involved in the procurement process 21 in consultation with its partners in peace operations the department also developed comprehensive guideline document on the integrated mission planning process which the secretarygeneral approved in june 2006 as the authoritative basis for all united nations departments in planning integrated missions 22 however the department needs to consider how the daily users its headquarters and mission staff members can better understand and practically utilize the doctrine in response to an oios survey staff of the department noted that more work should be done to identify what was needed and expected from staff in the context of doctrine development in the opinion of oios the doctrine that is being developed should also include process maps to clearly show the workflow crossdivisional interfaces and management approval lines for all entities involved in peacekeeping and other operations led by the department although the department started organizing and updating procedures and process mapping timelines to complete these tasks had not been set at the time of the audit the doctrine when developed must be fully communicated and properly implemented __________________ 12 a55977 13 a58746 paras 4548 a61743 0723882 10 b performance measurement and resultsbased budgeting 23 the resultsbased budgeting framework is an essential performance measurement tool for united nations depart ments and programmes to ensure proper governance and accountability it is designed to help ensure that departments budgeted resources are directly linked to its goals and that accomplishments are measured against the established quantifia ble indicators of achievement current practice is to compare actual results with the target indicators of achievement at the end of the budget period in performance report 24 while oios recognizes that improvements have been made in the departments resultsbased budgeting framework since its introduction in the 200304 budget cycle there has been insufficient use of resultsbased budgeting as performance measurement system or as strategic framework to govern the departments operations there was cl ear evidence that indicators of achievement were included in the workpl ans of the departments managers and officers or that their accomplishment was periodically evaluated on the basis of resultsbased budgeting at the subprogramme level some line managers and officers were not aware of their results based budgeting indicators of achievement furthermore oios did not find an effective structure or sufficient evidence to show that the office of the undersecretarygeneral adequately monitored the departments five subprogrammes to ensure that they had met the target indicators of achievement in the opinion of oios dedicated evaluation officer needs to be assigned to the office of the unders ecretarygeneral to be responsible for monitoring the performance of subprogrammes on the basis of related performance data and relevant indicator methodology 25 the departments resultsbased budgeti ng framework also needs to be better aligned with the mandated core functions of its subprogrammes for example according to the departments mandate the office of operations is responsible for coordinating and integrating inputs from within the department and from other entities 14 in the opinion of oios the offices current resultsbased budgeting framework does not properly measure the performance of its coordinating and integrating functions in its response to the oios draft audit report the department commented that the resultsbased budgeting frameworks for 200506 and 200708 have as their second and third expected accomplishments the rapid deployment and establishment of peacekeeping operations in response to security council mandates and the increased efficiency and effectiveness of peacekeeping operations those accomplishments when reviewed with the indicators of achievement and the outputs measure the performance of the office of operations in terms of coordinating and integrating inputs from within the department and from other entities however oios believes that the performance indicators set by the department have to be revised to adequa tely measure the abovestated functions of the office of operations 26 the department needs to ensure that the performance of its subprogrammes is measured against their specific responsibilities some key performance indicators of the department did not conform to the functions and activities of the subprogrammes for example one of the indicators for the military division involves the deployment of military components within the timelines planned for __________________ 14 stsgb20009 53 c a61743 11 0723882 specific operations15 with an objective of 60 per cent timely deployments targeted for the 200607 budget cycle however in the opinion of oios the division should be held responsible only for the generation of military components and not for the entire deployment because significant work by other subprogrammes is required before the deployment of m ilitary components takes place for example the office of operations provides political assessment and the office of mission support is responsible for complex logistical arrangements including the finalization of memorandums of understanding with the troopcontributing countries other support arrangements such as procurement of transportation for military personnel and equipment are also needed to accomplish the deployment 27 the department has taken steps to ddress the prior observations of oios that the resultsbased budgeting process took pl ace independently of the departments planning for new field missions and that the field missions resultsbased budgeting processes were not linked to their strategic planning for mandate implementation 16 the planning guidelines of the integrated mission planning process require mandatory linkages between strategic planning and the resultsbased budgeting of new field missions the resultsbased budgeting process also conforms to resultsbased concept for managing all operational areas and evaluating achievements which was proposed in the report on the comprehensive review of governance and oversight within the united nations conducted by the independent steering committee for the implementation of the 2005 world summit outcome 17 c delegated author ity in key administrative and logistical support functions 28 the department of peacekeeping oper ations carries out administrative and logistical support functions such as proc urement in field missions recruitment information technology finance and budgeting under the authority delegated by the department of management therefore th two departments need to coordinate closely in order to balance operational n eeds to monitor the effectiveness of the delegation of authority granted by the department of management 29 however prior oios audits concluded that internal controls and compliance with united nations rules and regulations in carrying out those functions were weak due to inadequate design and implementation of internal controls oios recommended strengthening the related internal controls and managerial accountability at all levels 16 30 in response to the recommendations of oios the department of peacekeeping operations and some peacekeeping missions indicated that certain united nations regulations and rules were outdated were too rigid and did not correspond to the current field realities in peacekeeping missi ons in addition they stated that the regulations and rules needed to be harmonized between united nations agencies and the field missions however specific cases or examples to support these opinions were provided to oios __________________ 15 a606 sect 5 table 513 in dicator of achievement i 16 see a60717 17 a60883 and add12 a61743 0723882 12 31 the oios comprehensive audit of the department found cases of noncompliance with rules and procedures and weaknesses in managerial accountability at all operational levels and c oncluded that one of the root causes of this situation is the reluctance of management to hold staff members accountable for violations of rules and regulations and poor management 18 in the opinion of oios the department of peacekeeping oper ations needs to identify financial rules and procedures that it believes may adversely affect peacekeeping operations and if necessary bring those in need of revision to the attention of the department of management for review and submission to the legislative bodies for approval as appropriate 32 in its response to the oios draft audit report the department of peacekeeping operations commented that certain short term procedures to facilitate the rapid deployment of new or expanded united nations missions had been developed together with the department of management and agreed to by the secretarygeneral those special measures included inter alia the reassignment of civilian personnel without advertisement of the post and with the existing delegations of authority pending completion of the designation process under secretarygeneral s bulletin stsgb20057 of 13 april 2005 b waiver of the twomonth requirement for notification to ll member states for gratis personnel c relief from the present threemonth lim it on the temporary deployment of civilian personnel d the use of general tem porary assistance to establish additional planning capacity at headquarters and in the field an increase in procurement delegations f entering into letters of assist with troopcontributing countries without competitive bidding and headquarters committee on contracts approval where the support required is immediate and the cost is assessed to be reasonable and g noncompetitive singlesource contracts for the provision of logistics support where sufficient time is not available to follow normal procurement procedures subject to determination by the undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping operations with the concurre nce of the undersecretarygeneral for management 33 the department of peacekeeping operations also commented that other specific human resources issues had been addressed to the department of management including the lack of capacity to deploy staff from one mission to another to meet urgent operational needs b strict eligibility criteria and the application of grading guidelines on the determination of level and step at recruitment under various existing contracts and c lengthy process and unclear procedures for the designation of staff members performing significant functions in the management of financial human and physical resources to address these challenges the secretarygeneral proposed as part of his human resources reform proposals 19 to establish 2500 career civilian peacekeeping personnel in both the professional and field service categories to meet baseline peacekeeping needs in critical functions in the substantive logistical and administrative areas those civilian career peacekeepers would be centrally managed by the department of peacekeeping operations and would be subject to rotation and rapid deployment to meet operational requirements __________________ 18 a60717 summary fourth 19 a61255 401 a61743 13 0723882 procurement authority 34 oios previously reported on number of irregularities in procurement activities of the department of peacek eeping operations indicating systematic breaches of united nations regulations and rules and generally weak or nonexistent internal control systems which led to high exposure to the risk of fraud and abuse 16 it is encouraging to note that the department has already made efforts to mitigate such risks as discussed in pa ragraph 20 above also the department of peacekeeping operations and the department of management are reviewing the management structure of procurement staff in peacekeeping operations and the training programmes for staff serving in field missions 35 procurement activities for field missions involve the personnel of the missions the department of peacekeeping operati ons and the department of management under the most recent delegation of aut hority from the secretarygeneral the undersecretarygeneral for management delegated procurement authority to the assistant secretarygeneral for cent ral support services department of management by stai20041 dated 8 march 2004 by memorandum dated 16 february 2005 the assistant secretarygeneral for central support services delegated the authority for field mission procurement to the assistant secretary general for mission support department of peacekeeping operations who accepted the delegation by memorandum dated 7 june 2005 20 and further delegated this authority to the field miss ions however the procurement authority for purchases exceeding 200000 has not been delegated by the assistant secretarygeneral for central support serv ices to the department of peacekeeping operations except in regard to purchases of core requirements for field missions up to 1 million procurement cases for amounts above the delegated authority require review by the headquarters committee on contracts in response to an oios survey on procurementrelated matters mission staff made number of comments that indicated need to strengthen the c ontrol of the department of peacekeeping operations over field procurement activitie s to examine the effectiveness of the delegation of authority to the department and to review the headquarters committee on contracts financial threshold for example staff of the department and of missions noted that there are ongoing delays in the procurement of goods and services for field missions b substantive review by the department is needed for field procurement purchases in amounts exceeding the delegate d authority before procurement cases are submitted to the hea dquarters committee on c ontracts currently the department exercises control in this pr ocess and its role is limited to making presentations to the headquarters committee on contracts or answering some of the committees questions on behalf of missions on the other hand the procurement service of the department of management communicates directly with the missions concerning questions about procurement actions __________________ 20 the assistant s ecretarygeneral fo r mission support noted in this memorandum that while oms office of mission support will make ev ery effort to absorb these additional responsibilities within existing staf fing additional resources may be required to ensure that the delegation is properly mana ged this issue should be considered in the context of the review of delegation in 2006 a61743 0723882 14 36 efforts have been made recently to alleviate these problems the secretary general in his 2006 report investing in the united nations for stronger organization worldwide procurement reform 21 recommended that the financial threshold in respect of procurement ca ses vetted by the headquarters committee on contracts be reviewed to allow the committ ee to devote more time to strategically significant procurement issues and that the department establish dedicated capacity within the department to enable it to assume responsibility and accountability for the delegated procurement authority for its headquarters and field procurement activities 37 it should be noted that in its 2002 report 22 oios recommended raising the headquarters committee on contracts financial threshold from 200000 to 1 million oios observed that the headquarters committee on contracts secretariat lacked sufficient staff resources to serve as an adequate internal control mechanism and that threshold of 1 million would reduce the committees workload by 66 per cent and expedite procurement lead time however the department of management has not accepted that recommendation 38 as indicated in paragraph 35 above the delegated procurement authority of the department of peacekeeping operations s been raised to 1 million for core requirements ie essential goods and services which by their nature lend themselves to local procurement in the opinion of oios dedicated capacity within the department of peacekeeping operations to assume responsibility and accountability for that delegated authority is necessary step to ensure adequate internal control over field procurem ent the department of peacekeeping operations and the department of mana gement need to design proper control mechanisms commensurate with the increased procurement authority of the former information and comm unication technologies 39 in its recent report on the comprehensiv management audit of the department of peacekeeping operations5 oios recommended that the communications and information technology service in the office of mission support be repositioned to report directly to the undersecretaryge neral in order to provide services and strategic technological leadership to the department and not only to the field missions oios found that the existing positioning of the service led to the inefficient deployment of resources and impeded the efficient delivery of services oios also concluded that the service s reporting structure impeded effective advocacy of the information and communication technologies ict agenda at the highest level in the department which is necessary to carry out the services strategic mandate and ensure optimum use of ict throughout the department 40 in addition the department does not have fully developed information management strategy and its existing capacity is used to address the ad hoc requirements of its services and divisions several information management units within other services and divisions of the department have independently developed information systems that are not streamlined or harmonized with systems of the communications and information technology service this situation does not comply with the secretarygenerals ict initiative stai200510 which calls for __________________ 21 a60846add5 and corr1 22 oios assignment an2001622 a61743 15 0723882 coherent and coordinated use of ict efficiency and other benefits expected from automation and information technology need to be maximized in this regard oios reiterates its prior recommendation that the department finalize its information management strategy carefully analyse ongoing informationsystem initiatives for interoperability and interconnectivity with existing and future information technology it systems and accordingly reposition the current it capacity within the department 16 finance and budget 41 responsibility and accountability are key factors in properly managing peace operations however responsibilities in the budget and finance areas are not clearly defined at the mission or headquarters level in the field the head of mission is considered accountable for preparing the budget but financial authority is delegated to the director of administration similarly the reporting lines of the head of mission to the security council the secret arygeneral and the department are not formally defined and enforced 42 the comprehensive oios manageme nt audit of the department of peacekeeping operations showed that there was duplication of effort between its finance management and support service and the department of managements office of programme planning budget and accounts in the budget and finance areas of operations 16 the controller allots funds to the department of peacekeeping operations which then suballots funds to its field missions the finance management and support service and the office of programme planning budget and accounts are both responsible for financial reporting and monitoring the missions budgets although the department of management and the department of peacekeeping operations commented that their roles in reviewing mission budgets were distinct both departments agreed to streamline the budget process for peacekeeping operations and eliminate any duplication they also agreed that only the accounts division of the office of pr ogramme planning budget and accounts would review the missions accounts 43 during the critical early period of establishing new peacekeeping operation when approval of the mission budget is pending the department of peacekeeping operations uses premandate commitment au thority to initiate logistical support operations however in the comprehensive audit report oios concluded that the current 50 million limit in prema ndate commitment authority from the peacekeeping reserve fund is longer sufficient in the context of large missions and since the premandate commitment also includes replenishment of strategic deployment stocks the insufficiency of the premandate commitment authority may preclude the timely establishment of proper organizational and reporting structures needed to effectively manage department of peacekeeping operations and field missions in terms of the segregation of functions and the recruitment of key personnel the department of management agreed with the recommendation of the office of internal oversight services to conduct study and seek an appropriate increase in the premandate commitment authority however action has yet been taken a61743 0723882 16 human resources management 44 in 1994 the office of human resources management of the department of management delegated the recruitment authority for field missions to the department of peacekeeping operations with the understanding that the delegation would assist the latter in providing more efficient and expeditious staffing of peacekeeping operations the department of peacekeeping operations was thus responsible for recruiting deploying and administering international civilian staff serving in field missions the personnel management and support service was established within the department of pe acekeeping operations to carry out those functions 45 during the comprehensive management audit of the department of peacekeeping operations oios found that th exercise of this delegated authority was inefficient because the department d not further delegated the recruitment authority to the field missions although limited recruitment authority was delegated to the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo and the united nations transitional administration in east timor 16 instead the personnel management and support service became an intermediary between the office of human resources management and the fiel d missions according to the department of management the office of human re sources management has not effectively monitored the authority delegated to the department of peacekeeping operations because of resource limitations in this regard oios recommended that the department of management conduct comprehensive and objective review to assess the success of the delegation of authority to the department of peacekeeping operations the office of human resources management advised that the review had begun recently 46 one of managements main functions is to ensure timely and adequate staffing in all key operational areas as at 31 may 2005 there was an overall vacancy rate of 23 per cent in the missions and vacancies in the international professional category and above were at 32 per cent vacancy rates of over 20 per cent in ongoing missions could be detrimental to the implem entation of their mandates as indicated in the oios report the personnel management and support service and the office of human resources management have not taken adequate measures to control vacancy rates and oios recommended the development of action plans for each mission to monitor vacancies and set targets for attaining the desired staffing levels in response to the recommendation of oios the department of peacekeeping operations set the resultsbased budgeti ng vacancy rate performance measure for international staff at 7 per cent in the missions including 5 per cent vacancy rate target for national staff for the 200607 budget period 47 department of peacekeeping operations managers indicated that resources especially in terms of the staffing of ssion support capacity at headquarters were not commensurate with the expanding scope and challenges of multidimensional peace operations over the past five years clearly the re sources of the department of peacekeeping operations need to be adequate to fully meet the responsibility and accountability requirements of supporting field missions however oios is not in position to comment on whether the departments current level of staffing and other resources is adequate because the department has not established baseline resource ratio that is commensurate with support requirements for field missions as recommended in the brahimi report in 2000 the department should conduct a61743 17 0723882 review as soon as possible and analyse the existing capacities of the department of peacekeeping operations and the departme nt of management at headquarters and in the field missions to perform equivalent support functions to minimize duplication and overlap career development plan 48 oios interviews and the results of its survey indicated that the level of skills and knowledge among staff often did not m eet the requirements of their positions the gap exists at various levels at headquarters and in the missions one of the main causes of this condition is that peace operations were never promoted as potential longterm career path for staff yet the united nations has carried out peacekeeping efforts for some six decades proving that peacekeeping has become core business and permanent feature of the organization due to the lack of structured career development plans for peacekeepers the department of peacekeeping operations faces the risk of not being able to nurture and develop pool of staff members with comprehensiv knowledge of peace operations for the longterm benefit of the organization in the opinion of oios there is an urgent need to establish comprehensive career development programme and the training system to support it the department took initial action to address this issue by establishing in july 2006 the integrated training service within the change management office to improve the preparedness of all categories of personnel to serve in field missions and to provide ngoing professional education and training of staff 49 in its reform strategy peace op erations 2010 the department of peacekeeping operations recognized that its people are its main asset and that there is need for more professional approach in recruiting and retaining personnel who are highly qualified with wide experience in peace operations in its response to the oios draft audit report the department commented that more work is needed to address the underlying causes of the 30 per cent turnover of professional staff in the field and persisting high vacancy rates in united nations peace operations to create stable staffing complement that can be trained and developed to meet the organizational needs to this end the secretarygeneral has already put forward proposals to address marked differences in the conditions of service offered to staff in field operations including the introduction of single staff contract under one series of staff rules the designation of missions as family or nonfamily on the basis of the security phase and harmonization of conditions of service for staff serving in nonfamily duty stations with those of the united nations agencies funds and programmes furthermore the secretarygenera ls report investing in the united nations for stronger organization worldwide23 noted that the future united nations workforce will have core of career international civil servants performing longterm functions as indicated in paragraph 33 above approximately 2500 internationally recruited positions in peacekeeping and special political missions will be identified to form that required capacity

management is to determine how much risk it is prepared to accept as it strives to achieve its objectives this challenge is especially applicable to the dynamic environment of the department of peacekeeping operations oios is quite c oncerned that the organization including the department of peacekeepi ng operations has not yet adopted an internal control framework including an enterprisewide risk management process in accordance with good practices in publicsector organizations thus the department needs to introduce such process as part of its internal control framework the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 24 an organization dedicated to improving the quality of fina ncial reporting through business ethics effective internal controls and corpor ate governance defined enterprise risk management as process effected by an entity s board of directors management and other personnel applied in strategysetting and across the enterprise designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity and manage risk to be within its risk appetite to provide reasonabl assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives the international organization of supreme audit institutions intosai 25 has accepted and incorporated the coso control framework concept into the intosai guidelines for internal c ontrol standards for the public sector 51 the external risk assessment of the department of peacekeeping operations commissioned in 2006 by oios identified th key risks the department faces and found high level of risk and considerable lack of formal business processes in most management and operational areas the assessment concluded that there was need to develop risk management mechanis m particularly with regard to resource management business processes and information technology support the department must now evaluate its capability to manage risks and make adjustments to its existing processes to enhance its overall risk management expertise structure of the monitoring function 52 the work of the department of pea cekeeping operations is diverse and its mandate is challenging it is exposed to various risks that need to be monitored and managed effective integration of subprogramme objectives is of paramount importance however the departments monitoring function is not adequately structured which generally leaves the subprogrammes to monitor their own work in __________________ 24 coso was originally formed in 1985 to sponsor the national commission on fraudulent financial reporting an i

budgeting framework and performance evaluation of subprogrammes enterprise risk management its information management strategy change management to support the reform initiative doctrine development best practices and lessons learned 53 the monitoring activities are closely inte rrelated and require wellorganized structure to ensure and produce the maximum benefit for the department in ensuring that its goals are achieved also the depa rtments partners in peace operations in responding to an oios survey pointed out need for establishing formal central policy dissemination and communication function within the department although the change management office and the peacekeeping best practices section are currently located in the office of the undersecretarygeneral their work needs more organized approach iv interaction coordination and cooperation with partners relationship with part ners in peace operations 54 although the department of peacekeepi ng operations is the lead department for peacekeeping operations in carrying out the curre nt multidimensional peace operations it relies on the support of many part ners at headquarters and in the field as shown in table 2 some partners especially the united nations agencies that form the country teams have the advantage of knowledge and experience in the field due to their presence in most of the countries with conflicts long before the department has established its missions some partners possess disciplines and information that may not be available within the department its office of operations is responsible for overall interaction and relationships w ith these partners while the office of mission support carries out administrative and logistical functions under authority delegated by the department of management and interacts with related partners in operational support areas its military and police divisions and mine action service also interact with external partners in their

peace operations generally the partners responded that the department interaction and relationships with them have been satisfactory most of the respondents stated that the political and executive support provided by the department was adequate and that the department was able to effectively coordinate and deliver results in crisis situations 56 however most of the respondents were of the view that the communication and cooperation between the department and its partners could be further improved some of the salient comments made by th key partners are summarized below single point of communication between the department at headquarters and the field missions and partners is needed b the department needs to develop formalized and clearly defined terms of reference for interaction cooperation nd coordination with its partners in peace operations c partners work with the department primarily through ad hoc contacts and informal arrangements which are somewhat effective but do not contribute to an efficient or consistent approach d the organizational culture needs to be reformed as there is need for more openness in communication and informationsharing to offer divergent opinions on peace operations there is need for guidance by senior department management on policy priorities that should be the basis of the departments overall communications strategies a61743 21 0723882 57 oios audits of the management and support of peacekeeping and political missions26 found that two key cooperation and coordination strategies between the department of peacekeeping operations and the department of political affairs stipulated by the secretarygeneral colo cation of department of political affairs regional divisions and the department of peacekeeping operations and the formation of interdepar tmental task forces27 have not been sufficiently implemented also staff members of the two departments indicated that in their view the effectiveness of interaction c oordination and cooperation varied from good to counterproductive although the manageme nt of the department of peacekeeping operations maintains that the political af fairs function in peace operations does not duplicate any of its own functions in the opinion of oios the political functions of the two departments were dup licative to certain degree8 58 the department of peacekeeping operations has recognized the need to establish framework for inter active partnerships as one of the five elements in its reform initiative peace operations 2010 in the view of oios there is need to develop and execute action plans at the working level concerning the departments partnership with other departments unit ed nations agencies funds programmes and other external partners the department commented that it was working to strengthen its external integration with its partners in peace operations through the establishment of common policies such as the policy on disarmament demobilization and reintegration and through the planned establishment of small unit to manage relationships with the partners b integrated mission planning process 59 as the department assumes responsibility for planning peace operations as instructed by the secretarygeneral the inte grated mission planning process is key activity requiring the involvement of the departments partners 60 the key strategy of the integrated mission planning process is the establishment of the integrated mission task forces as recommended in the brahimi report the task forces were envisioned as standard vehicle for missionspecific planning and support task force members were to be seconded from entities throughout the united nations system to work with the department with the task force leaders having temporary line authority over the seconded personnel 61 the secretarygeneral has concluded that the strategy functions well only as an information exchange and has been ss successful as strategic planning and management mechanism 28 62 the key partners also provided feedback on the following points as result of their participation and experiences with inte grated mission task force groups in the previous mission planning process partners are not involved early in the process and frequently need to raise this concern at the highest level in order to be included __________________ 26 oios audit assignments ap200656001 and ap200660015 27 see a55977 28 see a60640 a61743 0723882 22 b informationsharing and cooperati on often take place on personalized basis c once the mission becomes operationa l the roles and responsibilities of various departments and entitie s are not clearly defined 63 in this regard oios audits found that the department needed to review the composition and terms of reference of the in tegrated mission task forces and clearly articulate responsibilities including decisionmaking authority29 oios also considers it critical that the executive of fice of the secretarygeneral enforce and monitor the formation of integrated mission task forces30 while the monitoring of the task forces is function of the undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping operations as pointed out by the department in its response to the oios draft audit report oios believes that the involvement of the executive office of the secretary general in this process would greatly contribute to its successful implementation for example an interdepartmental task force for the united nations assistance mission for iraq iraq operations group had been formed and was functioning effectively with the active involvement of and monitoring by the executive office of the secretarygeneral the executive office shared the view of oios and indicated that its involvement helps to improve the effectiveness of interdepartmental task forces as was th case with recent planning activities for darfur in addition the department need s dedicated mission planning cells in the organizational structure at headquarte rs and in the missions to take full responsibility for leading coordinating monitoring and reporting on the planning process 64 the board of auditors noted in 2006 that there still was clear definition of an integrated mission and that the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved were not clearly understood 31 the board recommended that the united nations continue to formalize the integrat ed mission partnerships concept including their function structure and role and fi nalize governing principles and policies also the board recommended that there be extensive consultation with the united nations country teams from the first phase of the mission planning process the department of peacekeeping operations commented that the note of guidance on integrated missions was issued by the secretarygeneral on 17 january 2006 and the board of auditors in its draft report on peacekeeping operations for the 12month period ending 30 june 2006 considered the recommendation relating to the definition of an integrated mission and roles and responsibilities as implemented 65 oios acknowledges the important progress the department has achieved in consultation with its partners in developing comprehensive guidance document on the integrated mission planning process methodology which was approved by the secretarygeneral in june 2006 those gui delines recognize the integrated mission task forces as the key mechanism for ensuring coherence and the consistent engagement of the united nations system in the mission planning process the department also formulated the terms of reference for integrated mission task forces however they were still in draft form at the time of the audit key partners __________________ 29 see a58746 and a60717 30 oios audit ap200656001 31 see official records of the general assembly sixtieth session supplement 5 v ol ii and corrigendum a605 v ol ii and corr1 a61743 23 0723882 that responded to the oios survey noted that the new integrated mission planning process methodology should markedly improve the planning and design of future integrated missions and relations with united nations country teams and that it would have substantial positive impact on new missions if properly implemented v restructuring initiative of the department integration enhancement 66 under the current functional organizational structure of the department each specialized unit of its five subprogramme s reports to its own subprogramme chain of command in carrying out the departments core responsibilities such as the rapid deployment of multidisciplinary mission the efficient and effective integration of separate fu nctions is critical while the proper governance and accountability of each office and unit are maintained the effective integration of the work of the specialized units through informationsharing communication and streamlining of crosscutting processes which would facilitate efficiency and synergies is key factor for success in achieving the departments goals also the department should ensure effective comm unications between its specialized units field missions and partners in peace operations 67 on the basis of the results of oios interviews and surveys of officers and partners of the department and review of related reports and internal studies of the department oios concluded that the in tegration of operational processes in the department was inadequate this was si gnificant weakness of the departments management structure amplified by the lack of proper doctrine comprehensive performance measurement system and an enterprise risk management mechanism as discussed in section iii above 68 managers and staff of the department commented that its subprogrammes and subunits were working in silos without sufficiently communicating and understanding one anothers inputs and outputs also the departments working group on organization for the peace operations 2010 programme highlighted that evidence suggests that most crossdivisional work processes are personalitydependent informal not communicated or agreed across the department and can fall apart during personnel changes the opportunities to create synergies that would lead to increased performance were therefore diminished report of the secretarygeneral 32 noted fragmented approach among internal offices of the department and the lack of formal mechanism to ensure that staff officers in the various offices communicate or coordinate with one another in systematic and timely manner 69 furthermore the lack of integration in the departments operational processes and organizational structures together with insufficient communication can undermine strategic leadership senior managers of the department commented that they often receive contradictory andor impr operly synthesized information in part __________________ 32 a55977 a61743 0723882 24 because of the problems created by stovepiping which undermines their capacity to coordinate an effective international response33 70 in addition the field missions need to build their own contact networks in the department to obtain the answers and support they need especially in the critical early months according to the brahimi report moreover partners of the department and field missions surveyed by oios stated that there was need to enhance the departments structures to ensure effective communication and informationsharing b integrated matrix structure 71 the department identified inadequa integration as weakness in its management structure and considers this key issue in its reform efforts in 2005 it initiated plan to restructure itself and stre ngthen its integration specifically in the opinion of oios the department should be able to institutionalize communications and informationsharing and implement onestop shop solution for missions and partners to have direct links to headquarters however this should not add an additional level of management to the process 72 the undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping operations tasked staff members from the departments various offices and units with forming department working group on organization in connection with its peace operations 2010 reform plan in general there are three types of organizational structures functional matrix and project organization the working group conducted an assessment based on extensive interviews and review of leading practices and recommended that the departments headquarters be reorganized as matrix structure instead of the existing functional structure with five separate subprogrammes in matrix structure functional lines are maintained but provide their resources to the project teams when needed matrix structure could incorporate advantages of the functional and project organization structures when properly designed and implemented oios agrees with the working groups recommendations but points out that significant risks associated with such reorganization would need to be mitigated 73 the advantages of deploying integrated teams based on the matrix organizational structure were envisioned in the brahimi report and further studied by the departments organizational working group the advantages of using the integrated approach are as follows the integrated teams composed of staff from different subprogrammes will be accountable for all issues pertaining to the missions or countries assigned to them therefore if properly empowered team would be able to serve as one single point of communication for field missions and partners b the department will be able to assign necessary talent to specific projects without reorganization when ever new project is initiated c the practice will assist the departme nts partners in contributing staff to interdepartmental or interagency task forces to provide support __________________ 33 report of the department of peacekeeping op erations reform task force working group on organization a61743 25 0723882 d integrated teams have already prove d to be functioning well such as in the case of the formally established integrated training service and the ad hoc darfur planning team which is tasked with planning possible department of peacekeeping operations mission in darfur 74 the departments organization working group explored four options for restructuring as shown below and recommended implementing option c maintain the organizational status quo with the current functional structure and improve internal processes without the implementation of integrated teams b light integration grouping individual liaison officers around office of operations teams c medium integration using teams under office of operations leadership with an office of mission support element of six or seven staff and one or two military andor police officers d full integration using teams under office of operations leadership with teams of mission support military and police personnel comprising about 30 staff 75 according to the groups proposal the medium integration model is practical approach because it offers the advantage of implementation within existing resources and can be implemented progressively with limited impact on ongoing operations 76 the light integration approach would not be sufficient to provide onestop shop function because of the limited empower ment given to the integrated teams in addition with that approach it might not be possible to accomplish complicated project requiring considerable time such as planning large field mission on the other hand full integration would require the approval of the secretarygeneral and the member states because of the magnitude of the required changes and the significant additional staff resources requi red especially in military and police areas the departments daytoday operations could also be disrupted 77 in the opinion of oios the deployment of integrated teams based on matrix organization would present the opportunity to improve the departments management structure if properly implemented in the view of oios the department is on the right track in reform ing itself and has to choose what specific options should be implemented the recommendations of the department doctrine working group to improve doctrine and provide relevant training for staff members should be considered as prerequisite to implementation of the departments reform programme 78 if the department decides to adopt an integrated matrix organization it must ensure that risks associated with designing and implementing integrated teams are managed within an appropriate level of risk tolerance otherwise if not sufficiently mitigated the risks could unde rmine the expected benefits of the integrated matrix organization and render restructuring effo rts wasteful in the opinion of oios the following factors should be taken into consideration when implementing the integrated matrix organization the work expectations roles and responsibilities of the integrated teams should be clearly defined and understood by all entities and staff involved including a61743 0723882 26 field missions partners functional line ma nagers and officers as well as team members b integrated teams should be adeq uately empowered or be staffed by sufficiently senior officers to ensure that the teams have the power to make decisions delegation of authority should be clearly defined to ensure accountability c team members should be able to obtain technical support from the functional units d the department needs to design and implement performance evaluation system to institutionalize dual reporting in the integrated matrix organization the performance of integrated team members should be evaluated by the team leader and functional managers careful design is required to ensure that team members are assessed fairly it is also critical that the functional managers whose staff are participating in the integrated teams be evaluated in terms of their commitment and support for the teams terminology used in the formulation and operation of the integrated teams should be standardized and agreed to within the department to minimize misunderstandings f the department should steer the restructuring in consonance with the organizations reforms for example the information management strategy of the department should be developed taking into consideration that of the secretariat c change management 79 many of the departments staff responding to the oios survey noted that they were quite comfortable with the present organizational arrangements even though those arrangements lacked integration and diffused accountability in the view of oios staff at all levels within the department should be involved in the restructuring process once decision has b een made to go forward better internal communications frequent updates on progress and transparency of the process must be adequately considered so that the buyin of department staff at all levels is achieved 80 in the view of oios the department needs to develop stronger structure to implement its peace operations 2010 in itiative proposed by the undersecretary general for peacekeeping operations as vision to ensure that the department is able to meet the rapidly evolving needs of peace operations earlier the board of auditors in the context of the brahimi report recommended the development of proper project plan to systematically document steps to be taken to implement the brahimi plan including clearly defined m ilestones and indicators to measure the desired impact within defined time frames with clear indications of allocation of responsibilities and cost estimations 34 oios agrees with this type of approach and its application to the peace operations 2010 initiative so far efforts related to the peace operations 2010 initiative have been carried out by temporary working groups there is need to develop comprehensive plan showing which offices and __________________ 34 see official records of the general assembly fiftyninth session supplement 5 v ol ii and corrigendum a595 v ol ii and corr1 a61743 27 0723882 officers would be responsible for implementing approved changes proposed by the working groups 81 the implementation of changes is not an event but longterm process to be managed systematically requiring substantia l investment and attention from senior management to facilitate such change in the opinion of oios the departments change management office is in the best position to assume responsibility for coordinating the peace operations 2010 initiative and therefore should be designated as the first line of accountability for the outcome of the reorganization the office reports directly to the undersecr etarygeneral and thus is better able to manage potential conflicts that may emerge among the various components of the department the change management office which would develop and execute detailed implementation plan of integrated matrix teams should be empowered to lead and coordinate the change management process external support is likely to be required for specialist skills in management and business processes those external assets could provide expertise in change processes and organizational structures and develop outreach programmes to seek the buyin of groups that feel threatened by the change the ongoing assessment of organizational reforms will have to be structured and reviewed systematically so that change encompasses already existing best practices and protects departmental strengths vi recommendations 82 oios is making number of recommendations to improve management structures of the department of peacekeeping operations as follows recommendation 1 83 the department of peacekeeping oper ations should propose to the secretary general an updated mandate that clearly reflects its responsibilities for directing the substantive operations of the special political missions in addition to peacekeeping operations ap20065600101 35 84 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that the increase in the number of special political missions and the diversity of their mandates requires further clarification of its role in managing field operations in such missions the department will work closely with the executive office of the secretarygeneral and other departments to revise the relevant secretarygeneral s bulletins recommendation 2 85 the department of peacekeeping operations should on priority basis establish an action plan to develop comprehensive doctrine for peacekeeping and other operations led by the department by promulgating formal business processes and procedures governing its work that speci fy the accountability structure internal delegations of authority nd level of integration between the offices and entities involved in crossdivisional business pro cesses process maps for all operational areas should be developed to facilitate th is task and strengthen the departments internal control framework ap20066000102 __________________ 35 the symbols in parentheses in this section refer to an internal code used by oios for recording recommendations a61743 0723882 28 86 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that it acknowledges the need to develop doctrine and business processes and procedures as an ongoing requirement an expanded senior management team was established to prioritize areas for doctrinal improvement and review and to promulgate guidance materials such as policies procedures manuals and guidelines the department established the guidance project to provide comprehensive guidancedoctrine framework for over 1200 activity areas encompassing all tasks conducted in peace operations using that framework the department has collected in excess of 5000 policy and procedural documents governing activities in the department at headquarters and in the field the department is identifying the gaps in this framework to develop longterm plan for doctrinal development recommendation 3 87 the department of peacekeeping operations should ensure that the results based budgeting framework is coherently linked to the mandated work of the departments subprogrammes and is ef fectively utilized to measure their performance to improve governance and ac countability mechanisms and ensure the accomplishment of their goals also action should be taken to enhance the structure of the resultsbased budgeting monitoring and evaluating function within the office of the undersecretarygeneral ap20066000103 88 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation agreeing that resultsbased budgeting can be made more effective management tool within the department improvements have been made in the quality of results based budgeting outputs in the past two budgets however the department will examine ways possibly with external assistance to improve the management utility of resultsbased budgeting within the department as well as the monitoring and evaluation functions of the office of the undersecretarygeneral recommendation 4 89 the department of peacekeeping operations in coordination with the department of management should identify united nations rules and procedures that it believes may need revision to meet the increased complexity and changed environment in managing and supporting p eace operations in recent years while still providing satisfactory level of inte rnal control where appropriate the proposed changes in rules and procedures should be submitted to the legislative bodies for approval ap20066000104 90 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that it has already worked with the department of management in seeking the secretarygeneral s approval to modify or waive certain procedures to facilitate the rapid deployment of new or expanded united nations missions in east timor lebanon and darfur while it is recognized that these are shortterm measures they will form the basis of request for more longterm consolidation and rationalization of procedures for the field see also paras 3233 above a61743 29 0723882 recommendation 5 91 the department of peacekeeping op erations in coop eration with the department of management should develop and implement internal controls commensurate with the increased procurement authority delegated to the department of peacekeeping operations including the establishment of dedicated capacity within it to assume responsibility and accountability for procurement operations in the field missions ap20066000105 92 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that it and the department of management have established joint working group which has been examining the structure procedures and controls for procurement over the past six months in addition two temporary posts 1 p5 and 1 p4 were funded under the 200607 support account budget to manage the department of peacekeeping operations delegation of procurement additional resources are being sought under the 200708 support account budget to enable greater scrutiny of mission acquisition planning and implementation recommendation 6 93 as recommended by the panel on united nations peace operations the department of peacekeeping operations should establish an appropriate baseline staffing and funding level to ensure that headquarters provides adequate support for peace operations ap20066000106 94 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that mission benchmarking study undertaken under the auspices of the organization working group has already been completed for the field this has given the department rudimentary templates for staffing mission functions similar study is now contemplated for headquarters staff functions however it will require external assistance as the required resources are not available internally recommendation 7 95 the department of peacekeeping operations in coordination with the department of management should review and analyse the roles and responsibilities of both departments for the existing support capacities at headquarters and in the field missions to avoid duplication and overlap ap20066000107 96 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that the department highlights the need to address the fundamental systemic problems that prevent it from effectively discharging its mandate to direct manage and support united nations peace operations the department considers that there are considerable benefits to consolidating overlapping field support functions within the department consolidation would enhance oversight align resources and responsibility and provide for speedier responses to field mission issues recommendation 8 97 the department of peacekeeping op erations in consultation with the department of management should initia career development programmes in various areas of peace operations to sure the development of highly competent a61743 0723882 30 and experienced groups of united nati ons personnel in peace operations comprehensive training system should also be developed to support the career development programmes ap20066000108 98 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that work on career development and training programmes is already under way training and development programmes including developmental experience would be designed to equip st aff with the required knowledge skills and expertise recommendation 9 99 the department of peacekeeping operations should establish an enterprise risk management mechanism as management tool and as part of comprehensive internal control framework to identi fy and mitigate risks in achieving the departments objectives ap20066000109 100 the department of peacekeeping operations accepted this recommendation commenting that it has already initiated pilot risk management exercise as part of its review of resource decisions for the united nations mission in the sudan expansion into darfur the introduction of enterprise risk management will be studied as part of the move to enterprise resources planning which will be the mechanism for the introduction of new control mechanisms recommendation 10 101 the department of peacekeeping op erations should enhance and strengthen the monitoring function within the office of the undersecretarygeneral to effectively monitor the work of the department with re spect to the resultsbased budgeting framework and performance evalua tion of subprogrammes b enterprise risk management c the info rmation management
