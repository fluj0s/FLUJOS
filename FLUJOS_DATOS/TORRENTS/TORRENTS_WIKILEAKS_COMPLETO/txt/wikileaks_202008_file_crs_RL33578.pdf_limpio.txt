in energy and environmental economics resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578energy tax policy history and current issues summary historically us federal energy tax policy promoted the supply of oil and gas however the 1970s witnessed 1 signifi cant cutback in the oil and gas industrys tax preferences 2 the imposition of new excise taxes on oil and 3 the introduction of numerous tax preferences fo r energy conservation the development of alternative fuels and the commercia lization of the technologies for producing these fuels renewables such as solar wind and bioma ss and nonconventional fossil fuels such as shale oil and coalbed meth ane the reagan administration using freemarket approach advocated repeal of the windfall profit tax on oil and the repeal or phaseout of most energy tax preferences for oil and gas as well as alternative fuels due to the combined effects of the economic recovery tax act and the energy tax subsidies that had not been repealed which together created negative effective tax rates in some cases the actual energy tax policy differed from the stated policy the george h w bush and bill clinton years witnessed return to much more activist energy tax policy with an emphasis on energy conservation and alternative fuels while the original aim was to reduce demand for imported oil energy tax policy was also increasingly viewed as tool for achieving environmental and fiscal objectives the clinton administrations energy tax policy emphasized the environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gases nd global climate change but it will also be remembered fo r its failed proposal to enact broadly based energy tax on btus british thermal units and its 1993 acrosstheboard increase in motor fuels taxes of 43gallon the 109th congress enacted the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 signed by president bush on august 8 2005 provided net energy tax cut of 115 billion 145 billion gross energy tax cuts less 3 b illion of energy tax increases for fossil fuels and electricity as well as fo r energy efficiency and for several types of alternative and renewable resources such as solar and geothermal the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109 432 enacted in d ecember 2006 provided for oneyear extensions of these provisions the current energy tax structure favors tax incentives for alternative and renewa ble fuels supply relative to energy from conventional fossil fuels and this postu re was accentuated under the energy policy act of 2005 on october 3 president bush signed the economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 which includes 17 billion in energy tax incentives primarily extensions of preexisting provisions but also including several new energy tax incentives 109 billion in renewable energy tax incentives aimed at clean energy production 26 billion in incentives targeted to ward cleaner vehicl and fuels and 35 billion in tax breaks to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency the cost of the energy tax extenders legislation is fully financed or paid for by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry mostly by reducing oil and ga s tax breaks and by other tax increases the oil and gas tax in creases comprise cutbacks in the irc 199 manufacturing deduction for income attri butable to oil and gas production which will be frozen at 6 rather than

underlying these distortions and th nature of the distortions is discussed in detail in companion report crs report rl30406 energy tax policy an economic analysis by salvatore lazzarienergy tax policy history and current issues introduction energy tax policy involves the use of the governments main fiscal instruments taxes financial disincentives and tax subsidies or incentives to alter the allocation or configura tion of energy resources in theo ry energy taxes and subsidies like tax policy instruments in general are intended either to correct problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some social economic efficiency equity or even macroeconomic environmental or fiscal objective in practice however energy tax policy in the united states is made in political setting being determined by the views and interests of the key players in this setting politicians special interest groups bureaucrats and academic scholars this implies that the policy does not generally if ever adhere to the princi ples of economic or public finance theory alone that more often than not energy tax policy may compound existing distortions rather than correct them1 the idea of applying tax policy instruments to the energy markets is not new but until the 1970s energy tax policy had b een little used except for the oil and gas industry recurrent energyrelated probl ems since the 1970s oil embargoes oil price and supply shocks wide petroleum pr ice variations and price spikes large geographical price disparities tight ergy supplies and rising oil import dependence as well as increased cern for the environment have caused policymakers to look toward energy taxe s and subsidies with greater frequency comprehensive energy policy legislati on containing numerous tax incentives and some tax increases on the oil industr was signed on august 8 2005 pl 109 58 the law the energy policy act of 2005 contained about 15 billion in energy tax incentives over 11 years including numerous tax incentives for the supply of conventional fuels however record oil i ndustry profits due prima rily to high crude oil and refined oil product prices and the 2006 midterm elections which gave the control of the congress to the democratic party has changed the mood of policymakers instead of stimulating the traditional fuels industry oil gas and electricity from coal in addition to incentivizing alternative fuels and energy conservation the mood now is to take aw ay or rescind the 2005 tax incentives and use the money to further stimulate altern ative fuels and energy conservation minor step in this direction was made on ma 17 2006 when president bush signed 70 billion tax reconc iliation b ill pl 109222 this bill included provision thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs2 2 tax preferences are special ta x provisions such as tax cr edits exemptions exclusions deductions deferrals or favorable tax rates that reduce tax rates for the preferred economic activity and favored taxpayers such preferences also known as tax expenditures or tax subsidies generally deviate from neutral tax system and from generally accepted economic and accounting principles unless they ar targeted to the correction of preexisting market distortions further increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by extending the depreciation recovery period for geologi cal and geophysical costs from two to five years thus taking back some of the benefits enacted under the 2005 law and currently the major tax writing committees in both houses are considering further but more significant tax increases on the oil and gas industry to fund additional tax cuts for the alternative fuels and energy c onservation industries these bills are being considered as part of the debate over ne w versions of comprehensive energy policy legislation in the 110th congress hr 6 this report discusses the history curre nt posture and outlook for federal energy tax policy it also discusses current ergy tax proposals and major energy tax provisions enacted in the 109th congress for general economic analysis of energy tax policy see crs report rl30406 energy tax policy an economic analysis by salvatore lazzari background the history of federal energy tax policy can be divided into four eras the oil and gas period from 1916 to 1970 the energy crisis period of the 1970s the free market era of the reagan administration and the postreagan era including the period since 1998 which has witnessed plet hora of energy tax proposals to address recurring energy market problems energy tax policy from 1918 to 1970 promoting oil and gas historically federal energy tax polic was focused on increasing domestic oil and gas reserves and producti on there were tax incentives for energy conservation or for alternative fuels two oilgas tax code preferences embodied this policy 1 expensing of intangible drilling costs idcs and dry hole costs which was introduced in 1916 and 2 the percentage pletion allowance first enacted in 1926 coal was added in 19322 expensing of idcs such as labor costs material costs supplies and repairs associated with drilling well gave il and gas producers the benefit of fully deducting from the first years income writing off significant portion of the total costs of bringing well into produc tion costs that would otherwise ie in theory and under standard accepted tax accounting methods be capitalized ie written off during the life of the well as income is earned for dry holes which comprised on average about 80 of all the wells drilled the costs were also allowed to be deducted in the year drilled expensed and deducted against other types of income which led to many tax shelters that benefitted primarily highincomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs3 taxpayers expensing accelerates tax deduc tions defers tax lia bility and encourages oil and gas prospecting drilling and the development of reserves the oil and gas percentage depletion allowance permitted il and gas producers to claim 275 of revenue as deduction for the cost of exhaustion or depletion of the deposit allowing deductions in excess of capital investment ie in excess of adjusted cost depletion the economica lly neutral method of capital recovery for the extractive industries percentage depletion encourages faster mineral development than cost depletion the quivalent of deprecia tion of plants and equipment these and other tax subsidie s discussed later eg capital gains treatment of the sale of successful properties the special exemption from the passive loss limitation rules and special tax credits reduced marginal effective tax rates in the oil and gas industries reduced production costs and in creased investments in locating reserves increased exploration they also d to more profitable production and some acceleration of oil and gas production increas ed rate of extracti on and more rapid depletion of energy resources than would otherwise occur such subsidies tend to channel resources into these activities that otherwise would be used for oil and gas activities abroad or for other economic activ ities in the united states relatively low oil prices encouraged petroleum consum ption as opposed to conservation and inhibited the development of alternatives to fossil fuels such as unconventional fuels and renewable forms of energy oil and gas production increased from 16 of total us energy production in 1920 to 711 of total energy production in 1970 the peak year energy tax policy during the 1970s conservation and alternative fuels three developments during the 1970s cause d dramatic shift in the focus of federal energy tax policy first the large revenue losses associated with the oil and gas tax preferences became increasingly hard to justify in the face of increasing federal budget deficits nd in view of the longstanding economic arguments against the special tax treatment for oil nd gas as noted in the above paragraph second heightened awareness of envi ronmental pollution and concern for environmental degradation and the increased importance of distributional issues in policy formulation ie equ ity and fairness lost the domestic oil and gas industry much political support thus it became more difficult to justify percentage depletion and other subsidies largely claimed by wealthy individuals and big vertically integrated oil companies more importan tly during the 1970s there were two energy crises the oil embargo of 1973 also known as the first oil shock and the iranian revolution in 19781979 which focused polic ymakers attention on the problems alleged failures in the energy markets and how these problems reverberated throughout the ec onomy causing stagflation shorta ges productivity problems rising import dependence and other economic and social problems these developments caused federal energy tax policy to shift from oil and gas supply toward energy conservation reduced energy demand and alternative energy sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs4 three broad actions were taken through the tax code to implement the new energy tax policy during the 1970s fi rst the oil industrys two major tax preferences expensing of idcs and pe rcentage depletion were significantly reduced particularly the percentage depletion allowance which was eliminated for the major integrated oil companies and reduced for the remaining producers other oil and gas tax benefits were also cut back during this period for example oil and gasfired boilers used in steam generati on eg to generate electricity could longer qualify for accelerated depreciation as result of the energy tax act of 1978 as discussed below the second broad policy action was the im position of several new excise taxes penalizing the use of conventional fossil fu els particularly il and gas and later coal the energy tax act of 1978 eta pl 95618 created federal gas guzzler excise tax on the sale of auto mobiles with relatively low fuel economy ratings this tax which is still in effect currently ranges from 1000 for an automobile rated between 215 and 225 miles per gallon mpg to 7700 for an automobile rated at less than 125 mpg chief among the taxes on oil was the windfall profit tax wpt enacted in 1980 pl 96223 the wpt imposed an excise tax of 15 to 70 on the differen ce between the market price of oil and predetermined adjusted base price th is tax which was repealed in 1988 was part of political compromise that decontrolle d oil prices between 1971 and 1980 oil prices were controlled under president nixons economic stab ilization act of 1970 the socalled wageprice freeze for more detail on the windfall profit tax on crude oil that was imposed from 1980 til its repeal in 1988 see crs report rl33305 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy by salvatore lazzari another but relatively small excise tax on petroleum was instituted in 1980 the environmental excise tax on crude oil received at us refinery this tax part of the comprehensive environmental re sponse compensation and liability act of 1980 pl 96510 otherwise known as the superfund program was designed to charge oil refineries for the cost of rel easing any hazardous materials that resulted from the refining of crude oil the ta x rate was set initia lly at 079 00079 per barrel and was subsequently ra ised to 970 per barrel this tax expired at the end of 1995 but legislation has been proposed since then to reinstate it as part of superfund reauthorization the third broad action taken during the 1970s to implement the new and refocused energy tax policy was the in troduction of numerous tax incentives or subsidies eg special tax credits deducti ons exclusions for energy conservation the development of alternative fuels re newable and nonconventi onal fuels and the commercialization of energy fficiency and alternative fu els technologies most of these new tax subsidies were introduced as part of the energy tax act of 1978 and expanded under the wpt which also introduced additional new energy tax subsidies the following list describes these residential and business energy tax credits the eta provided income tax credits for homeowners and businesses that invested in variety of energy conservation products eg insu lation and other energyconserving components and for solar and wind energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs5 equipment installed in principal home or business the business energy tax credits were 10 to 15 of the investment in conservation or alternative fuel s technologies such as synthetic fuels solar wind geothermal nd biomass these tax credits were also expanded as part of the wpt but they generally expired except for business use of solar and geot hermal technologies as scheduled either in 1982 or 1985 15 investment tax credit for business use of solar and geothermal ener gy which was made permanent is all that remains of these tax credits tax subsidies for alcohol fuels the eta also introduced the excise tax exemption for gasohol recently at 52 per gallon out of gasoline tax of 184gal subse quent legislation extended the exemption and converted it into an immediate tax credit currently at 51gallon of ethanol percentage deple tion for geothermal the eta made geothermal deposits eligible for the percentage depletion allowance at the rate of 22 currently the rate is 15 29 tax credit for unconventional fuels the 1980 wpt included 300 in 1979 dollars production ta x credit to stimulate the supply of selected unconventional fu els oil from shale or tar sands gas produced from geopressurized brine devonian shale tight formations or coalbed methane gas from biomass and synthetic fuels from coal in current dollars this credit which is still in effect for certain types of fuels was 656 per barrel of liquid fuels and about 116 per thousand cubic feet mcf of gas in 2004 taxexempt interest on industrial development bonds the wpt made facilities for producing fuels from solid waste exempt from federal taxation of in terest on industrial velopment bonds idbs this exemption was for the benef it of the development of alcohol fuels produced from biomass for solidwastetoenergy facilities for hydroelectric facilities and for facilities for produc ing renewable energy idbs which provide signif icant benefits to state and local electric utilities public power had become popular source of financing for renewable energy projects some of these incentives for example the residential energy tax credits have since expired but others remain nd still new ones have been introduced such as the 45 renewable electricity tax cr edit which was introduced in 1992 and expanded under the american jobs cr eation act of 2004 pl 108357 this approach toward energy tax policy subs idizing plethora of different forms of energy both conventional and renewable and providi ng incentives for diverse energy conservation efficien cy technologies in as many sectors as possible has been the paradigm followed by policymaker s since the 1970s significant increase in nontax interventions in the energy markets laws and regulations such as the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards to reduce transportation fuel use and other interventions through th budget and the credit markets has alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs6 been significant feature of energy po licy since the 1970s this included some of the most extensive energy legislation ever enacted energy tax policy in the 1980s the freemarket approach the reagan administration opposed using the tax law to promote oil and gas development energy conservation or the s upply of alternative fuels the idea was to have more neutral nd less distortionary energy tax policy which economic theory predicts would make energy markets work more efficiently and generate benefits to the general economy the r eagan administration believed that the responsibility for commercializ ing conservation and altern ative energy technologies rested with the private sector and that high oil prices real oil prices corrected for inflation were at historically high levels in 1981 and 1982 would be ample encouragement for the development of alte rnative energy resources high oil prices in themselves create conservation incentiv and stimulate il and gas production president reagans freemarket views were well known prior to his election during the 1980 presidential campaign he proposed repealing the wpt deregulating oil and natural gas prices and minimizing government intervention in the energy markets the reagan administrations energy tax policy was professed more formally in several energy and tax policy studies incl uding its 1981 national energy policy plan and the 1983 update to this plan it culminated in 1984 treasury study on general tax reform which also proposed fundamental reform s of federal energy tax policy in terms of act ual legislation many of th reagan administrations objectives were realized lthough as discussed below th ere were unintended effects in 1982 the business energy tax cred its on most types of nonrenewable technologies those enacted under the eta of 1978 were allowed to expire as scheduled other business credits and the residential energy tax credits were allowed to expire at the end of 1985 also as sche duled only the tax credits for business solar geothermal ocean thermal and biomass technologies were extended as mentioned above today the tax credit for business investment in solar and geothermal technologies which has since b een reduced to 10 is all that remains of these tax credits final accomplishment was the repeal of the wpt but not until 1988 the end of reagans second term th reagan administrations other energy tax policy proposals however were not adopted the tax incentives for oil and gas were not eliminated although th ey were pared back as part of the tax reform act tra of 1986 although the reagan administrations objective was to create freemarket energy policy significant liberalization of the depreciation system and reduction in marginal tax rates both the result of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 erta pl 9734 combined with the regular investment tax credit and the business energy investment tax credits resulted in negative effective tax rates for many investments including alternative energy investments such as solar and synthetic fuels also the retention of percentage depletion and expensing of idcs even at the reduced rates rendered oil and gas investments still favored relative to investments in generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs7 energy tax policy after 1988 after the reagan administration seve ral major energy and nonenergy laws were enacted that amended the energy tax laws in several ways some major revenue provisions of the omn ibus reconciliation act of 1990 president george hw bushs first major tax law included numerous energy tax incentives 1 for conservation and deficit reduction the law increased the gasoline tax by 5gallon and doubled the gasguzzler tax 2 for oil and gas the law introduced 10 tax credit for enhanced oil recovery expenditures liberalized some of the restrictions on the pe rcentage depletion allowance and reduced the impact of the alternative minimum tax on oil and gas investments and 3 for alterna tive fuels the law expanded the 29 tax credit for unconventional fuels and introduced the tax credit for small producers of ethanol used as motor fuel energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 this broad energy measure introduced the 45 tax credit at 15 per kilowatt hour for electricity generated from wind nd closedloop biomass systems poultry litter was added later fo r new facilities this tax credit expired at the end of 2001 and again in 2003 but has been retroactively extended by recent tax legislation as di scussed below in addition the 1992 law 1 added an income tax deduction for the costs up to 2000 of cleanfuel powered vehicles 2 liberalized the alcohol fuels tax exemption 3 expanded the 29 production tax credit for nonconventional energy re sources and 4 liberalized the tax breaks for oil and gas omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 president clinton proposed diffe rential btu tax on fossil fuels broadly based general ta x primarily on oil gas and coal based on the british thermal units of heat output which was dropped in favor of broadly applied 43gallon increas in the excise taxes on motor fuels with revenues allocated for deficit reduction rather than the various trust funds taxpayer relief act of 1997 p l 10534 this law included variety of excise tax provisions for motor fuels of which some involved tax reductions on alternative transpor tation fuels and some involved increases such as on ke rosene which on balance further tilted energy tax policy toward alternative fuels tax relief and extension act enacted as title v of the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106 170 it extended and liberalized the 15kwh renewable electricity production tax credit nd renewed the suspension of the net income limit on the percentage depletion allowance for marginal oil and gas wellshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs8 as this list suggests the postreagan energy tax policy returned more to the interventionist course blished during the 1970s and primarily was directed at energy conservation and alternative fuels mostly for the purpose of reducing oil import dependence and enha ncing energy security however there is an environmental twist to ener gy tax policy during this period particularly in the clinton years fiscal concerns which for most of that period created perennial search for more revenues to reduce budget defi cits have also driv energy tax policy proposals during the postreagan era this is underscored by proposals which have not been enacted to impose broadbased ergy taxes such as the btu tax or the carbon tax to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions another interesting feature of the postreagan energy tax policy is that while the primary focus continues to be energy conservation and lternative fuels energy tax legislation has been enacted dur ing this period that does not also include some relatively minor tax relief for the oil and gas industry either in the form of new tax incentives or liberalization of existing tax breaks or both energy tax incentives in comprehensive energy legislation since 1998 several negative energy market deve lopments since about 1998 characterized by some as an energy crisis have d to congressional acti on on comprehensive energy proposals which included numerous energy tax incentives brief history of comprehensive energy policy proposals although the primary rationale for co mprehensive energy legislation has historically been spiking petroleum prices and to lesser extent spiking natural gas and electricity prices the origin of bills introduced in the late 1990s was the very low crude oil prices of that peri od domestic crude oil prices reached low of just over 10 per barrel in the winter of 19981999 among the lowest crude oil prices in history after correcting for inflation from 1986 to 1999 oil prices averaged about 17 per barrel fluctuating be tween 12 and 20 per barrel these low oil prices hurt oil producers benefitted oil re finers and encouraged cons umption they also served as disincentive to conservation and inves tment in energy efficiency technologies and discouraged production of alternative fuels and re newable technologies to address the low oil prices there were many tax bills in the first session of the 106th congress 1999 focused on pr oduction tax credits for marg inal or stripper wells but they also included carryback provisions for net operating sses and other fossil fuels supply provisions by summer 1999 crude oil prices rose to about 20 per barrel and peaked at more than 30 per barrel by summer 2000 causing higher gasoline diesel and heating oil prices to address the effects of rising crude oil prices legislative proposals again focused on production tax cr edits and other supply incentives the rationale was not tax relief for depressed industry but tax incentives to increase output reduce prices and provide price relief to consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs9 in addition to higher petroleum prices there were forces some of which were understood factors such as environmenta l regulations and pipeline breaks and others that are still are not so clearly unde rstood that caused the prices of refined petroleum products to spike in respons there were proposals in 2000 to either temporarily reduce or eliminate the federal excise tax on gasoline diesel and other special motor fuels the proposals aimed to help consumers i ncluding truckers cushion the financial effect of the price spikes the midwest gasoline price spike in summer 2000 kept interest in these excise tax moratoria alive nd generated interest in proposals for windfall profit tax on oil companies which by then were earning substantial profits from high prices despite numerous bills to address these issues major energy tax bill was enacted in the 106th congress however some minor amendments to energy tax provisions were enacted as part of nonenerg tax bills this includes title v of the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 also the 106th congress did enact package of 500 million in loan guarantees for small independent oil and gas producers pl 10651 energy tax action in the 107th congress in early 2001 the 107th congress faced combination of fluctuating oil prices an electricity crisis in california and spiking natural gas prices the gas prices had increased steadily in 2000 and reached 9 per thousand cubic feet mcf at the outset of the 107th congress at one point spot mark et prices reached about 30 per mcf the energy equivalent of 175 per barrel of oil the combination of energy problems had developed into an energy crisis which prompted congressional action on comprehensive energy policy bill the firs t since 1992 that included significant expansion of energy tax incentives and s ubsidies and other energy policy measures in 2002 the house and senate approved two distinct versions of an omnibus energy bill hr 4 while there were s ubstantial differences in the nontax provisions of the bill the energy tax measures also differed significantly the house bill proposed larger energy tax cuts with so energy tax increases it would have reduced energy taxes by about 365 billion ove r 10 years in contrast to the senate bill which cut about 183 billion over 10 ears including about 51 billion in tax credits over 10 years for two mandates re newable energy portfolio standard 03 billion and renewable fuel standard 48 billion the house version emphasized conventional fuels supply including cap ital investment incentives to stimulate production and distribution of il natural gas and electri city this focus assumed that recent energy problems were due main ly to supply and capacity shortages driven by economic growth and low energy prices in comparison the senate bill would have provided much smalle r amount of tax incentives for fossil fuels and nuclear power and somewhat fewer incentives for energy efficiency but provided more incentives for alternative and renewable fuels the conference committee on hr 4 could not resolve differences so th bills were dropped on november 13 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs10 energy tax action in the 108th congress on the house side on april 3 2003 the ways and means committee wmc voted 2412 for an

tax issues ethanol tax subsidies the 29 unconventional fuels tax credit tax incentives for nuclear power and clean coal on november 18 2003 the house approved by fairly wide margin 246180 the conference report containing about 235 billion of energy tax incentives however the proposed ethanol mandate would furt her reduce energy tax receipts the 10 year revenue loss was projected to be around 26 billion on november 24 senate republicans put aside attempts to enact h r 6 number of uneasy alliances pieced together to bridge contentious divides over regional issues as varied as

energy po licy act of 2005 pl 10958 which included the most extensive amendments to us energy tax laws since 1992 and the tax relief and health care act of 2006 which extended the energy tax subsidies enacted under the 2005 energy policy act epact05 the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 on june 28 2005 the senate approved by an 8512 vot broadly based energy bill hr 6 with an 11year 186 billion package of energy tax breaks tilted toward renewable energy resources and conser vation joint committee on taxation figures released on june 28 show that the bill included about 02 billion in nonenergy tax cuts and more than 47 billion in revenue ffsets meaning the bill had total tax cut of 188 billion over 11 years offset by the 47 billion in tax increases the house energy bill which included energy tax incentives totaling about 81 billion over 11 years and tax increases was approved in april this bill was weighted almost entirely toward fossil fuels and electricity supply on july 27 2005 the conference committee on hr 6 reached agreement on 111 billion of energy tax incentives including 3 billion in tax increases both energy and nonenergy the distribution of the cuts by type of fuel for each of the three versions of hr 6 is shown in table 1 one way to briefly compare the two measures is to compare revenue losses from the energy tax incentives alone and the per centage distribution by type of incentive as percent of the net energy tax cuts ie the columns marked divided by the dollar figures in row 11 the net revenue losses over an 11year time frame from fy2005 to fy 2015 were estimated by the joint committee on taxation the total revenue losses are repor ted in two ways the absolute dollar value of tax cuts over 11 years and the percentage distribution of total revenue losses by type of incentive for each measure table 1 shows that the conference repor t provided about 13 billion for energy efficiency and conservation including deduction for energyefficient commercial property fuel cells and microturbines and 45 billion in renewables incentives including twoyear extension of the ta x code 45 credit renewable energy bonds and business credits for solar 26

and electronic pr oducts was dropped from the final version of the energy bill hr 6 instead conferees included provision requiring the treasury and energy departments to c onduct study on recycling the house approved the conference report on july 28 2005 the senate on june 28 2005 one month later on july 28 2005 clearing it fo r the presidents signature on august 8 pl 10958 four revenue offsets were retained in the conference report reinstatement of the oil spill liability trust fund extension of the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund rate whic h would be expanded to all fuels modification of the 197 amortization and small increase in the excise taxes on tires the offsets total roughly 3 billion compared with nearly 5 billion in the senateapproved hr 6 because the oil spill liability tax and the leaking underground storage tank financing taxes are imposed on oil refineries the oil and gas refinery and distribution sector row 2 of table 1 received net tax increase of 1769 28571088 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 after expanding energy tax incentives in the epact05 the 109th congress moved to rescind oil and gas incentives and even to raise energy taxes on oil and gas in response to the high energy prices and resulting record oil and gas industry profits many bills were introduced in the 109th congress to pare back or repeal the oil and gas industry tax subsidies and other l oopholes both those acted under epact05 as well as those that preex isted epact05 many of the bills focused on the oil and gas exploration and development ed subsidy expensing of intangible drilling costs idcs this subsidy which has been in existence since the early days of the income tax is available to integrated and independent oil and gas companies both large and small alike3 it is an exploration and velopment incentive which allows the immediate tax writeoff of what economica lly are capital costs that is the costs of creating capital asset the oil and gas well public and congressional out cry over high crude oil nd product prices and the oil and gas industrys record profits did lead to paring back of one of epact05s tax subsidies twoyear am ortization rather than capita lization of geological and geophysical gg costs including thos associated with abandoned wells dry holes prior to the epact05 gg costs fo r dry holes were expensed in the first year and for successful wells they were capitalized which is consistent with economic theory and accounting principles the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109 222 signed into law may 2006 reduced the value ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs13 the subsidy by raising the amortization period from two years to five years still faster than the capitalization treatme nt before the 2005 act but slower than the treatment under that act the higher amortization period applies only to the major integrated oil companies independent unintegrated oil companies may continue to amortize all gg costs over two years and it applies to abandoned as well as ccessful properties this change increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by an estimated 189 million over 10 years effectively rescinding about 20 of the nearly 11 billion 11year tax for oil and gas production under epact05 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 at the end of 2006 the 109th congress enacted tax extenders package that included extension of numerous renewable energy and excise tax provisions many of the renewable energy provision in this bill had already been extended under the energy policy act of 2005 and were not set to expire til the end of 2007 or later the tax relief and health care act of 2006 provided for oneyear extensions of these provisions current posture of energy tax policy the above background discussion of ergy tax policy may be conveniently summarized in table 2 which shows current energy tax provisions both special or targeted energy tax subsidies and ta rgeted energy taxes and related revenue effects minus sign indicates revenue losses wh ich means that the provision is tax subsidy or incentive intended to increase the subsidized activity energy conservation measures or the supply of some alternative and renewable fuel or technology minus sign means that the provision is tax which means that it should reduce supply of or demand for th taxed activity eith er conventional fuel supply energy demand or the demand for ergyusing technologies such as cars note that the table defines those special or targeted tax subsidies or incentives as those that are due to provisions in the tax law that apply only to that particular industry and not to others thus for exampl in the case of the oil and gas industry the table excludes tax subsidies and incentives of current law that may apply generally to all businesses but that may also confer tax benefits to it there are numerous such provisions in the tax code complete listing of them is beyond the scope of this report however the following example illustrates the point the current system of depreciation allows the writeoff of equipment and structures somewhat faster than would be the case under both general accounting principles and economic theory the joint committee on taxation treats the excess of depreciation deductions over the alternative deprecia tion system as tax subsidy or tax expenditure in fy2006 the jct estimate s that the aggregate revenue loss from this accelerated depreciation deduction i ncluding the expensing under irc 179 is 67 billion certain but unknown fraction of this revenue loss or tax benefits accrues to the domestic oil and gas industr but separate timates are unavailable this point applies to all the industries reflected in table 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs14 4 there is an important economic distinction between subsidy and tax benefit as is discussed elsewhere in this report firms re ceive variety of tax benefits that are not necessarily targeted subsidies or tax expend itures because they are available generallyenergy tax policy in the 110th congress continued high crude oil and petroleum product prices and oil and gas industry profits and the po litical rea lignment of the congress resulting from the 2006 congressional elections continued the energy policy shift toward increased taxes on the oil and gas industry and the emphasis on energy conservation and alternative and renewable fuels rather than conventional hydrocarbons4 in the 110th congress the shift became reflected in proposals to reduce oil and gas production incentives or subsidies which were in itially incorporated into but ultimately dropped from comprehensive energy policy legislation in the debate over these two comprehensive energy bills raising taxes on the oil and gas industry by either repealing tax incentives enacted under epact05 by intr oducing new taxes on the industry or by other means was key objective motivated by the feeling that additional tax incentives were unnecessary record crude oil and gasoline prices and industry profits provides sufficient i f not excessive incentives in early december 2007 it appeared th at the congressional conferees had reached agreement on another comprehensiv energy bill the energy independence and security act hr 6 nd particularly on the controve rsial energy tax provisions the democratic leadership in the 110th congress proposed to eliminate or reduce tax subsidies for oil and gas and use the additi onal revenues to increase funding for their energy policy priorities energy efficiency and alternative and renewable fuels ie reducing fossil fuel demand rather than an energy oil and gas supply increase in addition congressional leaders wanted to ex tend many of the energy efficiency and renewable fuels tax incentives that either had expired or were about to expire the compromise on the energy tax title in hr 6 proposed to raise taxes by about 21 billion to fund extensions and lib eralization of existing energy tax incentives however the senate stripped the controversial tax title from its version of the comprehensive energy bill hr 6 and then passed the bill 868 on december 13 2007 leading to the presidents signing of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 on december 19 2007 the only taxrelated provisions that survived we re 1 an extension of the federal unemployment tax act surtax fo r one year raising about 15 bi llion 2 higher penalties for failure to file partnership returns in creasing revenues by 655 million and 3 an extension of the amortizat ion period for geological and geophysical expenditures from five to seven years raising 103 million in revenues the latter provision was the only tax increase on the oil and gas industry in the final bill those three provisions would offset the 21 billion in lost excise tax revenues going into the federal highway trust fund as resu lt of the implementa tion of the revised corporate average fuel economy standards the decision to strip the much larger 21 billion tax title stemmed from white house veto threat and the senates inability to get the votes required to end

taxable year the deduction was 3 of income for 2006 is currently 6 and is scheduled to increase to 9 when fully phased in by 2010 7 several times in the 110th congress the senate has not taken action on energy tax legislation due to the failure to invoke clot ure on the motion to proceed to the house energy tax extenders bills the first was june 10 2008 when the motion failed by vote of 5044 the second was on june 17 when the motion failed by vote of 5244 the third was july 29 when the cloture motion failed by vote of 53 to 43 in addition on july 30 the senate rejected by vote of 51 to 43 motion to in voke cloture on motion to proceed to debate s 3335 senator baucus energy tax billsince then the congress had tried several times to pass energy tax legislation and thus avoid the impending expiration of several popular energy tax incentives such as the wind energy tax credit unde r internal revenue code irc 45 which since its enactment in 1992 had lapsed th ree times only to be reinstated5 several energy tax bills have passed the hous but not the senate where on several occasions the failure to invoke cloture failed to bring up the legislation for consideration senate republicans objected to the idea of raising taxes to offset extension of expiring energy tax provisions which they consider to be an extension of current tax policy rather than new ta x policy in addition senate republicans objected to raising taxes on the oil and gas industry such as by repealing the irc 199 deduction and by streamlining the fo reign tax credit for oil companies6 the bush administration repeatedly threatened to veto these types of energy tax bills in part because of their proposed increas ed taxes on the oil and gas industry hr 5351 frustrated with the lack of action on energy tax legislation over the last two years house democrats introduced and approved several such bills such as hr 5351 which was approved by the house on february 27 2008 house speaker pelosi and other democrats sent president bush letter february 28 2008 urging him to reconsider his opposition to the democratic renewable energy plan arguing that their energy tax plan would correct an imbalance in the tax code hr 6049 as noted several times th house had approved ener gy tax legislation and several times in the senate such legislation failed cloture vote and thus could not be brought to the floor for debate the latest was hr 6049 the house tax extenders bill which was approved by the hous on may 21 2008 but failed three cloture votes in the

house democratic leaderships draft of broadbased ener gy policy legislation the comprehensive american energy security and consumer protection act pa ssed on september 16 2008 the bill reverses the longstanding opposition of democratic leaders to expanding oil and gas drilling offshore by allowing oil and gas exploration and production in areas of the outer continenta l shelf that are currently off limits except for waters in the gulf of mexico off the florida coast under the bill states could allow such drilling between 50 and 100 miles offshore while the federal government could permit drilling from 100 to 200 miles offshore8 revenue from the new offshore leases would be used to assist the development of alternative energy and would not be shared by the adjacent coasta l states the bill also repeals the current ban on leasing federal lands for oil shale pr oduction if states enact laws providing for such leases and production hr 6899 also enacts renewable portfolio standard

legislation would need to be paid for through new sources of revenue one proposed offset which had been previously blocked by some republicans would ve completely repealed the irc 199 manufacturing

proposal to eliminate the distinction between foreign oilandgas extraction income and foreign oilrelated income and an extension and increase in the oil spill tax through the end of 2017 in total tax increases on the oil and gas industry would account for 31 billion of the 40 billion total cost of the legislation the fina l major offset would have come from requirement on securities brokers to report on the cost basis for transactions they handle to the internal revenue service provision expected to raise about 8 billion in new revenues over 10 years the economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 as noted above some republicans had in the past objected to the idea of raising taxes to offset extension of ex piring energy tax provisions which they consider to be an extension of current

administration threatened also to veto any energy tax bill that would increase taxes on the oil and gas industry at this writing it appears that inclusion of the 199 deduction repeal as an offset might preclude the energy tax bill from coming to the senate floor some believe that it would fail nother cloture vote so this provision might not survive the process10 given continued republican opposition including possible presidential veto and to avoid another legisl ative impasse failed clot ure vote senators baucus and grassley released s caleddown version of s 347811 this energy tax extenders package ie the substitute of s 3478 is substitute amendment to the previously houseapproved energy tax ex tenders bill hr 6049 is valued at nearly 17 billion less than half the size of s 3478 and is fully offset the modified draft bill would also raise revenue by increasing the tax bur den on the oil industry unlike the original version of s 3478 however which would have repealed the 199 for major integrated oil companies completely the substitute bill would freeze the value of the manufacturing deduction for all oil comp anies at 6 the current rate this modification is estimated to raise 49 b illion over 10 years about 23 less than complete repeal because of smaller tax increases the bills remaining provisions measures to increase tax subsidies for rene wable fuels and for energy efficiency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs18 had to be cut back thus the scaleddown bill drops the nuclear electricity production tax credit provision scales back the 45 renewable electricity tax credit and generally shortens the extension periods the substitute amendment of s 3478 s amdt 5633 was added to hr 6049 which also includes an amt patch disaster tax relief and extens ions of nonenergy individual and business tax provisions it was passed by the nate on september 23 by vote of 932 there was only one change to the original baucusgrassley substitute version language extending

stabilization legislation hr 1424 as subdivision b the energy improvement nd extension act of 2008 on october 3 president bush signed this legislation the economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 which includes 17 billion in energy tax incentives primarily extensions of preexisting provisions but also includi ng several new energy tax incentives 109 billion in renewable energy tax incen tives aimed at clean energy production 26 billion in incentives targeted toward cl eaner vehicles and fuels and 35 billion in tax breaks to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency the cost of the energy tax extenders legislation is fully financed or paid for by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry mostly by reducing il and gas tax breaks and by other tax increases the oil and gas tax increas comprise cutbacks in the irc 199 manufacturing deduction for in come attributable to il and gas production which will be frozen at 6 rather than increasing to 9 as scheduled reforming the foreign tax credit provisions and by incr easing the perbarrel tax rate on refinery crude oil under the oil spill liability trust fund provisions windfall profit tax legislation over the past ten years surging crude oil and petroleum product prices have increased oil and gas industry revenues and generated record profits particularly for the top five major integrated companies also known as the supermajors exxon mobil royal dutch shell bp chevr on and conocophillips these companies which reported predominate share of those profits generated over 100 billion dollars in profits on nearly 15 trilli on of revenues in 2007 from 2003 to 2007 revenues increased by 51 net income p rofits increased by 85 oil output for the five majors over this time period declined by over 2 from 985 to 963 million barrels per day since oil industry income has been largely price driven with increase in output and with little new production resulting from increased oil industry investment many be lieve that portion of the increased income over this period represents windfa ll and unearned gain ie income not earned by any additional effort on the part of the firms but due primarily to record crude oil prices which are set in the world oil marketplace numerous bills have been introduced in the congress over this period to impose windfall profit tax wpt on oil most of the bills were introduced in the 109th and 110th congresses after the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 which provided additional oil and gas industry tax incentives on top of the industrys traditional tax subsidies s 3044 for instance would roll back 17 billion in existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33578crs19 tax breaks over 10 years for the largest oil companies and impose 25 windfall profit tax on major oil companies reve nues would be earmarked to expanding renewable energy development in general an excisetax based wpt like the one in effect from 19801988 would increase marg inal oil production costs reduce domestic oil supply and raise petroleum imports making the united states more dependent on foreign oil undermining goals of energy independence and energy security by contrast the incometax based wpt would be more economically neutral less distortionary in the shortrun sizeable re venues could be raised without reducing domestic oil supplies which mean s oil imports would not tend to increase neither the excisetax based or incometax based wpt are expected to have significant price effects neither tax would increase the price of crude oil which means that refined petroleu m product prices such as pump prices would likely not tend to increase in lieu of these two types of wpt an administratively simple way of increasing the tax burden on the oil industry and th erefore recouping some of the excess or windfall profits particularly from major integrated producers would raise the corporate tax rate by for instance repea ling or reducing the domestic manufacturing activities deduction under irc 199 this deduction is presently 6 of firms net income and is available generally to all domestic manufacturing businesses service firms are excluded including almost all il firms repealing this deduction for the major integrated oil companies and freezing it at 6 for the remaining qualifying oil companies is estimated by the join t committ ee on taxation to generate bout 10
