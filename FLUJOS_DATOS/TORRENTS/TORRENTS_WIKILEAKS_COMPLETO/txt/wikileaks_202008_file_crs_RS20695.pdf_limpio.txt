and finance division summary us firms have long received tax benefit for operations in puerto rico and other us possessions the benefits purpose is to generate employmentcreating investment in the possessions prior to 1996 the provision was known as the possessions tax credit and was provided under section 936 of the internal revenue code in the years following world war ii the government of puerto rico depended on the credit and its own set of tax benefits to attract investment to puerto rico from the us mainland the tax benefit and the inflow of investment it stimulated helped transform the puerto rican economy from one based on agriculture to one based on manufacturing services and trade however the credit was criticized on several grounds that it had high revenue cost compared to its employment effect that large share of the benefit did not accrue to residents of puerto rico and that it distorted deliberations over puerto ricos political status as result over the past 20 years the credit has been subject to series of modifications designed to limit its revenue cost and tie the credits benefit and effects more tightly to puerto rico the modifications culminated with the small business job creation act of 1996 which scheduled the credit for phaseout and ultimate repeal in 2005 the tax creditrenamed the puerto rican economic activity credit eacis now authorized by section 30a of the tax code separate phaseout schedule and rules apply to the possessions other than puerto rico the clinton administration for several years has proposed extending modified version of the credit beyond its expiration date and several proposals in congress would also modify and extend the credit this report will be updated as legislative developments occur the possessions tax credit prior to 1993 while the tax benefit for possessions1 investment is technically tax credit that reduces taxes rather than taxable income prior to 1993 the credit was equal to firms full federal tax

crsof full tax exemption for income us firms could attribute to operations in the possessions to qualify for the credit corporation was required to earn at least 80 of its income in possession and at least 75 of its income was required to be from the active conduct of trade or business in the possessions most firms that used the possessions tax credit did so by establishing subsidiary corporations that met the section 936 requirements it was the qualifying subsidiaries called possessions corporations that earned taxfavored possessionssource income further since the possessions corporations were uschartered corporations their mainland parents could generally qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction the tax code provides for payments between related us corporations this removed the possibility that taxes might apply when the exempt possessions income was remitted to the mainland parent corporations as intrafirm dividends while the tax credit is scheduled to expire in 2006 it should be noted that even without the tax credit full federal taxat ion would not necessarily apply to us firms in puerto rico corporations chartered in the possessions are considered foreign corporations for tax purpo ses and so can use an alternative tax benefit known as deferral that is available for the operations of us firms in foreign countries under deferral us firms can postpone us tax on foreign income as long as the foreign income is reinvested abroad still the possessions tax credit and the current eac is permanent exemption while for some firms deferral is only temporary in addition notwithstanding restrictions imposed in 1982 and 1986 relatively generous incomeallocation rules apply under the possessions tax credit that potentially make it easier for firms to shift income from various sources to the possessions where the income is protected from taxation by the tax credit legislation 19761993 issues of targeting and revenue cost legislation aimed at limiting the benefits revenue cost and targeting it more tightly to the possessions began with the tax reform act of 1976 pl 94455 which restricted the tax exemption to income earned in the possessions themselves2 prior to the act as long as corporation qualified as possessions corpora tion all its incomefrom the possessions and other sources alikewas exempt from tax legislation with the same cost and targeting concerns was again considered in 1982 but now focused on income shifting the possessions tax credit was heavily used by firms that invest intensively in intangible assets the credits use by pharmaceutical firms and electronics companies for example was especially high prior to 1982 there were concerns that firms were using transfers of intangibles at unrealistic prices to shift large amounts of what was really mainlandsource income to possessions subsidiaries that qualified for the exemption and that could shelter the mainland income from tax in response to these concerns the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 tefra pl 97248 provided set of rules governing the allocation of income from intangibles in the case of possessions corporations and their mainland parentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20695crs3 3 us president reagan the presidents tax proposals to the congress for fairness growth and simplicity washington 1985 p 309 4 us department of the treasury

after tefra with its 1985 proposals for broad tax reform the reagan administration pointed out that the possessions tax credit provided direct incentive for firms to boost their employment in the possessions indeed since the corporate income tax is tax on the return to capital an exemption is an incentive to employ capital not labor the reagan administration proposed replacing the possessions tax credit with tax credit equal to specified portion of firms wages paid in the possessions3 however congress did not include the administrations proposals for section 936 reform when it passed the landmark tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 the 1986 act did however include rules designed to further limit income shifting to possessions corporations modified version of the wage credit proposal was ultimately adopted in 1993 with the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra93 pl 10366 the measure was initially proposed by the clinton administration which stated that disproportionate share of the provisions benefit was realized by intangibleintensive industries that create relatively few jobs in the possessions and that while section 936 has created employment in puerto rico the number of jobs created is too small in relation to the tax expenditure4 obra93s provisions remain essentially intact under current law subject to new phaseout rules so they are worth describing in some detail the new law altered section 936 by imposing cap on the existing full tax exemption firm calculated its possessions tax credit as under prior law but the maximum credit it could claim was limited by the cap the cap was equa l to one of two alternative limitations which applied was up to the taxpayer under the first known as the percentage limitation firms possessions tax credit was equal to specified percentage of the credit the firm could have claimed under prior law after phasein period the percentage was set at 40 under the second alternative known as the economicactivity limitationa firms maximum credit was limited to an amount equal to the sum of three factors one factor was 60 of possessions corporations wages paid in the possessions qualified wages however were limited for each employee to 85 of the amount subject to social security taxes the second factor was specified percentage of the possessions corporations depreciation deductions for the taxable year the applicable percentage depended on the type of property 15 for property with relatively short recovery period 40 for property with mediumlength recovery period and 65 for longlived property5 for firms whose tax credit was constrained by the limitations the caps functioned in manner similar to wage credit and credit for investment for example firm subject to the constraint could reduce its tax bill by 60 cents for each additional dollar spent on wages6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20695crs4 6 continued research service the possessions tax credit economic analysis of the 1993 revisions crs report

washington us govt print off 1996 p 20713the small business job creation act of 1996 congress continued to focus on the possessions tax credit after obra93 in november 1995 congress passed the balanced budget act hr 2491 and included provision phasing out the credit over 10 years president clinton vetoed the bill and the tax credits phaseout was one provision the administration singled out for criticism the president proposed to instead restrict the credit s calculation to obra93s economic activity limitation that links the benefit with wages and tangible possessions investment the administration viewed its proposal as further movement in the direction begun in 1993 instead in 1996 congress passed and the president signed the small business job protection act pl 104188 which contained among its various tax provisions the essential elements of the 1995 phaseout proposal under its terms the credit is phased out over 10year period and is scheduled for repeal beginning in 2006 in providing for the phaseout and repeal congress cited reasons of fairness and revenue concerns stating that it understood that the tax benefits provided by the puerto rico and possession tax credit are enjoyed by only the relatively small number of us corporations that operate in the possessions moreover the congress was concerned about the tax cost of the benefits provided to these possession corporations that is borne by all us taxpayers7 the repeal of the tax credit was effective immediately for firms not already using the benefit for other firms existing claimants in the acts language the credits phase out rules depended on whether they use the economic activity limitation or the alternative 40 exemption for economic activity firms the amount of the credit is determined as under obra93 through 2001 beginning in 2002 the credit for these firms is subject to an additional cap the cap restricts income eligible for the credit to the firms average profits during base period prior to 1996 increased for inflation and proxy for economic growth for firms using obra93s alternative 40 exemption the 1996 act applied the baseperiod income cap beginning in 1999 firms were permitted to change the particular limitation they had chosen under obra93s rules while the repeal of the credit applies to all possessions existing claimants in possessions other than puerto rico and the us virgin islands ie guam american samoa and the northern marianas were exempted from the baseperiod cap in addition for firms in puerto rico using the economic activities limitation the 1996 act

limitation while the previous budgets proposals stated that the limit would be removed we thus assume the limitation would remain under the current proposal it is not clear however how the limit would apply to new claimantsto recap in 2000 the state of the phaseout in puerto rico is this only existing claimants can now claim the tax credit for firms who have elected obra93s 40 exemption the credit is now restricted by an added limitation linked to baseperiod earnings firms using the eac are not currently subject to the baseperiod cap but will be beginning in 2002 the credit will expire completely on january 1 2006 current proposals and issues in each of the four budgets the clinton administration has submitted since 1996 it has proposed extending modified version of the puerto rican tax credit the administ ration stated that the proposals purpose is to provide more efficient and effective tax incentive for the economic development of puerto rico and to continue the shift from an incomebased credit to an economicactivity credit that was begun in obra938 the first three of the proposals would have disallowed the optional 40 exemption but extended the eac indefinitely the proposals also would have allowed new claimants to use the credit and would have repealed the baseperiod earnings limita tion that is scheduled to begin in 2002 the most recent administration budget proposal for fy2001 would remove the existing claimant restriction on the credit and would exten d the eac version of the credit in contrast to the preceding budgets however the present proposal would extend the credit only through 20089 two bills to extend the eac have been proposed in congress like the administrations latest proposal s 212 sen moynihan would extend the credit through 2008 but would restrict its use to firms using the eac version of the credit the bill would relax but not eliminate the existing claimant rules and would repeal the baseperiod cap hr 2138 rep crane would also restrict the credit to the eac and would repeal the baseperiod cap in contrast to the senate bill however hr 2138 would replace the extension through 2008 with flexible extension under its provisions the credit would be extended indefinitely but only if certain economic indicators for the possession are not exceeded stated differently if possessions economy meets certain performance standards the credit would expire if possessions unemployment for particular year does not exceed 150 of mainland unemployment the possessions per capita income is at least 60 of that of the mainland and the possessions poverty level does not exceed 30 the tax credit for that possession would be repealed in the fourth year following the year in which the performance indicators are met in addition to these two bills chairman roth of the senate finance committee included proposal to liberalize the credits phaseout rules in his chairmans mark of the community renewal and new markets act while the proposal would not extend the ability of firms to earn the credit beyond 2005 it would liberalize the existing claimant rules remove the baseperiod limitation and increase the economic activity limitation for

juan 1999 p a38 a12 the irs figures are 66 of the planning boards total for employmen t and 76 for compensation while the two data sets are not necessarily strictly compatible they support the general point that taxfavored firms from the mainland make up substantial part of employment and compensation in puerto ricos manufacturing sector 11 grubert harry and joel slemrod the effect of taxes on investment and income shifting to puerto rico review of economics and statistics v 80 august 1998 p 365 12 cited in ibid p 372 13 posted by the government development bank of puerto rico on its web site at httpwwwgdb purcomeconomic considerations as noted above the purpose of the puerto rico tax credit is to stimulate employmen tgenerating investment in puerto rico for policy purposes crucial economic question is therefore what is the effect of the tax credit and its modifications on employment in puerto rico what will be the impact of its repeal employment and compensation by firms that use the tax credit are an important part of puerto ricos manufacturing sector and the manufacturing sector in turn is an important part of puerto ricos economy10 thus any impact that may result or has resulted from the 1993 redesign of the credit could potentially be important for puerto ricos economy likewise the impact of the provisions scheduled repeal is potentially important the most recent rigorous study of the tax credit was published by grubert and slemrod in 1998 and assessed the effect of the provision in its pre1993 form it found that the ability of firms to use the credit to shelter nonpossessions income from tax is the predominant reason for us investment in puerto rico and that without the ability to shift taxable income to puerto rico the operating capital and payroll of us firms in puerto rico would be more than twothirds lower11 but this result does not rule out the possibility that linking the tax benefit more directly with tangible investment and employment as with obra93 will or already has produced larger impact on us firms employment in puerto rico than did prior laws version of the credit indeed an earlier study by the same authors found that adoption of wage credit would increase us firms puerto rican payroll substantially12 presumably evidence of any large effect by obra93s changes could be visible by now we can note that puerto ricos economy has registered real growth of between 25 and 42 in each of the years since 199313 beyond this most general observation however thorough analysis of the evidence is beyond the scope of this report
