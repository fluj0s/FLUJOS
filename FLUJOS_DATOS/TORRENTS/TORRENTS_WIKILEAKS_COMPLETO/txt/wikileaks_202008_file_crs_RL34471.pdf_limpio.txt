among veterans introduction considerable public attention has been drawn toward the mental health care needs of veterans especially those return ing from combat in iraq and afghanistan numerous news stories in the popular pr int and electronic media have documented suicides among servicemembers and veterans returning from operation iraqi freedom oif and operation enduring freedom oef1 some veterans advocacy groups have filed classaction lawsuit cl aiming that the depa rtment of veterans affairs va is not providing adequate and timely access to mental health care and that this has led to an epidemic of suicides2 however most often the data cited in these press reports do not differentiate between suicides among veterans and active duty servicemembers3 it is important to make this distinction b ecause two separate health care systems at the va and the department of defens dod respectively are responsible for providing mental health care to these two distinct populations this report explains the difficulties in determining the incidence of suicide among veterans summarizes what is known about suicides in the general popul ation and among vete rans and discusses known risk and protective factors associat ed with suicide in each group it also discusses recent congressional action to address suicide among veterans and suicide prevention efforts by the va the repor t does not discuss dod activities or vas treatment of risk factors for suicide such as depression posttr aumatic stress disorder ptsd and substance abusehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34471crs2 4 in reference to

suicide is an effort that does not have fatal out come and suicidal ideation is thinking about or wanting to end ones life because completed versus attempted suicide results in death national statistics on suicide come from death certificate data4 these data are collected by state and territorial health officials under their authority and are voluntarily reported to the centers for di

cdc also publishes us standard death certificate which states and territories can modify most us deat hs are not investigated by government officials possible suicides may be investigated however pursuant to state and territorial authorities to the extent that death is recognized as suicide the standard death certificate provides the means to report suicide as the manner of death but it has limited options for noting other information that may be relevant to the suicide in 2003 cdc launched th national violent death reporting system nvdrs an active surveillance system that provides detailed in formation about the circumstances of violent deaths including suicide6 the nvdrs augments death certificate data by linking it to death inve stigation reports file d by coroners medical examiners and law enforcement officials these added layers of information allow the nvdrs to identify suicide risk factors such as depression to gather additional information such as toxicology results nd to more reliably capture information that could have been but was not completed on the standard death certificate at this time the nvdrs is not in operation nationw ide but only in 17 states and nvdrs data might not be generalizable to the entire us popula tion also b ecause protocols for death investigation vary fro m one state to the next nvdrs data might not be comparable between those states in which it is in operation cdcs goal is to expand the system to all 50 states all us territories and the district of columbia and to continue efforts to standardize data collection and analysis across states at this time there is nationwide system for surveillance ie tracking of suicide among all veterans as with all suicides in civilian jurisdiction suicides among veterans may be inve stigated and the death certificates completed by state and territorial authorities unless veterans suicide occurs in va facility opportunities for the va to become aware of the

of public health vol 97 12 pp 21938 december 2007 hereafter referred to as zivin et st udy of depression and suicide in veteransapproaches are being used to track the in cidence of suicide among veterans though each of them has serious shortcomings first cdcs standard death certificate allows officials to note if decedent has ever served7 in the us armed forces however the fact that decedent is veteran is not always known when the certificate is completed although suicides among veterans are part of tota l national suicide st atistics it is not known what proportion of that total is ma up of veterans second va data may be linked to cdcs vital statistics data through the national death index ndi this cdc data system allows authorized researchers to link national death data to other data systems identifying the fact that an individual had died of suicide and th at death certificate has been filed8 this would allow the va to identify suicide deaths am ong its enrollees subsequent research steps are cumbersome for example researchers typically must contact state officials to access the actual death certificates the ndi is not an ongoing data linkage that would constitute surveillance for suicide it can be used however to support special studies by linking specific data sets for example researchers from the va and the university of michigan conducted study in which they linked data from vas national registry for depression nardep to the ndi allowing va to match its patient registry to certified suicide deaths even when the decedents veteran status had not been noted on the death certificate9 however because only about onethird of veterans receive their health care from the va using va health systems data for linkage would not capture the complete experience of suicide among veterans third the nvdrs resolves many of th problems discussed above through ongoing active surveillance nvdrs substa ntially improves the likelihood that suicide victims veteran status will be captured and it provides additional useful information about suicide incidents bu t nvdrs is in operation in only 17 states though cdc intends it to become nati onwide system expansion would depend on appropriations congress first provi ded funding for nvdrs in fy2002 and has expressed support for the program in annua l appropriations repor t language the program has not recei ved specified appropriation in recent years but rather is funded through cdcs budget for inten tional injury prevention and control suicide in the us general population there are risk factors that

united states according to cdc there were more than 32000 suicid deaths in the united states in 2004 making it the 11th leading cause of death that year on average there are four suicides among males for each one among females use of firearms is the most common method of suicide among males while poisoning is the most common method among females suicide is the second leading cause of death among 2534 year olds and the third leading cause of death among 1524 year olds although suicide is leading cause of death in younger adults the rate of suicide number of suicides within the age group per 100000 resident population in the age group is actually highest in individuals aged 45 or older table 1 presents suicide rates across age groups in the united states for 2004 as published by cdc it is

librarysriskpdf visited april 30 2008risk and protective factors single cause or factor leads to suicide it is final common outcome with multiple potential antecedents preci pitants and underlying causes11 number of factors are known to increase or decreas the likelihood that an individual will attempt suicide factors that increase this likelihood are called risk factors risk factors exist at multiple levels involving individual family community and societal factors conversely factor s that decrease persons inc lination to attempt suicide are called protective factors which also exist at multiple levels it is important to note that none of these factors in isola tion is known to cause or prevent suicide the single best predictor of an increased risk of suicide is history of prior suicide attempt other risk factors fo r suicide in the general population include certain mental illnesses such as depression alcohol and substance abuse history of trauma or abuse family history of suicide job or financial stress the stigma associated with seeking mental health car barriers to health care access and easy access to lethal means protective fact ors include strong family or community connections accessible and effec tive clinical care skills in problem solving conflict resolution and nonviolent handling of disputes and cultural and re ligious beliefs that discourage suicide12 suicide among veterans in the absence of national surveillance for suicide among veterans information is limited to the findings of special epidemiological studies and surveys these vary considerably in their design and in the subpopulation of vetera ns studied and they often yield conflicting results it is tempting to make comparisons between these studies and with information about suicide in the general population ch comparisons are often made but they are not necessarily valid among other thin gs data about suicides in the general population includes suicides among vetera ns information about suicide in groups that exclude veterans is scant as is info rmation about the extent to which data for veterans may skew the data for the gene ral populati on if at all an additional problem in interpreting the findings of these special studies is that they are often conducted on populations of ve terans who are receiving treatment for suicide risk factors on the one hand this makes it di fficult to determine whether study findings reflect the effects of risk factors or the effects of interventions on the other hand it indicates that efforts to develop systematic surveillance of suicide among veterans may with careful attention to design also provide the means to evaluate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34471crs6 13 nvdrs 2005 report the definition current and

with depression found that having serviceconn ected disability was associated with lower risk of suicide in this group21 the authors suggest that greater access to va health facilities and regular compensation payments may explain the protective effect the effects of ptsd tbi and depression on suicide risk this section describes three suicide risk factors that are common among veterans posttraumatic stre ss disorder ptsd traumatic brain injury tbi and depression ptsd and tbi are common c onsequences of war with distinct symptoms treatment modalities and longterm effects ptsd has been recognized in various forms throughout military history it is an anxiety disorder with symptoms of varying severity that can occur following experiences such as military combat in which grave physical injury occurred or was threatened people who suffer from ptsd often relive the experi ence through nightmares and flashbacks have difficulty sleeping and feel detached or estranged tbi occurs when sudden physical trauma causes damage to the brai n improvised explosive devices ieds which have been used extensively in the current conflict in iraq can cause tbi sometimes in the absence of obvious external signs of injury symptoms of tbi can be mild moderate or severe depending on the extent of the brain injury when symptoms of tbi or ptsd are mild they may go undiagnosed or be confused with conditions with similar symptoms such as other mental illnesses including depression or substance use disorders either ptsd or tbi may cooccur with depression or substance abus finally some veterans have both tbi and ptsd in april 2008 the rand corporation pub lished study of mental health problems in servicemem bers and veterans22 from their review of the literature the authors found that in the general popul ation pression ptsd and tbi are each independent risk factors for suicide more limited information from studies of servicemembers or veterans generally shows the same effect of these three risk factors in specific groups that were studied this inform ation also typically shows trends comparable to those in the general population with respect to other risk factors for suicide though the demonstrated effect s of interactions of these factors with depression ptsd and tbi may differ for example st udies have found that while males are at greater risk of death from suicide than are females the effects that depression ptsd and tb i have on increasing this risk is greater in females among the general population substance abuse prio r nonfatal suicide ttempts severity of ptsd symptoms and certain types of tbi are more predictive for suicide and may signal areas of greater icide risk among military and veterans populations as well researchers also found that combat exposure increases the risk of suicide as well as the likelihood of ptsd which itself also increases the risk of suicide the vauniversity of michigan study of suicide among veterans with
