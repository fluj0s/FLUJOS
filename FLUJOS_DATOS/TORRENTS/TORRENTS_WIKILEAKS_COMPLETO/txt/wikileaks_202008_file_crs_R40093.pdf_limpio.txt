diplomatic rancor earlier in the decade japan and china have demonstrably improved their bilateral relationship since 2006 sinojapanese relations over the past ten years have followed remarkable trajectory from disastrous japan visit by former chinese president jiang zemin in 1998 to hu jintaos wellorchestrated and highly successful visit to tokyo in may 2008 the emerging détente has expanded to include breakthrough agreements on territorial disputes various highlevel exchanges and reciprocal port calls by naval vessels despite the rollercoaster of political and diplomatic ties other aspects of the relationship have remained relatively consistent chinajapan economic interdependence has grown as trade and investment flows have surged over the past decade chinajapan economic ties serve as an anchor for the overall bilateral relationship and the two nations and have become the key players in robust east asian trade and investment network on the other hand military strategists in each country remain wary of the others motives beijing is suspicious of any moves that hint at japan developing more assertive and active security posture and japanese defense planners note with alarm chinas burgeoning military modernization japanese defense documents have publicly declared their concern with beijings lack of transparency and apparently aggressive military spending over the past several years in addition occasional incursions by chinese vessels into japans territorial waters have kept tension high at times despite the overall improving relations the détente pursued with vigor by leaders in both beijing and tokyo follows an exceedingly tense period in the relationship under former japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi 2001 2006 koizumis annual visits to the controversial yasukuni shrine which honors japans war deadincluding several convicted class war criminalsparticularly rankled beijing the visits together with changes to japanese history textbooks that critics claim whitewash japans wartime behavior led to large sometimes violent antijapan protests in chinese cities that damaged japanese diplomatic posts since 2006 political leaders on both sideseven those whose rhetoric was the most vehement appear to have concluded that political accommodation is the best course at least temporarily the fact that this trend has survived several political transitions in tokyo is particularly promising many analysts contend that the short to mediumterm outlook is remarkably stable but acknowledge that fundamental distrust and disa greements over history could threaten ties in the longer term in short it appears that these disputes have created firm ceiling for chinese japanese relations the question is if this recent détente points to the establishment of new higher floor the durability of the recent détente could have significant implications for us interests us interests in the region are generally well served by pragmatic sinojapanese accommodation equanimity in the tokyobeijing relationship not only fosters stability and prosperity but also allows the united states to avoid choosing sides on delicate issues

security threat find the recent détente somewhat disconcerting althoug h this tends to be minority view among influential policymakers this school of thought advocates building up japans military capability to deter any of chinas strategic ambitions this camp encourages japan to move past some of restrictions placed on its military including article 9 the socalled peace clause of the japanese constitution authored by us officials during the postwar occupation the chance for japan and china to grow too close for us interests appears at this point remote historical grievances and contemporary distrust combined with the inherent tension of two major powers competing in the same region seem to preclude the possibility of more exclusive political partnership between tokyo and beijing that could marginalize us interests moreover despite some signs of drift in the usjapan alliance the american security commitment to japan appears to remain fundamentally solid in the even t of conflict in the taiwan straits japan would almost definitely play role in us military response the presence of 47000 us troops in japan 65 of them stationed in okin awa geographically proximate to taiwan implies that us counterattack could be staged from japan to many security analysts taiwans status as potential flashpoint for conflict between china and the united states provides fairly reliable bulwark for the usjapan relationship despite periodic bilateral tension

21st century both japan and china have reassessed their bilateral and regional strategies and likely will continue to do so in light of continuing global changes each country figures as an important calculation in these ongoing strategic reassessments as does the united states g5g145g146g151g138g561 chinas overriding primary goal is sustainable economic development at home in pursuit of it beijing has placed high priority on maintaining peaceful international environment both regionally and globally smooth ties with the united states and japan are thought to figure prominently in beijings foreign policy calculations on the theory that even the appearance of more overt pursuit of its interests could prompt responses from washington and tokyo that would be detrimental to its own continued development concern about china for instance could lead the united states to strengthen its alliance with japan or could convince japan to strengthen its own defense resources in addition beijing now sees itself facing new national security challenges in the postcold war environment among these challenges are the demise of the soviet union and international communism the surge in us global power and proindependence activism on taiwan beijing appears suspicious about the extent of japans own regional ambitionsfor example its territorial claims in the east china seaand the degree to which these may adversely impact chinas economic and political interests chinese leaders are especially concerned about the potential role of japanboth directly and as host to us military forcesin

japan is struggling to adjust to increasingly challenging domestic and geopolitical realities domestically the economy is struggling in the current global downturn after an extended period of stagnation in the 1990s in its first real experiment with divided government the political process is uncertain and somewhat paralyzed demographically concerns about shrinking labor force have grown more acute driven by japans combination of low birth rate strict immigration practices and rapidlyageing population outside its borders japan cannot ignore chinas skyrocketing economic growth and political clout its impressive gdp per capita and admirable standard of living for its citizens notwithstanding japan sees the enormous challenges ahead tokyos strategy appears to be to maintain its close security ties with the united states reassert itself as crucial trading partner for other asian nations and avoid counterproductive spats with beijing its main regional competitor japan also would like to raise its global profile in order to be recognized for its generous provision of foreign aid and other contributions to international development in 2004 japan accelerated its longstanding efforts to become permanent member of the united nations security council by forming coalition with germany india and brazil the socalled g4 to achieve nonveto membership for all four countries though the bush administration has backed japans bid it did not support the g4 proposal and security council reform efforts have stalled japan is the secondlargest contributor to the regular budget paying more than 20 of the total more than twice the percentage paid by the thirdlargest contributor overcoming beijings traditional opposition to permanent membership for japan is key obstacle to realizing this eventual goal g10g146g156g157g152g155g146g140g138g149g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561

treaty which allowed the united states to station troops on japan for japans defense the occupation of japan officially ended on apri l 28 1952 when most of japan again became an independent selfruled country4 two years later both countries built on the 1951 treaty by signing the mutual defense assistance agreem ent which entered into force may 1 1954 the agreement permitted the united states to station military forces on japan to provide for regional security and obliged japan to rearm for selfdefense purposes only finally on january 19 1960 both countries entered into defense alliance in new agreement that revised the 1951 treaty the treaty of mutual cooperation and security the 1960 treaty obliged both parties to assist each other in resisting an armed attack on territories under japanese administration japans military alliance with the united states became an additional factor affecting sinojapanese relations

political relations with the prc and in recognizing the roc government on taiwan as the legitimate government of china still through the 1950s japans unofficial economic contacts with the prc broadened including number of private agreements sanctioned by the two governments to enhance mutual trade the prc suspended these trade arrangements for several years in 1958 in possible attempt to pressure japan unsuccessfully for full political recognition japanprc trade improved in 1962 with the negotiation of new trade arrangements 5 but japans expanding trade with the prc met with objections from taiwan which considered it out of step with tokyos recognition of the roc government as result in 1964 taiwan suspended new government purchases from japan for six months6 in july 1971 reportedly without first informing japan us president richard nixon announced that he would visit the prc in 1972 to seek normalized relations between the united states and china the announcement came to be known in japan as the nixon shock and it quickly prompted reassessment of japanese policy toward the prc on the mainland and the roc on taiwan discussions to establish sinojapanese diplomatic relations began in december 1971 and on september 29 1972 both countries signed the joint communique of government of japan and government of peoples republic of chin establishing mutual diplomatic relations six years before the united states and china took this step the period that followed from 1971 until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 was time of significant rapprochement in sino japanese relations as it was in sinous relations in addition to substantial bilateral re engagement japan offered china substantial aid and investment and transferred muchneeded technology

of these challenges the adaptation to postcold war realities proved problematic in japans eyes china began to appear less as supplicant for japanese aid and investment and more as regional rival to japans own interests it also was not hard for tokyo to infer that chinas expanding military force modernization while fostering capabilities aimed at the island of taiwan had the same disturbing implications for japan and other island nations in the region the potential dangers were brought home pointedly during the 19951996 taiwan missile crisis when china conducted livefire missile exercises opposite the taiwan coast tokyos growing suspicions of beijing were returned in kind china increasingly saw itself as replacement focus of the usjapan alliancean alliance which not only did not fade away after the fall of the soviet union but which both countri acted to strengthen after the taiwan missile crisis in 1996 china also became concerned over what it saw as change in the alliances focus away from japans defense and toward taiwans status and other broader but vague regional security issues some of the usjapan initiatives that concerned beijing included the 1996 us japan joint declaration on security in which both parties reaffirmed their alliance the 1997 review of the guidelines for usjapan defense cooperation which avowed mutual cooperation not just in japans defense but in areas surrounding japan although without mentioning taiwan and the 2005 joint statement of the usjapan security consultative committee which for the first time mentioned both countries concerns that the taiwan issue be resolved peacefully through dialogue these and other tensions continued to plague sinojapanese relations until the new period of détente began in 2006 g22g138g146g160g138g151g514g156g561g20g152g149g142g561 current controversy over the status of taiwan is in part legacy issue of japans 19th and 20th century militarization after the 18941895 sinojapanese war japan acquired the island of taiwan in perpetuity from the republic of china turning it into japanese colony called formosa and investing heavily in the islands velopment although not part of japans world war ii conquests the japanese colony of formosa nevertheless came under allied power occupation after japans defeat and unconditional surrender this decision was set forth in the cairo declaration of december 1 1943 issued after meeting by us president franklin roosevelt roc president chiang kaishek nd british prime minister winston churchill among other things the cairo declaration stated it is the allied powers purpose that japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first world war in 1914 and that all the territories japan has stolen from the chinese such as manchuria formosa and the pescadores shall be restored to the republic of china japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed 7 in keeping with the cairo declar ation after japans defeat in 1945 taiwan and the pescadores were assigned to the republic of china for purposes of postwar occupation taiwan was still under this occupation four years later when the roc government fled to taiwan after the communist victory in the civil war on mainland china the formal state of war between japan and the allied powers was ended by the 1951 treaty of peace with japan also known as the san francisco peace treaty article 2b of that treaty stated that japan renounces all right

about taiwans new sovereign status the failure to specify taiwans so vereignty in this treaty the specific reference to formosas return to the roc in the cairo declaration and the rocs physical occupation of the island after 1949 all contributed to future controversy over taiwans political status8 g22g146g138g151g138g151g150g142g151g561g21g138g151g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 in the aftermath of chinas tiananmen square crackdown in 1989 japan demonstrated more independence from the us position in imposing sanctions against the prc government it appeared to follow the us leadmost notably the suspension of the 557 billion sixyear concessional loan program that japan had announced for china in 1988 at the same time japan also withdrew all japanese experts working on various projects in china and announced review of japans exportimport bank policies to ward china while these steps seemed to be severe sanctions the effects were mitigated by the fact that the concessional loan program was not scheduled to begin until april 1990 in addition japanese rhetoric toward china throughout much of 1989 was somewhat muted japanese officials rejected use of the term sanctions in referring to its actions toward china and prime minister sosuke publicly stated that imposing sanctions against china is very impolite to neighboring country 9 japanese officials at the time also criticized some steps taken by the united states as overly punitive against china capable of deepening chinas isolation japan also sought to moderate the position of g7 countries toward china at the g7 economic summit in houston in july 1990 10 g12g138g153g138g151g514g156g561g25g138g155g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 since the conclusion of world war ii the sharpest confrontations between japan and china have arisen over japans wartime history and the differing ways in which both countries perceive it china routinely protested former japanese prime minister junichiro koizumis annual visits to the yasukuni shrine where war criminals are also enshrined see later section on the controversial visits after koizumi first visited the shrine in 2001 china used the issue to justify its refusal to engage in bilateral summitry except as part of multilateral meetings prc officials have criticized japanese history textbooks which th ey say appear to minimize or even to deny japans wartime atrocities china also has declared that the periodic statements of japanese senior leaders apologizing for japans wartime aggression are insufficient beijing points to the yasukuni shrine visits and history textbooks as examples of actions that seem incompatible with those conciliatory statements

economic interdependence japan and china have undergone remarkable reversal from the tension of the koizumi years 2001 8 neither the roc government on taiwan nor the prc government on the mainland were signatories to the 1951 treaty however the roc government on taiwan concluded separate treaty with japan in 1952 that was based on the san francisco peace treaty 9 foreign broadcast information

under koizumi and determined to set the relationship on stronger course despite its suspicion of chinas longterm intentions tokyo has many reasons to pursue better ties with its biggest neighbor chief among them is facilitating continued robust trade relations increased exports to china was one of the main reasons that japans economy began to recover since 2000 although security planners may eye chinas military modernization with alarm curity specialists also recognize the need to avoid bilateral tension that could lead to an armed conflictfor example in the contested senkakudiaoyutai islandsif proper safeguards are not in place broader regionaland even globalconsiderations may also be at play for japan for example the importance of garnering some degree of support for tokyos priorities in the sixparty talks and even ultimately for japans bid for permanent seat on the security council g4g142g146g147g146g151g144g514g156g561g15g152g157g146g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 better relations with japan are thought to be an important calculation in the premium that prc leaders have placed on maintaining stable regional environment conducive to national economic development chinas economic interests are well served by being able to cooperate effectively with japan on trade investment energy efficiency environmental protection fisheries and other issues of mutual importance but prc leaders also are thought by some to be playing hedging game in relations with japan they are thought perhaps to be seeking to nudge japan out of its orbit as us ally or at least to make more difficult tokyos choices between advancing future prc or us interests beijing may calculate that increasing tokyos decision dilemmas could remove or minimize japan as potential factor in the event of future taiwan contingency but this requires delicate balance as beijing is thought to be more comfortable living with us japan alliance than with fully militarized japan

has involved the visits of highlevel japanese officials to the yasukuni shrine shinto shrine that honors japanese soldiers who died in war those enshrined include several class war criminals who were convicted by the international military tribunal for the far east following japans defeat in world war ii while japanese defenders of the practice claim leaders are simply paying respects to all of japans war dead chinese and other asian leaders claim the ritual disregards the brutality of japans imperial conquests when former prime minister koizumi visited the shrine annually during his tenureincluding the last visit on the sensitive date of august 15 the anniversary of japans surrender to the allied forceschinese leaders emphasized repeatedly that the visits constituted stumbling block in moving political relations forward since the war criminals were enshrined in 1978 four japanese prime ministers have visited the shrine objections were first raised by japans neighbors in 1984 when prime minister yasuhiro nakasone went after which he discontinued the practice httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40093g21g146g151g152g556g12g138g153g138

shrine visits before assuming office but refrained from visiting during his yearlong tenure abe did pay low profile visit to yasukuni shortly before assuming the premiership and remained noncommittal on his future plans to the press despite abes rhetoric relations with china almost immediately brightened and he made an early trip to beijing that was viewed as successful abes successor yasuo fukuda pledged not to visit the shrine before becoming prime minister explicitly explaining his decision as based on considering the feelings of other countries his declaration may have been the most effective measure to improve the atmosphere between tokyo and beijing and likely set the stage for the considerable advancement in relations chinese leaders were quick to praise fukudas statements on yasukuni given the success in improving relations japanese politicians appear to want to avoid provoking beijing by visiting yasukuni in the past current prime minister taro aso suggested that the emperor should visit the shrine as well as defended other politicians visits however he indicated that as prime minister he would not pay respects at yasukuni at times he has also been supporter of transforming yasukuni into secular staterun institution to commemorate the war dead ichiro ozawa head of the democratic part of japan has criticized past prime ministers visits to the shrine because of the damaging effect on ties with china g10g146g144g145g556g14g142g159g142g149g561g24g146g156g146g157g156g561 perhaps nothing is more emblematic of japan and chinas shifting relations than the trajectory of toplevel leaders visits in 1998 visit to tokyo that was considered public relations disaster chinese president jiang zemin openly scolded japanese officials for failing to appropriately acknowledge imperial japans wartime aggression with the exception of koizumi visit to beijing early in his tenure chinese and japanese leaders did not have an official summit during koizumis five years in office koizumi did hold several sideline meetings with chinas leaders at various international fora chinese leaders explicitly stated that they would resume bilateral summits if koizumi ceased visiting the yasukuni shrine 11 shortly after assuming office abe visited beijing in october 2006 to indicate his determination to improve ties chinese premier wen jiabao reciprocated with an april 2007 visit to japan including historic address to the japanese diet parliament fukuda seen as more friendly to beijing than abe was then warmly welcomed in beijing in december 2007 building on his predecessors success the détente climaxed with chinese president hu jintaos carefully orchestrated visit in may 2008 the first by chinese leader to japan in decade the heads of state summit was heavy on symbolism if thin on concrete substance notably absent from the chinese leaders statements was call for japan to apologize for historical grievances and both sides emphasized forwardlooking

agreement as remarkable improvement that would remove major obstacle in sinojapanese relations12 according to another view the agreement allows japan facesaving way to participate in energy development in disputed area while not requiring the prc to accept japans claims that median line divides the east china sea into japanese and chineseowned areas on the surface the east china sea agreement appears to lay the groundwork for addressing an area that has been the focus of years of competing sinojapanese territorial claims and tense standoffs still number of potential obstacles could hamper future progress each country has put its own spin on the agreement for instance with china quickly clarifying that it is not joint development project as japan claims but cooperative development venture which beijing describes as very different thing13 according to the prc side private japanese investment will have to recognize prc sovereignty over the chunxiao gas field and will be conducted in accordance with chinese laws details also remain sketchy on how the cooperation will move forward and on how revenues will be shared neither side has compromised on its core definition concerning its own sovereignty rights in the east china sea leaving this thorny issue as something still to be determined14 future sinojapanese cooperation under the east china sea agreement will have to navigate multiple minefields of nationalistic sentimentssentiments which at times appear outside the control of the involved governments such sentiments erupted after june 10 2008 when japanese patrol boat in the east china sea collided with and sank fishing vessel from taiwan whose government also maintains sovereignty clai ms in the disputed area taiwan responded by recalling its representative to japan and the following week boat of taiwan activists accompanied by taiwan patrol boats entered japanese waters in the disputed area in apparent protest of the collision prc nationalist sentiments also surged after the agreement was announced with small protest outside the japanese embassy in beijing and online commentary criticizing prc officials for allegedly selling

japan are the largest and second largest holders of foreign exchange reserves how the two countries conduct their economic relations will likely have important implications for east asia and the rest of the world and therefore for the united states the economic relationship is critical part of the overall china japan relationship while political and national security relations have made relations volatile through the years economic ties have provided stability china and japan have grown more economically interdependent which has provided great incentive for them to pursue better relations the economic relationship has broadened and deepened over the last two decades and has become more complex modern chinajapan economic relations developed at first very slowly after world war ii as the two countries dealt with the legacies of japans colonial occupation of china and of the war they were hampered also in the 1960s and 1970s as the two countries were on opposite sides of the cold war during which japan largely followed us policy and because chinas severely centralized economic system was not conducive to liberalized foreign trade and investment the climate for economic ties vastly improved first with japans diplomatic recognition of china in 1972 following the us opening to china with the visit of president nixon even more importantly major economic reforms that chinas leadership introduced beginning in the late 1970s included opening the chinese economy to foreign trade and investment while the economic relationship improved over the years it has still experienced periods of turmoil but has stabilized in the last few years as the two countries have become more closely intertwined economically

relationship in perspective these data indicate some significant contrasts between the two economies for example chinas economy has grown substantially faster albeit from much lower base than japans during the 19972007 period95 per year on average for china compared to 12 for japan the comparative figures for total gross domestic product gdp reflect the results of the rapid growth while japan is still larger economy in nominal terms china appears to be catching up in 2007 chinas total gdp was 32 trillion compared to japans 44 trillion however chinas economy is larger if measured in terms of purchasing power parity ppp73 trillion for china compared to 43 trillion for japan 21 more accurate measure of the relative state of two economies is the standard of living in each country one measure of standard of living is the per capita gdp and comparison of the two countries suggests that as impressive as chinas progress has been it still has far to go to catch up with japan in 2007 chinas nominal per capita gdp stood at 5480 in ppp terms on the other hand japans nominal gdp was 33630 in ppp terms according to this measurement chinas standard of living is only 163 of japans in addition china carries 92 unemployment rate compared to japans 38 and labor costs in china are far below those in japan173hour compared to 1959hour the labor cost differentials suggest an economic complementarity that would help shape the bilateral economic relationship namely one economy china with large pool of unskilled and lowskilled labor linking up with another economy japan with small and diminishing pool of highlyskilled highcost labor g5g145g146g151g138g556g12g138g153g138g151g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g22g146g142g156g561 significant element of the chinajapan economic relationship

has shifted over that brief period as well from 2000 to 2005 chinas exports of services to japan exceeded its imports probably because of surges in japanese tourism to china however the gap diminished over time and in 2006 latest data available japanese exports of services to china slightly exceeded its imports future data will determine if this trend will continue it seems likely that the total

political instability in china and chinese government restrictions burdensome taxation corruption and an unskilled local labor force tainted the investment climate japanese direct investments in china picked up in the midtolate 1980s and into the early 1990s chinese economic reforms made foreign investment more acceptable and the increase in labor costs in japan made domestic japanese production more expensive causing japanese producers to take advantage of lowwage labor in china by shifting production to china and other east asian countries as figure 3 indicates fdi flows dipped between 1995 and 1999 because china had imposed some restrictions on foreign investment and made some other changes in economic policies 29 in addition during this period east asia had experienced financial crisis and japan was in the midst of long recession as the figure above shows since 1999 japanese fdi has soared according to chinese official data that measures fdi accumulated from 1979 to 2007 japan is

appreciation of the renminbi and an insertion of more country risk in japanese investor strategies31 chinese official data also show that japanese and other foreignowned companies in china are becoming important platforms for trade through their global supply chains in 2006 861 billion in imports into china from japan were to foreignowned presumably japaneseowned companies or about 75 of total chinese impor ts from japan in 2006 foreignowned companies in china exported 611 billion in merchandise to japan or about 68 of total chinese exports to japan32 in 2006 around 70 of the products imported by foreignowned firms in china were mechanical and electrical products such as integrated circuits parts for televisions and other electrical appliances and computer parts in 2006 63 of exports by foreignowned companies in china consisted of machinery and transportation equipment33 these figures suggest that those companies including japaneseowned companies assemble parts into finished goods for export the increase in trade and foreign investment between china and japan appears to have benefitted both countries china has benefitted from the technology and knowhow that japanese foreign investment conveys as indicated by shifts in chinese exports from lowskilled production of apparel and footwear to exports of machinery and transportation equipment japanese producers have benefitted from the lower production costs that foreign investment in china provides however some in japan have expressed concerns that relocation of production to china signifies hollowing out of japans manufacturing base such arguments could become stronger as chinese labor becomes more skilled and locallybased chinese firms adapt foreign technology and become more independent and competitive

to be the most reliable us ally at such asian fora however japans own interests appear at this point to be far more closely aligned with washingtons and therefore this threat appears fairly small at this point significantly better communication between tokyo and beijing may help diffuse territorial issues and minimize potentially explosive miscommunication military clash between the two asian

issue for the united states is how to address uschinajapan relations in balanceofpower terms views in the united st ates differ somewhat on this point some see chinas growing power as not just challenge but threat to us regional and global interests chinese leaders these observers argue see conforming to international norms as strategy to employ while china is still weak in reality beijin g seeks at least to erode and at best to supplant us international power and influence in pursuit of this strategy according to this view chinese leaders may be probing potential rifts in the usjapan alliance and expanding chinas economic interconnections with japan seeking to complicate or raise the costs of japans policy choices where us and prc interests diverge these observers argue that the united states should seek to counter this prc strategy for instance the united states should avoid sitting on the policy sidelines or acting as balancing agent between japan and china and instead should unleash japan from some of the more restrictive confines of the us security umbrella for example they say us policymakers could encourage tokyo to develop more muscular regional policy and more robust military posture to provide counterbalance to growing chinese power other observers stress that the usjapan alliance is an important foundation of us strength and influence in asia while passive approach between china and japan may be counter to us interests these observers say it would be mistake for the united states to encourage enmity or dissension between tokyo and beijing as counter weight to growing prc power and influence the way to deal with growing chinese power according to this view is to strengthen and expand upon the usjapan alliance helping to increase japans power and capabilities and knitting tokyo more seamlessly into the us regional presence

status as the republic of china on the mainland on this issue both the taiwan and prc governments find themselves in the unusual position of being on the same side opposite japan as both make their territorial claims on behalf of the chinese nation these competing claims can raise unusual problems affecting not only japanchinataiwan relations but also us policy in june 2008 for instance

senkakudiaoyutais pose additional problems for the prcs relations with japan japans claim to the senkakudiaoyutais dates from january of 1895 during the sinojapanese war when the chinese emperor agreed to cede the islands to japan40 in the 1951 treaty of peace with japan after world war ii the united states assumed control over both island groups in 1953 proclamation us officials responsible for administering the ryukyus broadly defined the region under us control to include the senkakudiaoyutais 41 thus in 1971 when the united states signed the okinawa reversion treaty with japan returning to japan the areas and territories being administered by the united states the senkakudiaoyutais were included thus giving the united states recurring bit part in the ongoing drama over the senkakudiaoyutais and the ryukyu islands the largest of which is okinawa host of us military base although there is some ambiguity the usjapan security treaty appears to say that the an atta ck on the senkakudiaoyutais would require us response sinojapanese disputes also include areas of high oil and gas potential such as the chunxiao gas field sinojapanese territorial claims have continued to

and 1993 chinese naval vessels fired warning shots at japanese civilian ships44 japan launched fighters from bases in the ryukyu islands in august 1995 when prc fighters entered japans air identification zone around the senkakudiaoyutais45 the august 1995 incident and particularly heavy prc ship activities in early 1996 led to an escalation of tensions between japan and the prc lasting until the end of 1996 the prcs occupa tion of mischief reef in the south china sea in early 1995 also increased japanese suspicions the japanese government also has had to deal with the actions of japanese rightwing groups these groups periodically send members to the senkakudiaoyutais where they have implanted markers flags and even erected small lighthouse the rightist groups sometime act in response to heavy prc ship traffic near the islands other times they act without alleged prc provocations beijing considers their actions as provocation and has issued diplomatic protests to japan demanding that the japanese government prevent such activities the japanese government replies that the government is limited in its right to interfere with the activities of japanese citizens 46 40 in the sinojapanese treaty of shimonoseki ending the war signed in may 1895 china also ceded taiwan formosa to the japanese since this treaty did not mention the senkakudiaoyutais japan has claimed
