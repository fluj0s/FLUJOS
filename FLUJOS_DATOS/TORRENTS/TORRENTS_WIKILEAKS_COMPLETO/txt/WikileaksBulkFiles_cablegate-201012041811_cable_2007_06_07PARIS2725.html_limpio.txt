william j burns reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary fm lavrovs disinterest in establishing an expert level dialogue on arms sales begs the question of how best to address our concerns over russias arms export policy russian officials are deeply cynical about our motives in seeking to curtail russian arms exports to countries of concern and the threatened imposition of us sanctions has not proven successful so far in modifying russian behavior russia attaches importance to the volume of the arms export trade to the diplomatic doors that weapon sales open to the illgotten gains that these sales reap for corrupt senior officials and to the lever it provides the russian government in stymieing american interests while russia will reject out of hand arguments based on the extraterritorial application of american sanctions russian officials may be more receptive to message couched in the context of russian international obligations and domestic legislation the reality of american casualties and the backlash to russian strategic interests among moderate sunni governments in making our argument we should remember that russian officialdom and the public have little if any moral compunction about the arms trade seeing it instead as welcome symbol of russias resurgent power and strength in the world end summary russian arms sales matter 2 c russian arms sales are consequential totaling approximately usd 67 billion in 2006 according to official figures this amount reflects 12 percent increase over 2005 and 56 percent increase since 2003 russian arms sales are expected to total at least usd 8 billion in 2007 russia has made conscious effort to improve aftersales customer service and warranties which has added to the attractiveness of its weapons as result russian weapons command higher prices than previously russia is ranked second only to the united states in arms sales to the developing world and sizeable portion of its arms trade is with countries of concern to us 3 c while sales were reported in 2006 to iran syria or sudan in 2007 iran reportedly paid russia usd 700 million for torm1 air defense missile systems while syrian economic conditions are natural brake on trade with the russians as matter of principle the gor is prepared to sell defensive equipment such as antitank missiles and strelets sa18 surfacetoair missiles as well as upgrade mig23 fighters the gor barred the sale of iskandere tactical missiles to syria only after intense international pressure venezuela remains growth market with arms transfers in 2006 totaling more than usd 12 billion including 24 su30mk2 fighterbombers and 34 helicopters russia has an open arms approach to venezuela and whether its the transfer of more than 72000 ak103 assault rifles or negotiations for the prospective sale of three amur class submarines valued at usd 1 billion russia is prepared to entertain chavezs grandiose regional visions 4 c defense experts emphasize that the american and european domination of traditional nato markets and capture of new entrants and old soviet customers from central and eastern europe means that russia must court buyers that fall outside the us orbit by definition iran syria and venezuela are good markets for russia because we dont compete there 5 c while concrete numbers are hard to come by our best figures indicate that russian arms sales to its traditional bigticket customers china and india are growing russian experts however predict declining trajectory in the medium term in 2006 russia completed approximately usd 14 billion in sales to china including eight diesel submarines and 88 mi171s which means the prc only narrowly edged out chavez as russias most important customer russian defense experts underscore that as chinas technological sufficiency and political influence grow the prc will develop increasing military selfsufficiency and greater ability to challenge russia as supplier at the same time sales to india totaled only usd 360 million russia and india in fact have signed arms deals worth usd moscow 00005154 002 of 004 26 billion but not all deliveries and payments have been made while russian experts still downplay the ability of the us to displace russia in the indian arms market for reasons of cost and the legacy of decades old dependence they recognize increasing american inroads and growing influence other notable russian markets include algeria czech republic vietnam south korea and belarus legalistic world view 6 s as the recent 2 2 consultations confirmed russian officials defend arms sales to countries of concern in narrow legal terms in answering our demarches mfa officials always identify whether the transfer is regulated by one of the multilateral arms controls regimes eg wassenaar group mtcr etc resolutions or russian law senior officials maintain that russia does take into account the impact on the stability of the region in determining whether to sell weapons and shares our concern about weapons falling into terrorists hands this russian decisionmaking process has led to defacto embargo on weapons transfers to iraq where russia is concerned over leakages to iraqi insurgents and alqaida to handsoff policy towards pakistan the country russia views as the greatest potential threat to regional stability with thenrussian foreign minister igor ivanov ruling out weapons sales to pakistan as far back as 2003 and to moratorium on offensive systems to iran and syria concern over leakage has prompted russia to tighten its export controls with the recent institution of new provisions in arms sale contracts for small arms and light weapons salw that require enduser certificates and provide russia the right to inspect stockpiles of weapons sold 7 s what russia has not done is accept our strategic calculus and rule out the possibility of sales to iran syria sudan or venezuela the arguments made are broadly similar with iran we are told that that russia will not sell any weapon that violates multilateral or domestic regime nor transfer any item that could enhance iranian wmd capabilities sales such as the torm1 air defense missile system are justified as being defensive only and limited by their range of 12 kilometers while dfm kislyak told us october 18 that he was unaware of any plans to sell iran the s300 longrange surfacetoair missile system mfa officials previously told us that such sales while under review would not violate any russian laws or international regimes with syria russia also argues that its transfers are defensive in nature and points to its decision to halt the sale of manpads the mfa maintains that russian weapons used by hizballah in 2006 were not deliberate transfer by the syrian government but involved weapons left behind when syrian forces withdrew from lebanon russia argues that tightened enduser controls will prevent any future transfers with sudan the gor denies any current arms trade with the regime and maintains that russia has not violated sanctions or putininitiated decrees however based on our demarches it is clear that in contrast to syria russia has adopted dont ask dont tell approach to sudans adherence to its enduse requirements for its existing inventory of russiansoviet weapons with venezuela both mfa officials and russian experts believe that monroe doctrine mentality and not real concerns over regional stability is behind us demarches what is behind the russian calculus 8 c variety of factors drive russian arms sales but compelling motivation is profit both licit and illicit as former deputy prime minister and senior member of the duma defense committee anatoliy kulikov told us russia makes very bad cars but very good weapons and he was among the majority of russian defense experts who argued that the laws of comparative advantage would continue to propel an aggressive arms export policy while russian defense budgets have been increasing 2530 per cent for the last three years defense experts tell us that export earnings still matter the recent creation of rostechnologiya state corporation headed by putin intimate sergey chemezov which consolidates under state control rosoboronexport arms exports oboronprom defense systems russpetsstal specialized steel production vsmpo titanium producer and russian moscow 00005154 003 of 004 helicopter production is further proof of the importance the putin government places on the industry 9 c likewise it is an open secret that the russian defense industry is an important trough at which senior officials feed and weapons sales continue to enrich many defense analysts attribute russias decision to sell weapons that the venezuelan military objectively did not need due to the interest of both venezuelan and russian government officials in skimming money off the top the sale of su30mk2 fighterbombers was cited as specific example where corruption on both ends facilitated the offloading of mothballed planes that were inadequate for the venezuelan air forces needs 10 c second factor driving the russian arms export policy is the desire to enhance russias standing as player in areas where russia has strategic interest like the middle east russian officials believe that building defense relationship provides ingress and influence and their terms are not constrained by conditionality exports to syria and iran are part of broader strategy of distinguishing russian policy from that of the united states and strengthening russian influence in international fora such as the quartet or within the security council with respect to syria russian experts believe that bashars regime is better than the perceived alternative of instability or an islamist government and argue against us policy of isolation russia has concluded that its arms sales are too insignificant to threaten israel or to disturb growing israelirussian diplomatic engagement but sufficient to maintain special relations with damascus likewise arms sales to iran are part of deep and multilayered bilateral relationship that serves to distinguish moscow from washington and to provide russian officials with bargaining chip both with the ahmedinejad regime and its p5 1 partners while as matter of practice russian arms sales have declined as international frustration has mounted over the iranian regime as matter of policy russia does not support what it perceives as us efforts to build an antiiranian coalition 11 c third and related factor lurking under the surface of these weapons sales is russias inferiority complex with respect to the united states and its quest to be taken seriously as global partner it is deeply satisfying to some russian policymakers to defy america in the name of multipolar world order and to engage in zerosum calculations as us relations with georgia have strengthened so too have nostalgic calls for russian basing in latin america which russian officials including putin have swat down while profit is still seen by experts as russias primary goal all note the secondary thrill of causing the us discomfort by selling weapons to antiamerican governments in caracas and damascus taking another run at russia 12 c as fm lavrov made clear during the 2 2 consultations russia will not engage systematically at the expert level on its arms export regime while the prospect of russia changing its arms export policy in response to our concerns alone is slim we can take steps to toughen our message and raise the costs for russian strategic decisions although us sanctions are broad brush the more we can prioritize our concerns over weapons sales that pose the biggest threat to us interests the more persuasive our message will be demarches that iterate all transactions including ammunitions sales are less credible since lavrov has rejected an expertslevel dialogue on arms transfers it is important to register our concerns at the highest level and to ensure that messages delivered in moscow are reiterated in washington with visiting senior gor officials in the context of potential violations of international regimes and unscr resolutions russia needs to hear the concerns of key european partners such as france and germany in the wake of the litvinenko murder and subsequent recriminations uk influence is limited eu reinforcement is important for consistency although russia tends to downplay the bad news that european nations prefer to deliver in eu channels rather than bilaterally regional actors should reinforce our message russian weapon sales that destabilize the middle east should be protested by the sunni arab governments that have the most to lose given russias competing interest in expanding sales moscow 00005154 004 of 004 to saudi arabia and the gulf states the protests of our moderate arab partners could also carry price tag for russian defiance the same is true for latin america whose leaders to date have not made sales to chavez an issue on their bilateral agenda with the russians the appearance of russian weapons in iraq presumably transferred by syria and the prospect of american and coalition casualties as result could change the calculus of russian sales to damascus the more evidence that we can provide the more russia may take steps to restrict the asad regime at the same time we need to be prepared for the russian countercharge that significant numbers of weapons delivered by the us have fallen into insurgent hands finally providing the russians with better releasable intelligence when arguing against weapons transfers to rogue states is essential our russian interlocutors are not always impressed by the evidence we use to prove that their arms are ending up in the wrong hands while we doubt russia will terminate all its problematic sales for the reasons described above more compelling evidence could lead the gor to reduce the scope of its arms transfers or tighten export controls final caveat 13 c there are few voices in russia who protest the sale of weapons to countries of concern and domestic political constraints that tie the hands of russian policymakers on this score the pride that russian officialdom takes in the arms industry as symbol of russias resurgence is largely shared by average russians american concerns are interpreted cynically as the disgruntled complaints of competitor and viewed through the prism of 1990s story line in which the west seeks to keep russia down including by depriving it of arms markets burns
