interpreting the act and other recent cases in the field of prisoner civil rights litigation3 background prisoner civil rights litigation in the united states had its primary genesis in supreme court decisions in the 1960s th decisions changed legal doctrine that had formerly barred most prisoner civil rights suits prisoners file civil rights actions primarily to challenge their conditions of confinement in prisons or jails4 federal district courts have jurisdiction over cases by state prisoners under the 1871 civil rights act 42 usc 19835 section 1983 is now interpreted as creating private cause of action against any person who under color of state law deprives anothe r citizen or person within the jurisdiction of the united states of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states in 1971 the supreme court created an analogous remedy for constitutional wrongs by federal officials in bivens v six unknown named agents of the federal bureau of narcotics6 alleged violations of prisoners civil rights most commonly involve the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the ei ghth amendment the free exercise of religion clause of the first amendment nd the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment for the past 20 years supreme court decisions have gra dually curtailed the substantive rights of prisoners compared to the earlier cases of the 1960s through the mid1970s approximately even before passage of the reform act the court held that prison officials are not liable unless they act with subjective deliberate indifference to violate prisoners federal rights7 with respect to imposition of prison discipline due pro cess standards apply only in cases of serious misconducthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97999crs3

an 1983 action or other federal action with respect to prison conditions27 exhaustion is required for persons confined in any jail prison or other correctional facility before passage of the plra the cour ts had discretion to require exhaustion but they did not require exhaustion where monetary relief was sought and the state did not provide damages as an administr ative remedy since most 1983

inflicted injuries and habit of fighting with guards the day of the incident the inmate was admittedly drunk swung the first punch possibly spat at the guard and violen tly resisted transfer to an isolation cell the district court thought it significant that the jury awarded even 10 cents in damages apparently the court did not consider the possi bility that the award was actually in effect an insulting award for wasting the jurys time the court awarded attorneys fees of 28700 because counsel had been instrumental in vindi cating constitutional right the jury knew of course that the prisoner was on deathrow but did not know the facts of the crime lucas had murdered two elderly people in their homeaccused of convicted of sentenced for or adjudicated delinquent for violations of criminal law or the terms an d conditions of paro probation pretrial release or diversionary program30 the limitations on prisoner civil rights actions legislated by the reform act therefore apply to

the plra sets limits on an award of attorneys fees in prisoner civil rights actions attorney fee awards pursuant to 42 usc 1988 are prohibited except to the extent the fee was directly and reasona bly incurred in proving an actual violation of prisoners rights protect ed by statute and then only if one of two other conditions is met i the amount of the fee is proporti onately related to th court ordered relief or ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in forcing the relief ordered for the violation32 the first condition addresses cases where jury has awarded prisoner nominal damages eg ten cents but the court allows significant attorneys fees eg 2800033 the second condition relates to cas where attorneys are involved in enforcing nonmonetary relief the plra also requires the prisoner to pay up to 25 of any monetary damages to satisfy the fees of hisher attorney so the hourly rate shall not be greater than 150 of the rate established by 18 u sc 3006a for courtappointed

seeking to file in forma pauperis must pay fees if they have money in th eir prison trust fund accounts are among the key provisions of the plra from the perspective of the supporters of the act it is not surprising that these provisions are also the focal point of large number of the postreform act cases 36sec 807 of pub l 104134 37sec 808 of pub l 104134in forma pauperis filings filing fees prisoner seeking to file in forma pauperis must submit certified copy of his prison trust fund for the most recent sixmonths and pay the full amount of filing fee if any funds are availabl the court must set schedule for collecting the fees from the individual trust fund34 if funds are available to pay the filing fee the prisoner may file the civil rights action without paying fee false allegations of poverty if the court finds that the allegation of poverty is untrue it shall dismiss the case at any time for third time the reform act also specifies dismissal of the case if the court determines the action or appeal is frivolous or malicious fails to state claim on which relief may be granted or seeks monetary relief against defendant w ho is immune from such relief repeat frivolous filings prisoner is prohibited from filing in forma pauperis if three or more earlier actions or app eals have been dismissed on the grounds the case was frivolous malicious or failed to

for civil rights violation must be paid directly to satisfy any outstanding restitution orders pending against the prisoner36 the prisoner receives any amount that remains after full payment of the restitution order the reform act also requires that prior to payment of an award to prisoner reasonable efforts shall be made to notify the prisoners crime victims concerning the pending award37 the intent is to ensure that victims are compensated before the perpetrator of the crime receives civil rights money damages award revocation of good time c redits for malicious suits another disincentive

initial right not to reply in prisoner civil rights cases these waiver provisions coupled with th requirement for j udicial screening to identify frivolous or malicious petitions or petitions that fail to state claim could lead to early dismissals of substantial number of prisoner petitions under pre reform act law the supreme c ourt had held that prisoner in forma pauperis petition could not be dismissed for failure to state claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove t of facts to support the claim haines v kerner 404 us 519 1972 the plra appears to change this

appeal have upheld the provisions as constitutional nd either ordered ter mination or remanded the case for the district court to order termination the 2d circ uit purported to hold the provisions constitutional but only through an interpretation that essentially requires the state courts to substitute for the federal courts in enforcing the provisions of the consent decree that exceed federal constitutional rights it ordered newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97999crs10 42100 f3d 365 4th cir 1996 43the 1986 consent decree was primarily concerned with measures to alleviate prison overcrowding but

termination because the pretrial detainees were entitled to hearing on alleged new violati ons of federal rights seve ral district court decisions had held these provisions unconstitutional generally on separationofpowers principles but all of these adverse decisi ons have been reversed on appeal except for one decision in the easter n district of michigan the 4th circuit in plyler v moore42 ordered termination of consent decree affecting the south carolina prison system43 which had been in effect since 1986 holding that the plra constitutionally deprives the federal courts of authority to approve relief greater than that required by federal law the court rejected arguments that the immediate termination provisions violate the separation of powers principle and the equal pr otection and due process clau ses of the fifth amendment the provisions are not applied ret roactively under the doctrine of landgraf v usi film products44 since the statute affects the propriety of prospective relief in gavin v branstad45 the 8th circuit rejected arguments that the immediate termination of existing consent decrees vi olates the separation ofpowers principle impermissibly interferes in pending cases or denies prisoners equal protection under the law the appellate court reversed the district court which had held the provisions unconstitutional since the pl ra does not burden pr isoners fundamental right of access to the courts its constitutionality can be analyzed under rational basis standard rather than under strict scru tiny the plra passes this test since the government has rational in terest in promoting judici economy and reducing the involvement of the courts in state prison management it is wellestablished that congress has the authority to control the remedial powers of article iii courts also since consent decree is an executory form of relief that remains subject to later developments the constitution does not bar the congress from limiting the remedies ava ilable under existing consent decrees with respect to equal protection argume nts nothing in 18 usc 3626 divests prisoners of reasonably ad equate opportunity to pres ent claimed violations of fundamental constitutional ri ghts to the courts the immediate termination provisions implicate neither fundamental right nor suspect classification the equal protection claim fails because there the plra is based on legitimate governmental interests the promotion of principles of federalism security of prisons and fiscal restraint the limitation of relief to that which is essential to enforce prisoners rights under the constitu tion is an eminently rational means of furthering these governmental interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97999crs11 46the decree in gavin v

upon pretrial detainees simply because they are confined in jails awaiting trialthe 8th circuit reversed nd remanded the case to the di strict court presumably to order termination consiste nt with its opinion the district court had ruled the plra unconstitutional and therefore had not ordered termination of the consent decree46 the second circuit upheld the imme diate termination provisions by interpreting the plra as limitation only on the federal courts power to enforce nonfederal aspects of consent decrees and by interpreting the term relief as not including the consent decrees themselves in benjamin v jacobson 47 the consent decrees remain binding on the parties and the 2d circuit apparently assumes that the state courts will grant specific performance of the consent decrees under contract law the court intimated that if state courts do not enforce the contractual rights in the consent decrees the federal courts might still have jurisdiction to remedy an unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights moreover the inmates in this case are entitled to an evidentiary hearing on their allegations of current and ong oing violations of federal rights the court therefore lifted the stay on enforcement of the consent decree and kept the federal courts in the business of enforcing this consent d ecree the case was begun in 1975 by pretrial detainees in new york city jails similar to benjamin v jacobson massachusetts district court in inmates of the suffolk county jail v sheriff of suffolk county48 purported to uphold the plras termination provisions but did so by interp reting the term relief as not including consent decrees the court opined in dicta that if the plra were interpreted as wiping out the obligations under the c onsent decree the provisions would be unconstitutional as violation of the separationofpowers principle like the decree in jacobson the suffolk county ja il case involved consent decree dating from 1971 concerning c onditions of confinement for pretrial detainees the fact that the supreme court has ruled that pretrial detainees have broader constitutional rights than prisoners49 may have made th second circuit and the massachusetts district court more reluctant to disturb these existing consent decrees from the viewpoint of prisoner litigation reform advocates however the statutory interpretation that the plras limits on prospective relief do not include consent decrees appears almost as negative as decision holding the immediate termination provisions unconstitutional before the benjamin v jacobson

remedies before prisoners may file federal civil rights suit does not apply to cases pending on appeal when the plra was enacted wright v morris 111 f3d 414 6th cir 1997 the majority construed the amendment of 42 us c 1997ea to mean the exhaustion requirement applies only to new actions filed on or afte r the plra was enacted it contrasted the language of this provision with the plras provision on immediate termination of consent decrees noting that the latter expressly applies to existing consent decrees the dissenter argued that the exhausti on amendment amounts to change in the

facilities the seventh and eighth circuits have r eached different interpretation of the plras fee limitations provision in cooper v casey76 and jensen v clarke77 these appellate courts held the fee limitations do not apply retroactively to fees for services rendered before pa ssage of the act district court in northern new york has gone even further than the 7th and 8th circuits in allowing recovery of attorneys fees in excess of the plras limits in blissett v casey78 the court held the fee limits are not applicable to attorneys who performed most of their work in re presenting indigent prisoners after enactment of the plra but were retained before that date applying the retroactivity analysis of landgraf v usi film products the court said the plra would impermissibly impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed if the acts fee limits were applied to attorneys retained before enactment the plra requires successful litigants to pay up to 25 percent of any judgment to satisfy the fees of their attorneys in the view of this court application of the fee limits to attorneys retained before enactment of the plra would upset the reasona ble expectations of

the actual injury test of lewis v casey in determining limits on access to the courts majority of the court ruled that an inmate whose incell private computer printer was taken away from him need only

supreme court recently held that the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14t h amendment require state to provide free access to its civil appellate cour ts to an indigent parent whose parental rights had been terminated by trial court mlb petitioner v slj 117 s ct 555 1996 the state of mississippi allowed in forma pauperis filings at the civil trial level but not in civil appeals the court found that termination of parental status implicated fundamental right mo reover since the proceeding deprived the indigent person of her status as parent the court analogized the right of access on the same basis as criminal appeals of petty offenses for which right to free transcript has been established the majority of the court in the mlb case attempted to confine its precedential

the content neutral test of turner v safley 87 prohibition on prison mutiny the seventh circuit upheld federal statute prohibiting mutiny in federal correctional facilities in united states v

process in prison punishment the lower federal courts have adopted varying interpretations of sandin v conner89 case in which the supreme court attempted to set new standards for due process claims by prisoners who are punished for bad behavior in prison under sandin disciplinary confinement does not trigger due process protections unless the punishment represents an atypical and significant hardship on inmates in relati on to ordinary prison life an inmates placement in administrative custody for 15months pending investigation of his alleged rape of female corrections officer did not violate due process in griffin v vaughn 90 similarly prisoners transfer without notice or hearing to highersecurity prison because of romantic relationship with corrections officer did not violate the inmates due process rights in freitas v ault 91 the second circuit may be inclined to adopt more restrictive view of sandin however than that reflected in the above cases from the third and eighth circuits in two recent cases the second circuit re manded cases to the district court because appropriate findings were not made that 180days segregated confinement for assaulting fellow inmate92 and

passage of the prison litigation reform act virtually all prisoner civil rights cases were filed in forma pauperis the reform act mandates payment of filing fees unless the prisone r has funds whatsoever it is anticipated that in due course the prison litigation reform act will lead to significant reduction in prisoner civil rights petitions in the short term however prisoners and advocates of prisoner rights are challenging the constitutionality and interpretation of many provisions of the act the appellate courts have upheld the constitutionality of the provisions of 18 usc 3626 that limit the authority of fede ral courts in prison conditions cases and permit immediate termination of existing consent decrees the fourth and eighth courts of appeal have upheld these provisi ons and either ordere d termination of anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97999crs20 existing consent decree or remanded to the di strict court to orde r termination the second circuit also upheld the constituti

federal rights under state contract law the in forma pauperis filing provisions of the plra which require those prisoners who have money in their prison trust fund accounts to pa filing fees have
