billion government assistance package to arrest the financial crisis in the united states president bush argued that failure to enact legislation quickly could result in whol esale failure of the us financial sector as discussion of the administrations plan unfolded however questions in congress arose over issues of magnitude and management of the bail out the need for oversight and the possibility that less costly and perhaps more effective alternatives might be available in this light chiles response to its 1981 84 systemic banking cr isis has been held up as one example the cost was comparable relative to the size of its economy to that facing the us government today in 1985 central bank losses to rescue financially distressed financial in stitutions were estimate d to be 78 of gdp1 equivalent to approximately 1 trillion in the united states today the policy options chile chose had similarities as well as differences from those contemplated in the united states today their relevance is debatable but they do highlight an approach that succeeded inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22961crs2 2 ibid p 8 and 339 3 in the case of chile longer maturities were not widely available

ballooned the financial problem facing us institutions wa s compounded by the highly complex and arguably poorly understood securitization of these mortgageseventually stabilizing and returning the chilean banking sector to health while keeping the credit markets functioning throughout the crisis comparing financial crises the seeds of the chilean financial crisis were much different than those in the united states nonetheless in both cases the financial sector became the primary problem with policy makers concerned over the prospect of systemwide collapse chiles problems originated from large macroeconomic imba lances deepening balance of payments problems dubious domestic policies and th 198182 global recession that ultimately led to financial sector distress although most of these are not elements of the us crisis there are number of similar threads woven throughout both cases broadly speaking both countries had adopted strong laissez faire orientation to their economies and had gone through period of financial sector deregulation in the years immediately prior to the crisis group of scholars characterized chiles orientation toward the financial sector as the radical liberalization of the domestic financial markets and the belief in the automatic adjustment mechanism by which the market was expected to produce quick adjustment to new recessionary conditions without interference by the authorities2 in both cases given the backdrop of fi nancial sector dere gulation number of similar economic events occurred that ultimately led to financial crisis first real interest rates were very low giving rise to large expansion of shortterm domestic credit with credit expansion came the rise in debt service all resting on shaky assumption that shortterm rates would not change in both cas but for different r easons rates did rise causing households and firms to fall behind in payments and in many cases to default on the loans3 the provision for loan losses was inadequate causing financial institutions to restrict credit soon many found themselves in financial trouble or insolvent resulting in the financial crisis chiles response may prove useful as policy makers evaluate options the chilean banking crisis of 198184 following the coup against socialist pres ident salvador alle nde in 1973 general augusto pinochet immediately reprivatized the banking system banking regulation and supervision were liberalized macroeconomic conditions and loose credit gave way to the economic euphoria of 198081 the exuberance included substantial increases in asset prices reminiscent of bubble and strong w ealth effects that led to vastly increased borrowing the banking system readily encouraged such borrowing using foreign capital that because of exchange rate controls and other reasons provided negative real interest rate from 1979 to 1981 the stock of bank credit to businesses and households nearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22961crs3 4 ibid p

chile had to absorbdoubled to 45 of gdp this trend cam to sudden halt w ith the 198182 global recession4 the financial sector found itself suddenly in highly compromised position weak bank regulations had llowed the financial sector to take on tremendous amounts of debt without adequate capitalization debt was not evaluated by risk characteristics most debt was commercial loans but banks also carried some portion of consumer and mortgage debt as firms and households became increasingly financially stressed and as asset prices plummeted the solvency of national banks became questionable two issues would later be identified the ability of borrowers to make debt payments and more importantly the reluctance of borrowers to do so given there was broadlyheld assumption that the government would interv ene by november 1981 the first national banks and financial institutions that were subsidiaries of conglomerates failed and had to be taken over by regulatory authorities5 most debt was short term and banks were in position to restructure because they had access to longterm funds instead th ey rolled over shortterm loans capitalized the interest due and raised interest rates this plan was described by one economist as an unsustainable ponzi sche and indeed was critical factor in bringing down many banks as their balance sheets rapidly deteriorated from 1980 to 1983 pastdue loans rose from 11 to 84 of total loans outstanding the sense of crisis further deepened because many of the financial institutions we re subsidiaries of conglomerates that also had control over large pensi on funds which were heavily invested in bank time deposits and bank mortgage bonds in the end althoug h the roots of the banking crisis were different than those in the united states th chilean government faced the possibility of complete failure of the financial sector as credit markets contracted6 the government response the central bank of chile took control of the crisis by enacting three major policies intended to maintain liquidity in the financial system assist borrowers and strengthen lender balance sheets these were 1 bt restructuring for commercial and household borrowers 2 purchases of nonperforming loan s from financial institutions and 3 the expeditious sale merger or liquidation of distressed institutions7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22961crs4 8 ibid pp 2529 9 ibid pp 2526 there was also cost in xpanding the money supply but the macroeconomic effects proved limited and are not addressed heredebt restructuring from the outset of the rescue plan the chilean central bank considered providing relief to both debtors and lenders there were two rationales first as matter of equity there was sense that households as well as firms should be helped second to maintain functioni ng credit market both borrowers and lenders needed to be involved the central bank decided to rest ructure commercial consumer and mortgage loans the goal was to extend the loan maturities at reasonable interest rate the debtor was not forgiven the loan rather banks were given the means to extend the maturities of the loans to keep the debtor repaying and the credit system functioning restrictions were in place eligible fi rms had to produce either good or service eliminating investment banks that held stock in such firms only viable businesses were eligible forcing the bankruptcy procedures into play where unavoidable to keep the program going the loan conditions of each subsequent iteration of the program became easier longer maturities lower in terest rates nd limited grace periods8 the program allowed central banks to nd firms up to 30 of their outstanding debt to the banking system with the financ ing arrangement working in one of two ways at first the central bank issued money lent it to debtors which used it to pay back the bank loans later the central bank issued money to buy long term bonds from the banks which used the proceeds to restructure the comme rcial loans variations of this process were applied to consumer and mortgage debtors in cases where loans were made directly from the central bank to the debtor repa yment was expected usually beginning 48 months after the loan was made the fiscal cost was significant approximating 1 of gdp in 1984 and 19859 restoring bank balance sheets this program was mo re controversial and had to be adjusted over time to be effective the key idea was to postpone recognition of loan losses not forgive them it re lied on identifying nonperforming loans and giving banks time to provision against them without risking insolvency the process has been variously characterized as the central bank ta king on bad debt through loans purchases or swaps all three concepts play some pa rt of this complex largely accountingdriven arrangement initially this program was scribed as sale although there was exchange of assets the central bank technically ffered to buy nonperforming loans with non interest bearing 10year promissory notes banks were required to use future income to provision against these loans and buy them back with the repurchase of the promissory notes in fact they were prohibited from making dividend payments until they repaid the central bank in full the banks though actua lly kept the loans and administered them but did not have to account for them on thei r balance sheets this arrangement was intended to encourage banks to stop rolling ove r nonperforming loans recognize the truly bad ones and eventually retire them from their portfolios the banks benefitted by remaining solvent and gaining time to rebuild their loan loss reserves so to addresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22961crs5 10 ibid pp 2930 and bosworth dornbus ch and labán op cit pp 41 and 340 11 ibid 12

portion of their loan portfolios to qualif it also began to purchase these loans with an interestbearing promissory note the banks however actually repaid the interestbearing note at rate 2 percentage points below that paid by the central bank to the banks this added differential was sufficient incentive for the banks to sell all their bad loans to the central bank beginning pr ocess of identifying good loans and allowing for the eventual retirement of bad loans from the balance sheets and the banking system the cost to the central bank increased but by 1985 the portfolio of nonperforming loans at the central bank began to decline and was eventually eliminated11 restructuring distressed banks major goal of government actions was to ensure that bank owners and creditors were not absolved of responsibility to help resolve the crisis including using their own resour ces to absorb some of the costs the government worked closely with all financial institutions to impose new riskadjusted loan classifications capital requirements nd provisioning for loan losses which would be used to repurchase loans sold to the central bank the banks through the central bank purchase of substandard loans were given time to return to profitability as the primary way to recapitalize and became part of the systemic solution by continuing to function as part of the credit market number of banks had liabilities that ex ceeded assets were undercapitalized and unprofitable their fate was determined based on new sta ndards and they were either allowed to be acquired by other institutions including foreign banks or liquidated the too big to fail rule was apparently consideration in helping keep some institutions solvent total of 14 fina ncial institutions were liqui dated 12 during the 198183 period in most cases bank creditors were made w hole by the government on their deposits with liquidated banks for three fi nancial institutions that were closed in 1983 depositors had to accept 30 loss on their assets12 possible lessons from chiles bank crisis the overriding goal of strategy to correct systemic crisis in the financial sector is to ensure the continued functioning of credit markets chile succeeded in accomplishing this goal and restoring crisisridden banking system to health within four years the single most important lesson of the chilean experience was that the central bank was able to restore faith in the credit markets by maintaining liquidity and bank capital structures through the extension of house hold and consumer an maturities the temporary purchase of substandard loans fro m the banks and the prompt sale and liquidation of insolvent institutions substandard loans remained off bank balance sheetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22961crs6 until the viable institutions could provision for their loss from future profits other losses were covered by the government in addition number of other insights emerged from the chilean crisis the market could not resolve systemwide failure particularly in the case where there was high expectation of government bailout the expectation of ba ilout became selffulfilling and increased the cost appropriate pruden tial supervision and regulation were critical for restoring health and confidence to the financial system observers lamented the priori lack of attention to proper regulation private institutions that survived shared in the cost and responsibility to resolve the crisis to the apparent longterm benefit of the financial sector the fiscal cost of the three po licies discussed above was high liquidating insolvent institutions had the highest cost followed by the purchase of nonperforming loans nd rescheduling of domestic debts the strategy however is widely r ecognized as having allowed the financial system and economy to return to path of stabi lity and long term growth
