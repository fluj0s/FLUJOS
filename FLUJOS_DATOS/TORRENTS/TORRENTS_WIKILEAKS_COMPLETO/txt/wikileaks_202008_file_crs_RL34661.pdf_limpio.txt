divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34661fannie maes and freddie macs financial problems summary the decision to place fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship raises questions about their impact on the housing and finance markets to certain extent the housing mortgage and even general financial markets are in an unprecedented situation this action by their new regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa came after turmoil in the housing mortgage and fina ncial markets has raised doubts about the future of fannie m ae and freddie mac which are chartered by congress as governmentsponsored enterp rises gses and we re widely believed to have an implicit guarantee from the federal government the treasury will buy mortgagebacked securities from the gses and raise funds for them each gse gave treasury 1 billion in senior preferred stock and warrants to acquire at nominal cost 80 of each gse treasury pledged to invest up to 100 billion in each gse and committed to invest more if necessary now the formerly implicit guarantee is nearly explicit the federal reserve earlier took actions to allow fannie and freddie to borrow directly from the discount window priv ilege normally available only to primary securities dealers and banks that are member of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission has issued an emergency order restricting short selling of fannie and freddies stock the fhfa replaced the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo as the gses safety and soundness regulator ofheo repeatedly assured investors that fannie and freddie have ad equate capital but as highly leveraged financial intermediaries fannie mae and freddie mac had limited capital to cushion them against losses this report will be updated as

maes and freddie macs financial problems this report presents in question and an swer form the issues surrounding the financial conditions of fannie mae and freddie mac questions about conservatorship what is conservatorship conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac which are governmentsponsored terprises or gses involves the federal housing finance agency fhfa taking cont rol of the gses as conservator the powers of the board of directors officers and shareholders are transferred to fhfa conservator can also cancel certain contracts this is authorized by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 the goal of conservatorship is to preserve the gses assets and to re turn it to sound financial condition that will allow the conservato rship to be ended why did the fhfa place fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship as regulator of fannie mae and freddie mac fhfa announced that it had pl aced fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship because of their deterior ating financial position and the critical importance that each company has to the continued functioni ng of the residential financial markets1 fhfa has said that continuing audits of the gses determined that their financial positions were weaker than previously t hought and that the gses were unlikely to survive without conservatorship fhfa c ited previous public statements that the gses needed to increase their capital and n eeded to strengthen management controls over operations why did fhfa act on september 7 2008 instead of earlier or later fhfa in general followed the same approach that the federal deposit insurance corporation uses when it places bank in conservatorship series of requests for changes to the corporation nd increased capital followed by the sudden takeover providing deadline could provide the regulated entity with an incentive to take risky gambles in last attempt to avoid being seized by the government the fdic usually seizes bank by suddenly

httpir10kwizardcomfilesphpsource1372welc_next1xcomp0fg23 respectivelyaccording to media reports some larg foreign investors had been reducing their holdings of gse debt mortgage backed securities mbs and stock2 this would have made it more difficult for the gses to borrow money to finance their portfolios going forward for example bank of china ltd is reported to have sold or not replaced maturing 46 billion of gse debt which reduced its gse debt holdings to 173 billion as of june 30 2008 these same media reported that treasury officials contacted foreign central banks and others to reassure them of the creditworthiness of gse debt fhfa worked with treasury the fed and the gses over the weekend of september 6 and 7 2008 ofheo and fhfa c ontinue to take ad ministrative actions to transfer authority and resources to fhfa for example on september 4 2008 fhfa announced that it was publishing legal notice of its existence in the federal register 3 what will treasury contribute fannie mae and freddie mac have signed contracts to issue new senior preferred st ock to the treasury which has agreed to purchase up to 100 billion of this stock from each of the gses4 if necessary the treasury has agreed to contribute cash in the amount equal to the difference between each gses liabilities and ssets effective immediately september 7 2008 each gse issued treasury 1 billion of senior preferred stock and warrants options to purchase common stock if the warrants are exercised treasury would own 799 of each company as part of the contracts each gse has agreed to restrictions on paying dividends issuing new stock and disposing of assets the gses can increase their respective retained portfolio of mortga ges and mbs to 850 billion as of december 31 2009 but have to reduce their respective portfolios by at least 10 annually until each reaches 250 billion5 if gse were to reduce an 850 billion portfolio by 10 annually it would take more than 10 years to reduce it to 250

debt treasury has said that it expects to profit from the spread between the interest rate that it pays to borrow money through bonds and the mortgage payments on the mbs the gses will guarantee payment of the mbs this program expires december 31 2009 treasury agreed that if the gses have difficulty borrowing money treasury will create government sponsor ed enterprise credit facility gsecf to provide liquidity to the gses secured by mbs pledged as collateral7 this facility will terminate december 31 2009 future what are congress options fo r restructuring the gses going forward congress has many options for re organizing fannie mae and freddie mac including but not limited to the following it could decide not to change thei r structure however since the treasury has pledged financial support to the gses the claim that the federal government does not support fannie mae and freddie mac might not be believed in this case some might argue that it is inappropriate to provide financial support of two mortgage companies but not to others it should be noted that treasury has not announced direct guarantee of outstanding gse debt treasury has said that it will lend to the gses whatever funds are necessary so that the gses can pay their debt this arguably allows the statement that the federal government does not guarantee gse debt to remain technically accurate congress could make fannie mae and freddie mac part of the government both gses were or iginally government corporations and this would be return to that environment fannie mae and freddie mac could become federal home loanbanks the 12 regional banks are collective gse that is owned by their member institutions and thei r stock is not publicly traded fannie mae and freddie mac could be split up into large number of gses instead of two gses that are too big to fail there would be ten or some other number of smaller gses that would each be small enough to fail congress might wish to explicitly state what the risks to stockholders bondholders and business partners would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34661crs4 8 henry m paulson jr secr etary of the treasury rem arks by secretary henry m paulson jr on recommendations

could be converted into utilities each could issue mbs possibly guaranteed by the federal governme nt which would charge fee for the guarantee there are number of options for how the fees could be set the government could tablish standard fee or it could auction off the right to i ssue specific amount of mbs the government could sell new gse charters to the highest bidders treasury secretary henry m pa ulson jr has proposed using bonds backed not only by the issuing corporations legal obligation of repayment but also by the pledge of specific collateral as way to allow banks to supplement or even replace the gses role in mortgage markets8 what will happen to fannie mae s and freddie macs affordable housing initiatives there have been official announcements concerning the gses affordable housing initiatives both the housing mortgage goals set previously set by the department of housing and urban development nd the new national housing trust contained in the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 can be suspended if gse requests this and presents sufficien t justification section 1128 of the act allows fhfa to revise the hous ing goals and section 1131 of the act allows fhfa to suspend contributions what will happen to stockholders and other stakeholders the powers of common stockholders who formerly elected the boards of directors and approved certain enterprise actions are suspended the conservator has assumed all of their authority previously the co mmon stockholders owned 100 of the gses as result of the warrants issued to the treasury they could own only 20 of the enterprises in the long run 20 of healthy enterprise could be more than 100 of gses whose liabilities exceed their assets in the short r the price of the gses common stock has declined but if th gses recover st ockholders be better off compared to their situation at the time that conservatorship was undertaken to the extent that current and former employees have invested in common stock in the short run they are likely to see decline in the value of their financial assets the long run outcome is not clear both gses had employee stock and option plans the gses agreements with treasury prohibits issuing new stock consequently those programs cannot continue until the gses emerge from conservatorship gse employees except for the chief execu tive officer ceo of each enterprise are being urged by fhfa to continue work ing as before the ceos are replaced but have agreed to assist in the transition employees may decide to look for other employment but the decision is theirs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34661crs5 while the conservator is authorized by federal law to cancel certain contracts fhfa has said that current contracts continue in force who invests in the gses there is little information available about who holds gse stock bonds and mbs the fed reports statistics for combined ownership of government agency and gse debt and gse mbs at the end of 2007 nonunited states investors held 1479 trillion of 7397 trillion other large investors were us comme rcial banks 929 billion lif insurance companies 388 billion state and local government re tirement funds 317 billion mutual funds 566 billion assetbacked securitie s issuers 378 billion and the gses themselves 710 billion more recent reports from the gses show more than 40 of certain debt issues being held by foreign central banks what will happen to executive compensation the housing and economic recovery act strengthened fhfas regulation over executive compensation and golden parachutes the senior preferred stock agreement signed by each gse with fhfa requires the gses to get approval for new compensation agreements with executives after accoun ting irregularities we re uncovered in 2003 and 2004 ofheo sued fannie maes and freddie macs previous ceos franklin d raines and leland c brendsel resp ectively to recover part of their compensation in both cases out of cour t settlements were r eached which included the payment of fines nd donations to charities when will conservatorship end the conservatorship will end when fhfa determines that fannie mae and fr eddie mac have ade quate capital and have improved their controls and risk mana gement sufficiently the housing and economic recovery act charges fhfa with developing new capital standards for the gses to replace those established in the federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness ac t of 1992 pl 102550 while it is reasonable to expect that conservatorship will end either with the gses recovery or with their being placed in receivership and liquidated there is nothing mandating this outcome context why did fannie maes and freddie macs stock prices decline over the last year changes in the perception of the risks that fannie mae and freddie mac face in terms of future profitability and even continued financial viability has reduced the price that investors are willing to pay for share of the enterprises there was also concern that intervention by the federal government would reduce the value of the common stock between the end of 2007 and august 1 2008 fannies stock lost 72 of its value while freddies fell by 77 as pa rt of the treasurys financial aid package of september 7 2008 the gses agreed to issue warrants to the treasury worth 799 of their outstanding stock if treasur were to exercise the warrants current stockholders would own 20 of each enterpri this is one explanation why the gses stock prices declined further since september 7

these actions 10 pl 97362 96 stat 1726 et seq 11 pl 100233 101 stat 1568 et seqfannie mae and freddie mac are gses whose charters limit them to buying single family and multif amily home mortgages originated by others this lack of diversification makes them more exposed to housing and mortgage market problems than other financial institutions such as commercial banks that have other lines of business the gses have special re lationship with the federal government sometimes called an implicit guarantee that has allowed them to borrow at interest rates only slightly above those pa id by the federal government the two gses were very highly leve raged versions of banks they borrow money to lend and they max imize profits by keeping thei r capital reserves close to the minimum permitted by their regulators like banks the gses are required by law and by their regulators to maintain certain ratio between their loans and reserves to protect against loan losses key component of reserv is shareholders equity or the current value of the share holders investments however unlike banks the gses can only purchase home mort gages that others have made has anything like placing fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship ever happened before this is the first time that gse has been placed under conservatorship it appears to also be the first time that the federal government has made continuing commitment to company other than government companies on more gene ral level the federal government has intervened in the past to assist many companies9 what has congress done previously to improve the financial condition of the gses congress has previously acted to assist gses that were in financial difficulty when fannie mae was losing significant amounts of money in 1982 congress passed the miscellaneous revenue act of 1982 that provided some tax benefits for fannie mae10 the farm credit system another gse was aided with the agricultural credit act of 1987 which authorized the issuance of 4 billion in bonds to support system members11 section 1117 of the housing and econo mic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 authorizes the treasury to purchase any amount of gse securities debt or equity if necessary to provide stability to financial markets prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage cr edit or protect the taxpayer this means that if either of the two gses becomes ble to raise funds in private markets the federal government could simply purchase the debt securities that the firms were unable to sell elsewhere or recapitalize either firm by purchasing stock possibly becoming the majority shareholder this authority expires on december 31 2009 this action sent signal to the markets that the treasury was prepared to intervene rather than let either gse fail if this had been enough to maintainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34661crs7 12 freddie mac debt issuance by trade date available at

has taken to address the financial condition of the gses under existing law including the housing and economics refo rm act treasury the federal reserve and fhfa currently have the power to take certain actions even prior to the act the gses charters authorized the secret ary of the treasury to lend each gse 225 billion but this is more symbolic amount than total solution on the basis of fannie maes issuance of 1588 trillion in short term debt in 2007 the 225 billion would have lasted less than 125 hours on the basis of the 5986 billion of short term debt that freddie mac issued in 2007 the 225 billion would have lasted just under 33 hours12 on july 13 2008 the federal reserve bo ard of governors granted the new york fed the authority to lend directly to the gses13 section 1118 of pl 110289 requires the new gse regulator to consult with the fed to ensure financial market stability in addition to the feds general authority to be lender of last resort the gses charters give the gses special relationship to the nations central bank14 the federal reserve can use the gses bonds purchased on the secondary market for open market operations15 this could indirectly help the gses by adding to the demand for their debt and increasing its liquidity on july 15 2008 the securities and ex change commission sec issued an emergency order restricting short selling in the stock of 19 financial institutions including fannie and freddie16 the sec acted to prevent the possibility that false rumors could drive share prices down and cause the market to lose confidence thereby

stockholders will benefit the gses finance their portfolios of l ongterm typically 30year mortgages with shortterm borrowing typically three months to five years this increases the gses profits because shortterm borrowing is usually less expensive than longer term loans this creates interest rate risk which is the risk that if shortterm interest rates increase profitability can be reduced or can even turn to losses to try to reduce these risks the gses use variety of financ ial derivatives in worst case scenario the interest rate on shortterm loans to the gses could increase enough to cause substantial losse s and investors could stop entering into derivative contracts with the gses24 this would leave the gses who anticipated being able to roll over their short term debt unable to refinance treasurys financial promises of gse credit facility gsecf and to purchase mbs greatly reduces these risks what risks do fannie mae and freddie mac create for the us government there is the risk that one or both gses will be unable to repay the loan this risk that this could result in loss to the federal government is reduced by requiring collateral in the form of mb s but the value of
