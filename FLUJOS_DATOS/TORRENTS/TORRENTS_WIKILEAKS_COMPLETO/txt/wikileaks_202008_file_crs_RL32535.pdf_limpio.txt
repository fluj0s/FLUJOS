217a 7 69 fr 33281 june 15 2004received5 the fact act directed the ftc to promulgate rules establishing centralized source through which consumers may request free annua l file disclosures from each nationwide consumer reporting agency standardized form for these requests and streamlined process fo r consumers to reque st free annual file disclosure from nationwide sp ecialty reporting agencies under the final rule the centralized source includes centralized internet website tollfree telephone num ber and postal address it is estimated there will be 304 million requests yearly 75 or 228 million by internet 24 or 4 million by telephone and 1 or 166000 by mail to accommodate the initial volume of requests when the rule becomes effective availability will roll out from west to east beginning december 1 2004 and ending in nationwide availability on september 1 2005 during periods of extraordinary re quest volume request s may be redirected or declined so long as nationwide cra s implement reasonable procedures to anticipate and respond to consumer demand in order to strike balance between ease of use of the centralized source and maintaining adequate identification and authentication procedures against fraud and identity theft the ftc limits the collection of authentication and information collection to that which is reasonably n ecessary this may include but does not require consumers to provide their social security numbers it is the ftcs position that flexible standard that adapts over time is the most effective way to ensure that proper procedures are implemented furnishing of negative information section 217 of the fact act requires th at if any financial institution 1 extends credit and regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to nationwide consumer re porting agency and 2 furnishes negative information to such an agency regarding credit extended to customer the institution must provide clear and conspicuous noti ce in writing to the customer with 30 days of furnishing the negative information6 there is safe harbor for failure to perform if at the time of the failure the institution maintained reasonable policies and procedures to comply with the section if the institution reasonably believed that it was prohibited by law from contacting the customer the fact act directed the board of governors of the federal reserve system to publish concise model notice not exceed ing 30 words that financial institutions may but are not required to use to comply with the notice requirement on june 15 2004 the board published two model notices one for use when notice to the customer precedes the provision of negative information to cra and one for use if notice follows the provision of negative information7 the two model notices are as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32535crs3 8 69 fr 63922 november 3 2004 9 pl 108159 title i 10 pl 108159 sec 111 11 69 fr at 63933 12 69 fr at 63933 we may report

payment or other default on your account this informati on may be reflected in your credit report provisions related to identity theft on november 3 2004 the ftc released its final rule establishing definitions for identity theft and ide ntity theft report clarifying what constitutes appropriate proof of identity for purposes of the f cra as amended by the fact act and establishing the duration of an active duty alert created pursuant to the fact act8 definition of identity theft the fact act confers rights on victims of identity theft to assist them in resolving problems cause by identity theft9 defining identity theft determines who may avail themselves of the rights conferred by the act the fact act defines identity theft as fraud committed using the identifying information of nother person subject to fu rther definition by the ftc10 the ftcs final rule defines identity theft as fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority11 t h inclusion of attempted in the definition will allow both victims and intended victims to avail themselves of the pr otections provided under the act to have unauthorized inquiries remove d from their consumer reports and to have an initial fraud alert placed in their file definition of iden tity theft report under section 605a of the fcra as amended by the fact act victims who provide an identity theft report to consumer reporting agencies can request an extended fraud alert on their files an extended fraud alert lasts seven years and notifies users that the consumer may be victim of fraud or identity theft and requires users to contact the consumer before extending credit an identify theft report may so be provided by consumers to consumer reporting agencies to have information resulting from identity theft blocked from consumer reports and by consumers to info rmation furnishers to prevent information furnishers from continuing to provide information resulting from identity theft to the consumer reporting agencies the ftcs final rule defines identity theft report as report that alleges identity theft with as much specificity as the consumer can provide and has been filed by the consumer with federal state or local law enforcement agency12 the report may also include additional information as requested by an informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32535crs4 13 69 fr at

additional information for the purpose of determining the validity of the identity theft later than fifteen business days after receiving the law enforcement agency report or the consumers request whichever is later appropriate proof of identity section 112b of the fact act requires the ftc to determine what constitutes appr opriate proof of identity for the purposes described above in its proposed rule the commission found that the two greatest risks of misidentification are that the file of the requesting consum er is confused with another consumers file or that person pretending to be the consumer makes the request successfully the ftc noted that the risks vary over time by the method through which requests are made inter net phone mail nd between consumer reporting agencies considering the nature of the risks the ftc determined that the consumer reporting agencies were in the best position to assess the risks associated with misidentification and it proposed to require them to develop reasonable requirements to identify consumers in accordance with the risk of harm from misidentification the final rule follows the commission s original proposal but also imposes certain requirements on the consumer reporting agencies and provides examples of the types of information that may be used to prove identity13 under the final rule the consumer reporting agencies must ensure that the information is sufficient to enable the consumer reporting agency to match consumers with their files and adjust the information to be commensurate with an identifiable risk of harm arising from misidentifying the consumer14 examples of the type of information that may be used include the consumers full name an other previously used names current andor recent full address the full nine dig its of the social security number and date fo birth additional proof of identity may include copies of government issued identification documents utility bills and answers to questions to which only the consumer may be expected to know the answer duration of an active duty alert under the fact act military personnel deployed in situations where they are unlikely to be able either to apply for credit or to monitor their financial accounts may place active duty alerts in their files maintained by nationwide consumer reporting agencies the act sets minimum period of 12 months for the duration of th active duty alert but requires the ftc to determine if this pe riod should be longer the ftcs final rule abides by the duration of 12 months15 however the commission notes that service members depl oyed for longer than 12 months may request subsequent alerts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32535crs5 16 69 fr 68690 november 24 2004 17 69 fr at 68697 18 see 16 cfr part 314 19 69 fr

consumer information on november 24 2004 the ftc issued its final rule regarding the proper disposal of consumer report informati on and records as required under section 216 of the fact act16 the federal trade commissions new rule requires any person who maintains or otherwise possesses consumer informa tion for business purpose to properly dispose of such information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the inform ation in connection with its disposal17 the final rule includes examples of standards and practices that would constitute reasonable measures in compliance with the requirement articulated above such reasonable measures could include but are not limited to the following 1 the implementation of and monito ring of compliance with po licies and procedures that require the burning pulverizing or shre dding of papers containing consumer information 2 the implementation of and monitoring of compliance with policies and procedures that require the destruction or erasure of electronic media containing such information and 3 after due diligence entering into contract with another party engaged in the business fo record struction to dispose of such material persons subject to the grammleachb liley act and the co mmissions safeguards rule can incorporate the disposal of consumer information into the information security program required by the safeguards rule18 on november 29 2004 the national cr edit union administration ncua issued final rule to implement section 216 of the fact act by amending its fair credit reporting and security program regulations and ncuas guidelines for safeguarding member information19 the new rule generally requires federal credit unions fcus to develop and maintain controls designed to ensure proper disposal of consumer information as part of thei r information security programs examples of what constitutes proper disposal mirror those articulated by the federal trade commission on december 28 2004 the occ frs fd ic and ots the agencies issued final rule to implement s ection 216 of the fact act by amending the interagency guidelines establishing standards fo r safeguarding customer information20 the new rule amends paragraph iib of the gu idelines by adding proper disposal of consumer information to the list of objectives to reach this objective each institution must as part of its informati on security program develop implement and maintain measures to properly dispose of consumer information to guard against identity thefthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32535crs6 21 section 603d2aiii provides that person may communicate nontransaction or experience information that would otherwise be consumer report among its affiliates without becoming consumer reporting agency if the person has given the consumer both clear and conspicuous notice that such info rmation may be communicated among affiliates and an opportunity to optout of such communi cations and the consumer has not opted out 22 69 fr 33324 june 15 2004 23 idproposed rules affiliate marketing section 214a of the fact act amende d the fcra by adding new section 624 which the proposed rule seeks to imple ment by providing for consumer notice and an opportunity to prohib it affiliates from us ing certain information to make or send marketing solicitations to the cons umer section 624 governs the use of information by an affiliate not the sharing of information with or among affiliates which is the subject of section 603d2aiii21 though there is some overlap between the two optout provisions they serve distinct purposes section 624 does not specify which affiliate must give the consumer notice and opportunity to opt out of the use of the information by an affiliate for marketing purposes section 214 b2 of the fact ac t requires the ftc to consider existing affiliate sharing notification practices and to provide for coordinated and consolidated notices and section 214 llows for the combination of affiliate marketing optout notices with other notices required by law such as privacy notices therefore the ftc proposes that the pe rson communicating the information should be responsible for satisfying the notice requi rement where applicable because that is the person that would likely provide the ffiliate sharing optout notice under section 603d2aiii of the fcra and ot her disclosures required by law22 the proposed rule also defines the type of information that consumers are able to bar affiliates from using to send marketing solicitations referring to such information as eligibility information under the proposed rule eligibility information could include persons ow n transaction or experience information such as information about consumers account history with that person and other information such as information from credit bureau reports or applications23 under the proposed rule the commission has determined that person must give consumer reasonable opportunity to optout following delivery of the optout notice the proposal provides examples of what may constitute reasonable opportunity to optout and establishes 30day safe harbor period in certain situationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32535crs7 24 see 69 fr 42502 july 15 2004 69 fr 42302 july 14 2004 25 69 fr 23380 april 28 2004 26 idthe federal banking agencies and the securities and exchange commission have issued proposed rules that appear to be substantially similar to those proposed by the federal trade commission24 reporting of medical information on april 28 2004 the office of thrift s upervision of the partment of the treasury ots the federal reserve system board the fede ral deposit insurance corporation fdic and the national credit union agency ncua published proposed regulations impleme nting section 411 of the fact act restricting the circumstances under which consumer re porting agencies may furnish consumer reports containing medical information about consumers25 section 411a of the fact act added several new sections to the fcra among these new section 604g1 restrict s the furnishing by consumer reporting agencies of consumer repor ts containing medical information about consumers to the following three circumstances 1 the report is furnished in connection with an insurance transaction with the consumers affirmative consent 2 the report is furnished either for employment purposes or in connection with credit transaction the information is relevant to process th employment or credit transaction and the consumer provides writte n consent describing in clear and conspicuous language the use for which the information will be furnished or 3 the information pertains solely to transactions accounts or balances re lating to debts arising from the receipt of medical services products or devices wher such information is not sufficient to allow inference of the specific provi der or nature of the services the new section 604g2 prohibits cred itors from obtaining or using medical information pertaining to consumer in connection with any determination of the consumers eligibility or continued eligibility for credit final new section 604d3 liminates the standard exclusions permitting sharing transaction or experience information among affiliates after notice and an opportunity to optout where dicalrelated informa tion is concerned the agencies propose two things26 first they propose to create exceptions to the general prohibition against obtaining or using medical information in connection with credit eligibility dete rminations also they propose to create additional exceptions to the restrictions on sharing medicalrelated information with affiliates the agencies believe the exceptions are necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational transactional risk consumer and other needs and are consistent with congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes
