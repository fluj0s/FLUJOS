country of origin into containers ready for retail sale the law requires that their immediate containers carry country of origin mark if on the other hand they arrive in large boxes and are sold loose from store bins labeling is not required because the law allows for certain products to be ex empted from cool requirements namely vegetables fruits nuts berries which are in their natural state or

united fresh produce association gene rally is not in favor of mandatory cool beginning with consideration of the 2002 farm bill cool provision ufpa officials have maintained that the progra m should be voluntary and that cool laws should apply to all food items and cover all channels of distribution including food service sales the industry is concerned that mandatory prog ram will lead retailers to try to shift the burden of labeling ba ck up the chain to packershippers and producers8 opponents of mandatory cool point out that the industry has voluntarily labeled usgrown produce and tr ee nuts for years and that the trend in supermarkets and other retail outlets also has been toward increased cool in response to consumer preferences proponents of mandatory cool progra m which include the american farm bureau the national farmers union some domestic fruit and vegetable producers and some consumer organizations argue that consumers have right to choose which foods they buy based on knowledge of their source particularly since imports are increasing at fast pace and thus the ri sk is higher that foods with health and safety problems could enter the us ma rketplace although imported fruits and vegetables have been the source of some foodborne illness outbreaks eg the hepatitis outbreak in november 2003 linke d to green onions from mexico illness caused by pathogenic organisms in usgro wn produce also occurs as it did with an outbreak of illness from coli o157h7 contamination of fresh spinach from california in october 2006 f ood safety officials maintain that regulations alreadyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32951crs5 require imported produce to meet the same standards as us produce and that countryoforigin labeling does not increase food safety or prot ect public health planting flexibility congress passed planting flexibility pr ovision in the 1996 farm act pl 104 127 allowing producers of program crops to respond to market signals when choosing what to plant the term refers to the ability to receive subsidy payments for particular base crop such as corn on specific base acreage as declared by the farmer during the 2002 program signup peri od but to grow different crop on that same acreage in that same act howev er congress added nguage restricting producers from growing fruit and vegetable crops on base acres except in limited cases where producers had history of pl anting such crops specialty crop growers maintain that allowing program crop producers to switch even small numbers of acres to fruits or vegetables can sign ificantly destabilize the produce market congress renewed the restriction on gr owing specialty crops on program acres in the 2002 farm act in that act however soybeans became eligible for declaration as base crop that could receive bot h direct payments and countercyclical payments this raised an unforeseen problem primarily for some farmers in the midwest who traditionally have rotated soybeans with vegetable crops grown on contract for processing many producers found that the new soybean program rules severely restricted the amount of acreage on which they could continue that rotation they also found owners of rental farmla nd much less willing to rent their soybean program acres to farmers wanting to grow ve getables for fear of losing base acreage on which their payments are based companion bills were introduced in the 109th congress that would have reduced program payments on an acreforacre basis in year in which producer planted fruits or vegetables for processing on base acres the following year however if the producer again planted program crop on t hose acres that years payment would be calculated on the full number of base acres for the covered commodity in other words base acres could potentially be t for having been planted to fruit or vegetable crop for one year the bills also provided that in the event the secretary authorized recalculation of base acres any acres that had been planted to fruits and vegetables for processing would have been counted as having been planted to the program crop the 109th congress has taken action on these bills as of the date of this report regardless of what other specialty crop policies may be discussed for possible inclusion in the next farm bill changing or continuing planting flexibility policies likely will be key issue in that debate trade agreements and planting flexibility the concept of decoupling is important in the context of us ob ligations under multilatera l trade agreements the term refers to separating the direct link between federal farm payments and farmers decisions on what to plant on program acres efforts to decouple farm income and commodity support began in the 1980s and congress passed the first major decoupling provisions using planting flexibility as the mechanism in the 1996 farm act at the same time the act prevented producers from planting fruits and vegetables on flex acres except under limited circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32951crs6 9 for an indepth analysis of the wto ruling see crs report rl32571 usbrazil wto cotton subsidy dispute which is available on the crs website 10 much of the information in this section has been taken directly from crs report rl32044 immigration policy cons iderations related to guest worker programs please see that report for full analysis of the issue further questions should be directed to the author of the report 11 uffva position paper the top ten re asons to enact agjobs january 2005 available at httpuffvaorggovernmentin 2004 the world trade organization rule d that specific provisions of the us cotton program some related to the us policy on planting flexibility were out of compliance with the uruguay round agr eement on agriculture some trade and market analysts as well as legislators became concerned that legislative changes might be necessary to bring existing cotton program operations into compliance and that such potential changes could necessita that the 2002 farm act be reopened well before its scheduled expiration in 2007 ther was some concern therefore that the existing planting restrictions might need to be reexamined however it subsequently became apparent that the process of settling upon and implementing compliance plan to meet the wto finding would move slowly and that any potential changes in the current planting restrictions affecting specialty crops would not need to be considered until cong ress takes up the 2007 farm bill9 guest worker program reform10 at present the h2a program is the only program for temporarily importing foreign agricultural workers sometimes referred to as agricultural guest workers employers interested in importing workers unde r this program must first apply to the us labor department for certification that us workers capable of performing the work are not available and that employment of alien workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us workers number of bills were introduced in the 109th congress proposing to make changes to the h2a program s 359hr 884 hr 3857 s 2087 and others some of them contain provisions that woul d establish mechanisms for certain foreign agricultural workers to become us legal permanent residents none of these bills had been passed into law as of the date of this report positions on guest worker reform proposal s are mixed within the specialty crop industry and larger agriculture community the ufpa is strongly in favor of the proposals that have been introduced arguin g that the lack of sufficient legal workforce has reached crisis proportions th ey further maintain that s 359hr 884 would provide stable workforce for growers and more job stability for workers give workers better wages and working cond itions and let responsible guest workers earn the right to stay in the united states among other things11 opponents of the bills largely frame their arguments in terms of immigration policy arguing that the measures would give amnesty to illegal immigrants and make it easier for criminals and terrorists to get into the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32951crs7 the current discussion of guest worker programs takes place against backdrop of historically high levels of unauthorized migration to the united states supporters of largescale temporary worker program argue that such program would help reduce unauthorized migration by providing legal alternative for prospective foreign workers critics reject this reasoning and instead maintain that new guest worker program would likely exacerba the problem of illegal migration the consideration of any agricultural guest worker reform proposals would appear to raise variety of issues among them are the following how would the requirements of any new program compare to the requirements of the existing one who would be eligible shoul d the program include mechanism for participants to obtain legal permanent resident status how would family members of eligible individuals be treated what labor market test if any would the program employ would the program be numerically limited how would the rules and requirements of the program be enforced and what secu rityrelated provisions if any would be included
