rights such as child labor and working conditions it does this through the negotiation adoption and implementation of labor standards as treaties which are binding on the governments that ratify them the ilo has begun to address the issue of labor standards in trade and to refocus member attention on the core human rights labor standards declaration adopted in june 1998 confirms the obligation of all members to respect and apply the principles of seven core labor standards conventions and the ilo will begin an annual examination of how all nations comply with them the ilo is currently debating

and the us assessment the united states owes the ilo dues for previous years arrears and the ilo will need to comply with congressional reform benchmarks in order to be paid the ilo is also part of the debate on the use of labor standards as measure of fairness in trade agreements these issues are the subject of legislation during the 105th congress this report provides brief overview of the issues and the legislation introduced to address them crs has produced many related products which are referred to in the text basic information on the ilo can be found in crs report 95766 ilo fact sheet congressional research service the library of congress crs2 child labor issues during the 105th congress many bills have been introduced addressing child labor provisions including developing an

department of labor published its fourth annual report examining various aspects of child labor in us trading partners child labor convention the ilo has been concerned with child labor since its founding recent ilo study estimates that at least 250 million children are working either full or part time ilo convention number 138 sets minimum age for labor at 12 to 18 depending on how developed the country is and what type of work is involved it has been ratified by 64 countries though enforcement of minimum age laws remains problem in many of these countries the united states and most ilo members want to develop new convention to focus attention on reducing the worst forms of child labor such as bonded or slave labor certain hazardous conditions or occupations and work by very young children some ilo members are concerned that the proposed new convention will be too narrow others are concerned that some of the conditions which the proposed convention wants to control such as prostitution are crimes which are police matters rather than labor problems the june 1998 ilo conference discussed new child labor convention which addresses the worst forms of child labor convention 138 would remain the basis for protecting underage workers the language and contents of the new convention are being debated at ilo meetings now it is expected to be ready for adoption at the ilo conference in june 1999 number of differences in language and content remain to be resolved international program for the elimination of child labor ipec the ilo began technical assistance program to curb child labor in 1992 which is now operating in 30 countries and has small programs in many more there are 23 additional countries awaiting funding to begin ipec programs ipec programs focus on bonded child laborers children in hazardous working conditions and occupations very young working children and working girls they address the causes of child labor within each country support local efforts to prevent child labor provide alternative income and build permanent capacity within the country to address child labor the programs include efforts by ilo unicef local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations and the national government in an effort to change the situations within poor countries which lead to child labor ipec is considered very successful by many governments and is supported by many members of congress because the programs are cooperative and inclusive and address specific child labor situations in each country the us council for international business the us business representative to the ilo calls ipec programs well conceived and comprehensive ipec is currently funded by voluntary contributions from 16 donors including the united states ipec documents indicate that the 19961997 biennium budget was 184 million and the anticipated 19981999 budget will be 177 crs3 million congress provides contributions to ipec in the laborhealth and human services appropriations acts us contributions since 1992 total 81 million pl 105277 appropriated 30 million as requested by the president compared to 3 million in fy1998 ilo labor standards and trade since the creation of the world trade organization wto in 1994 the debate over the role of this new agency in relating labor standards to international trade practices has been heated and continuous the united states proposed and pl 103465 the uruguay round agreements act endorsed that working party be established in the wto to examine the relationship between workers rights and international trade issues in december 1996 wto members voted that the ilo rather than the wto should be the forum where the social dimensions of liberalized world trade are debated in their declaration wto members pledged commitment to observe internationally recognized core labor standards in june 1998 the ilo members adopted declaration declaring that all ilo members have an obligation to respect and promote core labor rights which are the subject of 7 ilo conventions whether or not they have ratified the conventions while the administration continues to press the wto to address the tradelabor standards issue it supports the ilo declaration and the development of an ilo procedure for the examination of compliance with the core labor standards anticipating the increasing ilo countries ratifying the core conventions role in the tradelabor standards area ilo member governments began to 87 freedom of 122 focus on labor standards and explore association right to new means of ensuring compliance with organize them several years ago member 98 right to organize 139 governments have debated and agreed collective bargaining that there are seven ilo labor conventions which are fundamental to 29 forced labor 147 workers rights these core human rights conventions deal with freedom of 105 abolition of 133 association right to organize and forced labor bargain collectively equal pay and 100 equal 137 benefits for men and women for work of remuneration equal value nondiscrimination in employment on the grounds of race sex 111 nondiscrimina 130 religion political opinion or national tion in employment origin freedom from forced labor and minimum age for employment the ilo 138 minimum age 64 members also agreed that the ilo should focus on encouraging wider ratification of these core conventions among ilo members and to emphasize them in the ilo technical assistance programs us trade legislation since the 1970s has often required trading partners to comply with internationally recognized workers rights with waiver where us national interests require more recently such compliance has been suggested for bilateral and multilateral foreign aid eligibility as well these rights as described in legislation and crs4 practice include compliance with the principles contained in the core ilo labor conventions congress continues to be interested in including labor standards in trade agreements failure of the administrations fast track trade legislation during 1997 has been blamed in part on inadequate labor standards provisions for background information on this issue see crs report 97272 worker rights and us trade policy wto singapore ministerial and fasttrack extension and crs report 94535 trade agreements and the international labor standards of the ilo at the june 1998 ilo conference the members adopted declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work this declaration states that all ilo members agree to adhere to the principles of the seven core conventions regardless of their state of development or whether they have formally ratified the conventions although the united states had hoped for agreement by all members by consensus the vote was 273 to 0 thirty countries 8 labor delegates and 5 employer delegates abstained from voting the us employer and worker delegates supported the declaration the ilo members also agreed to establish procedures for annual reports on the seven core conventions by all countries which have not ratified them comments on these reports by labor and employer groups will be included countries which have ratified the conventions report to the ilo at time intervals established by the various conventions the annual reports will be used to oversee how well countries are complying with the principles but there is still widespread disagreement over how the reports will be reviewed and used by the ilo in his june 1997 report to the members the ilo director general also proposed the development of social label for goods which are produced by countries found to be in compliance with core standards by independent international inspectors this proposal was very controversial among members with industrialized countries supporting and developing countries opposing such social label social labeling is increasingly being encouraged by consumer groups and by some governments us contribution shortfalls in fy1998 the united states contributed the full amount owed to ilo for calendar 1997 us contributions to the ilo the fy1999 appropriation covered nearly the in millions of dollars entire assessed amount appropriations short fy1991 620 falls during the last 10 years have left the united states about 29 million in arrears to the fy1992 546 ilo but the amount fluctuates as the exchange fy1993 573 rate changes from day to day fy1994 533 the ilo constitution requires that all fy1995 622 members pay an agreed portion of the budget fy1996 645 the us share is currently set at 25 congress funds the us contribution to the ilo through fy1997 540 the department of state appropriations in the fy1998 604 contributions to international organizations cio account part of title iv of the annual fy1999 req 598 commerce justice state appropriation bill the source department of state cio account funds many agencies and non crs5 agencies such as nato and the organization of american states the ilo contribution is the fourth largest in this account as part of efforts to reduce the budget deficit congress has cut spending for the cio account the reduction is made more severe because contributions to some international agencies such as international atomic energy agency and nato have been protected from the cuts requiring even greater reductions for the remaining agencies in addition contributions to the ilo are set in swiss francs rather than us dollars so changes in the exchange rate also affect the us assessment even after money has been appropriated the department of state as well as the us labor and employer delegates have long been concerned that the us arrears make it much more difficult for the united states to achieve its foreign policy objectives in the ilo including reform of the agency increased emphasis on core labor standards and concentration on child labor agency reform us proposals to reform the ilo mirror us efforts at the united nations focusing on budget reduction and transparency elimination of waste and effective oversight hr 1757 the fy1998 authorization bill as passed by congress required reform measures before any arrears payments could be made this included changes in the ilo budget and reduction of the us assessment to 20 hr 1757 passed both houses but due to disagreement between the house and the administration over abortion language unrelated to the agencies the president vetoed the bill appropriations bills have included arrears funds but they also require passage of an authorization bill and thus the reform measures before the arrears may be paid in march 1999 new ilo director general juan somavia of chile will take office his election was supported by the united states as the person most likely to continue the reforms needed in the ilo hr 1757 the bill authorizing contributions to the ilo contained series of reform benchmarks which must be met before any payment of arrears may be made these include reduction of the us assessment to the ilo from 25 to 22 in 1999 and to 20 in 2000 in addition the ilo must establish an independent inspector general similar to the inspector general and heshe must prepare regular reports to the members the ilo must adopt program evaluation procedures to establish the continued effectiveness of programs and terminate programs longer needed the ilo must establish clearer budget procedures and not exceed budget levels agreed upon at the beginning of the biennium except by consensus of members finally the ilo must approve 20002001 budget which is lower than the 19981999 budget another provision of the bill which sets the total us contribution to agencies in this account at 900 million may ultimately require greater reductions in us contributions or withdrawal from one of the larger agencies us government reform proposals for the ilo focus on clearer budget presentation budget reduction elimination of waste and overlap and effective member oversight in all these reform areas the department of state judges the ilo as one of the more reformminded organizations according to the department of state the ilo has made changes in budget format which have begun to address the us desire for clearer budget presentation but have long way to go in other areas such as reduced printing costs and meeting expenses the ilo has made substantial progress according to the department of state efforts to establish program priorities and eliminate internal duplication and low priority programs crs6 are being addressed the ilo governing body adopted amendments which tighten financial oversight and the agency does have internal and external audits in all these areas the administration expects the new directorgeneral to continue the progress made under the current one in its february 1997 report on us participation in 5 agencies gaonsiad97 2 the gao estimated that when inflation and the exchange rate are taken into account the ilo budget declined 2 in real terms between the 199495 biennium and the 199697 biennium this resulted partly from action taken by the ilo governing body to reduce expenditures after the budget was adopted in view of the unlikeliness of full us contributions the united states canada argentina and israel voted against the 199697 budget the june 1997 international labor conference approved 2year 19981999 budget of 481 million 375 reduction in constant dollars from the previous biennium according to the department of state under its normal procedures the ilo conference will not address assessments again until the june 2000 ilo conference until that time the us assessment will remain 25 and the ilo is unlikely to qualify for arrears payments under currently proposed provisions of reform legislation us ratification of ilo conventions the united states has ratified 12 of the 176 ilo conventions of the 12 two have never entered into force because not enough governments ratified them the small number of ilo conventions ratified by the united states has long been matter of diplomatic concern for many member states particularly us failure to ratify the core human rights labor conventions the united states has ratified only one of the core conventions 105 on forced labor another 111 prohibiting discrimination in employment was sent to the senate for consideration on may 181998 lack of ratification has historically been due to concern within congress that ratification would undermine the us legislative process in domestic matters since treaties become the law of the land concern that the division of authority between states and the federal government for labor standards would be undermined and opposition from much of the us business community nonetheless lack of ratification inhibits the us ability to encourage wider observance around the world of the standards set by them according to the department of state when the united states returned to the ilo in 1980 after 2year absence one of the changes adopted by the administration was the establishment of tapils the tripartite advisory panel on international labor standards this panel composed of labor business and us government members was established to provide more systematic assessment of ilo conventions by all concerned parties with the goal in mind of increasing us ratification of ilo conventions five conventions have been ratified since the process began including one of the core human rights labor conventions number 105 which prohibits forced labor number 111 which prohibits discrimination in employment has been cleared for ratification by the presidents advisory committee on the ilo following favorable report by tapils clearance by this committee means that there are legal impediments to implementing the treaty under us law in january 1997 then labor secretary reich recommended that the convention be submitted to the senate for approval for other
