of the operator of an illegal lottery and one of his runners who had been charged with conducting ﬁnancial transactions involving the proceeds of an illegal gaming business in violation of 18 usc 1956 the ruling is that proceeds as used in this money laundering statute means proﬁts rather than gross receipts of the underlying unlawful activity the decision combines plurality opinion interpreting the word proceeds in the statute to mean proﬁts and concurring opinion necessary for majority ruling that leaves room for interpreting proceeds as gross receipts in other circumstances strong dissenting opinion emphasized the constraints the ruling will place on prosecutors the interpretation rests on two principles of statutory construction the rule of lenity and the merger doctrine under the rule of lenity ambiguities in criminal statutes are construed in favor of the defendant application of the merger doctrine avoids the prospect that defendant would receive two punishments under

st ates v granderson 511 us 39 1994 10 in dissent justice alito illustrated some of the problems inherent in requiring prosecutors to prove beyond reasonable doubt that illegal enterp rises have produced profits and that those conducting financial transactions for them know that the funds they are using represent the profits from some unlawful activity 11 18 usc 1956a1supreme court decision the issue presented to the court was straightforward question of statutory interp retation as used in 18 usc 1956 does proceeds mean profits or gross receipts for santos and his coconspirators the answer the court provided is profits for others however the answer is not clear because there is majority opinion in the case there is an opinion for plurality of four justices which is joined by concurring opi nion by fifth justice justice stevens that limits the reach of the holding to narrowe r ground this means that the case may be cited as authority only for the narrow ground complicating this however are two factors 1 the plurality opinion includes language seeking to confine the meaning of justice stevens opinion and 2 all of the other justices disavowed the approach taken by justice stevens justice scalia in the plurality opinion writing for himself and justices souter ginsburg and thomas found way to deci pher what congress intended in using the word proceeds in 18 usc 1956 he found that 1 there is definition of proceeds in 18 usc 1956 2 the fe deral criminal code does not provide consistent definition or use for the term 3 either profits or gross receipts would fit everywhere proceeds is used in the st atute and 3 dictionaries revealed overwhelming preference for primary ordinary meaning of the term declaring himself unable to resolve the ambiguity justice scalia resorted to the rule of lenity7 which requires clarity in criminal statutes8 and ambiguities resolved in favor of defendants9 he reasoned that because profits is harder to prove10 than gross receipts defining proceeds as profits is more lenient to wards defendants and therefore it is the required interpretation in the statute this means that under this statute prosecutors must prove in addition to the other elements of th offense that the defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction is profits of some form of unlawful activity and that the transaction involves profits of specified unlawful activity11 in the opinion justice scalia seeks to dispel arguments raised by the solicitor general that defining proceeds as pro fits undermines the purpose of the money laundering statutepunishing c oncealment and promotion of illegal activitiesbecause it does not capture all the funds generated by th illegal activity he first asserts that the purpose of the money laundering laws might well have been elimina ting the harm causedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22896crs4 12 rational congress could surely have decided that the risk of leveraging one criminal activity into the next poses greater threat to society than the mere payment of crimerelated expenses and justifies the moneylaundering statutes harsh penalties santos scalia j plurality op slip op 78 13 for merger the applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes violation of two distinct statutory provisions the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each pr ovision requires proof of fact which the other does not blockberger v ited states 284 us 299 303 1932 14 justice stevens raises this issue allowing the government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense santos stevens j concurring op slip op 4 15 justice scalia disputes the effectiveness of the solution to the merger problem suggested by justice alito in dissentlimiting promote in the statute to exclude expenses of running the criminal activityboth by noting that many of th predicate offenses ar not ongoing violations and distinguishing between the kind of evidence that might satisfy the statutory requirement of intent to promote from the activity of promoting 16 justice scalia characterized this approach as unique to justice stevens and contrary to precedent saying that justice stevens re lies on the proposition that one undefined word repeated in different statutory provisions ca n have different meanings in each provision which is worlds apart from giving the same word in the same statutory provision different meanings in different factual contexts santos scalia j plurality op slip op 15 emphasis in the original 17 justice scalia finds this approach inconsistent with clark v martinez 543 us 371 2005 term in immigration law interpreted to apply in one manner to one class of aliens which it covers may not be interpreted in different manner for other classes of aliens covered idby pouring criminal profits into expanded cr iminal activity ie leveraging profits12 he then notes that the profits interpretation avoids the merger13 problem that would occur in many of the predicate offenses named in 18 usc 1956 including operating an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 usc 1955 this is because if proceeds were interpreted to mean gross receipts every separate expense of the underlying crime paid after its commission w ould be subject to prosecution both as the substantive crime and as the money launderi ng offense this would raise the double jeopardylike situation14 that the merger doctrine seeks to prevent15 in concurring opinion justice stevens ssentially limits the reach of the plurality opinion he did not focus on the rule of len ity although his rationale is consistent with it to the extent that he would interpret proceed s to mean profits in the case before the court he begins with premise which other justice embracest hat courts may choose different interpretations of ambiguous rms in statutes depending on the factual circumstances16 he draws parallel between the scope of judicial interpretation of statutes and the power of congress to flesh out terms in statutes he concludes that because congress could specify separate meanings for term in statute courts having to fill in statutory gaps occasioned by ambi guous language do not have to decide on one meaning for all circumstances to him the logic is if congress may apply different definitions drafting legisla tion courts may also do so17 from this premise he seems to have concluded that congress intended different meanings for proceeds in 1956httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22896crs5 18 justice stevens reinforces the conclusion with respect to requiring profits for any money laundering prosecution predicated on operating an illegal gambling business operation he opines that the result of prosecution for money laundering 20year felony based on the kind of business expenses involved in paying winners and employees in connection with an illegal gambling business 5year felony would be so perverse that he could not conceive of congress intending such result santos stevens j concurring slip op 3 19 as justice alito rightly argues the legi slative history of 1956 makes it clear that congress intended the term proceeds to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales santos stevens j concurring slip op 23 he further adds thus i cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must apply to the definition of p roceeds for these types of unlawful activities id 3 n 3 20 santos scalia j concurring opinion slip op 16 notes that other justice adheres to justice stevens view that one word in one stat ute may be interpreted different ways in different case the narrowness of his ground consists of finding that proceeds means profits when there is legislative history to the contrary that is all that our judgment holds it does not hold that the outcome is different when contrary legislative history does exist 21 brief for the united states united states v santos 061005 3 n 3 citing 16 appellate court cases in which money laundering prosecuti ons were predicated on expense payments rather than profits 22 id 28 among the factors cited by the government are poor record keeping on the part of criminals incentive to falsify r ecords to show losses if money laundering prosecution hinges on profitability of the criminal activity and problems that courts will face confronting in devising rules for determining profits and expenses in illegal activities as contrasted with the precise accounting rules for legitimate businessesfollowing this conclusion justice stevens finds that proceeds is intended to mean profits where as with th predicate offense of conductin g an illegal gambling business there is legislative history of c ongressional intent to the contrary18 on the other hand the opinion seems to assert that legislative history of congressional intent is necessary before courts may extend the meaning of proceeds to gross receipts the opinion also contains language indicating that there is the possibility that there is legislative history to substantiate congressional intent to aut horize money laundering prosecutions based on gross receipts transactions for certain offenses19 potential impact although justice stevens alludes to the possibility that legislative history supports interpreting pro ceeds as gross receipts for some types of prosecutions it is significant that the plurality opinion disputes this and characterizes it as dicta20 this may raise uncertainty as to the sustainability of convictions involving the contraband and organized crime offenses of the kind jus tice stevens cited as having legislative history supporting gross receipt s definition of proceeds because many of the money laundering cases that have b een brought under the subsection of 18 usc 1956 at issue have involved payment of expenses of the underlying crime21 the justice departments ability to shut off the f unding of criminal activ ities may be severely inhibited an added problem will be the difficu lty of sustaining the burden of proof that will be required to show profits of criminal activities in its merits brief the solicitor general argued that this burden would be substantial and pe rhaps unsurmountable22 in dissenting opinion written by justice lito joined by chief justice roberts and justices kennedy and breyer there is furt her indication of the difficulties that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22896crs6 23 santos breyer j concurring op slip op 1 24 as authority for this approach justice breyer cites united sates v edgmon 952 f 2d 1206 10th cir 1991 cert denied 505 us 1223 1992 that case was predicated on conversion of property secured by farmers home administra tion loan in violation of 18 usc 658 the money laundering charge was based on the conceal ment prong of the statute which requires proof that the defendant knew that the financial transaction was designed to conceal the nature the location the source the ownership or the c ontrol of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity 18 usc 1956a1bi the facts showed that the defendant conspired with his and sold as if it were his own the collate ral on which his had obtained secured loan he then used the proceeds of the conversion to buy other property on which he obtained loan and turned those proceeds over to his justice breyer also appears to suggest that if there was time difference between the offense and the mone laundering that would show that the two are distinct santos breyer j concurring op slip op 12 25 this section sets forth the purposes of th us sentencing commission one of which is to provide certainty and fairness in meeting th purposes of sentencing avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct 28 usc 991b1b another secti on 28 usc 994f requires the commission in promulgating guidelines to cover the purposes set forth in 28 usc 994b1 particularly 26 santos scalia j concurring op 11 27 idprofits definition will present to prosecutors 1 one of the main purposes of enacting the money laundering laws was to target pr ofessional money laundere rs who are unlikely to know or care whether the property they are d ealing with is profits or gross receipts 2 profits interpretation would require c ourts to determine the ordinary expenditures of criminal activities to distinguish them from profits and 3 under the plurality opinion if the government charges continui ng offense over period of yearsas in the case before the courtthe government would have to show that the operation yielded profit over the course of time charged another dissenting opinion written by jus tice breyer who also joined justice alitos dissent alludes to possible solutions to what he agreeing with the justices scalia and stevens sees as merger problemthat prosecutors are able to transform one crime into two and add the money laundering punish ments for financial transactions that constitute an essential part of the predicate offense23 one approach he mentions is requiring that the money laundering tran saction be distinct from the underlying offense24 he also suggests that the merger problem could be corrected by relying on the us sentencing commission to use its authority to address the unfairness resulting from using the money laundering statute to under 28 usc 991b1b25 justice scalia takes issue with each of these suggestions th first because it has basis whatever in the words of the statute26 the second because it lacks certainty27 it is thus not unlikely that the department of justice will seek legislation to solve the problems identified in this decision direct approach would clarify the ambiguity found by the court by making it clear that p roceeds means gross r eceipts at least with respect to certain kinds of offenses other possibilities include modifying other portions of the money laundering statute such as defi ning promote or specifying how distinct the predicate crime and money laundering offense must be
