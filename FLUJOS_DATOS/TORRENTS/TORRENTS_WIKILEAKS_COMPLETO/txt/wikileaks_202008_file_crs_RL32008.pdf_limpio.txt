disclosure of consumer credit information with key provisions of the fcra set to expire at the end of 20033 the 108th congress conducted series of extensive hearings on the fcra and how it pertained to number of consumer related issues such as identity theft and the credit granting process the legislation that resulted was the fair and accurate credit transactions fact act of 2003 which was signed by the president on december 4 2003 and became pub l 108 1594 key issue that emerged during the bate was the degree to which consumer credit files are complete and accurate and to what extent the accuracy of the information affects the ability of consumer s to access credit at reasonable rates the empirical research suggests that there can be significant inconsistencies omissions andor errors in c onsumer credit files5 for example federal reserve board study found that about 70 percent of the consum ers in the sample had missing credit limit on one or more of their revolving accounts6 in these cases the highest balance is typically used in place of the credit limit to measure consumers credit utilization which can lead to higher perceived leve l of credit risk for

improving the accuracy and fairness of the credit reporting system15 although the consumer reporting industry ag reed with this general thesis it did not support any legislative initiative that would allow all creditusing individuals to request one free credit report year16 given the difficulties in predicting how many consumers would exercise their right to receive free credit report each year the industry asserted that the potential increas ed costs from such policy could pose tremendous burdens17 on credit reporting agencies this report provides brief legal analys is of the fact act provision requiring annual free credit reports to be disclosed on request and from an economic perspective offers one approach to asse ssing the potential costs of this requirement to the credit reporting industry the report is divided in two distinct sections the first section provides legal analysis of th current federal and state laws regarding free credit reports including the recently enacted fact act the second section develops general economic framework which could be us ed to assess the potential costs to the credit reporting industry nd then calibrates the model using industry supplied data to calculate different cost scenarios legal analysis the fcra and free credit report disclosure free reports under the fact act the fact act inter alia amends the fcra to allow consumer to request one free copy of his or her credit report from each nationwide consumer reporting agency once during twelve month period18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32008crs4 18 continued both the fact act and the fcra use the rm consumer report rather than credit report while consumer report may in certain circumstances encompass more information than what is in typical cred it report the latter is the commonly used term for the type of information that is the subject of this report in fact the legislative history uses the term credit report when referring to the free access provisions and courts

allowing citizens of the state to obtain free copies of their credit reports generally the new federal law preempts state ws related to the provision of free annual credit reports however state laws enacted prior to the enactment of the fact act are explicitly exempt from this general preemption35 pursuant to state law residents of colorado maryland massachusetts new jersey and vermont can receive one free copy of their credit report per calendar year36 georgia residents are entitled to two free copies per year37 in addition to the free annual reports provi ded by some statues state may also require the provision of free credit reports under certain special circumstances for example consumers in colorado may obtai n free copies of their credit reports upon notification from consumer reporting agency that the agency has received eight credit inquiries pertaining to the consumer or the agency has received report that would add negative informati on to the consumers file38 the consumer reporting agency is required to notify the consumer when either of these events occurs and must provide the consumer with tollfr ee number to call to request free copy of the report under such circumstances statut of this type do not appear to be preempted under the general preemption discussed above in addition to the states that require the provision of free reports number of states limit the amount that consumer repor ting agency may charge consumer for disclosure of his or her credit report federal law places cap on what consumer reporting agencies may charge for the disclo sure of consumers report but does not require the imposition of charge thus states are free to enact laws limiting the charges allowed for example residents of connecticut pay 5 for the first copy and

the breach and insure that customer information is not used in an inappropriate manner such notices may also encourage consumers to check their credit reports for inaccuracies resulting from the breachan economic analysis the consumers decision tree by requiring credit reporting agencies to provide an annual free credit report upon the request of consumer the fact ac t mandates these agencies to in effect provide consumers free option which they can choose to exercise or not if consumer chooses not to exercise this op tion there will be cost incurred by the credit bureau if however consumer does choose to exercise the option the consumer may find data inaccuracies and decide to dispute the information contained in the report in this case the cost to the credit reporting agency of issuing the option will be dependent on the consumers decision path figure 1 illustrates the different paths of possible consumer decisions as can be seen from figure 1 the cost to the credit reporting agency of providing the option for consumers to request free credit report will depend on three major factors 1 the proportion of consumers who exercise their option p consumers will choose to exercise thei r option when the marginal benefit of receiving the report exceeds the hassle of taking the time and effort to request the report for each consumer the value rived from the peace of mind of knowing that hisher credit data are accurate w ill depend on the indi viduals particular characteristics and circumstances for example the marginal benefit of requesting credit report will likely be higher prior to the consumers application for credit or if consumer is particularly concerned about the possibility of identity theft the consumer may derive significant peace of mind from reviewing hisher credit report once year the credit reporting industry has also suggested consumers may request copy of their report following security breach notice40 for many consumers however the perceived hassle of taking the time to request the report may simply not be worth the effo rt to exercise the option this will be especially true for those consumers who are not well informed about the importance of accurate credit data or the risk of identity theft as consumers become more aware of these issues the proportion of consumer s who choose to exercise their option will likely

request cbo assumed thr eefold increase in the number of consumers requesting free credit report each year and estimat ed that the issuance cost or direct cost would range from 30 million to 60 million per year to estimate the secondary effect of reinvestigations the agency assumed that pproximately half of t hose individuals would dispute the information in accordance to cbo industry sources the cost per reinvestigation is likely to range between 700 and 800 not 1000 so the total cost of the secondary effect would range from 110 million to 125 million per year for more information see continuedthe assumptions for p and q table 1 attached at the end illustrates the range of possible cost estimates under different scenarios55 the benchmark case assumes the i ndustrys estimate for the number of consumers who are receiving free credit re ports under the current federal provisions as can be seen from the table if it is true that approximately half of these consumers call back with either question or dispute the model estimates that it is likely costing the industry anywhere between 836 million and 912 million if credit bureaus were required to provi an annual free credit report to all creditusing consumers who request one the industry timates that there could be as much as fourfold increase in the number of consumers who request free report56 under this scenario the table show s that the costs to the industry could range anywhere from 663 million to 6080 million depending on the number of consumers who decide to dispute and the it cost of issuing consumer report if one assumes that roughly half of these consumers will dispute then the cost could range from 3344 million to 3648 million thus under this assumption the model estimates that the additional cost of the po licy could cost the industry anywhere from 2508 million to 2736 milli on which is roughly in line with the industrys assessment of quarter billion57 however given the request rates re ported by transunion and other credit bureaus for states that alr eady require annual free credit reports the data suggest it is more likely that there will be twofold or threefold increase in the number of free reports requested once again assumi ng that approximately 50 of those consumers will dispute the cost to the credit reporting industry could range between 1672 million and 2736 million thus under th assumptions the additional cost of the policy to the credit reportin g industry could be anywhere from 836 million to 1824 million58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32008crs12 58 continued the cbo web site

additional cost of the policy to the credit reporting industry could theoretically range between 9614 million to 10488 billion it is important to note that the calculations presented in this report
