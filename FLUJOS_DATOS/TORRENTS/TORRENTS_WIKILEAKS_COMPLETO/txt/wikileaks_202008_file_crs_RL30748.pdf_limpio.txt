use since 1970 about 455000 personnel have started the vaccination series and according to dod at least 442 have refused the vaccine dod deems the immunization to be mandatory and active duty personnel who have refused have been subject to administrative discharge or court martial for failure to obey lawful order some reserve and national guard personnel have resigned rather than take the

against anthrax highly lethal disease caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis at least 10 countries are suspected of having developed or trying to develop anthrax as biological weapon in testimony before the senate armed services committee the joint chiefs of staff director of intelligence identified seven of these countries russia china iran iraq libya north korea and syria2 the vaccinations began in march 1998 with an advance program for the 48000 troops assigned to the persian gulf region on may 18 1998 secretary cohen approved the total force vaccination program and the full program began in september with troops in korea being priority it was expected to take about seven years to vaccinate all 14 million active duty and 900000 selected reserve personnel however difficulties in obtaini ng sufficient supplies of vaccine will probably extend this estimate 3 prior to this program over 3000 civilian and military personnel associated with dods biological warfare defense activities were routinely vaccinated an abbreviated immunization series of injections was also given to about 150000 troops deployed to southwest asia during the persian gulf conflict in 1990 914 the us food and drug administration first approved the vaccine for use in 1970 anthrax primarily infects grazing animals such as sheep and cattle and the vaccine is given to veterinarian and livestock workers who are at risk from exposure to the disease the full immunization process currently involves six injections delivered over 18 months followed by annual booster shots if the vaccination series is interrupted the fda does not require restarting the series from the beginning but rather approves continuing with the rema ining shots this is in keeping with the recommendation of the centers for disease control and preventio ns advisory committee for immunization practices the vaccine does not contain live anthracis bacteria it is killed bacteria vaccine as of july 2000 about 447000 personnel had started the vaccination series according to dod data 442 personnel have refused the vaccination and have received punishments ranging from general discharge under honorable conditions to courtsmartial resulting in bad conduct discharges for failing to obey lawful orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30748crs2 5 report on the dod anthrax vaccina tion program department of defense

httpwwwsenategovarmed_serviceshearings2000c000413htm this is in keeping with dod policy regarding all fdalicensed immunizations given to military personnel the disparity in punishment has received criticism but dod maintains that the disciplinary actions remain at the discretion of the local commander and that dodwide policy will be imposed on the services critics of the program maintain that significant numbers of personnel particularly among the reserves are choosing to leave the service rather than take the vaccine and dod has acknowledged that its records would not reflect those individuals this has raised concerns over the programs effect on personnel retention and readiness although dod maintains that the effect has been minimal in response to this the fy2001 dod authorization act pl 106398 requires gao report by april 2002 on the impact of this program on personnel recruitment and retention secretary of defense cohen directed that the dod vaccination program

supplemental testing of vaccine lots previo usly approved for release by the fda to assure safety and potency as discussed below not all these lots have been reapproved for release thereby creating shortage of vaccine that will extend into 2001 see vaccine production and testing personnel data on those vaccinated is currently being entered in the defense enrollment eligibility reporting system deers and eventually will be entered in newly developed jointservice preventative health care system for long term tracking of immunization status the independent review of the immunization program was conducted by dr gerard m burrows david page smith professor of medicine at yale medical school and special advisor to the president for health affairs he completed his independent review of the anthrax vaccination program on february 19 1998 concluding that the anthrax vaccine appears to be safe and offer s the best available protection against anthrax as biological warfare agent and that aside from not vaccinating pregnant personnel and those with immune systems deficiency there would not seem to be the need for special considerati ons5 there has been criticism however that dr burrows is not specialist in immunology or biological warfare and consequently the value of his review is limitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30748crs3 6 department of defense anthrax vaccine immunization program

anthrax vaccine program the anthrax vaccination program has become focus of controversy and congressional concern for variety of reasons questions have been raised about the vaccines efficacy against all forms of anthrax possible longterm adverse effects the reliability of the adverse reaction reporting system the reliability of the manufacturer and dods contractual arrangements with the manufacturer the house government reform subcommittee on national security veterans affairs and international relations the house armed services subcommittee on military personnel and the senate armed services committee have held hearings providing testimony from broad range of witnesses including representatives from dod the food and drug administration fda and the general accounting office gao members of the military who believe their anthrax vaccination has caused variety of medical ailments and members who have refused the vaccination and have received disciplinary action or chosen to leave the service have also testified the house government reform committee has also published report detailing its national security subcommittees critique of the vaccination program6 some members of the us air national guard and air force reserve have been among the vocal of opponents to the vaccination program and significant numbers have left the service rather than participate the general accounting office provided preliminary results of study to the house committee on government reform indicating that the program was indeed serious considerat ion among those pilots leaving the guard and reserve7 the department of defense and the food and drug administration in their testimony continue to maintain that the vaccine is safe and the most effective medical protection curre ntly available against anthrax 8 charles cragin acting assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs has noted that in addition to the fda the united nations world health organization the american public health association the american college of physicians and the national institutes of health have endorsed the vaccine9 vaccine effectiveness the controversy over the vaccines effectiveness centers on its ability to protect against inhalation anthrax and its ability to protect against genet icallyengineered strains that could be developed as biological weapon anthrax is naturally most often contracted through cuts or abrasions in the skin which come in contact with contaminated animal products or through ingestion of contaminated meat as biological weapon however anthrax is far more likely to be delivered as spore aerosol that would be inhaled critics of the vaccine programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30748crs4 10 house government reform subcommittee on national secu rity

anthrax vaccine gaotnsiad99148 p 4 12 ibid 13 testimony before the house government reform subcommittee on national security continuedpoint out that there is very little data based upon human studies upon which to judge the vaccines effectiveness against inhalation anthrax10 given that anthrax is fatal disease challenge studies ie exposing vaccinated subjects to anthrax spores to determine immunity cannot be performed consequently the only public study involving humans was based upon observation of limited group of wool workers and though none of the vaccinated workers contracted anthrax and unvaccinated ones did the small number of people involved limits the value of the study dods assessment of the vaccines effectiveness against inhalation anthrax is based upon studies conducted with rhesus monkeys dr arthur friedlander chief bacteriologist at the army medical research institute of infectious diseases has testified that the vaccine protected 95 of the test subject rhesus monkeys exposed to anthrax doses hundreds of times greater than the amount that kills an unprotected population11 the general accounting office has noted however that there is inadequate data on correlating the effectiveness of this vaccine in monkeys to its effectiveness in humans12 dod and the fda are currently working to develop the data required for this correlation concerns have also been repeatedly raised that the vaccine may not protect against all 31 known strains of anthrax and that it would be possible to develop genetically engineered strain against which the vaccine would not be effective on september 30 1999 lt gen robert r blanck surgeongeneral of the army testified before the house armed services military personnel subcommittee that we have solid evidence that this vaccine will protect against all natural strains of anthrax at the same hearing deputy secretary of defense hamre testified we have evidence that anyone has genetically engineered an anthrax strain to the point that it can be weaponized and is threat but acknowledged that were this to occur there is the possibility that the current vaccine would not be effective with this in mind critics of the program insist that the vaccines possible limitations be openly acknowledged the vaccination programs supporters maintain that the question of the vaccines effectiveness against potential new anthrax strains should not overshadow its effectiveness against the current anthrax threat agents the health and human services department in cooperation with dod is currently working to develop an improved anthrax vaccine and one which could reduce the number of shots required to achieve immunization although the fda approved protocol currently requires 6 shots it has been suggested that data supporting this requirement is not conclusive and that protocol requirin g fewer shots could be approved the fda is currently reviewing development of new protocol13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30748crs5 13

the manufacturer the fda and dod maintain that in the twentynine years of administering the vaccine permanent or chronic adverse reaction has been reported14 although the anthrax vaccine has been in use since the 1970s there has been study conducted that actively followed the longterm medical conditions of those receiving the vaccine the fdas assertion that there have been longterm or chronic adverse health effects from the vaccine is based upon data received through the vaccine adverse events reporting system vaers this system relies upon physicia ns or patients taking the initiative to report effects believed to be caused by any vaccination because it is not system of active medical surveillance of those receiving vaccinations it has been criticized as underreporting adverse events particularly those could occur long after the vaccination and therefore not obviously connected it should be noted that there is distinction between an adverse event which is any medical event or condition that occurs after the vaccination and may or may not be associated with the vaccination and an adverse reaction which is medical event or condition that can be directly attributed to the vaccination from 1990 through september 2000 1561 adverse events associated with the anthrax vaccine have been reported to the fda through the vaers lower than average number of reports for vaccines according to the fda given that during this period 2 million doses of the vaccine were administered of the 1404 adverse events 76 were judged serious ie lifethreatening requiring hospitalization or resulting in permanent disability but diverse in nature with clear patterns emerging of the 76 reports 55 were judged to be reactions to the vaccination and all personnel have recovered and returned to duty the fda has testified that aside from injection site reactions eg swelling localized pain none of these eventscan be attributed to the vaccine with high level of confidence nor can contribu tion of the vaccine be entirely ruled out15 the fda has concluded that the reports on the anthrax vaccine received thus far do not raise any specific concerns about the safety of the vaccine16 army

employee prnewswire september 29 2000received the vaccinations and that they routinely undergo regular physical examinations which have detected long term medical effects17 number of service members testifying before the house government reform subcommittee on national security veterans affairs and international affairs maintain that military physicians have been reluctant to report their medical complaints through vaers because their symptoms do not conform to anticipated vaccine reactions consequently they maintain that there is filtering effect inhere nt in the vaers which would also contribute to underreporting they strongly believe that their ongoing medical conditions are direct result of their vaccinations and believe their cases should not be excluded from consideration of the vaccines safety18 some service personnel and members of the public have associated the anthrax vaccine with the controversy over illnesses experienced by veterans of the persian gulf war the independent presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses determined that evidence could be found connecting the vaccine with subsequent illnesses19 on september 28 2000 another issue arose when michigan county medical examiner told local newspaper that reaction to the anthrax vaccine had contributed to 61year old bioport employees death the pathologist who actually performed the autopsy disagreed with that assessment asser ting that the employee died of ventricular arrhythmia cardiac artery inflammation which could not be definitely linked to the vaccine both the fda and the department of defense have obtained copies of the autopsy report and will conduct independent investigations20 vaccine production and testing there have been some concerns raised about the vaccine production facility and the retesting of stockpiled vaccine the vaccine was originally manufactured by the michigan biologic products institute mbpi the only licensed manufacturer of human anthrax vaccine in the united states food and drug administration inspectors repeatedly cited this facility for quality control and recordkeeping deficiencies during 199397 with mbpi having failed to take corrective action the fda issued warning of license revocation in march 1997 the revocation however did not take place and the facility passed subsequent fda inspections in the spring 1998 the state of michigan sold mbpi to private corporation bioport inc the facility was then shut down for renovations partially funded by dod to increase its production capacity renovated from the ground up the new bioport facility underwent an initial fda inspection in november 1999 the fda found shortcomings in number of areas including deviation reporting fillinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30748crs7 21 zoon

and independent consultants are currently working with the fda to bring the facility into compliance fda officials have estimated that this will take until early or mid2001 in the interim bioport is manufacturing only test lots of vaccine this lack of production created vaccine shortage and forced dod to alter its policy of vaccinating all personnel deploying to korea and southwest asia now only those who will be deployed to those regions for more than 30 days will be vaccinated on this reduced schedule dod estimates there is sufficient stockpiled vaccine to last until march 2001 dod had expected that stockpiled vaccine that was being re tested by independent consultants and the fda to ensure its safety and potency would be sufficient to carry through bioports shutdown for renovations however the retesting is taking longer than expected and some vaccine lots have been rejected for lack of potency concerns about bioports financial stability also arose when the company in order to remain solvent required renegotiation of the vaccine procurement contract which raises the per dose price from 436 to 1064 raising the contract price from 257 million to 498 million including an 18 million advance payment the renegotiation was requested by bioport inc which maintained that the facilitys former financial sponsorship by the state of michigan led to an inaccurate initial estimate of production costs and without additional dod support the facility would have to close the army contract adjustment board approved the renegotiation on july 27 1999 these difficulties with the biopor t facility have led dod to explore ways to establish second production source the us pharmaceutical industry is being canvassed though the industry has shown little interest owing to the relative lack of profitability in an anthrax vaccine consequently dod will request funding in fy2002 for study to determine the advisability of building governmentowned contractoroperated goco facility22 neither option will however provide second production facility in the short term estimates range from 4 to 7 years to establish fully licensed functioning second facility depending on whether an existing plant is converted or new one built congressional action congress addressed the anthrax vaccination program in the dod fy2001 authorization act pl 106398 sec 217 218 751 requiring dod to provide
