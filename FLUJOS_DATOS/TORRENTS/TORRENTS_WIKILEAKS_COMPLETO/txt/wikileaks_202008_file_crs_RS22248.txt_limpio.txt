this report will be updated to reflect developments for review of other federal water assistance programs see crs report rl30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs following natural disasters and other calamities the immediate recovery tasks involve assistance for individual victims in addition communities also often face the necessity of repairing critical infrastructure systems that sustain essential services to the affected population among the most important of these are water infrastructure systems drinking water treatment and distribution systems that provide safe and healthy potable water as well as water supply needed for firefighting efforts sewage collection and congressional research service the library of congress crs2 treatment systems and water and flood control works to drain flood waters and repair levees and floodwalls this report describes several federal programs that can provide emergency assistance for needed activities so that communities are able to respond to disasters and restore drinking water wastewater and related facilities and services the most important of these is the public assistance program administered by the federal emergency management agency fema other programs of the us department of agriculture environmental protection agency and us army corps of engineers may also provide emergency assistance and are described below for information on corps activities related to new orleans levee and floodwall infrastructure see crs report rs22238 new orleans levees and floodwalls hurricane damage protection

stafford act are administered by fema state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations1 are eligible to receive public assistance program grants to repair replace or restore disasterdamaged publicly owned facilities wide range of activities are eligible for funding under this program including repair of water treatment and distribution systems sewage collection and treatment facilities power generation facilities and distribution lines water control facilities including drainage channels pumping facilities and emergency repair of levees2 roads and bridges and removal of debris to be eligible the work must be required as the result of disaster be located within the designated disaster areas and be the legal responsibility of an eligible applicant the statute states that the federal share shall not be less than 75 of the eligible cost of repair restoration reconstruction or replacement work that is eligible for federal disaster grant assistance is classified as either emergency work or permanent work under fema regulations 44 cfr 206204 emergency work involves work that must be done immediately to save lives and to protect property public health and safety or to avert or lessen the threat of major disaster emergency work generally lasts more than six months and includes such activities as debris removal and demolition of unsafe structures permanent work is intended to restore damaged facility to its predisaster design and must be completed within 18 months after an emergency is declared states may extend the deadlines for an additional six months for emergency work and an additional 30 months for permanent work work can range from minor repairs to replacement categories of permanent work include utility distribution systems such as water treatment and delivery systems sewage collection and treatment facilities and power generation facility and distribution lines 1 eligible private nonprofit organizations are those that provide critical services that are available to the general public critical services are defined to include power water sewer wastewater treatment communications and emergency medical care 42 usc 5172a3b 2 permanent repair of flood control works is the responsibility of the us army corps of engineers and the natural resources conservation services us department of agriculture crs3 congress appropriates funds annually to the disaster relief fund for this program and for other categories of aid authorized under the stafford act ie individual and household assistance and state hazard mitigation assistance to ensure that assistance is available when disasters occur in most years supplemental appropriations also have been made in response to specific natural disasters for fy2004 congress originally appropriated 18 billion and made supplemental appropriations of 2275 billion for fy2005 original appropriations were 2042 billion while supplemental appropriations reached

funding the 2002 farm bill farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 authorized 35 million per year through fy2007 for this program and made funding for it mandatory through reservation of 3 to 5 of appropriated water and waste disposal grant funds amounts provided through this program have been quite variable over time in fy2002 emergency grants totaling 296 million were made by rus to projects in six states in fy2003 166 million was distributed for 63 projects in 24 states and in fy2004 152 million was distributed for 64 projects in 21 states for fy2005 3 in the event of major disaster the stafford act also authorizes the president acting through fema to direct federal agencies with or without reimbursement to use their authorities and resources under federal law including personnel equipment supplies facilities and technical services in support of state and local assistance efforts 42 usc 5170 under this authority many agencies are providing wide range of assistance to areas affected by hurricane katrina including in the area of water supply for example the us navy and the bureau of reclamation department of the interior have sent to mississippi water purification units that can provide up to 200000 gallons of drinking water per day crs4 congress appropriated 229 million for emergency and imminent community water assistance grants statutory authority statutory authority for the emergency and imminent community water assistance program is the consolidated farm and rural development act as amended section 306a 7 usc 1926a for additional information on rus water programs see httpwwwusdagovruswaterindexhtm emergency watershed protection and restoration the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the usda administers several authorities for measures to prevent erosion and flood damages and to conserve develop and utilize land and water resources one of these is the emergency watershed protection ewp program which is used to restore the natural functions of watershed after natural disaster has occurred this program is designed to help people and conserve natural resources by relieving imminent hazards to life and property caused by floods fires windstorms and other natural occurrences it is an emergency recovery program ewp work is not limited to any one set of prescribed measures and can include httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22248 removing debris from stream channels road culverts and bridges reshaping and protecting eroded banks correcting damaged drainage facilities repairing levees and structures and purchasing floodplain easements all ewp work must reduce threats to life and property and must be economically environmentally and socially defensible and sound from technical standpoint nrcs makes casebycase investigations of the completed work ewp funds have number of significant restrictions for example ewp cannot solve problems that existed before the disaster or improve the level of protection above that which existed before disaster it cannot fund operation and maintenance work or repair private or public transportation facilities or utilities the work cannot be used to install measures not essential to the reduction of hazards in addition funds cannot be used to perform work on structures installed by another federal agency appropriations vary widely from year to year and activity levels can vary widely from year to year and place to place spending is dependent upon supplemental congressional appropriations and is usually made available in emergency supplemental legislation for example in fy2005 congress provided 250 million in pl 108324 emergency supplemental appropriations for fy2005 to repair damages to waterways and watersheds resulting from natural disasters with the largest amount 120 million going to florida to respond to damage caused there by hurricanes in 2004 in fy2004 congress provided 150 million for use in southern california for wildfire and tree mortality emergency according to usda over the past 10 years an average of 120 million per year has been appropriated for ewp work approximately twothirds of the events that trigger ewp assistance are local in nature and not presidentially declared disasters statutory authority the program is authorized by section 216 pl 81516 33 usc 701b1 and sections 403405 pl 95334 16 usc 22032205 for additional
