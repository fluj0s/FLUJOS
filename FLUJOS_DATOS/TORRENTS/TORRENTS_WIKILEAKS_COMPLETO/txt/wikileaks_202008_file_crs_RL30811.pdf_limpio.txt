meeting in june 2000 in the months immediatel following the summit the two koreas developed new dialogue which included several interminist erial talks meeting of defense ministers talks on economic cooperation and family reunions the sheer breadth and depth of the dialogue indicated to many analysts that seoul and pyongyang were trying in earnest to regularize and institutionalize the rapprochement in contrast to previously ephemeral thaws in 1972 1985 and the early 1990s there have been several setbacks however leading many critics to wonder whether north koreas diplomatic outreach is merely tactic to obtain economic assistance and reduce the us troop presence in south korea since february 2001 interkorean diplomacy has effectively been frozen with south korean president kim dae jung being openly labeled lame duck many have wondered whether his sunshine policy of engaging north korea has run out of steam due to the growing length of the chronology this

2000 and 2001 background the historic june 2000 summit on june 13 2000 south korean president kim dae jung flew to pyongyang for threeday summit with north koreas paramount leader kim jongil the meeting was the firstever between the leaders of north and south korea which have been divided since 1945 and officially at war since 19501 the two kims signed joint declaration pledging among other things to work towards eventual reunification open dialogue between government officials engage in economic cooperation permit family reunions and hold cultural and athletic exchanges upon his return to seoul kim dae jung stated that kim jong il had verbally agreed that even if northsouth tensions continued to be reduced us troops should remain in south korea to help preserve regional and peninsular stability it became clear the south korean president continued that we will not ever go to war again2 the ebb and flow of the new interkorean dialogue since the north south summit interkorean interchanges have alternated between bursts of meetings and lulls in public activity in the summer and fall of 2000 northsouth interchanges flowed as the two koreas rapidly developed new dialogue four rounds of inter ministerial talks were held the two countries defense ministers met for the first time talks on economic cooperation commenced the two sides marched together at the 2000 sydney olympics and emotional reunions were held among hundreds of families separated by the interkorean divide south korean president kim stated his desire to negotiate northsouth peace agreement which would officially end the korean war before he leaves office in february 2003 moreover numerous south korean businesses and citizens forged their own contacts with north korea development made possible when president kim under his socalled sunshine policy of trying to induce more cooperative behavior from north korea through engaging pyongyang relaxed seouls previous insistence that the government monopolize all contact with the north3 in october of 2000 north korea slowed the pace of the dialogue perhaps to focus on flurry of diplomatic activity with the outgoing clinton administration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30811crs2 4 aidan fostercarter will all things go well ups and downs in the new interkorean normality comparative connections 1st quarter 2001 available at

political steps if the north agrees to 1 start to take serious verifiable steps to reduce the conventional weapons threat to the south 2 improved implementation of the 94 framework and 3 verifiable constraints on north koreas missile exportsleading to the postponement and delay of scheduled family reunions and several meetings interkorean activity again picked up from november 2000 to january 2001 as the talks entered new phase ministeriallevel talks shifted from meeting approximatel every month to every quarter with more frequent workinglevel meetings expected to provide forward momentum4 kim jongils businessoriented trip to china combined with talk of new thinking in the staterun north korean press seemed to promise more breakthroughs in 2001 such hopes were frustrated in march of 2001 however as north korea abruptly halted virtually all interkorean contacts for nearly six months pyongyang linked the move to the bush administrations calls for stricter reciprocity in dealing with pyongyang however the interkorean dialogue had slowed even before the bush administration launched its review of us policy toward north korea process that was completed in june 20015 economic talks in late 2000 and early 2001 had hit snag over north koreas demand that the south provide 500000 kw of electricity immediately and 2 million kw soon thereafter although the two sides militaryto military talks in february produced an agreement on rules of operation for construction of railroad through the dmz north korea declined to sign and ratify the pact furthermore kim jongil made move to fulfill his promise of return summit visit to seoul the interkorean dialogue picked up again in september following kim jong ils trip to russia and chinese president jiang zemins visit to pyongyang the resumption was curtailed however by the changed international environment following the september 11 terrorist attacks against the us there were some signs that north korea would use the attacks as an opportunity to improve relations with the south and the us if only to extricate itself from the us list of terrorist sponsoring nations in addition to condemning the attacks pyongyang publicly rejected terrorism and the support of terrorist organizations signed two antiterrorism treaties and announced plans to sign five more however interkorean talks broke down completely in november 2001 due to pyongyangs objections to seouls heightened security posture to guard against terrorism and the norths demand that all future talks be held in the dprk rather than alternating between north and south for security reasons north koreas chronic fears of an american attack were further heightened in november by the bush administrations apparent expansion of the definition of terrorism to include the development of weapons of mass destruction wmd and by several administration officials references to the norths suspected wmd programs some have interpreted the north hardline stance as sign that hardliners in pyongyang have gained thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30811crs3 6 aidan fostercarter back on track comparative connections 3rd quarter 2001 available at httpwwwcsisorgpacforccejournalhtml 7

9 lee hoichangs speech to the american enterprise institute september 15 1999ascendancy6 kim dae jung and his cabinet have expressed pessimism about future talks being held or bearing much fruit coinciding with the slowdown in interkorean dialogue since the spring of 2001 there have been growing number of naval and border clashes between the two koreas and between north korea and japan some analysts interpret these incidents as signs that north korea is attempting to pressure its neighbors to be more forthcoming in bilateral talks and warn of additional provocations from the north in the future in the meantime while pyongyangs relations with seoul washington and tokyo have worsened over the past year north korea has renormalized relations with china and russia and has established relations with number of western european countries in an apparent attempt to diversify its diplomatic contacts civilian contacts continue despite the freeze in governmentto government talks northsouth links between groups and individuals have continued to expand this is marked contrast to earlier thaws in 1972 1985 and the early 1990s in which the governments monopolized crossborde r activity although south korean firms have made major direct investments in the north since the june 2000 summit number have taken tentative steps toward building an arms length presence in the north over one hundred fifty southern firms now manufacture goods in the north primarily on contract basis7 samsung has sought to take advantage of the norths interest in information technology by opening software center in beijing using north korean programmers and by applying to open an operation in pyongyang outside business circles grassroots interkorean civilian contacts also have continued to grow southern civic groups for instance donated approximately 73 billion won over 56 million at 1 1300 won in the first 11 months of 2001 compared with over 40 billion won over 30 million for all of 20008 criticism of the sunshine policy in south korea within south korea criticism of president kims sunshine policy particularly from the opposition grand national party gnp has mounted over the past year particularly as north korea put halt to the dialogue the tension peaked in august and september 2001 when controversial visit to pyongyang by south korean unification activists led to the forced resignation of the president kims unification minister the collapse of his ruling coalition and his partys loss of control over the national assembly the gnps concerns have been less over the logic of the policy the party generally has come to support some form of engagement with north korea than over its implementation9 the gnp leadership has charged president kim with failing to insist on reciprocity from pyongyang in exchange for seouls concessions and with ignoringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30811crs4 10 for instance hwang jang yop the highestranking north korean ever to defect to south korea has accused the south korean government of threatening to evict him from protected safe house in order to stop him from criticizing north korea and kim dae jungs sunshine policy see yonhap november 23 2000 and the moral cost of engagement far eastern economic review december 28 2000important issues such as confidencebuilding measures and the several hundred south korean pows and kidnaping victims said to remain in the north the gnp also has criticized kim for failing to adequately consult with the national assembly in which the gnp is the largest party and for trying to silence domestic criticism of north korea10 president kims domestic support has been further weakened by the widespread perception that he is lame duck by law south korean presidents can serve only one fiveyear term and jockeying has already begun for presidential elections in december 2002 the slowing of south koreas economy in 2001 has added weight to the gnps warnings that the government should avoid providing north korea with significant economic assistance after recording an 88 growth rate in 2000 the economy is expected to have grown by less than 3 in 2001 the slowdown also has accentuated the serious financial difficulties of the hyundai conglomerate particularly its north korean business ventures which have been the economic flagships of kim dae jungs sunshine policy interkorean trade in the first 11 months of 2001 fell 93 year on year to 363 million what are north koreas inten tions with the apparent and perhaps temporary collapse of kim dae jungs sunshine policy south koreas ability to take the initiative on peninsular matters is limited thus the future course of interkorean relations revolves to an even greater degree around north koreas intentions which remain opaque in the aftermath of the june 2000 summit many wondered whether pyongyangs diplomatic opening was sign that kim jongil had changed his stripes deciding to adopt more cooperative posture and possibly reform the faltering north korean economy others warned that the norths actions were merely tactics to obtain economic concessions from south korea and its allies thereby propping up north koreas economy rearming its deteriorating conventional military and preserving the power of its communist elite another possibility is that the north korean ruling elite is divided with some reformers favoring greater openness and other interests such as the korean peoples army opposing it in any event thus far north korea has largely succeeded in steering the northsouth dialogue toward discussions over economic assistance and away from discussions over military confidencebuilding measures and internal economic reforms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30811crs5 11 association of southeast
