r3mx part ii lecture given on 7 february 1963 okay here we go second lecture saint hill special briefing course 7 february ad 13 this briefer lecture this has to do exclusively now with the mechanics of 3mx what is 3mx and why its called x because its still experimental and therefore its designation is really routine 3m who can run it well anybody thats trained and qualified to run it and that takes up your classification this is routine 3 and routine 4 routine 3 process is run by class iii auditor who however must get his material checked out such as did the goal rocket read and so forth by class iv auditor now the probability is that great deal of listing under supervision of 3mx will occur and therefore we have to modify it and say that class ii auditor under the supervision of iii auditor with the essential points checked out by class iv can run 3mx this is very precise process and the main danger of all these processes is the gross auditing goof that is the main danger of any process this is quite remarkable the number of goofs that can be pulled in an auditing session like somebody is marking every time the needle twitches thats rock slam fall thats rock slam so forth that is just an asinine goof and if you and i were to get together and think of the number of goofs which we could think of working day and night for about thirty days we probably would not have begun to cover the goofs which can occur under the gross auditing error these things have to be seen to be believed and that is the basic foe of processing at large pc is never required to sit in the auditing chair you know everything is going along fine and youve got rses marked on the list and everything seems to be just fine except we find out that the auditor has never used an emeter and doesnt have one in the session honest honest theyou cant outguess what goofs can occur now what you have to do is be very sure that your supervision in an area is adequate and knowing that your technical people are anxious to pass on the information and to get people so that they really can audit and your next big hump is to make sure that bulletins which come in arent just read the last paragraph and put aside well i know that do you have bulletin soandso oh yes i have bulletin soandso they didnt addbut ive never read it youve got to have good bulletin checkout youve got to have tape listen and things of this character staff training and auditor training and so forth has got to be very good and very straight this is how you get along the around these goofs so in actual fact it isnt the complication of the process or the difficulties of the process which is our biggest foe but the relaying of the proper information with regard to the process that is the stumbling block now youll find perhaps theres some chap down in lower north southeast bulawayo or something of the sort who never never never hands out bulletin he just wont let anybody see bulletin but hands out gratuitous information from the bulletins he has never read now that kind of thing can occur therefore the liabilities of scientology are basically those of gross auditing errors which are just unimaginably godawful andor ridiculous and next to that actually is just study of the information and given those youve already got goodhearted willingness on the part of auditors never doubt that but given these other two items corrected why then you could have as complicated as process as you wanted to have now 212 210 apparently had tremendous number of rules they were just rules rules rules rules and never never never and all this kind of thing and so forth you notice those things are boiled down well now i havent sat down and given you long list of the exact codifications of these things but they start to become obvious to you as you look them over and you will shortly have very precise rundown of this material youve got lectures on it youve got lots of tapes on it most of this material isnot all of it is on tapes or in the last bulletin i handed out on it and weve got long way to go with this information because weve been waiting for thisfor this breakthrough all right theres breakthrough routine 3 fine some people went clear then theres this fact that this case and that case and the other case just didnt quite make it and they hung up in listing so there must be bugs on listing so i started to work on listing and worked on listing and ive been working on that for some little time actually you dont need too much new technology in order to find goal but the technology that was needed had to do with listing and in 212 and 210 working with those i found the answer to goals listing and goals listing becomes more precise and more exact than the goals listing of 212 and 210 or 212a there is much greater precision connected with listing on goal now lets take look at this 3mx and find out exactly what weve got i just remarked here give rocket reading reliable item and i can clear the pc just give one off this case that i can make rocket read and it is reliable item give that and somehow or another i will steer him right on down through by oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose on spiral staircase and after hes clear of his first goal we find out what it was thats remarkable but theres the look which youre taking right now so lets take look at what we have here then is not process which actually completely depends on finding the pcs goal more pertinently youve got to find rocket reading item well supposing somebody was busily listing 212a and found rocket reading item the lastthere were three rocket readsreading items occurred on the list and one of these still fires with rocket read the last one and just one and theres rs fires its just that rocket read fires now if the auditor knew that rocket read and it was checked out as rocket read the thing to do is to determine whether or not it is terminal or oppterm unload immediately from whatever other process one is doing and immediately go into 3mx just like that bang just shift gears right there at that point because youve got pearls on your hands man why bother with anything else because you can enter the spiral staircase of 3mx with any reliable item which rocket reads well thats good news whats the spiral staircase thats just oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose and when you go off the rails go back and find an item the pc didnt really like extend the list find another rocket reading item put it on the line plot as the consecutive one to the one you want and just go on oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose and youre just going right straight through the gpm youll get terrific relief and terrific knockout of masses and pressures and all this sort of thing when youre dealing with rocket reading items youre not dealing with the liabilitiesand if youre dealing with rocket reading items perfectly according to the rules of listing and nulling nowyoure not dealing with the liabilities that you are with rock slamming items rock slamming item is quite liability you can only go around it four times it leaves mass hanging it does this it does that oh yes its good processing but it is susceptible to error and it is susceptible to going off the rails not so not so with rocket reading you take an rsing item that goes off the rails rocket reading reliable item give that and i can keep it from going off the rails because it will go much more precisely the gpm is made up of greater level of precision of course than its locks its locks can be far more random thereforetherefore when you get right down to it here and look over the situation 3mx is actually easier to run than routine 212a you say well why not run it exclusively well you sometimes cant find the pcs goal or even really get him to take much of goals list and their goals list go into the thousands on some particular cases unless you take some relief off the bank so there is your purpose and function of 212a its just trying to unburden and relieve the bank now given the pcs goal which rocket reads or pcs goal which at sometime in the past was reliably observed to have rocket readi mean reliably observed to have rocket read class iv auditor saw itgiven that goal what do you do well that goal is terminal therefore you list it as terminal only on an oppose you must never represent rock slamming item you know that well that also applies to rocket reading items dont represent rocket reading item that tells you at once what was wrong with fourline listing that we were doing with goals earlier it is not as serious but it is the same order of magnitude to represent rocket reading item and on some of these cases they didnttheir goals listing didnt survive the represent of the rocketthe representing the rocket reading item who or what would have your goal all right thats representation of rocket reading item and so the individual didnt get down to cases on the thing and there it is now frankly it didnt mess up the case thats one thing you can be very happy about it might have eclipsed the goal so that you couldnt see it anymore and it didnt fire anymore but you take that goal and wording it in some way that the pc can answer who or what would the goal to catch catfish oppose and just list that one line powpowpowpowpow if that was the pcs goal youre going to get rocket reads and youre going to go right on down the line sometimes you wont get rocket reads but youre certainly going to get an rs and you follow right on through its the last rocket reading or the last rsing item that you get on that list thats the last rocket read or the last rs that you get on that list and thats all you do with goal you complete that list and that completes by the way under the same old rules that youve been doing with 212a youd better go beyond it about fifty just to make awful sure because its not going to mess up the pc to the degree that the items themselves will mess up the pc all right though youre sure youve got this now and this is good rs determine whether its terminal or an oppterm byask the pc which one of these lineswhich one of these questions turns on the most mass or feeling on you well we dont care what it is and the one that doesnt seem to produce any action on the pc and produces the most action on the meter is the right way to so you know now whether its terminal or an oppterm now when it comes to opposing this thing just make sure its right now you can test anything you can test anything with few items and if it tightens up the needle and doesnt give you much ta thats wrong way to thats the same way isnt it well you try not to test these things just make sure that when you start to list the needle gets looser not tighter and youve got it right way to for the oppose and you run right straight on down you get your last rocket reading or rock slamming item go twenty five beyond it when youve got twentyfive beyond it take your rocket readingtake your last rock slamming item on the list read it to the pc it wont fire take the next to the last rocket reading item read it to the pc it wont fire and if your list is complete if your list isnt complete theyll fire and then we take the last rocket reading item on the list we read it to the pc and it goes phew nice rocket readall right every time we read it theres tiger drill theres monkey business theres rudiments theres nothing you dont do anything you just do this you understand im getting impatient about that i swear to pete you know the most auditing that you can do on anybody the most auditing that you can do is just the auditing im talking about if pc arc breaks your list isnt complete i dont care what the pc thinks or anybody else the list isnt complete period now you can get an arc break out of pc by not finding any item on the list the probability is his item wasnt on the list you have to go back to the earlier trick i talked about where find something he wasnt quite satisfied with and continue that list to get the item if you cant complete the list youre working on but the point im making here is that arc breaks come from the item not being there now i suppose you could goof it up this way the auditorthis requires considerable amount of watchi better not go into that at the moment youve got to watch your emeter carefully ill just say that at that point what you do is just keep carrying this on this same rule same rule same rule same rule you find out if its term or oppterm you consider your first listing of it test listing if that tightens the needle get off of it and get the other way around and oppose it the other way to in other words and all right that loosens the needle so you keep on then and you keep record of your tone arm and your tone arm and your tone arm and your tone arm and you keep and record rocket reads and rs and whatever it is and you get down and finally you get your last rr or rs we dont care which it is youve got to go twentyfive items beyond that not twentyone or twenty nineteen or something like this youve got to 90 twentyfive beyond that you dont get in any rudiments you dont do anything just go twenty five beyond that when youve actually gone twentyfive beyond that providing the tone arm motion is out you see why you read your last rs if there is one and if there isnt one you reador if there is one you read your next to the last rocket reading item and then you read your last rocket reading item the last rocket reading item on the list is it that is it bang catfish bang catfish bang catfish bang rocket read every time you say dandy fine three cheers now supposing it didnt well thats time to go into fits thats time to say on this item has anything been suppressed on this item has anything been careful of on this item is there anything you have failed to reveal on this item is there anything been suggested eighteen hours later on this item has anything been blah anything blah blah blah you goofed man now how did you goof well actually the pc could have been thinking of one item while he said another item so you read the one above and the one just below it and see if they rocket read neither one of them rocket read all right thats your first prevention your next prevention on the thing is that you didnt see the rocket read read that last one again the last rocket reading item read it again still doesnt fire take your pencil in hand take your ballpoint between the thumb and forefinger and say to the pc who or what would catfish oppose and the pc says oh my god more of those and you say well all right whats the matter and hes pulling in mass its killing and so forth well just give ajust give few all right so he gives you few and you watch that needle and that needle is going tight tight well dont list the poor guy into the ground it aint there well if the auditors very green i think i would then start nulling from the last rocket reading item on down to the end of the list i think id actually do that thats only thirty or forty or fifty items at the absolute outside dont you see theres reason to go earlier than that because if you saw rocket read on the list there is rocket read earlier you saw rocket read on the list and it doesnt fire theres rocket read earlier on the list thats going to fire now how about this it might be earlier on the list well let tell you if its earlier on the list youve goofed somewhere it almost isnt worth finding its got to be the last rocket read on the list you understand that means an earlier list was incomplete now id say if the auditor was awful green id ask him to null on down from that last rocket read just read each one off once and see if those rocket read he might not have been watching now the point is as you write rocket read is much more rapid and much less persistent than rock slam and you are liable to miss it and green green green auditor certainly will miss some of these rocket reads in other words he was watching the chandelier when he should have been watching his emeter now you cant get around that but i hope that someday we will have an emeter improvement that will actually throw reflection of the emeter needle on as shadow or something onto the paper the auditor is writing on and maybe by prism or something of the sort that could be effected that would be very desirable but nevertheless you can do it this other way lot of your writing ought to be done without looking at the paper and that needle should never be out of the corner of your eye in other words as you look at the paper even if you look up at the pc that meter dial must be in your field of vision so you see that thing flick you can see it flick if it flicks thats the main prevention for this other thing happening when an auditor has little experience on this line hed never null on down from the last rocket reading item if he didnt find one hed always pull this trick hed say to the pc hed say now pc ive got several items here and take breaktake break here i want to talk this over with you ive got several items here and which one of these things didnt you think fitted very well oh the pc says eggs god iiiim thinking now i dont know how you got eggs on the list you know because itit just doesnt oppose the empire state building and you dont remind him because an auditors always tactful that should be part of the auditors code he doesnt say but at the time you said you knew exactly how it opposed the empire state building you dont do that thatswe leave that for the psychiatrist when we get him into that position he says he doesnt think that does so therefore you take whatever eggs came off of which was who or what would oppose the empire state building and the item you got was eggs well he doesnt like eggs so you add to that now dont be so alarmed as you might be if you didnt know this fact theres going to be tone arm action now you tell why theres going to be tone arm action weve loosened up the bank of course and youre going to get tone arm action and by extending that list twentyfive or thirty youre going to get another rocket read take that as your item dont keep badgering the pc bring that item down to the list and now terminal oppterm whatever it is and just carry on with your oppose oppose oppose in other words you can get back on this spiral staircase even when youre hanging over the well in the middle of the stairs you dont want to get off of that spiral staircase so dont goof under these rules if only by goofing on these rules can you get in trouble its matter of you find out for sure if its terminal or oppterm if youre not absolutely sure you determine it by what youre listing is not tightening the needle in the first few items then you keep on going you list all the tone arm action out of it when the tone arm action longer is showing on the thing from that point on you are counting items and then if an rr or an rs shows up after that tone arm action has ceased and that tone arm action does not include surges cognition surges in other words thinks that are registered on the thing you couldnt follow them with tone arm anyhow i dont know how this theory got in that theres such thing as motionless tone arm because there is and you get this down the line 40 40 40 40 40 its 40 all of sudden pow youve got rocket reading item bang that thing goes just like that pow you write it down rr and you keep going for little while and the pc says hows it going and you say its going all right i need twenty more items well all right and you notice now and youll seeif you watch that needleyoull see your needle start to tighten well that means youre not going to get any more on the list but you go ahead and put those twenty items down and then you take the last rs if there is one and whether there is or not the next to the last rr and you read those to the pc you tell him what they are not that theyre his item and then you take the last rocket reading item you read it to the pc its going to fire and you say thats your item promptly and immediately yes that rocket reads thats beautiful all right and dont do something else keep your eye on the pc dont go off and do something else keep your eye on the pc when you say that last item to the pc dont shift the pcs attention now why dont you read the pcs item first and then read the one above it well because when you read that item that is the pcs item to the pcsee you can determine now which one is the pcs itemand when you read that to the pc his attention fixes on it and it is very confusing and upsetting to him to have his attention now fixed on some corny item that isnt his you understand that so you dont shift the pcs attention after you have read to him and found the rocket reading item you dont do it thats misdemeanor of the first water so therefore any tests youre going to make are made before you do anything with that anything you are going to do here do it before that is the thing do it before now when you read the item keep your eye on the pc dont talk dont write up auditors reports and dont expect him to tell you the story of his life particularly hell give you cognition hell say thats it and so forth in rocket reading itemshes liable to cognite for half an hour on an r212a item but not on anot necessarily on rocket reading item at all hell give you pow thats it weve hadbeen watching this out in the z unit now and pow pc says thats it and the auditor says but he never cognited he just said it was his item and that was fine well the idiot what more do you want the pc says its his item and of course he knows what it is well but the auditor was expecting cognition now today the pcswastes half an hour of session cogniting well the auditor i suppose is very happy about that because its always better easier to listen to the pc than audit but youits the uncertainty factor youre looking for and the darkening of the pcs eye pouches and so forth that youre looking for you say this item catfish and the pc says lets see catfish catfish uhhhhh whatwhat whats it supposed to oppose well its supposed to oppose eggs eggs catfish hm well i guess i yeah iiyou could sayyou could say that well were going to list little bit further the auditor says right about that point i mean thats all it takes all right did his eye pouches darken and emeter again did the tone arm fall down when you said that item catfish to him the moment before it was at 40 you say catfish and it goes phew 325 if that doesnt happen you havent got the pcs item youve goofed thats just the open and shut of it i havent seen it yet where you had on any of these itemswhere you didnt get blowdown when you said them to the pc thats enough cognition for you thats mass blowing off like mad you say to him catfish and it was 40 and it remains 40 the pc will also say well i catfish put that on the list catfish thats funny thing i dont quite know whether that will oppose lets see catfish two catfishes say i guess so well if you say its the item i guess it is see that will accompany stuck up ta your ta wont blow down you goofed list probably incomplete now whator gross auditing error the auditor didnt know you were supposed to look at the emeter get the read off of it thetherell be something wrong if youif you keep getting things wrong with 3mx theres something awful wrong and its not good enough for you to be sitting around at desk looking at folders you go out and take look at the pc and the auditor in action and youll find the pc hangs by his heels from the ledge of the building blowing smoke rings so the auditor can be sure that he is now able to confront space and thats the direction they are auditing or you will find out some other damn thing that the emeter hasnt had its battery working in it for the last month youll find something goofy that you just never think of and its ive seen aive seen student here now go weeks and weeks and weeks that nobody could get anything on and they had to do new lists and nobody could get anything on and they had to do new lists nobody could get anything on they had to do new lists and we find out that the auditor didnt know the difference between dirty needle fall and an rs and so everything was an rs and so the guys lists all looked like the rs was increasing throughout you see how that would be so where yourewith this gross auditing error dont takedont take for an answer because listen to now depend on in this instance youll find 3mx and 212a work by the rules of listing and if they dont work by the rules of listing theres something wrong and if theres something wrong youve got to straighten it out youve got to go maybe earlier to better source item youve got to do something earlier now heres another rule if the pc arc breaks go earlier dont ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever start new action you hear that never never that is the most serious error you can do dont ever start new action on pc that is arc broke dont ever start new one we had somebody around here that was starting new one every time the pc sneezed oh well the pc didnt have any action here didnt have any action he wasnt getting anyplace with this list so we started to list who or what does existence consist of well he didnt get anyplace with who or what does existence consist of so we started to list who or what are you in contact with in church but that didnt work out very well so then we thought of new list and so oh bunk man arc breakearlier always go back from an arc break you understand thats one of the basic fundamental stable data you have pc arc breaks pc nattery pc feeling sad pc misemotional not about his items hell say oh poor little boy yes thats very sad item isnt it joe that isnt what were talking about were talking about oh i feel so sad sitting here being audited i wish youd never started to audit in the first place were talking about misemotion about the auditing session were talking about the pc going splat on the subject of auditing were talking about this in other words misemotional arc break go earlier the error is always earlier you understand now when we say earlier howwhat earlier do we want five minutes ten minutes an hour two hours sometimes the last session more rarely actually never session long time ago pcs dont arc break on last months session they forget those but if you keep going and inventing new things the pc never has chance to recover from the arc break because its all arc break now because nobody went that few minutes earlier to find out that hatrack wasnt her item the auditor said hatrack there was rs gross auditing error pc was so pleased with the item at the time that the auditor said well all right im sorry but i let her have it oh yes that happened it happened right here unbelievable if an item doesnt fire it isnt the pcs item thats all i dont care if the pc cognites pcs are liable to cognite on anything did you ever realize that theyre all the pcs items i know look over one of your own lists someday and realize that youve had leaning toward every one of those terminals theyre all the pcs items so sure the pc will cognite on these you didnt see an rs it isnt the pcs item thats all period and yet you can goof with magnitude by yeah well it didnt rs but i didnt really have rocket read on it you know the pc would have been so upset if id said it wasnt his item funny part of it is if youd been watching the pc very carefully and he had dark shadows under his eyes if youd been watching him very very carefully this would have taken place he says billing joe thats my item oh yes yes oh man thats my item thats beautiful item oh i love that item i just love that item thats just marvelous you know ive always beenive always been joey billings ever since i can remember you know you watch him note carefully the pouches under his eyes and the color of his complexion note it carefully and then say to him im sorry but that is not your item and watch his face go lighter in other words when he tries to sell you an item and you buy it you make him worse every time so you go by the rules and you go by nothing but the rules and if the rules dont fit in 3mxthere is more flexibility in 212abut when they dont fit in 3mx boy youre not there you cant even say whats wrong because we havent now defined list as complete or incomplete weve defined list as something which twenty five the last twentyfive items had motionless tone arm and there were twentyfive items after the last rs or rr and that is complete list now that doesnt tell you that anything else is complete list does it that the rr that on that listthat is the last rr on the list is the pcs item thats that if that isnt it then its not the pcs goal the auditor has goofed god knows what has happened but it is wrong and the error is earlier the error is never later thats something that you really must learn its just earlier the error always is the pc just had been given an item dogs breakfast and he had this item dogs breakfast and the pc sat there and he said dogs breakfast yeah thats my item he was propitiative that day yeah i see dogs breakfast thats good item fine fine dogs breakfast and you list dogs breakfast it fired you list the thing and it didnt go anyplace and its just solid rr the whole way everything is an rr and then all of sudden there arent any rrs you say what on earth is this all about this looks different than all the rest of the lists yeah of course its different than all the rest of the lists theres something wrong with dogs breakfast well youve got to go back and correct dogs breakfast if you really want this straightened out you now got to go back and correct dogs breakfast theres something wrong with the item and you will find out that youve hit once in the blue moon situation that item twentysix rocket read the twentysixth you just stopped one short once in blue moon itll vary to that degree but the error is always earlier this is quite interesting pcs go on hard sell but the auditor who thinks the pc knows is goofy and the auditor who thinks the pc has nothing to tell him is also goofy its what has the pc got to tell the auditor well the pc can tell the auditor how he feels about things and he can tell the auditor this and he can tell the auditor that and these are all quite valid but the pc says well actually the whole trouble with this package the whole trouble with this package the real trouble with the package is your earliest list there on the package who or what would oppose wheaties that earliest list ithats wrong thats wrong and all the items since are all wrong and then you put down five more items on the list youre completing the pcs rs goes on that list thats it its very funny five minutes later why hes forgotten that he told you that he was going to scrap all of his items its very funny you dont take the pcs advice on what to do in other words you take the pcs advice on how he feels about things but you dont take the pcs advice on remedy because hes more likely to be dramatizing his remedy than otherwise he cant think clearly on the subject of his own case you can usually think far more clearly than the pc on the subject of his own case that also occasionally has modifications theresthat isnt always completely true as witness many instances sometimes the pc knows very well whats wrong pc has been sitting there saying well i waswe cant list it this way thats all and the auditor keeps on listing it that way and the pc says it cant be listed that way all of sudden the auditor says well all right ill try it the other way and he tries it the other way and its right this does happen now 3mx goes on and on and on and on and on on the spiral staircase oppose oppose oppose oppose oppose as long as you can stay on it youll probably find out that youll run out the whole central core of the goal and that simple prepcheck on the goal puts you in position now to find the next goal and thats all there is to 3mx you dont have to do any more than that you always prepcheck goal before you leave it and make sure that it isnt reading and make sure that it isnt reading because its been squashed you dont want goal not reading because its squashed so anyway make long story short the guts of 3mx is listing because you can do it without goal see the guts is listing do without goal you can go all the way without goal i think thats quite fascinating but thats only in theory in actual fact although there are prehav methods particularly with roll your own prehav where he could probably turn up rocket reading item without the pcs goal you will find that the easy way to do it is to find the pcs goal now how do you find the pcs goal well just the way weve always been finding the waythe pcs goal you could takedo you realize you can take any firm oppterm which is still reading on routine 212 and get out of that by listing list 1 and list 6 of old 3ga criss cross on that oppterm you can usually turn up with the pcs goal itll usually be goal number 1 of list 6 i mean its easy as thatfinding pcs goal therethe best method of finding pcs goal is the first method which is you list goals thats the best method why well weve got several cases around here that had an awful time with goals and theyve had terrible time with goals and weve turned them loose on listing goals and we are absolutely fascinated we are getting tone arm action on the goals list the like of which you never heard of the rule is list the tone arm action out of the goals list i dont care how long that goals list has to be to get the tone arm action out of it somebody said here today oh well i have twenty pages you mean i have to go on look twenty pages is goals list ive seen goals list of hundred pages how do you like that so you just list all the ta action out of the goals list oh i remember there was another question on ta motion if you had some twoway comm with the pc and the tone arm went down and then you returned him to the list and the tone arm went back up again to where it had been before was that tone arm action well tone arm action is caused by fixation of attention to the pc and if you change hischange his attention and you put his attention on something else youre going to have that youre going to have tone arm action arent you well you put it back on the list its the same thing isnt it i mean youve got to go youve got to ask better questions than this if you expect some idiotic answers now the best way to get goal in actualitybecause youre going to have too much trouble as long as the goals list is chargedis just to sit there and list goals now in 3mx it is preferred and youll find out its much better indeed to list goals on meter and you sit there and list goals on the meter looking for the rrs and you mark them down rr you dont drill the goal pc says thats my goal and he screams and beats the floor with his fist and so forth you go on listing goals because the ta action isnt out yet you say ive taken good note of that ive marked down the fact that it rocket read well come back to that as soon as we have finished your goals list okay and the pc says okay its not his goal anyway here we go on down to the end all the ta action is out of the goals list we now go back and take those we have noted rocket read and we test those things out to see if they still rocket read actually the lastif it followed the rules of 212awhich it probably will not because its too general question you see its source list and therefore the thing can appear on it anyplaceif it followed the exact rules it would be the last rocket reading goal on the list would be the pcs goal i think that will have some priority it will be more often that goal than other times but it could also be any of the other rocket reading goals now you dont go into five or six weeks of prepchecking and that sort of thing to make goals read or not read just go over those goals and read them to see if they rocket read the main goal may be rocket reading like mad therell be one of those goals you cant really get rid of the rocket read this is finding goal without prepcheck you just read it once rocket read you read it again didnt rocket read you read it again didnt rocket read you read it again did rocket read hey get alert all right read it again didnt rocket read read it again didnt rocket read now youve got lot of suppresses off of the thing and anxiety fails to revealin other words you tiger drill it little bitby golly you read it pow it rocket read then it didnt rocket read you know thats really enough to run 3mx with you cant get rid of the rocket read now any goal that isnt the pcs goal the rocket reads arent that solid or arent that good and thats worth knowing now if anybody has ever seen somebodys goal rocket read rocket read rocket read and now it doesnt rocket read and you cant get peep out of it if you can get reliable evidence that it did rocket read or if you can get sixtyfourth of an inch rocket read out of goal that was found year and half ago my god that goal will survive almost anything wont it well list it that isnt an invitation to list wrong goal im telling you that right goal has tremendous reluctance to give up its rocket read in fact you can always uncover bit of rocket read on the thing again if you plug at it of course it may even only rocket read once what do you think of the strength of goal that you rocketit rocket read twice when it was found was prepchecked and was found to rocket read again and you year later take this goal prepcheck it and get one rocket read out of it what do you think about that well look if it wasnt his goal it wont thats only true of the pcs goal that the rocket reads can be recovered and that are persistent and will continue to rocket read on locks on that they go off pow gone so it rocket read you read it again half rocket read you read it again doesnt rocket read you prepcheck it you never get rocket read out of it again it just never yeeps you can take it year later and it still doesnt rocket read anymore but real goal its very spotty it rocket reads and then it doesnt rocket read and it does and six months later you take the same goal and you drill it for little while and you can get rocket read out of it must be the pcs goal then you just list that down the line according to the rules of 212a and take the last rs or the last rr on that goal oppose what is the goal oppose list and youre going to have your entrance into the gpm and after that the pc is going to go giddily right on down the spiral staircase providing you follow these rules of listing just as ive been giving them to you in this lecture the variability of 3mx is much less than that of 212a how do you repair 3mx well its too soon to tell its too soon to tell i dont know what errors are going to be goofed on 3mx but remember this if you will simply audit and not make whole bunch of goofs you dont have anything to patch up and therefore you dont have to patch up anything now theres the secret of auditing audit well enough and accurately enough so that you dont make goof you have to patch up because the case condition deteriorates from the first goof that you have to patch up thats where the case condition starts going down now you get this goof and then you get another goof and then you get another goof and then you patch up those goofs and then you goof again and you patch up that goof and then you patch up the goofs and then you patch up patchingup the goofs and by that time theres room for auditing the way to do auditing is just sail in and do it right now theres few changes on 3mx in model session which are as follows you put in the life and livingness goals before you put in the session goals reverse that around and you ask the pc at the end of session for his goals and gains before havingness and you also after youve got hisif he made any of his goals and gains you ask him if theres anything hed care to say before you end off the body of the session in other words push the goals and gains over into the body of the session end off the body of the session when you do then check the pcs havingness run few little taps of havingness just to exteriorize him into the room and simply say all right here it is end of session and if you carry on session like that youll find you exteriorize the pc out of the session very easily as far as pcs carrying around items between sessions and pcs missing items and pcs suppressing items i dont interfere with the pc unless he stops listing i only straighten out those things which get in the road of the pcs progress thats the only thing ill ever straighten out in session anymore its actually he cant list so i will straighten it out ill get off the suppresses and the invalidates and halfway through my doing so he starts listing again and so he sails i cant get the pc to hear the auditing question at the beginning of session i just cant get him to hear it so i run some general ow because he seems terribly agitated dont you see and at the moment he can hear the auditing question and can answer it im auditing right straight on down the line bangetybang now what you want to do is become very accomplished auditor not sloppy auditor the better the auditor the less he has to patch up the perfect auditor never has to use any of the tools of auditing somebody sits down he knowsthe pc knows hes insession this is very interesting the upshot of auditing is getting something done if you get the things done which you should in an auditing session the pc will just walk forward with sevenleague boot strides all the way the less you interfere with the pc thinkingness and the less you distract him from the job of listing and the job of cogniting and so on why the less tools you have to use and its the mark of very bad auditor that he has to use the auditing tools all the time that is the mark of poor auditor now it goes worse than this if an auditor is obsessively continuously and insistently forever and aye butting into the session to straighten it out he hasnt got any session to straighten it out why is he trying the whole secret of auditing is getting auditing done now when you see green auditor start doing 3mx or 212a youll find out that they have to patch everything together and they have to do everything and do everything and do everything in order to get around to doing some 212a they may do that the first session the second session the third session the fourth session if they are capable of observation if they are capable of being good auditor youre going to find something new is going to occur that session by session they start dropping the tools of auditing they start dropping these things and theyre doing less and less monkey business and more and more auditing and finally when they are very confident of their routine 2 or routine 3 and theyre very confident of these things why they have dropped the use of auditing tools to practically minimum they see that the pc is bit fogged in and the second that pc looks alooks little bit dopey they know thats going to stop their tone arm action and itll give them false flat list well it isnt that the pc cant list its the fact that the tone arm wont register on dopedoff pc so right away pull the missed withholds pull the missed withholds pull the missed withholds soon as they are pulled the pc is bright alert and wideawake the auditor is off of that he isnt pulling missed withholds as profession hes pulling missed withholds just to brighten that pc up and get that pc up there so he can get any residual tone arm action going these are the tools of auditing and how they are used when an auditor is auditing like that hes getting something done and he doesnt have trouble with the pc he doesnt have arc breaks the first thing to know how to do however is the routine 3 and the routine 2 youto make these conditions obtain in session you have to know your routine 2 and routine 3 perfectly and have good confidence in it and actually to get to point where you could have good confidence in it and perfectly your auditing has to be very nearly perfect so theretheres where the thing adds up youve got situation here where you have terrifically workable processes if they are done and thats the one thing you must keep in mind any of you who are ever supervising auditors and so forth that they are not going to be done in the presence of gross auditing errors such as you cant audit pc who stays home gross auditing error well we didnt make much gains in that twentyfivehour intensive guess 212 doesnt work say you didnt make much gains what did you do well i dont know just 212 212 thats what i did well if you just let it pass at that youd say well 212 doesnt work or something like that make little bit of further inquiry and you find out the pc was only there for two hours of the first session of the first day and was home the rest of the week doesnt sound like 212 doesnt work it sounds like the auditor never got the pc into the auditing chair never got him into the session never had him at the session it wasnt case of being insession the pc never arrived in the same building as the session you get the idea you say well theyre you will encounter auditors like this theyll make gross auditing error theyre very green and so forth but they dont recognize these things are that gross and the other thing is is you cannot expect somebody to follow technique or follow procedure who doesnt know what the procedure is therefore you have systems of checkout you have systems of training you have systems of observation and you keep somebody under supervision until they get good win all training of auditors has certain liabilities you get people in the road and things in the road and cases in the road and all that sort of thing but it can be done and i think youll find out that 3mx done as it can be done with maximum of purity and snap and polish and right on the groove as ive been telling you in this lecture tonight i think its going to produce you some clears and i think its going to produce clears with far greater rapidity than you ever thought was possible so theres what weve been aiming for and there it is so okay and thank you very much good night
