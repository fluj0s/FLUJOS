small wit h only three low value subagreements in 2004 short visit to the largest implementing partner confirmed adequate record keeping and only minor issue on completing the final spmr was discussed and properly dealt with some fifty years ago unhcr provided housing loans totalling some us 74 million to building societies and individual refugees for the construction of some 4000 housing units for refugees as of december 2004 the outstanding loan balances amounted to some us 690000 and the last repayment will not be due unti l 2017 as the responsibility for the loan recoveries was transferred

safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit focused on 2003 and 2004 programm activities under project abgrfls400 with expenditure of some us 500000 our review concentrated on the activities performed at the representation in berli n and at the liaison office in nurnberg short visit was paid to local implementing partne r we also reviewed activities self implemented by the representation mainly public in formation activities with expenditure of us 170000 6 the audit reviewed the

18000 0 and current value of some us 30000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in germany was 12 under the staffing table two parttimers worked on durab solutions mainly for afghanis and iraqis paid from temporary funds from unhcr caswan ame and one person who 2 assisted occasionally with meeting individual asylu m seekers was paid on hourly basis 7 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records in berlin nurnberg and at headquarters iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 8 the unhcr programme in germany is rather sm all implementing one project ababgrfls400 main activities related to prote ction and public information of which some us 120000 was spent in 2004 under selfimple mentation us 54000 euro 43000 was implemented under subagreement with bundesf achverband umf bumf 9 short visit was paid to the bumf office i n nurnberg which started working with unhcr in 2004 to assist children and adolescents bumf activities under the unhcr sub project were also funded by various other agencies confirmation of an adequate accounting system and general internal controls was obtained t hrough an interview with the director of bumf and by browsing through vouchers and financial reports the accounts were maintained by an accounting firm and audited by an audit firm 10 our review assessed the arrangements as ad equate except that the final spmr included not only unhcr funds but also all the fund s that bumf had received for these refugee related activities totalling some euro 127 000 oios recommended that bumf should adjust the final 2004 spmr to limit the repo rting to the use of unhcr funds only the representation has informed oios that an update d spmr has been submitted for reporting exclusively on unhcr funds b housing loans 11 between 1955 and 1967 interestfree housi ng loans totalling some dm 30 million us 74 million were granted from and unhcr fu nds for the construction of some 4000 housing units for refugees these loans were granted mainly to housingbuilding societies but also to individual refugees as th repayment periods were set for 50 years most of these loans are still partially outstanding as at 31 december 2004 about 550000 us 690000 was still outstanding for collection and the last repayments will not become due until 2017 12 some years ago the responsibility for the loans was transferred from the unhcr representation in germany to the treasury section t headquarters therefore only limited information was available at the representation on the loans such as initial granting conditions and subsequent collection management as well as the level of compliance with any statutory requirements associated with the loan s 13 initially the unhcr representation in ger many managed the loans and the repayments with the assistance of four agencies in different locations in west germany berlin nurnberg bonn and stuttgart later the agencies took full responsibility for the collection of repayments on behalf of unhcr once year they reported the refunds to 3 unhcr treasury section copy to the representation and made corresponding payments into bank account under the responsibility of unh cr headquarters 14 various concerns and questions came up after this initial review that need to be considered for example the status of the loans i s reported in note 12 to the unhcr financial statements and will continue until 2017 however there has been independent confirmation nor audited statements to confirm the correctness of the remaining loan balances 15 according to the loan conditions the hous ing units were to be used exclusively by refugees one of the agencies explained that as th loans were subject to local government registration along with the properties the require ment for refugee occupation was considered mandatory for the initial 50 years even if the loa ns were paid up before the final due date however it was not possible to confirm that the co nditions initially set for granting the loans were still honoured further it was unclear wheth er the requirement for refugee occupation would end upon the full repayment of the loans 16 the agencies retained 125 per cent fees f rom the regular collection and 3 per cent of the loan balance if they were paid up before final due date oios noted that the agency in nurnberg was one of the main borrowers itself ther efore the question arises whether the 125 per cent collection fee should apply if the agency is collecting funds from itself recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in germany should gather detailed information of the loan conditions and the ir legal status under local housing legislation in case re fugees could still benefit from this housing assistance in futur feasible management arrangement needs to be put in place r ec 01 the representation has already planned visits to th agencies managing the loans to assess the present situation on collections and the number and other details of the still outstanding loans mission report expected towards the end of third quarter 2005 should be shared with treasury section oios expects such report to h ighlight details on the present situation of the loans and to consider if any future benefits ca n be expected from the housing units for refugee assistance in germany c refugee statistics 17 for years government statistics on refuge and asylum seekers showed their numbers as having been well over one million by december 2003 it had fallen to some 900000 by end april 2005 updated figures were not yet availa ble for 2004 as result unhcr planning figures for 2006 had to be based on 2003 d ata also various details on the figures were not available at the representation for confi rming the actual number the unhcr mandated refugees and asylum seekers in germany 18 the largest group listed with the governme nt refugee statistics was 416000 defacto refugees or asylum seekers who were allowed to sta temporary in germany without being granted refugee status the representation estimat ed that about half of them could fall under its mandate it was not known how many persons fro m various old caseloads were still listed there for instance whether any refugees who had b enefited from the housing loans some 50 4 years ago were still included or how many persons from countries that had recently joined the eu were still included in the refugee statistic s 19 oios understands that the government autho rity in charge of the refugee statistics is updating their systems and more detailed informatio n may be available in future by obtaining more information on the refugee figures unhcr should be able to focus its work more on any needs with vulnerable groups recommendations head2right the unhcr representation in germany should endeavou r to gather more details from the government on the r efugee population in order to determine more accurately th groups and individuals under unhcrs mandate rec 02 the representative stated that this matter has been of concern to unhcr and the government the german authority in charge of comp iling and maintaining such refugees statistics has confirmed that comprehensive revie w of the system is being performed it may however take up to two years but significant changes are expected in the numbers the representation will inform oios as soon as updated information is made available d private sector fund raising 20 unhcr signed recently an mou with deutsche stiftung fur unofluchtlingshilfe dsuf for fund raising activities in germany all income at dsuf is used for refugee related matters of which unhcr hq received about t wothirds amounting to some us 15 million in 2004 direct mailing appeals turned out to be the most effective approach in germany special events generated much less income however even the least profitable ones could be considered as having raised public awarene ss the representation worked closely with dsuf and unhcr staff member was on its manag ement board oios has audit comments on this area security and safety 21 general review of the security and safe ty matters at the representation in berlin did not reveal any particular concerns in addition to general reception for the building on the ground floor twodoor security entrance limits the access to the office area on the 2nd floor the liaison office in nurnberg is located w ithin government building which is very well protected 22 oios suggested however that the represen tation in berlin consider installing protective film on windows preferably at the front of the building facing the road which would reduce the scattering of glass in case of any incidents the representation agreed and has started preparations for cost estimates and obt aining the landlords approval f administration 23 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in berlin complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w the representation in berlin covered 5 most of the administrative and financial needs of t he liaison office in nurnberg which operated on petty cash basis following are desc riptions of some of the issues that were discussed 24 asset management needed some improvement some data entries to assettrak needed to be completed and the inventory lists for new purchases such as computer equipment in 2004 needed to be updated also the disposal process for items longer needed many of them at the liaison office had yet to be completed oios was satisfied that steps were being taken to deal with these matters 25 the 2004 performance appraisal reports pa r for three staff members had not been completed at the time of the audit oios also note d some delay in setting the 2005 objectives the representation explained that the remaining 200 4 pars were being finalized for the setting of the 2005 objectives an office re treat was being organized for harmonizing them for all staff along the goals for the 2006 cou ntry operational plan which was only completed towards end of march 2005 since the performance period is based on the calendar year the 2005 objective setting in german will be very close to the midterm review this may diminish the value of the midter m review 26 suggestion from oios to prepare and keep updated travel plans for the office was well received and acted upon some financial and ac counting issues were discussed with the adminfinance assistant and oios is satisfied with the actions taken such issues related to providing more complete information on hospitality claims and that the representative should not certify or approve payments for himself v acknowledgement 27 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and
