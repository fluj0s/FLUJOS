restrictedchapter 1 overview information operations background introduction 11 information underpins all operational and management functions and capabilities within the defence organisations it is fundamental resource critical in commanders decisionmaking processes increasingly military decisionmaking is becoming dependent on information systems is 1 for moving sorting manipulating and exploiting available information with the spread of communication systems information is also attaining national and global dimension exploitation of this dependence on information as critical component of commanders decisionmaking processes is achieved through concept called information operations io 12 io like ther forms of military operations are activities that are planned and executed can be conducted in phases can involve direct and indirect approaches require resources utilise capabilities to greater or lesser degrees depending upon the particular operation and require doctrine and training io would normally be used in concert with combat operations and military support operations but can also standalone national threat 13 io presents particular challenges to the military due to the wider range of potential protagonists that can be involved the low entry costs associated with the conduct of basic io multiplies the threat and offers range of non stateactors new avenues to conduct business such actors include issue motivated groups imgs non government organisations and disgruntled individuals additionally the lack of strategic intelligence against some of these potential actors and reduced warning time of likely activities complicates the defensive task 14 therefore offensive io activit against australia must be seen as significant national threat such activity involves shaping national perceptions through manipulation of information disrupting daily activities of national life through interference with national information infrastructure as well as attacking nations capacity to wage war 15 io threats are not easily discernible or characterised intelligence therefore is critical in determining intent and capability and for the successful exploitation of the io concept detailed intelligence on decisionmakers and their supporting decisionmaking processes for wide range of adversaries must be provided the global nature of the information age makes this challenging task understanding io definition io are defined as actions taken to defend and enhance ones own information information processes and information systems and to affect adversary information information processes and information systems 16 io brings together wide range of related activities focussed on or related to information there is by means broad consensus either within the australian defence organisation ado or external to it as to what exactly constitutes io consequently io may be portrayed as range of interrelationships at all levels figure 1 represents this from defence centric perspective at the national level depicting io as the overlap of military operations is relevant friendly information on those systems and intelligence

within national construct the io focus 17 the time taken to make decisions is being compressed with an everincreasing challenge or drive to remain ahead of an adversarys decisionmaking processes commanders use of and dependence upon information is not new what is new however is the concept that information can be more easily managed distributed and manipulated through modern technology and perhaps even be considered weapon in its own right the aim is to speed up our own ability to observe orient decide and act while slowing down disrupting or destroying the adversarys ability to carry

outcome of decision superiority io can be considered to have three components offensive io offensive io are actions synergised with wider activities and plans designed to exploit or attack information information processes and information systems in order to undermine decisionmaking processes offensive io include the use of such capabilities as electronic warfare ew psychological operations psyops

military objectives b defensive io defensive io are processes synergised with wider activities and plans designed to ensure friendly information information processes and information systems are protected from malicious activity an adversarys use of offensive io or from accidental and naturally occurring acts ado decisionmaking processes must be robust enough to ensure the successful achievement of designated objectives defensive io include the use of such capabilities as information assurance ia counterintelligence physical security operations security electronic warfare counter psychological operations and other conventional military capabilities as appropriate non military capabilities may also be applied to support military defensive activities c io support support io are activities and processes common to both offensive and defensive io or are not exclusively assignable to either they specifically enable and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of offensive and defensive io io support activities are fundamental to the ability to conduct both offensive and defensive io efficiently io support includes intelligence public information civil affairs the management and command and control of io information and knowledge management risk and vulnerability analysis support network mapping support and io training support io support activities and processes can be generally divided into infrastructure and intelligence support as follows 1 infrastructure support just as other military operations employ range of capabilities such as ships aircraft and ground forces io require certain capabilities to be in place if commanders are to be able to plan and initiate action these collective capabilities can be referred to as the io infrastructure it includes organisations hardware and software policies and doctrine and trained people furthermore io employ range of less tangible information capabilities such as public information psyops and deception to influence decisionmaking at the highest level of the io infrastructure are those io processes that enable commanders to employ the io infrastructure in flexible ways to achieve objectives 2 intelligence similarly intelligence activities provide critical support function to the conduct and planning of io the nature of operating in the information age is such that the intelligence must be timely readily accessible accurate and sufficiently detailed to support an array of io concept requirements regardless of the level at which io are conducted io principles general 19 the principles for the conduct of io are people decisionmaking processes and information systems are susceptible to io b io must be conducted within national framework designed for io c io are an integral part of national military strategy d io must be centrally directed at the highest level and coordinated in execution io may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other military operations f comprehensive understanding of the environment in which io are to be conducted is critical to the successful planning and conduct of io and g moral ethical and legal considerations will influence the conduct of iorestricted iospm restrictedsusceptibility to io 110 io offers suite of activities both offensive and defensive relating to the use and manipulation of information across the conflict continuum it involves activities ranging from technological to psychological united by common objective the psychological element includes aspects such as psyops deception and other methods of shaping perceptions while the technological element involves the manipulation of electronic information 111 people decisionmaking p rocesses and information systems are susceptible to io the adf must therefore be prepared to conduct io across the psychological and technological domains national framework for io 112 io is national issue requiring coordinated approach although th lines of distinction are blurred in places io has civilian and military dimension therefore combination of military and civilian capabilities may be required for the execution of io io as part of national military strategy 113 the globalisat ion of information and is have eroded traditional state boundaries determined and knowledgeable adversary is able to strike at national information infrastructure such as strategic military command and control nodes electricity grids air traffic control systems and communications infrastructure without recourse to the application of conventional force this approach would undermine the effective functioning of government as degradation of this infrastructure could have significant ramifications for range of vital national and commercial activities 114 early identification of critical elements with respect to io targets will be essential to enable successful offensive and defensive io the geostrategic advantages enjoyed by some nations have been reduced in the information age the method of delivery of some information attacks creates an advantage of distance only for the attacker who remains harder to detect and take action against 115 io provides potential adversary greater flexibility in gaining leverage by attacking nations interests both onshore and offshore the ability to attack economic assets companies diplomatic missions and nationals in less threatening way than conventional force makes clear policy response by the targeted nation more complex direction and coordination 116 io must be centrally directed at the highest level to ensure integration of available capabilities some of which may be resident in number of programs within the ado in addition agencies from outside of the ado may also be required to support military io activities to ensure that there is economy of effort io must be coordinated in coherent manner with clearly defined division of responsibility between programs io and conventional operations 117 information has always been dimension of war in the information age however it has the potential to become major theatre of conflict much like air land and sea and it has the potential to be weapon in its own right aspects of io offer the potential to minimise and in certain circumstances may eliminate the need for conventional military force io can make an important contribution to defusing crises it can reduce periods of confrontation and enhance the impact of informational diplomatic economic and military efforts io can forestall or eliminate the need to employ forces in combat situation understanding the environment 118 comprehensive understanding of the environment is critical to the successful planning and conduct of io regardless of the level it is vital therefore that the adf is supported by comprehensive system involving information collection processing and dissemination capability which supports the planning and conduct of io such capability builds situational awareness in terms of knowledge on the adversary the environment and friendly factors that impact on the conduct of iorestricted iospm restrictedmoral ethical and legal considerations 119 understanding the legal and ethical issues involved in the conduct of io will be essenti for commanders at all levels as general proposition conventional attacks against is such as the destruction of an adversarys military computer centre can be dealt with using traditional principles of the law of armed conflict loac including military necessity proportionality and collateral damage on the other hand the phenomenon of information attacks using nontraditional information weapons or techniques does not fit easily within the loac framework the danger is that while some states or individuals will be restrained by moral ethical or legal considerations others will not this reinforces the need to concentrate on establishing strong defensive regime the adf must be prepared to conduct io within an ambiguous legal framework responsibilities 120 the current policy responsibilities for io related activities are spread throughout the following organisations adhq responsible for strategic level information concepts and strategies responsible for the provision of strategic policy plans and priorities to guide the development of io and responsible for the achievement of national strategic requirements for military io depsec corporate responsible for overall effectiveness and efficiency of defence information management defence information environment board dieb directs the development

procedures for the implementation of io in the australian theatre io concepts planning and activity there are two ways to view io first as conceptual framework within operations planning which induces staff effort focussed on influencing decision cycles secondrestricted iospm restrictedis those operations or activities undertaken to meet the objectives arising from this staff effort 2 io concept in planning 121 io is considered to be conceptual approach to mili tary planning and operations including their support functions rather than new area of military specialisation io at the operational and tactical levels is the responsibility of operations staff assisted by other functional groups planning staff will also need to consider io as part of future operations preferably dedicated staff meets the io responsibility within headquarters where otherwise constrained this responsibility may also be met by command direction an awareness of io or the establishment of an io group or board the manner by which the io planning function is met must be appropriate to the headquarters and ensure that io are considered and integrated with the plan 122 io objective the objective of io within the adf is to contribute to the achievement of military objectives by promoting and protecting adf decisionmaking and exploiting and influencing adversary decisionmaking 123 io focus through io the adf seeks to enable decision superiority and promote freedom of action for adf decisionmaking processes while hindering the efforts of adversaries io seeks to exploit the opportunities and vulnerabilities inherent in the decision making process and information dependent systems this includes people infrastructure weapons command and control computers and associated network systems io seeks to impair or distort the decisionmaking abilities of an adversarys leadership structure and to influence the belief or perceptions of nations people the focus is therefore on the psychology of perception and leadership and the ability of the commanders and managers to provide effective leadership and management 124 coordinated and integrated strategy adf io policies and plans are to be integrated within the overall military strategies and objectives to achieve coherent effect io requires the close coordination of both offensive and defensive capabilities and activities as well as effective design integration and interaction of command and control with intelligence and other support mechanisms 125 conduct of io levels of command io like other forms of military operations are activities that are planned and executed can be conducted in phases can involve direct and indirect approaches require resources utilise capabilities to greater or lesser degrees depending upon the particular operation and require doctrine and training io may be conducted at all levels and throughout the continuum of conflict figures 3 and 4 describe this relationship 2 this includes the approach to military operations taken to disrupt or inhibit an adversarys ability to command and control his forces while protecting and enhancing our own in the past this has been referred to as command and control

national strategic level io at the strategic level will be directed by government to achieve national objectives by influencing or affecting elements of an adversarys national power political economic military or societal the ultimate strategic objective for io is to affect strategic decisionmakers to the degree that any adversary will cease actions that threaten australian interests 127 io at the military strategic level for adf purposes io at the military strategic level are conducted in support of national io objectives the focus will be on the information related aspects of strategic military leadership lines of communications command and control processes logistics and other critical strategic level processes designed to sustain military capability 128 io at the operational level io may be conducted at the operational level to support military objectives within particular theatre of operations and would normally be carried out with theatre resources the focus at this level will be on the information related aspects of lines of communications within the theatre logistics leadership will to prosecute operations command and control processes and infrastructure and information sources 129 io at the tactical level io at the tactical level will be conducted to achieve specific manoeuvre objectives activity will only be conducted under theatre guidance the focus in this instance will be on information related to tactical leadership command and control processes directly related to the conduct of specific military operations and military information processing equipment io as an activity 130 io is conducted through the integration of many activities these are oft delineated by the offensive or defensive outcomes required the activities that support the components of io are listedrestricted iospm restrictedbelow while activities are shown as an element of offence defence or support this does not necessarily mean they remain wholly within io the majority of these elements exist in their own right and contribute to other military operations and business processes in much the same way as they do to io io seek to harmonise the activities to achieve the greatest offensive and defensive contribution to commanders objectives 131 offensive io the activities which support offensive io are electronic attack electronic attack ea is that component of electronic warfare ew that uses electromagnetic or directed energy to attack personnel facilities or equipment with the intent of degrading neutralising or destroying adversary combat capability it is addressed further in adfp 24 electronic warfare and includes the following 1 actions taken to prevent or reduce the adversary s effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum such as jamming and electromagnetic deception where 2 electronic jamming is deliberate radiation reradiation or reflection of electromagnetic energy used with the object of impairing the effectiveness of electronic devices equipment or systems being used by an adversary and 3 electronic deception is deliberate radiation alteration reradiation absorption or reflection of electromagnetic energy in manner intended to confuse distract or seduce an enemy or that adversarys electronic systems 4 employment of weapons that use either electromagnetic or directed energy as their primary destructive mechanism such as lasers radio frequency weapons and particle beams electronic neutralisation is the deliberate use of electromagnetic energy to damage either temporarily or permanently adversary devices that rely exclusively on the electromagnetic spectrum b psychological operation s psychological operations psyops are are planned activities in peace and war directed to adversary friendly and neutral audiences in order to influence attitudes and behaviour affecting the achievement of political and military objectives the objective of adf psychological operations is to cause adversary friendly and neutral personnel to act favourably toward australia and its allies psyops is described in detail in adfp 25 psychological operations and the categories of psyops are 1 psychological action the planned use of support activities to reduce an adversarys prestige and influence and to increase friendly influence and attitudes in potentially hostile or neutral countries 2 psychological consolidation those activities designed to foster the establishment or maintenance of order and security and gaining the support of local population in order to advance political and military objectives 3 psychological warfare efforts designed to bring psychological pressure to bear on an enemy and to influence attitudes and behaviour of hostile groups and target audiences in areas under enemy control c deception see chapter 7 deception includes those measures designed to mislead the adversary or target by manipulation distortion or falsification of evidence to induce the target to react in manner prejudicial to his interests and to the benefit of friendly interests thus deception seeks to influence the mind of the adversary commander and the requirement for deception is derived from desire for security or need to achieve surprise 1 security security is function of command and includes all those measures taken by command to protect itself from espionage observation sabotagerestricted iospm restrictedannoyance and surprise security denies information to an adversary and retains for the commander the ability to employ his forces more effectively deception may be required to assist in the protection of capability and intent from an adversarys collection system 2 surpris the ultimate objective of deception is the achievement of surprise it is not essential that an adversary be taken unaware but only that he becomes aware too late to react effectively if commander is to achieve surprise he must plan to fulfil two requirements conceal the true security and reveal the false deception d destruction destruction or physical destruction refers to the process and activity involved in the development and selection of target sets for degradation neutralisation or destruction through physical attack by overt covert or clandestine military force such attacks are conducted in accordance with commanders guidance and planning objectives computer network attack computer network attack cna involves the deliberate attack on adversary computer information systems cis through the medium of that systems own components these components may include inputs outputs software hardware links connections or personnel cna is thus related to but can act distinctly from ea such attacks occur in variety of forms including 1 hacking hacking involves the illegal entry of system usually for one of two reasons malicious destruction or degradation of key nodes or b curiousity 2 chipping chipping is malicious hardware attack usually conducted through the deliberate insertion of hardware that is designed to fail on initiated sequence or at selected time 3 inside r insiders add personnel risk to cis security they may be transient or permanent they may be malicious or sources of information 132 defensive io the activities which support defensive io are electronic protection electronic protection ep involves action taken to protect personnel facilities or equipment from the effects of friendly or adversary employment of ea ep can be either technical or procedural technical ep is applied at the equipmentsystem level and is based on technology procedural ep is concerned with the manner in which ew is conducted and includes techniques such as information security infosec and emission control emcon information security includes computer security compusec and electromagnetic security emsec emsec is further divided into communications security comsec and electronic security elsec emcon procedures are implemented to protect essential elements of friendly information eefi further details are available in adfp 24 electronic warfare b counter psyops counter psyops seeks to counter adversary propaganda defensive counterpropaganda shield audiences

counterintelligence counterintelligence ci is that aspect of intelligence devoted to destroying the effectiveness of foreign intelligence activities and protecting information individuals installations equipment records and materiel from espionage sabotage subversion and terrorism cl has both staff component and an operator activity component but unlike intelligence it is not normally referred to as the product of analysis the term security intelligence is used to designate intelligence product from cl related agencies on threats to security intelligence seeks to support the planning and conduct of operations by providing the commander and staff knowledge and understanding of the threat and environment within this function cl seeks to prevent the adversarys intelligence system from achieving the same objective and to stop potential and real adversaries undermining the security of friendly forces ci is discussed further in adfp 19 intelligenc d opsec operations security opsec is the process which gives military operation or exercise appropriate security using passive or active means to deny knowledge of the dispositions capabilities and intentions of friendly forces it is command function that involves those collective measures taken by the operational force to maintain security from generally overt and clandestine intelligence collection it is therefore controlled and coordinated by operations staff with input from ci and other staffs opsec depends on an understanding of the adversarys ability to collect information the way information is processed and the decisionaction cycle that results from it opsec is covered in more detail in chapter 6 protective security protective security is the organised system of defensive measures instituted and maintained at all levels of command with the aim of achieving and maintaining security protective security measures consist of controls which form series of interlocking defences in depth against the threat the protective security measures imposed by the adf are detailed in security orders and instructions these are designed to protect information material and personnel from the threat and comprise 1 physical security the system of physical controls through which access to information and material is restricted to authorised persons 2 personnel security the process of personnel investigation and categorisation designed to ensure that person is allowed access to classified information or material if there are known objections to them from the point of view of integrity or loyalty f information assurance information assurance ia is the protection of information and information systems by ensuring their confidentiality integrity availability authentication and nonrepudiation this includes providing for the restoration of information systems by incorporating protection detection and reaction capabilitiesrestricted iospm restricted133 io support the

information pi is information that is released or published for the primary purpose of keeping the public fully informed thereby gaining their understanding and support in time of tension and conflict the maintenance of australian domestic support and an understanding of adf operations are of great importance to the maintenance of the national effort should the australian public lose confidence in the ability of the adf to bring conflict to successful conclusion restraints may be placed on the government and the adf in low level conflict the results of loss of public confidence could include an unwillingness on the part of the civilian population to continue to deny the adversary achieving its aims withdrawal of active support to authorities and perception by the international community of the political weakening of australian resolve c civil affairs civil affairs ca describes the broad range of actions conducted to establish maintain influence or exploit relations between the military civil authorities and the civilian population in order to assist military operation they include the provision of support to the civil administration and civil military operations d io command and control and management supporting io is the level of education in io and io planning the command and control mechanisms available to assist in the synchronisation and deconfliction of io activity and the availability of tools to assist in the planning of io information and knowledge management the efficiency of information management systems on headquarters plus the way in which knowledge is held and circulated impacts directly on decision systems f analysis support the availability and competency of integral and external specialist analytical support for the risk and vulnerability analysis

activities and plans designed to ensure friendly information information processes and information systems are protected from an adversarys use of offensive io or from accidental and naturally

while denying adversaries the opportunity to exploit friendly information and information systems for their own purposes defensive io include the use of such capabilities as information assurance ia counterintelligence ci physical security operations security opsec electronic warfare ew counter psychological operations psyops and other conventional military capabilities as appropriate non military capabilities may also be applied to support military defensive activities 22 national threat io presents particular challenges to the military due to the wider range of potential protagonists that can be involved the lowentry costs to conduct basic io multiplies the threat and offers range of nonstate actors including issue motivated groups imgs non government organisations and disgruntled individuals new avenues to conduct their business additionally the lack of strategic intelligence against some of these potential actors and reduced warning time of likely activities complicates the defensive task defensive io principles 23 the following are the principles for defensive io defensive io measures must permit command to continue to operate successfully while under attack from an adversarys use of offensive io b defensive io involves measures and processes to counter the susceptibility of decisionmaking processes and information systems to offensive io c defensive io must be

planning and coordinating strategies tactics and actions to protect friendly data information information systems and associated processes infrastructures and key decision makers from structured or unstructured attacks by adversaries and to protect against naturally occurring acts these attacks may be based on physical electronic logical3 and psychological methods inherent in defensive io

information systems and associated processes and infrastructures from natural accidental and deliberate attacks and to maintain stated levels of confidentiality integrity and availability integrity of the system includes concepts of authentication and nonrepudiation protection of information aspect includes not only information but information processes and information systems and includes the ability to react and restore information flows in event of loss of assurance defensive io and the defence information environment 27 defensive io seeks to protect the defence information environment die for successful defensive io it is important that commanders have clear understanding of the dies components structures relationships processes and capabilities the adf must have comprehensive understanding of the normal state of the die know when and why change is occurring within the die and identify the cause 28 figure 1 illustrates the defensive io process and shows i ts continuous nature the process recognises the need in the first instance to deter attacks against the die and to establish mechanism to protect the information environment should deterrence fail b that there are vulnerabilities in and threats t infrastructure systems processes and procedures there is need therefore to apply risk assessment and risk management to provide appropriate defensive measures based upon the impact on the operation or business functions at risk c the need to d evelop measures and capabilities such as ia physical and personnel security deception ci counter psyops electronic

defensive io process relies on establishing normal or steady die state from which to operate in this state capabilities defensive processes and procedures would be routine implemented such that they are managed as daytoday activity this normal state would be monitored for indications of significant change by appropriate management mechanisms and organisations responsible for information security and intelligence functions reports and advice will be provided to operations staff personnel responsible for io management within strategic command division for appropriate action 211 thresholds of triggers and known atta ck signatures are established to indicate when the attacks or disruptions might be such that they are likely to impact on defence operations and business and where additional measures and activities might have to be implemented the strapp process is followed from this point relations with other organisations 212 there are number of organisations within defence which have responsibility for the protection of the die the operations communications and information systems intelligence and security communities all contribute to defensive io defences defensive io process will therefore seek to synergise all of their functions to ensure the most effective sustainable and efficient yet affordable solutions are developed for defensive io as the defence information infrastructure dii is in part dependent upon the national information infrastructure nii there is need to protect at least selected parts of the nii 213 elements of the nii that enable the dii are identified and as far as possible monitored and protected defences role in protecting these aspects of the nii must be determined and in the absence of legal clarity appropriate directives acquired from executive government likewise both defence and nondefence including government federal and state and civilcommercial information sources on which defence decision making and critical business processes rely must be identified monitored and protected executive government will direct defences role in this process there are number of agencies both within and external to defence which have an influence on or will be influenced by the defensive io relationships as shown in figure 3 academia adhqfederal government other government organisationsallies other coalition partners industry commerceother defence programs state government hqast ngoslaw enforcement figure 3 defensive io relationships defensive io conceptsrestricted iospm restricteddefensive io strategy 214 managing the risk associated with defending against offensive io attacks including physical electronic psychological and logical attacks is complex and demands increased central coordination further it may not be possible to defend all information information systems and information processes and at the same time retain the functionality required to conduct operations commander must manage rather than avoid risk accepting that some capability loss will exist for realistic defences 215 informati on information systems and information processes will be protected relative to the value of the information they contain and the risk and likely impact associated with their compromise or loss similarly key decisionmakers will be protected relative to their importance to the decision making process and information infrastructure will be protected relative to its criticality hence it will be necessary to identify each commands activities and processes which require protection the key decisionmakers within these processes and the information information flows information systems information processes and information infrastructure upon which they rely defensive io priority 216 the initiative is always with offensive io due to the minimal entry costs available to potential attackers against distributed autonomous soft information targets the anonymity afforded by the accessibility to and ubiquity of potential targets also gives the attacker decided advantage offensive io attacks by their nature can be implemented at electronic scales and speeds and offer any potential attacker high payoff relative to the investment in the offensive capability 217 people will always be source of weakness in any security system therefore defensive io must address the long term yet enduring pervasiveness of global communications reaching into every household with the potential opportunity for adversaries to shape perceptions anonymously and perhaps even subconsciously the simplest of such threats can be manifest in the electronic and logical threat freely supported in the public domain and on the world wide web defensive io processes and procedures must incorporate methodology to account for this potentially open information environment 218 io attacks therefore are not limited to times of rising tensions or conflict consequently and unlike direct physical or conventional attacks defensive io must be conducted continuously in time and across all phases of the conflict spectrum in peacetime periods of rising tensions war post conflict restoration and rebuilding planning 219 general defensive io cannot be segregated from operations planning defensive io forms part of commanders intent and is integrated into planning execution and monitoring of all plans and operations operations plans require commanders direction on the priority of systems to protect vital assets key personnel perception management strategies priorities for intelligence and information requirements and those essential elements of friendly information eefi to be specifically protected from adversary collection 220 perception management component defensive io has its own objectives and can impact significantly on military outcomes by protecting against adversary targeting and contributing to own targeting processes against the beliefs cognitive and decision making processes of adversary leadership decision makers militaries and populations the perception component of offensive io targets fears prejudices superstitions beliefs and cultural behaviour patterns therefore the effectiveness of psychological components of defensive io requires knowledge of these beliefs fears and superstitions as well as knowledge of the media radio television press leaflets internet etc through which these ideas can be influenced threats 221 know the threat io threats are not easily discernible or characterised intelligence therefore is critical in determining intent and capability and for the successful exploitation of the io concept detailed intelligence on decisionmakers and their supporting decision making processes forrestricted iospm restricteda wide range of adversaries must be provided offensive io attacks may be remotely initiated and effected at electronic speeds and the resultant damage is subtle defensive io must anticipate and expect such attacks defensive io processes and procedures must allow commander to either retain the initiative and control or to restore the situation as soon as possible depending upon the circumstances there may even be need to conceal the degree of effectiveness of any adversary offensive io activity 222 clandestine threats the difficulty in establishing effective io measures is that offensive io is often concealed clandestine attacks where the nature of the activity is concealed exploit the intangibility of human decisionmaking and reasoning processes and of supporting information and information processes there will often be little physical damage or visible cues to initiate decisive action to defend or isolate systems personnel or processes 223 covert threats many io attacks will also be conducted covertly often even if targeting becomes apparent the sponsor and aim of the attack remains hidden damage if detected will appear attributable to accident misjudgment bad luck third party or other cause hence efforts to damage copy tamper with or alter information and information processes may not be placed in wider context thus the extent of damage will not be known until too late when synchronised attacks occur with other overt and wider efforts components of defensive io plans 224 defensive io preparedness components of effective defensive io preparedness are normalcy assessments

activities and plans designed to exploit or attack information and information systems in order to undermine decision making processes they are conducted to exploit or attack an adversarys decisionmaking processes to prevent adversary commanders from making accurate and timely decisions offensive io involves the integrated use of assigned and supporting capabilities and activities mutually supported by intelligence to affect adversary decisionmakers and achieve or promote specific objectives offensive io include the use of such capabilities as electronic warfare ew psychological warfare psyops deception computer network attack cna destruction and other conventional military capabilities as appropriate io support 32 fundamental to being able to conduct offensive io is io support these include but are not restricted to intelligence including signals intelligence and its electronic support component public information pi psychological action information management situational awareness and command control communications and intelligence systems infrastructure personnel must also receive training and be competent in planning offensive io and in recognising offensive io opportunities io and the indirect approach 33 io like other forms of military operations are activities that are planned and executed can be conducted in phases can involve direct and indirect approaches require resources utilise capabilities to greater or lesser degrees depending upon the particular operation and require doctrine and training means available for offensive io general 34 weapon can be described as an instrument that has desired effect on target this required effect may be physical or intangible and the weapons which achieve it may be lethal or non lethal including delivered munitions b special purpose weapons such as immobilising agents c electromagnetic impulses d propaganda deceptive information and f disabling technologies for example computer viruses 35 combinations offensive io will seek to use any weapon or combination of weapons the key component is the effect desired determination of the means is then related to the nature of the target the level of the effect desired and the time for the effect to occur for example to achieve psychological effect the same message may be sent by leaflet radio emission physical attack manoeuvre or combinations of any such mediumrestricted iospm restrictedlethal weapons 36 genera l lethal weapons achieve their effects through such readily identifiable mechanisms as blast penetration fragmentation cratering or fire the often brutal nature of lethal weapons should not negate their use in an indirect approach to undermining an adversary target system 37 airdelivered weapons guided weapons laser infrared or electrooptical hardened target penetrating weapons sea and land mines free fall weapons often known as dumb bombs area denial weapons often termed cluster bombs and antiradiation missiles are all examples of air delivered weapons each of these weapon types produces different effects which can be modified by factors such as fuze delays impact velocities and angles and the hardening characteristics of the target 38 land based fire and manoeuvre land based fire and manoeuvre can incorporate all the arms and supporting arms in targeting role the characteristics of land based weapons enable force to occupy threaten harass and neutralise land targets landbased commanders reserve force can also be manoeuvred to strike to achieve an operational level effect at designated time and place in order to strike in the deep penetration by land forces must be achieved by manoeuvre amphibious assault or airborne operation 39 naval targeting naval surface fire support includes those weapon systems that can be employed in support of operations ashore such as guns or missiles also naval assets can be used to target key maritime assets choke points or sea lanes through surface manoeuvre sub surface strike or harassment and mine warfare mining achieves its objectives by making an area unsafe for the passage of enemy forces it is the minefield therefore that should be regarded as the weapon rather than the individual mine 310 special operations special forces sf can be used independently or in conjunction with conventional force application options the ability of sf to operate in the deep battlespace particularly denied areas allows teams to directly attack targets or provide support to air land and sea attacks the ability for sf to conduct sabotage selective killing and io targeting requires specialist advice from special operations components or special operations planning teams nonlethal weapons 311 nonlethal weapon s tactical nonlethal personal weapons such as immobilising agents blinding lasers rubber bullets and so on are not normally considered as part of io the use of large scale immobilising agents and electromagnetic pulse and burst weapons are sensitive and beyond the scope of this publication however if available for employment they would be required to meet the terms of targeting doctrine in adfp 23 targeting perception

approach to military planning and operations including their support functions rather than new area of military specialisation io at the operational and tactical levels is the responsibility of operations staff assisted by other functional groups planning staff will also need to consider io as part of future operations within joint headquarters dedicated staff preferably has the io responsibility where otherwise constrained this responsibility may also be met by command direction an awareness of io or the establishment of an io group or board the manner by which the io planning function is met must be appropriate to the headquarters and such that io are considered and integrated with the plan 42 io objective the objective of io within the adf is to contribute to the achievement of military objectives by promoting and protecting adf decision making and exploiting and influencing adversary decision making 43 io focus through io the adf seeks to enable decision superiority and promote freedom of action for adf decision making processes while hindering the efforts of adversaries io seeks to exploit the opportunities and vulnerabilities inherent in the decision making process and information dependent systems this includes people infrastructure weapons command and control computers and associated network systems 44 io seeks to i mpair or distort the decisionmaking abilities of an adversarys leadership structure and to influence the belief or perceptions of nations people the focus is therefore on the psychology of perception and leadership and the ability of the commanders and managers to provide effective leadership and management 45 coordinated and integrated strategy adf io policies and plans are to be integrated within overall military strategies and objectives to achieve coherent effect io requires the close co ordination of both offensive and defensive capabilities and activities as well as effective design integration and

military appreciation process 47 effective decision making must take account of all aspects of operational planning this includes deliberate planning prior to operations contingency planning responsive and quick planning during operations and the concurrent planning of future operations the joint military appreciation process jmap addresses planning before and after the start of operations jmap provides clear methods for concurrent and responsive planning for ongoing and future operations and for crisis situations the process enables the commander to select courses of action with an understanding of the associated risks the jmap consists of four consecutive steps with an integral and continuous part known as joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace jipb the four steps of the jmap and their relationship with the jipb process are shown at figure 1 jipb mission analysis step 2 course of action development course of action analysis step 4 decision executionmodified coascomds guidance step 1 step 3 figure 2 jmap showing the link with jipb 48 io planning is integral to the jmap process io brings to course of action coa development range of activities that can be synergised within the traditional manoeuvre of major force elements to achieve decisive points it is not separate planning activity nor can io be considered as separate manoeuvre element force element or battle operating system jipb and io 49 overview the jipb process requires thorough study of the total operating environment including political and social influences and their cumulative effects on possible coa and friendly forces it requires detailed analysis of the full range of possible threats including an adversarys likely coa jipb recognises the uncertainty of conflict and allows assumptions to be made to keep the planning process active it focuses informationgathering sources on validating those assumptions and possible threat coa as early as possible hence jipb will provide the critical vulnerability analysis of the adversary and the environment that can be exploited through offensive io it will also provide basis for understanding own vulnerabilities through assessing what friendly critical vulnerabilities the adversary is likely to target hence it will be fundamental to defensive io full detail on intelligence support to io is available in adfp 19 intelligenc erestricted iospm restricted410 determining equity intelligence staffs assist the planning of io as part of their wider support to the operations planning process central part of this support is providing analysis of the objectives andor endstates stakeholders desire these objectives or endstates may be grouped on matrix as displayed at annex at the strategic level this grouping may occur in terms of politics economics military and social matters in joint operations the grouping may be related more to military characteristics of the environment such as manoeuvre objectives sustainment local support command intelligence communications and so on intelligence staff will also provide detail on stakeholder capacity to conduct or sustain information operations this analysis may be divided into offensive and defensive capability andor actual and potential capability it may also be used to address vulnerabilities of the friendly force to offensive io 411 steering collection in turn the intelligence process will receive direction from io planning in the preconflict period this will require the development of substantial databases of value to io planners including such aspects as biographical data psychological operations studies infrastructure and communications data and capability studies subsequently during conflict planning gaps in intelligence relating to io will be identified during jipb and throughout the continuum of planning and conducting io significantly steering the intelligence system to collect on assessed measures of effectiveness moe of io efforts is of paramount importance to this process see chapter 5 mission analysis equity comparison 412 comparing equity from the jipb stakeholder analysis the io planner can compare the relationship between stakeholders to ascertain where mutual benefit occurs where conflicting aims occur and where aims are relatively neutral to each other this process is illustrated at annex relative to the friendly mission analysis the io planner can then indicate one of the following where mutual benefit or support occurs whether this should be enhanced neutralised or made to conflict b where conflicting aims occur whether this should be promoted or neutralised c where neutral or ambivalent aims occur whether conflict stasis or support should be engendered 413 mission analysis the review of the situation from the io perspective will provide the basis of advice on the types of io objectives to be included in mission analysis and commanders guidance the io planners involvement in mission analysis is to provide io input on situation b assumptions c mission d tasks 1 specified 2 implied and 3 essential limitations f planning considerations commanders guidance 414 commanders are central to the operations planning process an d their guidance on io will include an assessment of how the commander views friendly and adversary vulnerabilities this may translate into priority of critical vulnerabilities cv and priorities of effort for scarce resources therestricted iospm restrictedcommander may also indicate the level of acceptable risk to be sustained and the perceptions to be manipulated commanders guidance may also include direction as to the deception target and deception objective see chapter 7 and those key elements of information see chapter 6 personnel and materiel to be kept secure 415 central to the development of commanders guidance in relation to io and targeting is the continuing balance between the implications of the laws of armed conflict loac and the principles of war adf offensive io will be conducted as legitimate response and hence the selection of targets the means of attack the level of force applied and the risk of collateral damage will all be in accord with national and international law coa development and nodal analysis 416 coa development supported by jipb the coa development stage will group and link critical vulnerabilities to potential lines of operation and determine the decisive points to be achieved by this stage the io planner has come to terms with the environment and has identified list of vulnerabilities within the battlespace that may require exploitation through io these vulnerabilities form part of the wider range of cv that are developed and analysed within the coa development process of the jmap the operations planning staff will with advice from specialists select those adversary critical vulnerabilities infrastructure targets and high value targets that can be degraded or exploited to achieve the commanders intent 417 identify vulnerabilites for each coa developed io planning assists in the identification of ways to exploit or protect cv and in the designation of the effects to be achieved own cv will be assessed from an adversary perspective as to how they may be affected and io planning will identify defensive and offensive means to reduce pressure on friendly decisionmaking capability adversary cv will be assessed in concert with manoeuvre and targeting elements as to the capacity for io to achieve desired results assessments will have an offensive and defensive io component 418 nodal analysis to conduct such assessments io planners will need to conduct nodal analysis node is the point where human and machine sensors processors decisionmakers databases and the interconnecting communication systems converge analysis of such nodes seeks to identify the specific parts or points that can be exploited to undermine wider target systems such analysis uncovers potential targets further elaborates on vulnerabilities identifies potential ways to achieve effects and assesses the potential of defence mechanisms in offensive planning this nodal analysis will need to be integrated with the wider target systems analysis conducted in support of targeting in defensive sense nodal analysis will need to be integrated with the information assurance and information management activity of the communications staff on the planning headquarters this process is detailed at annex b 419 designate effects as part of the designation of effects within wider course of action io planning will require the derivation of effects relative to nodes and the rationalisation of these effects into objectives for prioritisation of effort the details of nodes not considered for exploitation or protection can be retained for use later in support of contingency planning 420 assign assets to achieve effects against each objective is apportioned the force or asset required to achieve the desired effect this will require some initial deconfliction between io elements and sychronisation and sequencing with other assets and effects coa analysis 421 there are four main activities undertaken in io planning during coa analysis these are shaping friendly offensive io plans to achieve desired effects this will require reviewing the scale nature and command arrangements of assets fulfilling io tasking and developing time lines and resource requirements for the achievement of effects such efforts will also confirm objectives tasking groupings and priorities and assist in defining guidelines and restrictions for subordinates b assessing adversary actions and reactions from defensive io perspective the wargamed adversary actions and reactions will require analysis to assess the need torestricted iospm restrictedcounter adversary action by preemptive io efforts or increased defensive action this may also include an evaluation of how to exploit any adversary offensive io and also where the adversarys defensive io may become degraded over time c deconflicting and synchronising io activity 1 deconfliction it is the nature of io that much of the effort to achieve io related effects can be detracted from or confused by other io related activity for example thematic based message efforts such as deception pinfo opsec and psyops often conflict therefore the io planner will be required to ensure that each effort works to achieve suitable outcomes in accordance with set priorities moreover io efforts can often conflict with other efforts such as targeting manoeuvre and the desires of subordinate commanders again the io planner will seek to plan for and avoid such confliction deconfliction is discussed further in the following chapter 2 synchronisation as well as being deconflicted each io effort must be synchronised with other io efforts and wider operations efforts to achieve maximum effects this process is fundamental to io and is captured on synchronisation matrix or on timeeventsequenced chart further detail is at annex c d developing io contingencies for possible branches vulnerabilities or crises that may arise the utility of wargaming is that it allows for the exploitation of previously unaddressed or unseen vulnerability and the preparation for commanders decision points within the battlespace the identification of the possible circumstances in which the commander will be required to decide how when and where to shape the battlespace has direct io implications for the speed of friendly decisionmaking by preparing the commander these circumstances require offensive and defensive io plans and also lead to requirement for contingency plans decision and execution 422 approval the commander will be presented with io plans as part of each coa developed and analysed in the preceding stages of the jmap the commander will then decide the coa to followed as the plan and approve the io components of the plan 423 plans there are three general ways in which io plans are produced the general concept for io in cluding objectives and means is included in the main text of the operations order opord or operations instruction opinstr while the details of each of the capabilities employed in achieving io are the subject of separate annexes this system would normally be used in major conflict where there is requirement for large discrete highly controlled annexes on deception psyops opsec ew and so on if used an io annex would simply contain the io synchronisation matrix that displays the links between capability employment described in other annexes b the general concept for io is included in the main text while the details of activities are included in single io annex caveat or limited distribution material may be the subject of appendices to that annex this system is of use where the detail of capability employment and policy is not lengthy or involved and where logically single annex is all that is required c the io plan is released as separate document as an inseparable part of the operations plan io will rarely be released separately at or below the operational level however io planning guidance and interdepartmental io efforts may be the subject of individual strategic level io publications execution of io and the management of io in current

two applications in conducting offensive io it is the methodical examination and evaluation of an adversarys systems to identify nodes that may be exploited to contribute to the attainment of the commanders mission in conducting defensive io it is the systematic examination and evaluation of own force systems to identify nodes that may be exploited by an adversary this analysis of both the adversary and own forces should result in list of critical vulnerable nodes that can either be exploited or should be protected in supports of the overall operational plan 2 nodal analysis is primarily conducted at the operational level during peacetime nodal analysis should be routinely conducted as part of the development of campaign plans operations plans and contingency plans all based on strategic plans and guidance relationship of nodal analysis to the operational planning process 3 nodal analysis is part of io planning which is conducted in parallel and in support of the operational planning process this approach facilitates the exploitation or protection of nodes contributing to the successful conduct of operations io planning is guided by operational planning an understanding of operational art terms used in the operational planning process is therefore necessary more thorough treatment of the operational planning process and operational art terminology can be found in adfp 1 and adfp 6 target development related terminology centre of gravity 4 centre of gravity cog is that characteristic capability or locality from which military force nation or alliance derives its freedom of action strength or will to fight at that level of conflict the centre of gravity may consist of number of key elements typically the military operations planning process will be primarily focussed through the operational art on efforts to attack destroy neutralise or influence directly or indirectly an enemy centre of gravity and its key elements in their broadest sense the centre of gravity and its supporting elements constitute target systems therefore to gain clearer perspective of targeting the adf views it as the process by which joint headquarters centrally manages those scarce assets that can affect specific elements of these systems critical vulnerability 5 critical vulnerability is that characteristic or key element of force that if destroyed captured or neutralised will significantly undermine the fighting capability of the force and its centre of gravity critical vulnerability is not necessarily weakness but any source of strength or power that is capable of being attacked or neutralised additionally critical vulnerabilities may be tangible or intangible an adversarys critical vulnerabilities are initially identified in the ongoing intelligence process the subsequent critical vulnerability analysis within operations planning identifies the types of target systems that need to be effected to achieve the commanders intent hence the critical vulnerability analysis conducted by operations planners is aided by target system analysis process detailed below targets 6 targets are defined as any geographic area complex installation platform object capability or entity planned for capture neutralisation exploitation or destruction by military forces platform may be air sea land or space based and an entity may be person government organisation or body capability may be related to systems training knowledge force element and so on target characteristics every target has distinct characteristics these characteristics form the basis for target detection location identification and classification for analysis and strike target characteristics includerestricted iospm restrictedinherent characteristics the initial original or essential characteristics of target object or area that are generally immediately obvious and which are used to identify detect and categorise the target for example the spans piers abutments and superstructure of bridge or the ethnicity of target group acquired characteristics elements which modify enhance or augment the inherent characteristics of target for example the internal modifications to fertiliser plant enabling the production of explosives or the attitudes and behaviour of individuals relative to specific situations functional characteristics the organisational characteristics that describe the operations and activity levels of target and are important in determining target value physical characteristics definition of target by size and shape physical complexity composition and construction reflectivity and absorbency electromagnetic energy propagation andor vulnerability mobility characteristics characteristics that define the targets ability to move or be moved that is targets may be fixed mobile or transportable environmental characteristics constant or manmade conditions that may include atmospheric geographic economic characteristics countermeasures and accessibility target system 7 target system is group or set of targets that are functionally related functionally means that all targets in the system contribute towards the function of the system or each plays part in the final product normally target system equates to measure of capability that is key element of force and hence may be considered critical vulnerability systems require an interrelationship between personnel equipment and procedures 8 commander will depend on number of systems to complete mission for example supply and distribution systems air defence systems pay and personnel management systems examples of strategic target systems include components of national infrastructure such as power and communications political leadership educationknowledge utilities military command and control hierarchy and offensivedefensive capability while an individual target may be important or significant based on its own characteristics its worth usually derives from its relative importance within target system 9 an example of target system is an air defence system an example of whi ch is at figure 1 identification of the air defence systems key components would form necessary foundation to efforts to gain air superiority within course of action analysis of the air defence system would start with the target system

representative target systemrestricted iospm restrictedtarget system components 10 target system may be broken down into smaller units called target system components that assist or orientate the system to achieve its goal objective or purpose moreover each system is component of larger more inclusive system and hence the definition of systems to be targeted is peculiar to each level of command systems can be complex and components are interdependent change in one component affects other components additionally systems can be modified to overcome damage to their components 11 for example the air defence systems components at figure 1 include leadership ground controlled intercept antiaircraft artillery aaa and surface to air missile sam sites airfields and command and control c2 target system components can also refer to component services for example power water and lines of communication target system elements 12 target system elements are smaller parts of the target system than the components and are necessary to the operation of the component as whole for example target system elements of the airfield at figure 1 include operations areas petroleum oil and lubricant pol supplies munitions runways aircrew facilities and aircraft as well as communications links refuelling tankers or bowsers or air traffic control atc facilities further levels of analysis may derive the training of aircrew as an element of the target system where derived elements are tactical assets fundamental to the achievement of operational level outcomes they are referred to in joint planning as high value targets hvt an example of hvt in the system at figure 1 is the combat air patrol airframes nodes 13 node is the point where human and machine sensors processors decisionmakers databases and the interconnecting communication systems converge nodes are normally considered as the junction between elements components or systems however nodes may be considered as elements of target system in their own right 14 in the example above the sector headquarters that coordinates the effect of the ad system or the communications links into the headquarters could be considered nodes degrading the headquarters performance will have disproportionate effect on the system 15 to be vulnerabl node must satisfy three criteria susceptible there must be weakness to exploit accessible there must be scope and resources to exploit or degrade the node feasible the exploitation must be worth the risk this will not only include security and loac considerations but will measure the ability of the node to recover its function target system activities 16 target system activities encompass those actions or functions performed by the target system components and elements in pursuit of system goals the target development process should not focus on the system nor its components but rather on their activities once the critical vulnerability that must be modified or defeated has been identified nodes within key target systems components or elements that should be attacked degraded or exploited to produce the desired effects can be determined target system linkages 17 an understanding of the linkage between target system components and their interdependence is imperative for accurate analysis linkage is the connection between installations performing identical similar related or complementary activities or functions interdependence describes the mutual relationships among installations so that the activity of one is contingent upon influenced controlled or determined by another for example some industries are dependent uponrestricted iospm restrictedthe products such as capital goods equipment components and expendable supplies of other industries to manufacture their own products target systems analysis 18 target systems analysis process tsa examines the following aspects of target system target system characteristics identify the dimensions of the target system in space time and effect determining the general components and elements that comprise the system target system activities determine the key activities and functional outcomes of components and elements to assign relative importance to the system target system linkages develop an understanding of the linkage between target system components and their interdependence nodes identify those key points where target systems system components and target elements are linked and dependent upon each other tsa focuses on identifying the critical nodes within key target systems that will satisfy objectives and conform to guidance critical nodes are also assessed to identify the implications resulting from their damage exploitation or destruction critical elements important nodes are analysed to identify their critical elements ce for destruction or exploitation every target has at least one ce that if damaged or destroyed will prevent the target from performing its designed function for some period of time for example the ce of sector headquarters in an enemy air defence system would comprise the operators the commander the operations room the communications room communications feeds external communications facilities or main and emergency power supplies the particular ce to be attacked will be determined in the light of 6 command guidance 7 weapon type availability and accessibility 8 the reliability of perception management strategies and 9 the protective characteristics of the ce recovery times selected nodes are also analysed to identify recovery times associated with their exploitation or destruction recovery time is measurement of the time and cost required for system to regain the ability to function after being disrupted recovery effort is key indicator of how critical target is to the enemy assessments on the time and cost required for an opponent to respond to counter the exploitation or to repair or replace damaged elements allow operations planners to determine the timing or necessity for re attack in concert with the wider scheme of manoeuvre the time required to restore degraded function depends on many factors these may include the sensitivity of the adversarys intelligence system to perception management activity and the adversarys defensive information operations capability it may also include the level of damage inflicted power energy and materials for repairs the availability of alternative locations to substitute for damaged or destroyed functions should also be considered when analysing an entire target systems ability to recover role of intelligence staff in nodal analysis 19 in most circumstances identification and analysis of systems to determine critical nodes requires the skills of specialist analysts this effort is conducted by the intelligence staff of note however is that intelligence analysts conduct tsa from an adversary perspective that is consider targets from an adversary perspective there remains requirement for io planners in the operations planning function to conduct nodal analysis from the perspective of how friendly coa are seeking to shape the battlespace and achieve effectsrestricted iospm restricted20 nodal analysis depends on highly developed and well maintained databases which provide basic intelligence on potential nodes within an adversarys systems as well as own systems intelligence staff will compile comprehensive database of critical nodes which may be exploited or will require protection during contingency the identification of critical nodes and the examination of their vulnerability is conducted by the io planner as part of either deliberate or contingency planning the io planner may often require additional information on node and will task the intelligence staff in accordance with standing operating procedures relationship of nodal analysis to target development 21 target development is part of the targeting process described in detail in adfp 23 targeting io analysis of adversary nodes is integral to this process io analysis of friendly nodes is integral to the defensive analysis and forms part of information assurance ia planning coordinated by the j6 or cis staff 22 target development and nodal analysis are both done in support of the operational planners critical vulnerability analysis the efforts will be conducted in parallel close coordination is essential for the success of both the io planner provides input to the targeting process on those offensive io actions required to be inserted into the joint target list jtl the jtl includes statement on the significance of the target relative to the commanders intent and are produced for each coa developed the list may nominate force capabilities that could be employed while the io planners comments should be included if the target can be affected through io means input will also be made the restrictedprotected target list an example would be an enemy command and control site which is being exploited for deception purposes which outweighs its importance as targe t 23 all the jtl will be reduced to joint prioritised target list jptl when decision is made as to which coa is to be enacted as the plan the io planner should be member of any targeting cells or boards designed to validate and prioritise

information operations and current operations section 1 introduction general 51 the majority of information operations io staff effort is directed towards the conduct of current operations this effort is discussed in this chapter in two broad areas io management the focus of this io management in this chapter will be on deconfliction of io activity and those tools available to assist in daily management and forecasting of io activity b analysing and monitoring effects this includes establishing and evaluating measures of effectiveness moe maintaining an effective reporting system to identify degradation in information assurance and steering the battle damage assessment bda efforts of the intelligence system io management 52 io management includes the prioritisation synchronisation and deconfliction functions of io staff effort prioritisation and synchronisation was discussed in the previous chapter deconfliction is discussed below io management also addresses the need to monitor io efforts against the effects to be achieved specialist advice will be required to assess the effectiveness of weapon systems policy and other activity in achieving the desired effects this assessment leads to advice to operations planners on the success of that approach whether renewed effort is required whether different measure or approach is required or whether the activity is concluded 53 some tools available in the management and forecasting of io act ivity are discussed at annex section 2 deconfliction psychological operations and io 54 psychological operations psyops is the primary means of affecting attitudes and behaviour within io and has also secondary impact in all military operations the psychological impact of military activities can be planned for and exploited the categories of psyops are psychological action the planned use of support activities to reduce an adversarys prestige and influence and to increase friendly influence and attitudes in potentially hostile or neutral countries b psychological consolidation those activities designed to foster the establishment or maintenance of order and security and gaining the support of local population in order to advance political and military objectives c psychological warfare efforts designed to bring psychological pressure to bear on an enemy and to influence attitudes and behaviour of hostile groups and target audiences in areas under enemy control 55 each category of psyops effort requires deconfliction with other psyops categories other io efforts and wider military operations aspects of this deconfliction are as follows psyops at various levels of command psyops guidance direction and plans are generated from the top down in this way tactical level efforts will not undermine operational level objectives and so on however this process must ensure that subordinate commanders flexibility and manoeuvre is not unduly constrainedrestricted iospm restrictedb psyops and public information psychological consolidation and public information pinfo processes appear to overlap in their attempts to influence friendly and sometimes neutral target audiences in fact pinfo releases messages through accredited media resources pinfo deals in themes with the content of the message largely construed by the media form psyops avoids accredited media and deals in specifically formatted propaganda for which the medium used is only vehicle moreover psyops seeks to alter attitudes and behaviour which is not the pure focus of pinfo c psyops and operations security psyops is heavily influenced by operations security opsec planning in that opsec may seek to deny information to an adversary that would be significant benefit to psyops due to the significance of the essential elements of friendly information eefi that drive opsec opsec considerations will normally override psyops requirements d psyops and deception in psychological warfare terms psyops may seek to influence attitudes and behaviour of key players in the adversarys command decision system however deception seeks only to shift perceptions for given period of time deception does not therefore deal in altering attitudes and behaviour but rather seeks to exploit weaknesses in existing attitudes and behaviour patterns due to the transient nature of deception objectives psyops will not normally be involved in releasing deceptive material due to the potential loss of credibility to the more enduring psyops campaign however psyops material must not conflict with the deception story psyops and civil affairs psychological consolidation activities will normally form vital link in the conduct of civil affairs ca this is especially the case in efforts to foster and maintain order and security f counter psyops and defensive io the counter psyops effort designed to counter an adversarys psyops attacks on friendly and neutral audiences forms an integral part of defensive io countering an adversarys covert propaganda effort that is the adversarys use of black propaganda which purports to emanate from another source is linked directly to the counterintelligence ci counter subversion effort more broadly the counter psyops effort will be linked to information assurance ia efforts to secure personnel within information systems and processes supporting decision making from subversive messages deception and io 56 general deception is fundamental part of io in that it complicates the adversarys decision cycle by causing the deception target to estimate the situation incorrectly while normally considered part of offensive io deception also forms part of defensive io by acting as tool in the opsec process and in ci activity security requirements generated by the use of deception will normally drive or be allocated priority over other io activity or measures 57 deception and opsec opsec is discussed in more detail in the following chapter of note is that there is symbiotic relationship between opsec and deception the truth must be protected if the false is to be revealed moreover an opsec measure can be to deceive an adversary collection system the planning and execution of opsec measures that are needed to secure the real operation are not direct responsibility of the deception planners however the opsec measures taken to protect the real operation have to be coordinated with the measures needed to insure against the compromise of the deception operation by the discovery of the real activities additionally the deception plan could require the disclosure of some real activity to the adversary so it is necessary to ensure that the opsec measures associated with the real plan are not so effective that they preclude the adversary from discovering the elements of information required to be released under the deception plan 58 coordination of electronic activity in planning and conducting electronic deception the intelligence and deception staffs must work closely with communications and electronic warfare ew staffs and units effective electronic deception requires coordinationrestricted iospm restricteda with electronic warfare the full range of ew activities has to be coordinated with the deception plan electronic support measures are required to gain intelligence about the deception target including knowledge intentions and expectations electronic protection measures ep and electronic attack measures ea are required to degrade the targets ability to gain visibility of real activity for example jamming can be used to screen or confuse surveillance of activities whose concealment may be an essential part of the deception operation moreover drawing the adversarys attention to an activity can be useful way of ensuring false ploy is noticed and given priority in the targets intelligence collection plan however ea and ep must be constrained to ensure they do not interfere with the portrayal of the deception story through electronic means b with nonelectronic deception measures deception is unlikely to be achieved by the use of electronic measures alone since the target who is attracted to situation by what he sees through the electronic spectrum will seek confirming evidence through other means careful integration of electronic deception with visual sonic and olfactory measures is critical to the successful projection of deception story c with real communications and noncommunications activity it is also important that the full range of ew activities and the real communications and non communications activities of the force are coordinated with the deception operation close control and integration of the communications and noncommunications activities in support of the real and the deception operation will be essential to their success both communications and noncommunications electronic measures are needed to convey the deception story to wide range of sources that will influence the target d communications security successful electronic deception and deception in general requires very high level of communications security comsec and communications discipline in the force units have to appear to be acting normally to only reveal what the deception plan says they should and give other indicators to the target special controls may need to be implemented however these in themselves should not indicate that something special is occurring effect on signals intelligence the projection of the deception story using electronic means can and should be reflected in friendly signals intelligence sigint this closed loop effect will be particularly important if the deception includes the introduction of imitative electronic deception into the adversary communications system sigint may well be collected by agencies not operating in the same command as the deception authority therefore close coordination between all the agencies handling sigint and intelligence processing staffs is required to ensure imitative false intelligence is identified filtered out and not allowed to influence the assessments of those who may not be fully aware of the deception operation electronic warfare and io 59 ew contributes to io in three ways ea concerned with denying an adversary commander use of the electromagnetic spectrum to effectively command and control forces usually associated with offensive io ep involved with guaranteeing the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for the commander to command and control friendly forces usually associated with defensive io and contributes to the commanders accurate estimate of the situation in the operational area usually associated with the intelligence support function to io each element of ew is interdependent with the other elements and will often require deconfliction for example the fulfilment of information requirements via may conflict with desire to jam adversary frequencies specialists will usually address such deconfliction leaving io staff andrestricted iospm restrictedoperations planning staff to ensure wider systems are working in concert to achieve desired outcomes an example of the wider deconfliction effort is noted in the deception section above operations security and io 510 opsec is covered in more detail in chapter 6 the ia focus on assuring information for command decisionmaking and the opsec focus on denying eefi to an adversary are the two cornerstones of defensive io ia and opsec are therefore essentially linked and need to be strictly coordinated 511 denying adversary covert attack options is role of ci part of the intelligence function and hence ci counterespionage operations will need to act in concert with opsec measures designed to deny overt and clandestine threats to key elements of information physical destruction and io 512 physical destru ction in io terms relates to the use of lethal weapons or clinical strike to affect designated nodes as part of an integrated io and targeting effort the effect required is not necessarily destruction as such but rather may be selective degradation of capability including will to resist deconfliction needs to occur as follows the targeting process especially the joint targeting coordination board will need to prioritise targets as well as deconflict and synchronise assets available for missions b physical destruction always has psychological effects and must be deconflicted with supported by or subject to psyops planning and action section 3 monitoring effectiveness general 513 monitoring effectiveness includes establishing moe and lin king the assessment of moe to the combat assessment aspects of the targeting process and to the security validation and reporting process 514 during planning the moe for each io element will need to be defined these will be further developed and monitored as part of current operations moe are considered in an offensive context for the targeting outcomes of offensive io and in defensive context for the security aspects of defensive io these determinations ideally rely on such data as mathematical models ongoing practical weapons testing and historical analysis all of which combine to enable staff to predict the effectiveness of io activity in psyops this process may include pretesting types of product to guarantee an appropriate effect offensive io measures of effectiveness 515 lethal weapons physical destruction methodologies published in the joint munitions effectiveness manuals jmem facilitate the development of moe for air delivered weapons and special operations by formalising the known characteristics of particular weapons and their effects against different types of target for other force capabilities staff tables may be used to conduct this analysis in either case these data sources enable the development of specific moe based on the known effects and signatures of the weapon used such moe may include parameters for assessing whether bridge may be destroyed or sustain only light damage or whether runway may be cratered or interdicted 516 perception management weapons and risk the effects of perception management weapons such as deception and psyops are inherently less definite than those achieved by lethal weapons these effects may be trends activities or altered patterns of activity moe are therefore not as rigid as for lethal weapons in this case derivation of moe requires clear statement of effect and determination of the events and information that will indicate the desired effect is being achieved uncertainty should not preclude the use of such weapons however an inability to identify results is significant risk to operational effectiveness hence commanders approval for perceptionrestricted iospm restrictedmanagement weapons employment will usually be predicated on the provision of feasible moe the brief outline of potential moe provided below is only intended to be indicative and substantive moe will need to be developed particular to each target type and circumstance 517 perception management moe moe for the employment of perception management weapons include propaganda moe the use of propaganda as weapon within the psychological warfare category of psyops aims to achieve attitudinal and behavioural change in adversary target audiences or those in areas under adversary control in order to achieve desired result or effect the desired changes may manifest themselves through population movement civil unrest retreat surrender or cooperation the moe for psyops campaign will be directly related to the desired effect the accessibility of the target audience the type of propaganda campaign the themes and symbols used and the types of media selected b deception moe the objective of deception operation is stated in terms of what the adversary commander is to do or not to do within the battlespace within given time frame therefore successful deception will require an intelligence focus on adversary indicators that prove or disprove the deception plan is working as deception can be employed through targeting number of sensors olfactory electronic sonic and visual the moe can focus on adversary sensor analysis andor adversary reaction c electronic attack moe electronic attack ea depends on electronic support measures for cuing and to assess its effectiveness signatures may include the cessation of transmission an adversarys inability to detect or react to hostile forces the use of alternative or redundant systems or changed operating procedures or parameters defensive io measures of effectiveness 518 security security moe are dictated by commanders in the designation of the level of damage or degradation often referred to as harm they are willing to accept on their information personnel and materiel moe on passive security measures may be defined by the category of security control used that is passive controls include military security the controls imposed by defence within defence to protect its information materiel and personnel and b civil security the controls imposed on the civil population either by the civil authorities through legislation or in theatre of war or emergency by the military authorities on behalf of the civil power 519 security moe will seek to evaluate the effectiveness of such controls success in deterring threats from penetrating defences b highlighting hostile attack by forcing threat sources into relief c increasing the level of security awareness and d providing suitable response investigation and repair capability 520 information assurance ia moe will include those systems procedures and training developed to ensure confidentiality data integrity transaction nonrepudiation system availability and user identification and authentication for example system availability may be evaluated as product of survivability tolerance and restoration and reliability such assessments when reviewed against shifting or emerging threats dictate the level of protective measures alarms and response measures that need to be installed in turn these measures become part of the collective ia effort that require moe measures and response mechanisms includerestricted iospm restricteda an ability to increase awareness of risk b an ability to identify and patch systems at risk c installation of intruder detection systems on key nodes d assessment and analysis capability on the level of threats emergency response teams f red teams to reverse engineer attacks and g plans for degradation or loss of networks combat assessment 521 combat assessment ca provides the feedback necessa ry to ensure the continuing validity of the targeting process and recommends future targeting priorities commanders must be cognisant of the fact that ca is resource intensive and will divert assets from other operational or intelligence tasks there are four aspects to ca battle damage assessment bda in which intelligence personnel analyse the effects of weapons employed against target b weapons effectiveness assessment wea in which weapon specialists compare the actual performance of the selected weapon with that expected from data contained in planning manuals c reattack recommendations rr in which collective staff effort conducts reactive examination of the results of completed missions and makes an assessment for operations staff of whether target should be reattacked immediately to facilitate future missions against related targets and d mission assessment ma in which operations planners address the effectiveness of the overall operation in light of command guidance 522 the most critical ingredient for effective ca is comprehensive understanding of the commanders guidance and how it relates to specific target as well as intelligence input on the overall impact of operations against the adversary 523 thorough ca greatly assists commander in determining future mission guidance all components all commands and all sources contribute to and rely on ca figure 1 shows the interaction and coordination between those with functional

the effective performance of subsequent aspects of ca bda is the estimate of the effect on targets resulting from the application of force or perception management activity bda also forms part of the intelligence systems estimate of residual adversary capabilities timely bda influences current and future military operations and allows the commander to quickly allocate or redirect forces in their most efficient configuration 525 separate processes are used for assessing the outcomes of targeting by lethal weapons and perception management tools however generically bda comprises physical damage or perception influence assessment b functional damage or degradation assessment and c target system assessment 526 physical damage assessment physical damage assessment is an estimate of the extent of physical damage to target based on observed or interpreted damage this postattack target analysis is coordinated effort among combat units component commands joint task forces theatre command and national agencies information needed to make physical damage assessment may be derived from mission reports imagery aircraft cockpit and weapon system video personnel debriefings artillery target surveillance reports and the various categories of intelligence 527 perception influence assessment measures of effectiveness moe for perception management strategies focus on trends activities or altered patterns of activity hence bda is often more complex than for the employment of lethal weapons the perception influence assessment examines the behaviour or functionality of target against the criteria defined in these moe the results of this assessment will necessarily be more qualitative than those for bda of lethal weapons but this should be viewed as characteristic of the weapons themselves and not preclude their use deception intelligence has special relationship with operations staff in the conduct of deception planning the moe for deception relates to the deception objectiverestricted iospm restrictedwhich is stated simply as what the deception target is to do or not to do within given time frame over given space to establish bda architecture intelligence staff fulfil the following functions 1 know the deception target determine what the target is doing capable of doing and what the target intends to do this requires extensive biographical related assessments on the targets decisionmaking profile and the foibles attitudes and capability of staff and advisers in bda terms this allows the intelligence staff to predict the likely target reaction to the deception and the reaction if the target detects the deception such analysis allows the intelligence staff to determine indicators of target activity and behaviour that prove or disprove the effectiveness of the deception story 2 know the deception targets intelligence system deception requires intelligence staffs know and be in position to control the information inputs to the deception targets decisionmaking process such knowledge and capability allow intelligence staff to target those parts of the deception targets intelligence system that will achieve best carriage of the deception story this analysis leads to decisions about sources that have to be destroyed or neutralised and those that should be targeted for manipulation as matter of priority b psychological operations bda in psychological operations psyops forms part of the posttesting process results are collection through intelligence channels observable reactions or specific psyops posttesting activity such as survey samples panels of experts and panels of representatives the results of psyops product are checked against indicators determined during the planning process there are two types of indicators 1 direct indicators direct indicator occurs when the target audience displays activity in accordance with the psychological objective for example if the psychological objective was to encourage the local population to report enemy movements direct indicator would be substantial rise in the number of reports received 2 indirect indicators indirect indicators are events that appear to be the result of psyops activity but cannot be conclusively tied to the material they may include physical actions by an adversary to deny the psyops product from the target audience or may be an increase in counterpsyops activity by the adversary c electronic warfare electronic attack ea crosses the bounds of both lethal and perception management weapons indicators of the effectiveness of ea will be examined through intelligence channels and especially through electronic support bda considerations for elements of ea are as follows 1 jamming target suffering jamming may switch off emitters reveal emergency or silent frequencies or activate alternative systems or reserve modes of operation that are more susceptible to friendly jamming may also interfere with friendly electronic systems and will deny the target frequency as source of information this may effect bda collection architecture consideration of an adversarys ability to employ lethal weapons against jammers is considered in the planning for their use 2 deception an adversarys is the target of manipulative ew deception and is subject to the same bda requirements as noted for deception above 3 neutralisation the assessment of the level of damage to target emitters due to neutralisation by electromagnetic means is usually conducted via indirect indicators of damage unless technical expertise is available on the sight of the emitter historical data of neutralisation is the main direct assessment toolrestricted iospm restrictedindirect indicators of damage may be change in operational procedures loss of power to observable assets and so on d computer network attack bda requirements for computer network attack are the same as for ea neutralisation noted above 528 functional damage or degradation assessment functional damage or degradation assessment estimates the remaining functional or operational capability of targeted facility object audience or person functional assessments are inferred from physical damage assessments or perception influence assessments they include estimates of the recovery or replacement time required for the target to resume normal operations such analysis is typically conducted in intelligence allsource centres or designated bda fusion cells and is conducted in conjunction with support from higher level assets 529 target recovery time as part of the functional damage assessment recovery time to repair replace or recondition the targets critical elements or nodes is also determined this time is an estimate based on type degree and location of the degradation relative to the strength will and resources required to recover the availability of spares reserves or alternate elements campaign tempo and the expected duration of hostilities as well the adversarys determination to repair recondition or replace the degraded element are all factors used to calculate recovery times 530 target system assessment target system assessment is an estimate of the overall impact of force employment or perception management techniques against an adversary target system in this assessment the analyst uses the same criteria as used to determine the individual targets functional damage or degradation these assessments are typically conducted in intelligence all source centres or designated bda fusion cells and is conducted in conjunction with support from higher level assets providing additional target system analysis these centres compile all bda reporting on physical and functional damage to targets within target system and assess the overall impact on that systems capabilities this lays the groundwork for future recommendations for military operations in support of operational objectives 531 reporting central to the effective conduct of bda is the timely reporting of the results of these assessments to higher command bda reporting consists of three phases by which physical functional and target system damage assessments are conveyed to all levels of command the analysis contained in the reports must be read in conjunction with intelligence assessments on the likely adversary response bda reports attempt to answer to the following questions what were the actual levels of damage or exploitation to the target what residual capability remains what level of collateral damage was inflicted were there any unpredicted results or adverse impact on adversary activity or operations how long will it take the adversary to repair the damage or recover from exploitation and resume pretargeting levels of activity where is the adversary now most vulnerable to targeting in nodal and critical element terms what would be the likely result of or response to reattack weapons effectiveness assessment 532 weapons effectiveness assessments wea allow commanders to receive specialist advice on the effectiveness of employed weapons wea information is useful in choosing more effective weapons or fine tuning weapons for continued operations the results of wea from specialists in io related capability may include the shifting of jamming aimpoint in frequency terms or change in psyops media themes or symbolsrestricted iospm restricted533 wea is conducted in concert with bda since the same signatures used to determine the level of physical or functional damage also provide information as to the weapons effectiveness the difference is that bda is conducted from largely the adversary perspective whereas wea is conducted from the friendly weaponeering perspective hence wea is primarily the responsibility of operations staff and specialist advisers with inputs from intelligence staff wea analysts seek to identify any deficiencies in the performance of the weapon and weapon system including the tactics and procedures used to conduct the targeting activity wea answers the question did the force employed perform as expected 534 once deficiency is identified analysts can make recommendations for procedural changes different tactics system modifications or new system development after the same weapon attacks several targets of specific type wea should be used to evaluate weapon performance 535 targeted installations th at are captured by friendly forces will yield detailed information on the effectiveness of weapons employed to wea teams similarly human intelligence exploitation of individuals will validate the effectiveness of psyops deception and other offensive information operations such information could have crucial impact on future operations and the quality of future ca 536 wea continue after conflict resolution and during weapons trials during peace to establish moe baselines reattack recommendations 537 reattack recommendations follow directly from bda and wea efforts and are incorporated as part of current operations planning they are combined staff effort incorporating intelligence bda outcomes specialist wea legal advice logistic and communications implications and most significantly commanders direction operations staffs are ultimately responsible for reattack recommendations to the commander for initiation by the relevant actioning agencies 538 reattack recommendations provide input s for modification of the targeting process through updates to target development weapons selection force application execution and combat assessment activities evolving objectives target selection vulnerabilities tactics and weapons are all factors in the new recommendations reattack recommendations can also drive requirements for further capability acquisition or research and development mission assessment 539 mission assessment ma is an evaluation of the effectiveness of all preceding steps in the targeting process in the light of overall command guidance ma gives commanders at all levels broad understanding of the impact and success of targeting operations against an adversary and provides the commander scope to review renew or redirect targeting efforts within command guidance 540 operations staffs are responsible for ma the questions they will answer through ma are did the targeting mission achieve its objective was the effect on the adversary the desired effect was the adversary response expected and planned for does the adversary response require shift in future targeting activity did the targeting objective add to the commanders intent do

appropriate security using passive or active means to deny knowledge of the dispositions capabilities and intentions of friendly forces it is command function that involves those collective measures taken by the operational force to maintain security from generally overt and clandestine intelligence collection it is therefore controlled and coordinated by operations staff with input from ci and other staffs opsec depends on an understanding of the adversarys ability to collect information the way information is processed and the decisionaction cycle that results from it 62 operations security opsec is process of identifying essential elements of friendly information and subsequently analysing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems b determine what indicators adversary intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive essential elements of friendly information in time to be useful to adversaries and c select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation 63 opsecs most important characteristic is that it is process that can be applied to every operation the opsec process consists of five distinct actions identification of essential elements of friendly information analysis of threats analysis of vulnerabilities assessment of risk and the application of appropriate opsec measures these actions may be revisited at any time in order to update all planning processes as such the process is not collection of specific rules and instructions but more tool for the management of the perceptions of an adversary 64 in information operations io the threat to opsec is ultimately the adversary decision maker denial of essential elements of friendly information about friendly capabilities and limitations attempt to force an adversary into flawed decisions the intent of opsec in io should be to force the adversary to make decisions based upon insufficient information andor to retard the decisionmaking process due to lack of information 65 joint opsec planning and execution occurs as part of the command or organisations io effort the commanders objectives for io are the basis for opsec planning opsec is an operational function and works towards attaining the ultimate condition of security an adf warfighting concept and principle of war this relationship is displayed at figure 51 planning must focus on

measures that can be taken to counter intelligence and are all controlled staffed or managed through variety of functions specifically counterintelligence ci is that part of the intelligence function devoted supporting these facets of security it has both offensive and defensive aspects and may be directed against hostile intelligence sources and agencies andor individuals groups or organisations capable of conducting espionage subversion sabotage5 or terrorism6 5 sabotage is used in ci terms in relation to covert attack by insiders and sabotage networks orchestrated by hostile intelligence agencies organisations or individuals it does not normally include external clandestine attack by special forces and so on 6 counter terrorism relates to the force protection aspects of the ci function due to the extent of the covert nature of terrorists daily existance and sources of supply the adf has adapted the british experience of linking counter terrorism to the specialist stream of cirestricted iospm restricted68 the ci function is normally enacted on two levels staff and operator at staff level ci personnel will be involved with the provision of security intelligence protective security policy advice including input to operations security and deception and the technical control of ci operations at an operator level ci personnel can provide local ci staff advice and will conduct ci operations to gather security intelligence and to counter threats from espionage sabotage subversion and terrorism counterintelligence and opsec 69 opsec is command function that involves those collective measures taken by the operational force to maintain security it includes those active and passive measures designed to deny hostile intelligence systems knowledge of the actions of friendly units it is therefore controlled and coordinated by operations staff with input from ci and other staffs opsec plans focus on denying an adversary knowledge of essential elements of friendly information eefi about the friendly plan and utilise nonspecialist measures such as countersurveillance electronic protection physical security and deception on the other hand ci plans are directed towards the gaining of security intelligence and denying threats from espionage sabotage subversion and terrorism the ci estimate provides the foundation for both opsec and ci plans and significantly influences deception planning the opsec process 610 the opsec planning process consists of five steps that are int rinsically linked within the joint military appreciation process jmap these actions are applied in sequential or adaptive manner during opsec planning in dynamic situations however select actions may be revisited at any time new information about the adversarys intelligence collection capabilities for instance would require new analysis of threats 611 opsec planning factors the following factors must be considered when conducting opsec planning the commander plays the critical role opsec planning guidance must be provided as part of the commanders io planning guidance to ensure that opsec is considered during the development of friendly courses of action coas b opsec is an operations function operations planners must do opsec planning with assistance from appropriate planners from other staff elements intelligence support is particularly important in determining the threat to friendly operations and in assessing friendly vulnerabilities c planning must focus on identifying and protecting only essential elements of friendly information denying all information about friendly operation or activity is seldom cost effective or realistic d the ultimate goal of opsec is increased mission effectiveness by preventing an adversary from determining friendly intentions or capabilities opsec reduces losses to friendly units and increases the likelihood of mission success opsec should be one of the factors considered during the development and selection of friendly coas coas will differ in terms of how many opsec indicators will be created and how easily those indicators can be managed by opsec measures depending upon how important maintaining secrecy is to mission success opsec considerations will be factor in selecting coa f opsec planning is continuous process during the execution phase of an operation feedback on the success or failure of opsec measures is evaluated and the opsec plan is modified accordingly friendly intelligence and counterintelligence organisations communications security comsec monitoring and opsec surveys are the primary sources for feedback informationrestricted iospm restrictedg public affairs officers should participate in opsec planning to provide their assessments on the possible effects of media coverage and for the coordination of opsec measures to minimise those effects h the termination of opsec measures must be addressed in the opsec plan to prevent future adversaries from developing countermeasures to successful opsec measures in some situations it may be necessary for the opsec plan to provide guidance on how to prevent the adversary as well as any interested third parties from discovering sensitive information relating to opsec during the postexecution phase jipb analysis of threatsadversary 612 as part of the joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace jipb process the intelligence staff will advise on adversary capability and intent including adversary and stakeholder intelligence collection capability and potential operations planners working with the intelligence and counterintelligence staffs and assisted by the opsec program personnel will require answers to the following questions who is the adversary who has the intent and capability to take action against the planned operation what are the adversarys intelligence collection capabilities what are the adversarys goals what does the adversary want to accomplish what is the adversarys strategy for opposing the planned operation what actions might the adversary take what essential elements of friendly information does the adversary already know about the operation what information is it too late to protect mission analysiscoa development identification of essential elements of friendly information 613 to be effective opsec measures must be considered as early as possible during mission analysis and then be revised to keep pace with any changes in current operations and adversarial threats 614 while assessing and comparing friendly versus dversary capabilities during the planning process for specific operation or activity the commander and staff seek to identify the questions that they believe the adversary will ask about friendly intentions capabilities and activities these questions are recommended by intelligence counterintelligence staff and extrapolated as eefi for each course of action under development it is only that information that is vitally needed by an adversary the identification of essential elements of friendly information is important in that it focuses the remainder of the opsec process on protecting vital information rather than attempting to protect all sensitive information coa analysis analysis of vulnerabilities 615 identifying the opsec vulnerabilities of an operation or activity requires examining each aspect of course of action under development to identify indicators that could reveal essential elements of friendly information these indicators are then compared against the adversarys intelligence collection capabilities during course of action analysis wargaming vulnerability exists when the adversary can collect an opsec indicator correctly analyse it and then exploit it continuing to work with the intelligence and counterintelligence staffs the operations planners seek answers to the following questions what indicators of essential elements of friendly information assessed as unknown to the adversary will be created by the execution of the course of action what indicators can the adversary actually collectrestricted iospm restrictedwhat indicators can the adversary use to the disadvantage of friendly forces can the adversary analyse the information make decision and take appropriate action in time to interfere with the planned operation decision and execution assessment of risk 616 planning staff analyses the opsec vulnerabilities identified in wargaming and determines possible opsec measures for each during the decision and execution phase of planning the commander must assess the risk to security because of the vulnerabilities and approve the execution of specific opsec measures to minimise the risk 617 opsec measures reduce the probability of the adversary either collecting the indicators or being able to correctly analyse their meaning opsec measures can be used to prevent the adversary from detecting an indicator b provide an alternative analysis of an indicator andor c attack the adversarys collection system 618 opsec measures include any action tailored to protect over t indicators and can include such actions as cover concealment camouflage deception international deviations from normal patterns and direct strikes against the adversarys intelligence system more than one possible measure may be identified for each vulnerability conversely single measure may be used for more than one vulnerability the most desirable opsec measures are those that combine the highest possible protection with the least effect on operational effectiveness each of the standard opsec measures noted below exist in their own right and may perform other functions however they are the most often used to protect the indicators that give away eefi personnel security b physical security c information security d ep countersurveillance and f deception operations conducted to maintain security 619 risk assessment requires comparing the estimated cost associated with implementing each possible opsec measure to the potential harmful effects on mission accomplishment resulting from an adversarys exploitation of particular vulnerability opsec measures usually entail some cost in time resources personnel or interference with normal operations if the cost to mission effectiveness exceeds the harm that an adversary could inflict then the application of the measure is inappropriate because the decision not to implement particular opsec measure entails risks this step requires command involvement typical questions that might be asked when making this analysis include the following what risk to effectiveness is likely to occur if particular opsec measure is implemented b what risk to the mission is incurred if an opsec measure is not implemented c what risk to the mission is incurred if an opsec meas ure fails to be effective 620 the interaction of opsec measures must be analysed in some situations certain opsec measures may actually create indicators of essential elements of friendly information for example the camouflage of previously unprotected facilities could be an indicator of preparations for military action the selection of measures must be coordinated with the other components of io actionsrestricted iospm restrictedsuch as jamming of intelligence nets and physical destruction as well as psyop plans may require that opsec measures not be applied to certain indicators in order to project specific message to the adversary the commander is ultimately responsible for making the decision on how much risk to accept application of appropriate opsec measures 621 in this step the command implements the opsec measures or in the case of planned future operations and activities includes the measures in specific opsec plans during the execution of opsec measures the reaction of adversaries to the measures is monitored to determine their effectiveness and to provide feedback current operations planners use that feedback to adjust ongoing activities and for future opsec planning provisions for feedback must be coordinated with the commands intelligence and counterintelligence staffs to ensure that the requirements to support opsec receive the appropriate priority in addition to intelligence sources providing feedback opsec surveys can provide useful information related to the success of opsec measures 622 feedback between and within each step of the process is vital to effectively protect essential elements of friendly information and eliminating indicators surveys 623 the purpose of an opsec survey is to thoroughly examine an operation or activity to determine if adequate protection from adversary intelligence exploitation exists ideally the operation or activity being surveyed will employ opsec measures to protect its essential elements of friendly information the opsec survey is used to assess the effectiveness of the measures the survey will determine if the essential elements of friendly information identified during the opsec planning process are being protected survey cannot be conducted until after an operation or activity has at least identified its essential elements of friendly information such information is necessary to make determination that opsec vulnerabilities exist 624 in combat surveys emphasis must be on identifying operational indicators that signal friendly intentions capabilities andor limitations and that permit the adversary to counter friendly operations or reduce their effectiveness in peacetime surveys generally seek to correct weaknesses that disclose information useful to potential adversaries many activities such as operational unit tests practice alerts and major exercises are of great interest to potential adversary because they provide insight into friendly readiness plans crisis procedures and c2 capabilities such insights can contribute to that adversarys longrange planning 625 types of surveys there are two basic kinds of opsec surveys command and formal command survey is performed using only command personnel and concentrates on events within the particular command formal survey requires survey team composed of members from inside and outside the command and will normally cross command lines after prior coordination careful prior planning thorough data collection and thoughtful analysis of the results are the key phases of an effective opsec surveyrestricted iospm restrictedchapter 7 deception though fraud in other activities be detestable in the management of war it is laudable and glorious he who overcomes the enemy by fraud is as much to be praised as he who does so by force machiavelli section 71 deception 71 deception has always been crucial facet of warfare it is significant false multiplier creating doubt and forcing an unwarranted expenditure of resources and effort by an adversary deception seeks to influence the mind of the adversary commander it therefore requires an intimate knowledge of the adversary commander clear concept of operations clear deception objective and high standard of operations security opsec recent examples of the successful use of deception show that it still has great utility despite the sophistication of modern surveillance and intelligence collection systems the human mind is today less susceptible to deception than in the stone age 72 successful dece ption invokes two principles of war security and surprise the requirement for deception is thus derived from desire for security or need to achieve surprise security security is function of command and includes all those measures taken by command to protect itself from espionage observation sabotage annoyance and surprise security denies information to an adversary and retains for the commander the ability to employ his forces more effectively deception may be required to assist in the protection of capability and intent from an adversarys collection system surprise the ultimate objective of deception is the achievement of surprise it is not essential that an adversary be taken unaware but only that he becomes aware too late to react effectively if commander is to achieve surprise he must plan to fulfil two requirements conceal the true security and reveal the false deception section 72 the deception planning process the deception planning process in overview 73 the deception planning process commences when the commander is issued with directive or conceives of the need to undertake an operation the requirement for deception arises from the commanders appreciation of the need for surprise to shape the battlespace or it may arise from the security needs of emerging courses of action in the joint military appreciation process jmap 74 the steps in the deception planning process also known as conducting deception appreciation are determine the desirability feasibility and credibility of deception operation b determine who to deceive the deception target c determine the deception objectives what the deception target is to do or not to do d conduct deception appreciation to determine what the enemy is to perceive in order to react according to the commanders intent the deception story develop the outline plan into full deception plan by applying resources and systematically analyse operations plans to decide what aspects are to be hidden and what false information is to be presented deception methods and techniques f incorporate deception requirements into the opsec plan counterintelligence plan collection plan andrestricted

whether to continue adjust or abandon deception operations and h termination of the deception deception and the joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace process 76 the joint in telligence preparation of the battlespace jipb process provides an analysis of the operational environment and an intelligence estimate 77 the analysis of the operational environment the analysis of the operational environment contains analysis of all information related to oceanic continental aerospace littoral electromagnetic social political cultural religious and economic factors that influence and constitute the battlespace the significance of how these factors affect the battlespace on military operations is also assessed this analysis is applied to deception planning in the consideration of the effectiveness of each of the available deception techniques and measures and b the channels available for conveying the deception story to the adversary through his intelligence collection and surveillance sources 78 the intelligence estimate the intelligence estimate provides an assessment of the adversarys most likely course of action coa it is therefore the nearest available approximation to what the adversary will do in reaction to the friendly force and the adversarys expectation of friendly activities the estimate will also provide an assessment of the adversarys strengths and weaknesses b guidance on the level of adversary commander in position to control the battle the commander who is the focus of the estimate will often be the target for any deception activities 79 the counterintelligence estimate the counterintelligence ci estimate is systematic appreciation of the friendly operational plan and its vulnerabilities relative to the adversarys intelligence collection capabilities and threats from sabotage terrorism and subversion it is conducted by the counterintelligence ci component of the intelligence staff significantly the ci staff will assess the vulnerability of the adversarys intelligence collection system to manipulation through deception the enemys strengths weaknesses critical nodes and intelligence acquisition systems will determine the deception means to be covered by the friendly deception plan the ci estimate will provide the deception planners with detail on the adversarys intelligence collection and surveillance capabilities b the adversarys employment and deployment of his collection meansrestricted iospm restrictedc the threat these present to the friendly forces and plans and to the detection of their real activities d the threat posed to the deception by the adversarys collection activities and recommended countermeasures in the form of deception opsec measures and physical security 710 collection planning jipb and commanders intelligence requirements leads to the development of the friendly intelligence collection plan and to large part of the surveillance plan the collection plan is designed to collect the indicators of the adversary activity in order to confirm refute or modify the most likely adversary coa deduced in the estimate when deception operation is to also be conducted the collection plan has to be expanded to include the collection of the information that is needed to monitor the adversarys receipt of the deception indicators b the collection of indicators that the adversary is reacting or not reacting to the deception story in the way desired and c the collection of details about the adversarys intelligence collection and surveillance resources their operating status location reporting systems etc deception and the jmap 711 the jmap see chapter 4 has three important connections with the deception planning process the jmap may come up with most desirable course of action coa that cannot be achieved unless the adversary is deceived it can thus identify the need for deception and the deception objectives b the jmap will identify number of feasible coa to the friendly force since all of these are feasible they have the essential element of credibility to be used as the basis of the deception story c the jmap sets the time frame for the deception deception planning staff if formed act integrally with plans staff much of the operations planning deliberations will be directly relevant to the depiction of the deception

communications are required to support the command and control of the force in the normal way b the communications picture that supports the deception story has to be generated c those communications that would reveal the actual operations and so compromise the deception operation have to be concealed d the communications of the friendly force have to be monitored to ensure that the desired electronic indicators are available to the enemy and that indicators that would compromise the deception are denied to him the adversarys communications have to be intercepted to determine that he is receiving the indicators and reacting to them in the desired mannerrestricted iospm restrictedsection 73 desirability feasibility and credibility of deception desirability 714 the criteria for employment of deception includes will it lead to surprise will it achieve decisive results will it reduce casualties will it save time feasibility 715 prior to planning the feasibility of deception is determined by examining the following the degree to which the commanders plan is dependent on successful deception b the opportunity to achieve deception c the susceptibility of the adversary to deception d the likely enemy reaction to deception the time available to achieve the deception and f the degree to which resources can be diverted to the deception 716 criticality to the commanders plan it is often not be desirable to depend on deception for success but in some situations the only way to achieve the mission with the available resources and in the desired time will be to significantly alter the balance of forces at point in the battle this will form part of the risk the commander is willing to sustain and should be highlighted early in planning conversely in situation where the achievement of surprise will have material effect on the conduct of the battle the expenditure of resources on deception may be deemed waste 717 likely adversary reaction and susceptibility to deception deception operations must be tailored in each case to the enemys unique character and conditions the consequences of adversary likely response options to the friendly plan must be taken into account before deciding to proceed with deception if the enemy can react in way that would place the real friendly plan in jeopardy the deception may have to be rejected as dangerous course to follow from an adversary perspective the intelligence staff will assess the quality of the enemys intelligence b the likely intelligence architecture c adversary perceptions d cultural framework operational situation and flexibility of response f the ways in which the enemy might react to the deception 718 opportunity for deception to achieve deception objective command must have number of potential options that the adversary has the capability to assess as likely to occur the deception story can then be enacted by displaying indicators of an alternative coa that forces therestricted iospm restrictedadversary to react or not react according to the requirements of the deception objective these multiple feasible courses of action are derived during the coa development process 719 time available there has to be sufficient time for the deception to be planned prepared and executed and for the adversary to act on it there must also be time to establish collection capability to assess the adversary reaction to collect information on adversary indicators to process that information and to react to it by the time the deception is achieving the desired effect initial planning guidance must determine the key timings in the design for battle and indicate the time available until the deception has to take effect the intelligence staff can assess the time needed to pass deception indicators to the enemy and for reaction to occur thereby planners can conduct gross check to determine if there is sufficient time for deception if sufficient time is not available then launching any complex deception is waste of effort 720 resource availability even if the effectiveness of deception is beyond question the cost of applying it should not be underestimated every attempt at deception implies penalty in terms of manpower time equipment training for the specific skills required and the logistic effort needed to support it the penalty increases as the level of the deception target and duration of the deception increases and the cost effectiveness of the diversion of these resources needs to be carefully assessed moreover the necessary time sensitive coordination and centralised control required for successful deception may make deception difficult in situations where commanders do not have control over all the deception means available credibility and excessive and repetitive use of deception 721 while it is laudable to seek to achieve surprise in every military operation the dogged adherence to the principle can be counterproductive an adversary who is alert to the possibility of surprise in every operation will proceed cautiously and the enemy commander who has been conditioned to expect surprise all the time will have already overcome the actual shock of the unexpected 722 as result of the expectation of deception the adversary may be more cautious and hesitant to act without overwhelming evidence this may benefit the friendly commander as hesitant opponent who delays decisions might be easier to handle however cautious adversary may act with greater certainty and stronger resources an audacious opponent who takes risks may be easier to defeat than cautious enemy as he would be easier to deceive 723 as well as the conditioning effect on the enemy of repetitive deception constant requirement to produce deception aspect in every operation will exhaust the flair and inventiveness of the friendly deception planners deception stories may become repetitious variations on few themes which will become predictable reliance on few deception techniques that have been successful may produce pattern that is also predictable and once deception becomes predictable it becomes ineffective and can be turned to the adversarys advantage 724 the repetitive and routine use of deception by the soviets against the germans during world war ii ran this risk it was largely the arrogance of the high level german commanders who tended to follow their own preconceived conclusions almost without regard for the actual evidence and the fragmentation of their intelligence systems that allowed the russians to continually achieve operational surprise through deception section 74 the deception target whom to target 725 the determination of who to target with deception is not as simple as it may appear the level of command that can affect the required response needs to be carefully selected often the deception target is the mind of the adversary commander who has the span of responsibility and authority to make the decisions and order the actions that will comply with the deception objectives on the other hand the target may not be obvious as for example the opposing commander may be significantly constrained by higher authority moreover several targets may be selected to provide the corporate response or lack of response requiredrestricted iospm restrictedadversary intelligence system 726 the principal channel for information to reach the deception target is the adversary intelligence system hence significant piece of the assessment of the target is the accessibility credibility reliability and capability of the targets intelligence feeds if piece of information does not attract the attention of the adversary intelligence staff it is unlikely to get to the commander in form that will be seen as sufficiently significant to react to moreover the relationship of the principal intelligence staff officer to the commander and the credibility and reliability of the adversary intelligence staff are also important factors to consider section 74 deception objectives 727 the commanders intent will include direction on how he wants the battlespace shaped including how adversary action is to be made to conform to the plan he will therefore provide to his staff broad statement of what the commander wants the adversary to do or not do these assessments and requirements will be refined as the jmap process unfolds an examination of the likely and desired enemy action in the context of the proposed friendly operation will then indicate what actions will be forced on the adversary by the actual friendly operations b where it would be desirable for the adversary to carry out actions to his disadvantage and c those adversary actions that would place the commanders plan in jeopardy if they were to occur 728 based on these assessments the deception planner can determine the pe rceptions that have to be created in the enemy commanders mind in order to influence him along the desired lines staff thus develop statement specifically dictating what actions the deception target is to take or not to take at given time and place within the battlespace this statement is known as the deception objective along with the deception objective staff will detail the key aspects of the friendly plan that are to be protected from discovery by the adversary known as essential elements of friendly information eefi 729 deception objectives should be explicitly stated and agreed by the commander as they are what deception operations are to be designed to achieve and they are the bases for making judgments on the effectiveness and continuation of the operations once launched for example the kamarian jtf commander is not to attempt to reinforce the x island garrison until 18 oct xx section 75 the deception story the process 730 the deception story is the friendly intention capability or disposition which the adversary is to be made to believe is true it is the picture of reality that the enemy is to conclude as result of his intelligence system collecting and processing the false information that is provided it is the focus for the planning of the deception operation 731 from the derivation of deception target and objective deception planners then conceive the deception stories that may achieve the objectives by influencing the target the preferred deception story will then be selected based on consideration of factors such as accessibility of the target time availability of means and resources deception planning checklist is provided at annex to assist this process the possible deception stories 732 the commanders choice the commanders consideration of the situation and his design for battle may enable him to give clear indication of what he expects the enemy commander to believe is happening in simple tactical situations where the choice of friendly courses is limited this may be merely matter of his indicating what his proposed course will be and that he wants the enemy to believe the friendly intention is to follow the course that is least like the actual planrestricted iospm restricted733 rejected friendly courses examination of the operational appreciation will identify courses of action that are feasible but have been rejected these will have the advantages of credibility and some work may have been done on the elements of the operation that would be required to put them into effect 734 adversary expectations the enemys intentions as assessed in the intelligence estimate or his dispositions may also indicate the course of action he is most expecting if this is not the chosen friendly course the deception story can be built around it to exploit the enemys preconceived idea if it is the same as the friendly plan then the commander may adjust his plan or it may be necessary to adjust the enemy commanders perceptions through the deception selecting the best story 735 principles of deception stories to be effective deception story must be realistic realism involves ensuring that the story is consistent with the reality of the situation at least as far as the adversarys perception of the situation can be determined plausible to be plausible the story must accurately match the adversarys estimate of the factors that he will consider it must be logically consistent with the way in which the friendly force normally acts for example the environment must appear to provide for the course of action being portrayed the story must accord with the capabilities and dispositions of the friendly force these capabilities and dispositions must be as they are assessed by the adversary and be compatible with his background intelligence on the friendly order of battle and his knowledge of recent activity on the battlefield verifiable the story has to be such that it can be detected by the adversarys intelligence collection means and crosschecked by several sources to determine it to be true story which can only be portrayed through one source will often be dismissed or overlooked simple the more complex the deception story the more time and means will be required to portray it and the more difficult it will be for the adversary to piece it together the simpler the story can be kept the more likely it is that the enemy will be able to put it together accurately 736 factors considered in developing the story the following factors are considered in developing deception story factor the target further examination of the deception target and consideration of target characteristics is conducted factor adversarys dispositions intentions and capabilities this must establish 1 what the adversary probably expects the friendly force to do 2 what adversarial response is likely as the deception unfolds and 3 what the deception targets reaction will be to the discovery that he has been subject to deception factor deception means available this review ensures that generally the means is available to affect the vulnerabilities in the adversary collection system advice will be drawn from basic intelligence material and the counterintelligence ci estimate factor time the most important factor is time the timing of the deception has to be keyed to the timings of the real operation with the sequencing of the deception activity built back from the time by which the deception objectives have to be in effect in cases where the achievement of the deception is critical to the success of the real operation it may be necessary to adjust the real operations timings to allow for the deception to be effective time must be considered from both the friendly and enemy perspectives as follows 1 friendly consideration of time from the friendly point of view mustrestricted iospm restricteda determine the desired duration of the deception b determine the time to initiate and terminate each deception action c determine the time at which friendly action will unequivocally compromise the deception d determine the duration of likely effectiveness of the deception operation and determine the time to initiate real activity 2 target consideration of time from the target point of view must determine the time the target will require to collect and process the intelligence b determine the time for the targets staff and decision cycle to react to the intelligence c determine the time for the target to enact the desired action and d determine the time at which the target will be at the most disadvantage factor resources available consideration of the means of portraying the elements of the deception will indicate what actions are required earlier consideration of the availability of resources in relation to the execution of the real operation during the jmap will have identified what is available these two aspects have to be matched in the outline deception plan the deception tasks have to be assigned to the forces that can be made available and 3 whose ongoing actions can make their deception activity seem logical continuation of their current activities and 4 whose simulated situation at the end of the deception will appear logical and related to their actual situation on the battlefield portraying the deception story 737 the portrayal of the story is achieved by the conduct of number of deception activities both real and simulated which collectively represent the events that would be necessary to carry out the course chosen as the basis of the story each deception event will display an indicator of friendly actions or intentions as an element of the story 738 portraying the elements of the story however is only one part of the conduct of the deception operation it is equally important that the plan includes those elements that have to be denied to the adversary because they would reveal the real plan andor b would discredit the false story section 76 deception means general 739 deception

different noise and heat sources number of signatures when found together can identify unit or installation or indicate an activity the types of signatures are visual b acoustic c infrared d

undertaking or contemplating 742 indicators an indicator is an object or event that singularly or in combination indicates the activities andor intentions and plans of military force in preparing for and conducting military activity it is impossible to avoid generating indicators in order to use indicators to the advantage of the friendly force it is necessary to recognise what is an indicator and what interpretation can be placed on it some indicators or combinations of indicators are directly related to various types of operations when these are seen it will lead the opposing intelligence staff to put particular interpretations on the events it observes or thinks it observes 743 profiles each unit has number of signatures and indicators which it displays as it goes about each type of activity the combination of these provides picture of the unit or headquarters or installation that uniquely identifies it and can point to the activity it is undertaking 744 patterns patterns are the way military activities are carried out military forces develop standard procedures for most activities which place the various facets of the activity in relation to each other in time and space intelligence staffs plot these patterns and develop templates or analytical models and use these as the framework into which they fit the information they receive in order to deduce the activity and intentions of their opponent deception means 745 the channel used to provide information from the deceiver to the tar get is the deception means this channel includes both the adversarys means of intelligence collection and the friendly forces means of conveying the deception the conduct of deception therefore requires the provision or denial of information to the targets intelligence collection resources the targets sources and agencies through channel which consists of the carrying out of the action or display of the object by the friendly force b the detection of the event or object by the targets intelligence means agents surveillance reconnaissance and observation systems and the targets equipment processes and personnel cthe conveying of the report of the observation to

requirements upon which he will base his assessment of what is the friendly commanders intentions they may also be information he is not seeking but which has to be brought to his attention in order to convince him of the deception story 748 categories of deception measures the measures employed to convey elements of the deception story to the targets intelligence information collection means are visual b sonic c olfactory d technical sensors electronic and communications f human and g documentary visual 749 effective visu deception is critical to the projection of the deception story visual evidence alone will not usually deceive an adversary however its absence will seriously jeopardise the integrity of the other deception measures 750 much of the adversarys intel ligence is based on what is observed on the ground or seen in imagery and despite technological advances visual observations and aerial photography continue to be important sources of information this is especially true at the lower levels of command where sophisticated electronic equipment is not available or is not present in sufficient quantities to cover the area of operations examples of visual deception measures include the employment of such things as dummies decoys camouflage and smoke and the portrayal of false positions 751 dummies and decoys two items commonly used in visual deception are dummies and decoys dummy is physical representation of something on the battlefield decoy is used to draw the attention of the adversary away from more important area dummies can be used as decoys it is not necessary to have specially made equipment to conduct visual deception dummies can be constructed from available stocks waste materials or salvaged equipment the distance both on the ground and from the air from which the adversary can observe the items or action dictates the degree of realism required augmenting dummy with real items also enhances realism mix will also add confusion and difficulty to the adversarys attempts to deduce the actual situation since he has to detect all items in order to determine which are real and which false realism is also enhanced by having supporting evidence with the dummies and the scene should be dynamicrestricted iospm restricted752 use of camouflage as it would be normal to use camouflage it should appear in dummy position and on decoys and dummy equipment poor camouflage can be used to ensure that the deception is revealed and to add to the realism by making the enemy intelligence analyst find the indicators 753 use of smoke smoke may be used with dummies and decoys to simulate activities that would normally produce smoke smoke can be used to screen the sites of real activity or installations to add to the simulation of false activity by screening probable site without an actual display and to simulate ground haze or mist when visibility and the tactical situation may unmask decoys 754 use of alternative positions previously prepared or alternative positions can provide ready made basis for depicting an occupied part of the friendly defensive layout the movement of troops and equipment between alternative positions while leaving dummies in both positions can add to the realism of the depictions it also indicates much larger force than actually is in occupation and can cause the enemy confusion as he searches for the true picture sonic 755 sonic deception is the projection of sounds to produce battlefield noises it is directed against the adversarys sound ranging equipment and the human ear sonic measures are used to convey to the adversary the identifiable sounds of specific activity in accordance with the deception story 756 sonic measures should be accompanied by visual measures as the adversary will seek to confirm what is heard with other sensors sonic measures are generally more effective at night or when the point of origin is obscured by natural terrain or weather or by artificial means such as smoke 757 sonic deception can be applied to various activities such as vehicle move ment construction work and defensive digging it is also possible to use explosives to simulate firing and the fall of fire 758 the following considerations apply to the use of sonic deception although person can recognise several different sound s arriving simultaneously the estimate of the distance to the source is unreliable the receiver deduces that sound rising in pitch is coming towards him and that one lowering is going away b false sound by itself will seldom be successful it is ne cessary to blend true sounds with those reproduced artificially c the less effective the adversarys visual observation the more effective will be the projection of sonic deception measures d the range of sound depends on climatic conditions vegetati on and topography although distances cannot be predicted conditions in which sound carries best are low temperatures high humidity wind in the right direction and across water surfaces deception and counter surveillance measures must be integrated and sounds that will indicate the true operation must be suppressed or swamped with false sonic indicators olfactory 759 olfactory deception is usually aimed at the adversarys collection of intelligence by close human reconnaissance applications of olfactory measures are generally limited to small area where close reconnaissance by the adversary is possible or where adversary agents are likely to gain access however an adversary may be equipped with special chemicalodour sensing and analysis machines that can extend the range at which he can collect olfactory evidence in these circumstances deception that indicated an occupied area could be faulted if it did not also cover the projection of olfactorychemical indicatorsrestricted iospm restricted760 imagination is requi red to represent the appropriate olfactory signatures some considerations for the effective use of battlefield odours are the smells projected must be consistent with the visual sonic and electromagnetic measures being used they will usually be complementary to the main deception measure b olfactory measures are affected by climatic conditions c the olfactory signatures of true operations must be either controlled or swamped by stronger false odours technical sensors 761 what is seen in the vis ual spectrum must be supported by displays that can be detected by the nonvisual surveillance devices an apparently metal object must display similar radar picture supposed heat source should have an infrared signature electronic and communications measures 762 the array of modern electronic surveillance devices and the interception of the electromagnetic spectrum for the purposes of collecting intelligence make it essential that any deception operation consider the use of electronic measures since military operations are often dependent on the use of communications the use of appropriate levels of communications activity must be considered in all deception activity even if active measures are beyond the resources of the level contemplating the deception passive measures must be undertaken and what is emitted must be closely controlled 763 electronic deception electronic deception is the deliberate radiation reradiation alteration absorption or reflection of electromagnetic radiation to mislead an adversary in interpreting data received by his electronic equipment and to present false indications to electronic systems the projection of false electronic evidence is carried out by technically trained operators working intimately against specific adversary devices and operators the detail of the specifications of the adversary equipments and their operating procedures will be provided as classified materials for use by the specialist units deception planners should be generally aware of the techniques 764 categories of electronic deception there are three categories of electronic deception manipulative electronic deception manipulative measures are defined as the alteration of real friendly electromagnetic radiation to accomplish deception activities include 1 controlled breach of security an apparent breakdown or violation of communications security this may be introduced as operator chatter as well as in formal messages 2 traffic volume manipulation false messages can be added to the traffic on system when the number of real messages is low and then reduced when the real traffic level increases 3 traffic direction manipulation false messages can be used to adjust the number of apparent messages flowing in particular directions on net 4 net signature manipulation the movement or nonmovement of force can be simulated by the disposition of the unique communications net of that force b false order of battle additional communications facilities can be used if they can be resourced to represent larger andor more diverse friendly order of battle than actually existsrestricted iospm restrictedc imitative electronic deception imitative measures are defined as the introduction of radiations into adversary channels which imitate the adversarys emissions d simulative electronic deception simulation is the creation of electromagnetic emissions to represent friendly notional or actual capabilities in order to mislead hostile forces examples are operating false radio nets generating radar emissions and radar swapping 765 non communications the enemy uses non communications systems as part of his surveillance target acquisition and navigation systems these devices provide information to the adversarys intelligence system and therefore have to be incorporated into any deception operation techniques that may be used as part of the deception of these devices and systems are reflection deception by reflection is means of reflecting the electronic illumination of target such as by radar in way that indicates the signature of specific equipment or object this technique is used to indicate the presence of objects that are not actually there and can be very effective in conjunction with dummies of the actual objects repeaters repeaters are technical devices that are triggered by the illuminating radar and which emit return pulse at different frequency this introduces false return to the enemy device and can lead it to mislocate the target false target generation spoofing it is possible to use friendly radar emissions to produce false radar readings which indicate the presence of specific equipment such as tanks and aircraft where none actually exist signature manipulation non communications electronic equipments are often signature indicators of particular facility unit or group or particular disposition the enemy can therefore be led to believe that the force has moved or not moved by observing the actions of the signature equipments the deceiver can implement this technique by replacing the equipment normally associated the force with replica thereby having the signature equipment act independently to portray the deception and marry up with its parent units later counter targeting techniques several technical techniques exist to spoof targeting radars and provide them with false signals that frustrate their ability to accurately locate and track their targets while essentially self defence devices their use as support to deception activity such as with decoys should be considered concealment devices such as chaff can be utilised to screen actual activity to confuse enemy surveillance or to inject the impression that something is going on when it is not their use in the electromagnetic spectrum is not unlike the use of smoke in the visual spectrum and the two may have to be used together if both visual and electronic surveillance is to be deceived at the same time human source deception 766 the use of people to convey elements of t he deception story to the adversary involves four types of human sources the prisoner b the casual source c the agent and d the body 767 prisoners friendly soldier who becomes an prisoner is regarded by an adversary as valuable source of both short term tactical information and information that may be of longer termrestricted iospm restrictedoperational and strategic importance the control of the information the prisoner provides to the enemy under interrogation however is difficult the best prisoner source will therefore be one who recounts to his captors what he was doing or saw without knowing it is deception personnel who are aware of the nature of the deception should be protected from capture or exploitation although it may be good fiction to plant prisoner to spread false story it would place the integrity and security of the deception in grave jeopardy 768 casual sources non military personnel who are in position to observe events or objects that are part of the deception and to pass their observations on to the enemy are valuable corroborating means of supporting the deception story 769 agents enemy agents can be important means of conveying elements of the deception story under three circumstances where the identity of an agent is u nknown but his presence is suspected false information can be made readily available so that he is able to collect it in his normal way b where the agent is known he can be provided with false information in the same way as an unknown agent in this case there will be better knowledge of what is actually getting to the enemy c where the agent is known and turned into double agent he can be provided with false information with certainty that it is getting to the enemy in form and detail under control of the deception director 770 bodies people have been used as important elements in deception operations when it has been important to enhance the credibility of the deception story with tangible evidence general patton was used to give credibility to the existence of the first army group in 1943 the deception operation operation mincemeat the basis of the story the man who never was involved use of dead body to give credibility to documentary evidence that the allies would invade sardinia when their real target was sicily documentary deception 771 captured document carries high credibility above all it must appear genuine and contain information that can be substantiated by other means the credibility is further enhanced if it comes into the targets hands in plausible way 772 considerable care has to be exercised in the use of this type of measure to ensure that the adversary does not get the information too easily too gratuitous provision of document that contains large amount of information would be counter productive if it alerted the adversary to look more closely into its authenticity control of deception measures 773 it may not be practical or appear necessary to use all deception measures in deception operation however it is necessary to ensure that all the means that the target has to receive the deception story or to acquire contrary evidence are provided with consistent indicators which collectively provide the whole story while mass of conflicting information will confuse the adversary and so assist the friendly commander it is better if the target is able to deduce consistent and credible picture albeit the wrong one in response to the prompts portrayed to him section 78 deception techniques 774 mix of false and real activities that in total are designed to achieve specific effect on the target achieves the depiction of deception there are number of patterns or combinations of activities used to achieve these effects each specific effect and the way it is achieved are known as deception technique deception techniques may be used in combination to present number of indicators to the enemyrestricted iospm restricted775 there are number of deception techniques which form the basis of all active deception operations the recognised techniques are the feint b the demonstration c the display and d variety of ruses the obvious solution the lure the false routine the mask the unintentional mistake the piece of bad luck the substitution and the double bluff feints 776 the feint is the most widely used type of active deception operation at the tactical level 777 characteristics feints are offensive actions involving actual contact with the enemy it is the actual contact that distinguishes them from demonstrations they are usually designed to simulate the launching of an actual main attack as distinct from supporting or diversionary attacks which are real attacks with limited objectives 778 purpose the principal purpose of feint is to divert the attention and forces of the enemy from the point of the main operation feint may be used to cause the enemy to commit his reserves prematurely or away from the main attack b hold his reserves so that they cannot influence the main attack c reveal the extent and detail of his defence including such things as his defensive fire plan and positions of support weapons d divert support effort away from the main point of battle and reveal key technical intelligence eg electronic characteristics of weapon systems 779 single feint may not always be the principal deception series of recurring feints can be used to harass and confuse the enemy to such an extent that he cannot distinguish the main thrust of the attack repetitive feints can also accustom the enemy to pattern of activity so that he takes special action when the main attack occurs mistaking it for just another feint advantages realism is the key advantage of feint since the actual contact involved can convince the enemy of the truth of the deception disadvantages feints are resource intensive since in order to make them realistic considerable combat power has to be allocated to the task contact also brings with it the likelihood of capture ofrestricted iospm restrictedpersonnel and documents and the greater risk that the enemy will become aware of the true purpose of the feint the enemy will also be able to assess the relative strength of the force involved in the feint compared to the rest of the friendly force timing is important in minimising this risk by limiting the time between the feint and the actual attack so that they enemy cannot react to the discovery of the deception 780 applications feint must be plausible and courses of action considered during the initial appreciation but later rejected are often suitable for feint it must also be capable of achieving the deception objective and the commander must determine that the area of activity is of sufficient importance to the enemy that he cannot ignore the attack and has to react in the way desired b the feint is conducted sufficiently far from the main point of attack to require the enemy to adjust his dispositions away from positions where they can carry out their original or primary purpose and c the area of the feint is sufficiently displaced from the point of main attack so that the feint does not interfere with the main attack 781 time of feint the timing of feint is critical to its success it may precede or be coincident with the main attack or it may even follow the commencement of the main attack the timing and duration of the feint has to be such that the enemy commander has time to react and adjust or redeploy his forces before he discovers the nature of the feint or that the other action is the main attack if he has not reacted then his dispositions will still allow him to meet the main attack with his original plan feint may follow main attack where it is desired to keep the enemy off balance and undecided on the commitment of his reserves thus allowing the main attack time to consolidate and exploit any local opportunities demonstration 782 demonstration is show of force in an area where decision is not sought it is similar to feint except that contact with the adversary is intended advantages the major advantages of using demonstrations are the absence of physical contact with the adversary facilitates subsequent employment of the demonstration force elsewhere the size of the force can be reduced as its strength is not to be tested by contact with the adversary and they permit more use of simulated equipment and actions disavantages the major disadvantages are demonstration lacks the realism of feint and it is more difficult to portray the deception story convincingly without contact and it is more likely that demonstration will be identified as deception early in the operation enabling the adversary to divert his intelligence effort and forces to determine and counter the actual operation 783 demonstration may be used successfully when the factors of time distance or terrain make lack of contact realistic they have application during defensive operations and when the forces are manoeuvring out of contact displays 784 to assist in the proje ction of deception story units can be tasked to conduct displays by presenting static productions to the targets intelligence collection resources through the use ofrestricted iospm restricteda invention b disguise c portrayal or d combination of the above 785 invention in an invention objects or systems are simulated that do not exist these simulations have varying requirements for authenticity depending on the type proximity and effectiveness of adversary sensors reconnaissance and observation and the amount of camouflage used 786 disguises disguise is simply altering an object or set of objects to make it look like something else since many military objects and installations are difficult to conceal completely it may be easier and more desirable to disguise their appearance disguise can also make targets of high value appear to be of little or value 787 portrayals portrayal presents to the adversary unit which does not exist or which is of different type to that which does actually exist while portrayal is considered an act in itself it usually includes disguises and inventions 788 use of displays ammunition and supply dumps vehicle parks airfields artillery positions bridges and field fortifications can be portrayed successfully the results of some attacks can also be imitated to confuse an adversarys battle damage assessment for example airfield runways can be made to appear unusable or secondary explosions can be initiated in dump that has been shelled portrayal of installations may involve the alteration of existing facilities and adding equipment and activity necessary to provide the desired appearance ruses 789 ruses are tricks of war they are generally single actions planned or impromptu the ruse is characterised by the deliberate placing of false information into the hands of the enemy the techniques for instigating ruse and overcoming the suspicion and scepticism of the target are briefly discussed in the following paragraphs 790 the obvious solution in this technique the adversary is encouraged to believe that the obvious way of achieving the objective will be adopted the jmap and the adversary deployment pattern can give leads to the identification of what is the most obvious course of action and what the adversary has appreciated is the most likely friendly course 791 the lure in this technique the adversary is presented with set of apparent circumstances which offer sudden and ideal opportunity to achieve his objective and which must therefore be seized quickly before it disappears in fact he is being tempted to take action without the opportunity to fully test the intelligence that has been presented to him and he is heading into trap 792 the false routine the adversary is conditioned by repetition to believe that the friendly force has routine of activity that does not lead to any threat in fact the routine activity is used by the friendly force as cover for the preparation of hostile action this may also be known as the cry wolf ploy where the target is given number of alerts which result in substantive action so that he is reluctant to cause yet another unnecessary alert when the real action begins 793 the mask in this technique the friendly forces are disguised as an adversary or neutral element so that the adversary fails to identify them until it is too late and they have tactical advantage the use of this technique has to be undertaken with caution however as it is necessary to remove such disguise and reveal the true identity of the force in order not to contravene legal requirements 794 the unintentional mistake the adversary is lead to believe that valuable information has come into his hands by mistake or the incompetence of an individual this technique most often takes the form of an apparent breach of security or lapse in operational security arising from incorrect use ofrestricted iospm restricteddocument or communications security loose talk in the proximity of known or possible enemy agents also comes into this category 795 the piece of bad luck the adversary is lead to believe he has acquired piece of vitally important information due to friendly force accident or bad luck the feeding of information to the adversary by having him find such things as marked maps in evacuated headquarters or on prisoners or casualties is such technique faked vehicle or aircraft accidents in which apparently important information falls into the adversarys hands are an example of this technique the important aspect to using this technique is to ensure that the circumstances are so arranged that the adversary does not suspect the ease with which he receives critical piece of information 796 substitution false display this is an elaborate ploy in which the adversary is shown display that is obviously deception or is deliberately exposed to the adversary as not being genuine salvaged or dummy equipment and prepared alternative or dummy positions may be used when the adversary has accepted it as false situation and dismissed it from his consideration they can be occupied as real positions or substituted with real capability simple example is the dummy defensive position that the adversary discovers to be dummy but the friendly force subsequently occupies as key part of their defensive plan 797 the double bluff this technique is reliant on an adversarys natural predisposition to expect deception or previous conditioning given these circumstances the adversary is presented with the real situation but identifies it as deception and dismisses it this technique is extremely risky and requires highly developed ability to monitor the adversarys intelligence and decision processes it is vital that the friendly commander knows that the real situation has been dismissed and can proceed with implementation of the real plan without risk 798 overload where it is not possible to shift the targets perceptions it may be possible to present him with variety of stories of which all appear equally probable or b present him with so much information that he finds it difficult to reach any conclusion 799 the second situation is one of creating an overload on his intelligence system the technique of overload is to provide the adversary with an excessive amount of information which he must sort through to make decision it is designed to prevent him from producing effective and timely intelligence if executed effectively it neutralises the adversarys intelligence effort and in the longer term reduces the credibility of the intelligence staff in the eyes of their commander and the operations staff such situation will support future deception as commanders who have lost faith in their intelligence staff will tend to be their own intelligence officers they then make themselves more susceptible to believing preconceived ideas or the sources they regard as best to the exclusion of more balanced assessment of the full range of sources 7100 the use of overload should not be resorted to lightly its effectiveness relies on the incompetence of the adversary intelligence system and its inability to handle volume processing faced with system overload an intelligence officer may fall back on smaller number of high quality sources or on an almost random selection of the reports available equally he might rely more on his detached assessment and be relatively uninfluenced by the incoming information in these cases the intelligence officer frees himself from being overloaded and can produce coherent assessment such assessments may be wrong but equally they may be right in either case the friendly deceiver by using overload has lost the ability to influence the adversary intelligence officer resorting to overload as ploy therefore still requires the monitoring of the adversary intelligence and command system to determine what the actual effect is and how the overload is being handled 7101 the use of overload at the same time as active deception can neutralise the deception good deception requires that it attract the attention of the target and intelligence staff and keep them focussed on the information that supports the story the false information being fed to the adversary to depict the deception story may be lost in the overall volume of the overload section 79 deception plansrestricted iospm restrictedthe deception plan 7102 deception plan consists of the target the objective the techniques the means the measures timings and the resources required or responsible to achieve the effect 7103 deriving plan from the story having decided on the deception story planners consider which elements of the story can be conveyed by what means using what technique to the target over what timeframe the deception planners approach the deception story as if it were the force commanders concept of operations and detail the actions that the force would have to take to execute the operation 7104 plan for each coa an initial deception plan prepared for each coa developed within the jmap will include deception target objective and story and an overview of the techniques means measures times and resources required these issues are contested during the wargaming process conducted as part of coa analayis see chapter 4 7105 deciding on the plan in the process of deciding coa the commander will select the preferred deception story and provide guidance on the techniques and resources to be used this is developed into the actual deception plan by matching the available resources to the portrayal of the elements of the deception story they are required to carry out the preparation of the deception plan converts the visualised deception into the specific actions deception measures that have to be carried out it also finalises who has to carry them out in order to convey the indicators of the deception story to the targets collection means these then are the basis of the instructions and orders that are subsequently issued section 710 execution supervision and coordination 7106 the plan has to include the arrangements for ensuring the deception activities are coordinated and the reporting requirements of the various participants this should extend to the requirements for monitoring the effectiveness and completeness of the activities and the review and adjustment of the operation concluding deception 7107 it is important that at the planning stage the way in which the deception is to be concluded is considered and included in the plan the best deception is one that the adversary does not know has occurred ever 7108 deception activities should terminate in logical manner from the adversary point of view and it may be necessary to manufacture information in order to make it seem so the adversary may tend to blame his own intelligence system for failing to provide timely and accurate intelligence rather than see and acknowledge that he has been successfully deceived this characteristic can be exploited by providing information that shows the real situation but does it too late to be of use 7109 the notio nal order of battle has to be adjusted back to the actual order of battle in logical way if the adversary is to remain unaware of the deception if it is intended to utilise phantom units again then they have to be placed in reserve and some continuing deception activities will have to be promulgated to the enemy such longterm deception even at low level will require dedication of resources notional units can be disbanded as reinforcements for actual units however time has to be allocated to achieve this and some briefing and actual movement of personnel may be required if the deception is not to be later compromised by the interrogation of friendly prisoners flexibility 7110 battle proceeds as planned the deception has to be sufficiently flexible to be altered in response to adversary activity that was unexpected or other events that alter the situation situations may also arise where the means of channelling the deception story to the adversary become ineffective or are destroyed and alternative measures have to be generated to ensure critical aspects get through to the targetrestricted iospm restricted7111 the deception must be able to exploit unforeseen opportunities as well as remedy problems deception should not be so designed that critical operational opportunity cannot be exploited because of the inflexibility of the deception operation where exploiting an operational opportunity will compromise the deception the longterm effects on the overall mission will have to be weighed by the commander protection of false activity 7112 where it is decided to depict false activity consideration has to be given to the provision of protection to the troops who are carrying out the depiction in order to secure them and their deception activities from destruction and discovery and b those opsec measures that have to be taken to protect the depiction from compromise concealing the real operation 7113 the planning and execution of opsec measures that are needed to secure the real operation are not direct responsibility of the deception planners however the opsec measures taken to protect the real operation have to be coordinated with the measures needed to insure against the compromise of the deception operations by the discovery of the real activities additionally the deception plan could require the disclosure of some real activity to the enemy so it is necessary to ensure that the opsec measures associated with the real plan are not so effective that they preclude the enemy from discovering the elements of information required by the deception plan 7114 the need to know the control arrangements for the distribution of the deception plan and orders has to take into account the extent to which the usual recipients of operational information have need to know about the deception
