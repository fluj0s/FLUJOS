services of 36 channels or more and 70 of those households actually subscribe to such services the fcc will be empowered to promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources house report issued when the provision was enacted indicated that 612g was intended to provide mechanism to assure there is adequate ï¬‚exibility to develop new rules and procedures with respect to the use of leased access channels as the cable industry develops and serves more citizens in the future subsequent amendments to section 612 granted the fcc greater power to regulate leased access to cable systems in fact all of the powers congress in the house report had suggested would be conferred upon the fcc under 612g were granted expressly to the commission by the

has interpreted the extent of the fccs authority to promulgate new regulations th at would provide diversity of information sources two main arguments have been made regarding the scope of the commissions power under the 7070 provision the first argument woul d grant the fcc broad authority to promulgate any rule that encourages diversity of information sources the second argument would

the communications act of 1934 as amended imposes requirement upon cable operators to lease certain percentage of their channel capacity to unaffiliated persons eliminates cable operators editorial control over the content provided on leased channels except in certain narrow circumstances grants the fcc the authority to set maximum reasonable rates terms and conditions for use and procedures for dispute resolution and sets out procedures for challenging cable operators refusal or failure to make channel capacity available pursuant to section 612 1 subsection g of section 612 states that when cable systems with 36 channels or more reach 70 of us households and 70 of households passed by these cable systems actually subscribe to that service the fcc may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources2 the fcc previously had determined that the first prong of the socalled 7070 test had been met3 however subsection g remains dormant because though data have suggested that the second prong of the test had been met the fcc has not made an affirmative finding4 on november 27 2007 the fcc preliminarily adopted the 13th annual assessment of the status of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming 5 in this report the fcc has found that based on data supplied by warren communications news the second prong of the 7070 test has been met6 other data sources according to the fcc indicate that the second prong has not yet been met7 as result the fcc is requiring the cable industry to submit further information regarding the number of homes passed by their systems and the number of actual subscribers to those services8 the fcc asserts that this data will help the agency to accurately measure the percentage of households actually subscribing to cable services and determine if the second prong of the 7070 test has indeed been met9 1 codified at 47 usc 532bf 2 codified at 47 usc 532g the full text of the provision states that notwithstanding sections 541c and 543a of this title at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the united states and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available the commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information

will then have the authority to promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources10 the scope of authority section 612g grants remains matter of contention the fcc has previously solicited comment on the extent of its authority under the subsection11 the current commission however remains undecided as to the extent of the authority the provision grants and the continued necessity of the provision itself in light of increased competition in the market for providing video programming 12 on december 6 2007 hr 4307 entitled the consumer freedom of choice in

section 612 originally was enacted as part of the 1984 cable communications policy act the 1984 cable act was accompanied by house report that briefly explained section 612 and subsection 612g under the 1984 version of section 612 the fcc was not permitted to determine maximum reasonable rates cable operators could charge for leased access channels develop procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes or promulgate rules related to the terms and conditions of access under the section 13 the house report seems to suggest that subsection 612g was intended to grant the fcc power to promulgate such rules in the event the 7070 test was met14 hrept 98934 states in pertinent part it is clear that as the cable industry more fully develops and programming industry desires for pursuing leased access opportunities more fully emerge new and different requirements relating to leased access may be necessary in order that nationally mandated leased access scheme fully meet the first amendment goal of assuring diversity thus subsection 612g provides m echanism to assure there is adequate flexibility to develop new rules and procedures with respect to the use of leased access channels as the cable industry develops and serves mo re citizens in the future at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available ie households that are passed by cable to 70 percent of households in the country and as these cable systems are actually subscribed to by 70 percent of those households which have availability to them the fcc is granted authority to promulgate any additional rules necessary to assure that leased access channels provide as wide as possible diversity of information sources to the public along these lines the commission may develop any additional procedures for the resolution of disputes between cable operators and ffiliated 10 47 usc 532g 11 in the matter of 12th annual assessment of the status of competition in the market for

establishment of rates terms and conditions of access for such programmers15 in 1992 however congress enacted the cable television consumer protection act which amended section 612 to give the fcc more authority to regulate leased access16 specifically the fcc was granted the authority to determine the maximum reasonable rates that cable company could charge for leased access establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use and establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage17 in other words all of the powers congress in the house report had suggested would be conferred upon the fcc under 612g were granted expressly to the commission by the 1992 cable act revisions of section 612 congress did not however repeal subsection 612g when it enacted the 1992 cable act furthermore in the 1984 house report the regulations congress indicated the fcc could promulgate regarding leased access under 612g seemed to be illustrative rather than an exhaustive list the scope of the fccs authority under 612g therefore remains an open question

information sources including those that would apply outside of the channels designated for leased access18 however the legislative history of 612g and its context within provision that solely governs leased access might suggest otherwise when the plain language of statute is unambig uous courts generally do not find it necessary to look to legislative history to interpret statutes meaning19 proponents of broad authority under 612g argue that if congress granted the fcc the power to promulgate any rule to promote diversity of information sources congress meant to do exactly as it said and did not mean to restrict the fccs powers to leased access20 the word any according to the supreme court has an expansive meaning that is one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind21 these 15 hrept

has the authority to promulgate any rule so long as it would promote diversity of information sources furthermore proponents of this interpretation argue that broad grant of authority is consistent with the purpose of section 61222 section 612a indicates that the purpose of the provision is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public23 the broad intent of the statutory provision couple d with the broad language of subsection 612g some commenters argue grants the fcc farreaching regulatory powers24 such powers if upheld by the courts would allow the fcc to promulgate many new regulations for the cable industry above and beyond new rules that would encourage leased access of channels to unaffiliated persons g16g138g155g155g152g160g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 other commenters argue that the provision confers upon the commission only the power to promulgate regulations related to the leased access of cable channel capacity to unaffiliated persons these commenters argue that the context of subsection 612g and the provisions legislative history make it clear that congress intended 612g to apply solely to leased access and not to grant broad regulatory authority 25 subsection 612g appears in section that governs only leased access to cable channel capacity by unaffiliated persons26 proponents of narrow reading of 612 g argue that the explanation of subsection 612g in the house report accompanying the original legislation and its placement within the leased access section of the statute appears to indicate that congress intended 612g to govern leased access only27 the supreme court has noted that congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes28 subsection 612g in this line of reasoning is small and long dormant provision in narrowly dr awn section of the statute that should not be read to grant expansive authority to reregulate an industry congress has chosen repeatedly to deregulate29 if congress had intended to include provision that granted the fcc such broad power it would 22 comments of

the leased access section of the statute according to these commenters proponents of narrow reading of 612g further argue that section 624f of the telecommunications act makes clear that the fccs authority to regulate cable programming services is narrow30 section 624f provides that any federal agency state or franchising authority may not impose requirements regarding the provision or content of cable services except as expressly provided in title vi 31 commenters supporting narrow reading of 612g argue that the placement and legislative history of that provision make clear congress granted the fcc authority expressly to regulate only leased access under 612g and therefore under 624f the fcc does not have the power to read subsection 612g to grant broad authority32 if court adopted this line of reasoning the fcc would have the power only to regulate more stringently leased access to cable services by unaffiliated persons

judicial review of the scope of the fccs power to promulgate rules under 612g would likely begin with determination of whether or not the court is required to defer to the agencys interpretation of its authority33 the court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if congress has done so the inquiry is at an end the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress34 federal court determining whether congress has spoken directly to the scope of an agencys authority under statutory provision likely would begin its analysis with the language of the statute itself35 statutes must be read as harmonious whole and in determining whether congress has spoken directly to an issue reviewing court should not confine itself to examining particular statutory provision in isolation36 ambiguity of meaning may be clarified when placed in context justice scalia has stated that statutory construction is holistic endeavor provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory schemebecause the same terminology is used elsewhere in context that makes its meaning clear or because only one of the permissible meanings produces substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law37 it seems therefore that when an agencys interpretation of the scope of its authority is at issue reviewing court will look first to the statutory context in which the provision granting the authority appears ie the intent of the statute as whole the 30 comments of

placement of the provision under review to determine the precise scope of the power congress has delegated38 with these principles in mind it seems likely that court would begin its analysis of the authority congress granted under subsection 612g by noting the subsections broad language on its face the subsection appears to grant broad authority to promulgate any rule that would ensure diversity of information sources once the statutory test has been satisfied39 however because statutory construction is holistic endeavor the court likely would analyze the broad language of subsection 612g within the context of the entire statute in which the subsection resides40 subsection g appears within section 612 which applies solely to leased access to cable systems congress has provided other avenues of access to cable systems in the statute beyond leased access such as the provision requiring carriage of local television channels mustcarry41 the provision requiring carriage of noncommercial educational channels42 and the provision requiring carriage of public education and government peg channels43 the court would then weigh narrow interpretation against legal arguments for broader one it should also be noted that congress in the 1984 cable act stated its intent to ease regulatory burdens on the cable industry44 if 612g grants broad authority as some commenters argued it would allow the fcc to regulate many different areas related to the provision of video programming45 this result would arguably run contrary to the deregulatory intent of the statute46 although not beyond question it appears that court likely would adopt the narrow interpretation of subsection 612g because the narrow reading ap pears to produce substantive effect that is 38 brown williamson 529
