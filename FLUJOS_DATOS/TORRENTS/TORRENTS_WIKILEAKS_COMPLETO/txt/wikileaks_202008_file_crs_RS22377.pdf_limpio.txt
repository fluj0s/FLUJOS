function other aspects of the program in clude service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and conti nuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off pub lic assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support paymen ts now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent fa milies on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households that

nts for tanf payments made to the family other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family usually through the state disbursement unit in 1996 congress passed major changes to the cse program as part of its reform of welfare since fy2002 when the authorizati on expired for the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and other re lated programs proposals for significant changes to the cse program have been linked to welfare reauthoriza tion legislation pl 109171 the deficit reduc tion act of 2005 s 19321 among other things reauthorized the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and made substantive changes to the cse program cbo estimate s that the cse provisions in pl 109171 will reduce federal costs of the cse prog ram by 15 billion over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 for comparison of selected provisions see table 1 child support assignment and distribution policies pl 109171 the deficit re duction act s 1932 seeks to improve the cse program and raise collections in order to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent it simplifies cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthens the familyfirst policies started in the 1996 welfare reform law assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf cash benefits family must assign its child s upport rights to the state assignment rules determine who has legal cla im on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support assignment cove rs any child support that accrues while the family receives cash tanf bene fitsas well as any child s upport that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child s upport collections are not paid to families rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support rights to the state and thereby r eceive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extr emely important feature of the assignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assignment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and durin gassistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state note that pastdue child support payments arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377crs3 referred to as arrearages if the assign ment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages that accumulate while th family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the fede ral income tax refund offset program pl 109171 stipulates that the child s upport assignment only covers child support that accrues while the family receives tanf be nefits this means that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family star ted receiving tanf be nefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporar ily and thereby any child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages will go to the family distribution of child support distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support collection is important because in many cases arrearages are never fully paid tanf families while family receives tanf cash benefits the states and federal government retain any current support and an assigned arrearages collected up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits that has been paid to the family while states may pay their share of collections to the family they must pay the federal government the federal governments share of child suppor t collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to families and disregarded by the state in determining the familys tanf cash benefit pl 109171 provides incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves often referred to as familyfirst polic as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffe rs for welfare benefits paid to the families pl 109171 will help states pay for the cost of thei r cse passthrough and disregard policies by requiring the federal government to share in the costs of the entire amount of child support collections passed thr ough and disregarded by stat pl 109171 will allow states to pay up to 100 per mont h or 200 per month to family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family to the family and would not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal g overnment to share in the cost of the child support passthrough the state would be requi red to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in termining the familys cash tanf benefit cbo estimates that this provision will cost the federal govern ment 140 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 this provi sion takes effect on october 1 2008 former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welf are reform law pl 104193 beginning on october 1 2000 states mu st distribute to former tanf fa milies the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family l eaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages pl us 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits an child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377crs4 one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking unde r current law child support that accrues before family r eceives tanf nd after the family stops receiving tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf pl 109171 gives states the option of dist ributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their be half ie both current support and all child support arrearages including arrearages coll ected through the federal income tax refund offset program thereby pl 109171 allo ws states to simplify the cse distribution process by eliminating the speci treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset pr ogram under pl 109171 the federal government shares with the states the cost s of paying child support arrearages to the family first cbo estimates that this pr ovision will cost the federal government 283 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 th is provision takes effect on october 1 2009 or at state option not before october 1 2008 expansion or enhancement of collectionenforcement tools the cse program has numerous methods by which to obtain child support from noncustodial parents they include income withholding interception of federal and state income tax refunds seizure of lumpsum benefits lotte ry winnings and settlements withholding of drivers license s professional licenses and recreational licenses of persons who owe pastdue child support seizure of assets from banks and other financial institutions denial of passports impositi on of criminal penalties against noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support childre n who reside with custodial parents in another state and civil or criminal contemptofcourt procedures nonetheless in fy2004 states were collecting only 18 of child support obligations for which they collectively had responsibility for severa l years child advocates and members of congress have been pushing for more or enhanced cse tools pl 109171 includes provisions that 1 wer the threshold amount for denial of passport to noncustodial parent who owes pastdue child support 2 allow states to use the federal income tax refund offset pr ogram to collect pastdue child support for persons not on tanf who are longer minor s 3 authorize the secretary of hhs to compare information of noncustodial pare nts who owe pastdue child support with information maintained by insurers concerning insurance payments and to furnish any information resulting from match to cse agen cies so that they can pursue child support arrearages 4 allow an assisting state to establish cse interstate case based on another states request for assistance thereby enabling an assisting state to use the cse statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system for interstate cases 5 require states to review and if appropriate adjust child support orders of tanf families every three years and 6 require that medical child support for child be provided by either or both parents cbo estimates that these cse collection tools will reduce federal costs by about 36 million over the period fy 20062010 the effectiv dates related to collection techniques vary few take effect immediately while others take effect between october 1 2006 and october 1 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377crs5 2 the cse incentive payment was statutorily set by pl 105200 in the aggregate incentive payments to states may not exceed 446 million for fy2005 458 million for fy2006 471 million for fy2007 and 483 million for fy2008 to be increased to account for inflation in years thereafter the incentive payment is based in part on five performance measures related to establishment of paternity and child support orders collection of current and pastdue child support payments and costeffectiveness in addition pl 105200 required mandatory reinvestment of child support incentive payments into the cse program or related activities 3 paternity establishment costs that are not asso ciated with laboratory testing are reimbursed at the regular cse federal matching rate of 66 4 in addition pl 109171 establishes minimum funding level for technical assistance and the federal parent locator service fpls co sting 4 million over the fiveyear period fy2006 fy2010 pl 109171 prevents funding for technica l assistance which is equal to 1 of the federal share of child support collected on beha lf of tanf families from going below the amount the state received in fy 2002 similarly pl 109171 prevents funding for the fpls which is equal to 2 of the federal share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families from going below the amount the state received in fy2002 it is expected that the diminishing share of the cse caseload that receives cash tanf benefits together with the new rules related to assignment and distribution will result in th federal government receiving smaller amount of child support collections than it previously receivedfinancing provisions the federal government reimburses each stat 66 of the cost of its cse program however it reimburses states at higher 90 matching rate for the laboratory costs of establishing paternity in addition the fe deral government pays states an incentive payment2 to encourage them to ope rate effective programs pl 109171 includes provisions that 1 establish 25 annual user fee for individuals who have never been on tanf but receive cse services and who have received at least 500 in any given year saving the federa l government 172 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 2 reduce the cse federal matc hing rate for the laboratory costs associated with establishing paternity from 90 to 663 saving 28 million over the five years and 3 eliminate the fede ral match on cse incentive payments that states in compliance with federal law reinvest back into the cse program saving 16 billion over the five years4 table 1 comparison of child support assignment distribution and financing rules under old and new law old law new law pl 109171 child support assignment rulesassignment rules stipulate who has legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent generally child support owed before and during familys time on tanf belongs to the state and federal government and child support owed after the family leaves the tanf rolls belongs to the familystipulates that the child support assignment only covers child support that accrues during the period that the family receives tanf thus child support owed before family enrolls in tanf and after the family leaves tanf belongs to the family and child support owed during the time the

distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid when both the family and the state have competing claims on the money the general rule is that if the family is on tanf or receives federal foster care aid then the state is paid first while family receives cash tanf benefits the state can send some all or none of its share of the child support collected to the family the state is required to send the federal government the federal share of any child support collected on behalf of tanf families if the family is not on tanf then the family is paid first however an exception occurs for former tanf families if the child support is collected via the federal income tax refund offset program in such cases the state is paid firstfor families who receive assistance from the state tanf or foster care requires the federal government to waive its share of the child support collections passed thro ugh to tanf families by the state and disregarded by the state up to an amount equal to 100 per month in the case of family with one child and up to 200 per month in the case of family with two or more children effective october 1 2008 simplifies child support distribution rules to give states the option of providing families that have left tanf the full amount of the child support collected on their behalf ie both current child support and child support arrearages including support payments collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the federal government would have to share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first effective october 1 2009 october 1 2008 at state option financing ruleswelfare families are automatically enrolled free of charge in the cse program nonwelfare families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 in general the federal government reimburses each state 66 of the cost of expenditures on its cse program however for the laboratory costs of establishing paternity the federal government reimburses states at higher 90 matching rate in addition the federal government pays states an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs federal law requires states to reinvest cse incentive payments back into the cse program or related activities if incentive payments are reinvested in the cse program they are reimbursed at the appropriate cse federal matching rate ie 66 for general activities or 90 for laboratory testing for paternity determination requires families that have never been on tanf to pay 25 nnual user fee when child support enforcement efforts on their behalf are successful ie at least 500 annually is collected on their behalf effective october 1 2006 reduces the federal matching rate for laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity from 90 to 66 effective october 1 2006 prohibits federal matching of state expenditure of federal cse incentive payments this means that cse incentive payments that are received by states and reinvested in the cse program are not eligible for federal reimbursement effective october 1 2007
