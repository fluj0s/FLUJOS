amplified by documents from the white hous office of science and technology policy httpwwwostpgov and nasa the main features include the following astronauts would return to the moon in the 20152020 time period using new crew exploration vehicle cev to be developed by nasa the last time americans wa lked on the moon was in 1972 eventually astronauts would go to mars date was announced robotic probes would serve as trailblazers for human explorers the first probe to support the vision would be launched to the moon in 2008 construction of the international spa ce station iss would be completed by 2010 the president promised that the united states would meet itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21720crs2 1 1998 intergovernmental agreement iga and memoranda of understanding between nasa and its counterparts detail those oblig ations see httpwwwhqnasagovofficeoer 2 the characterization of the 126 billion as an addition was based on nasa assumption that without the vision nas would have been held to flat budget the increase therefore was above hypothetical budget that is lower than what nasa projected in its fy2004 budget 3 the 2004 sand chart is at httpwwwnasagovpdf

the cev would be operational for earth orbital missions us astronauts would rely on russi to take them to and from iss nasa would redirect its research aboard the iss to that which specifically supports the vision inst ead of the broadly based research program that was planned other countries were invited to participate in the vision cost estimate was not provide d but fy2005 nasa budget documents showed that 126 billion would be added2 to its budget for fy2005 2009 to begin implementing the vision and nasa projected budget chart the sand chart3 suggested that 150170 billion would be spent on the vision from fy20042020 most of the money was to come from other nasa programs the 126 billion for example comprised 1 billion in new money and 116 billi on redirected from other activities commission on the implementation of us space exploration policy was created by the president to advise nasa on implementation of the vision its report was issued in june 2004 the speech came 11 months after the february 1 2003 space shuttle columbia accident see crs report rs21408 and two weeks after the january 3 2004 successful landing of us robotic probe spirit on mars invoking the explorations of lewis and clark the president explained that america has ventured into space for the same reasons because the desire to explore and understand is part of our character and that quest has brought tangible be nefits that improve our liv in countless ways public reaction an associated pressipsos poll conducted be fore the presidents speech in response to press reports that it

hearings on the vision and related issues members of both par ties have expressed support for the goal but also concern about the cost and the impact on othe r nasa activities and nasas workforce fy2005 funding for fy2005 congress appropria ted almost all the funding nasa requested for all its activities see crs report rl32676 for more information on nasas fy2005 budget many vision supporters considered that action as sign of congressional support conferees on the act how ever explicitly stated that although they were appropriating substa ntial funds for the vision to date there has been substantive congressional action endorsing this initiative hrept 108792 p 1599 fy2006 funding nasas total fy2006 budget request was 165 billion 24 increase over what was appropriated in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 if 126 million fy2005 supplemental is added nasas fy2005 total was 162 billion and the fy2006 request was 16 increase by comparison the white house projected 47 increas for fy2006 when it announced the vision in 2004 crs report rl32988 describes nas as fy2006 budget in more detail within nasas total budget re quest what constitutes funding for the vision is open to interpretation nasa budget ch art from february 2005 divided the fy2006 request into three categories exploration specific 6 billion shuttle space station 64 billion and earth science aeronautic s and others 41 billion some may consider the vision funding as that in the explorationspeci fic category which combines funding for the exploration syst ems mission directorate esmd with many programs in the science mission directorate such as robotic solar system exploration and space telescopes others ma add funding for the space shuttle and space station since those are often described as the first steps in the vision alternatively funding only for esmd 32 billion could be defined as funding for the vision which includes development of the new crew explora tion vehicle and launch vehicle for it congress appropriated 164568 million for nas in the fy2006 science state justice commerce ssjc appr opriations act hr 2862 pl 109108 it provides net increase of 500000 above the reque sted level but is subject to 028 acrosstheboard rescission in that act and 1 rescission in another appropriati ons act pl 109148 in the ssjc act congress added approx imately 500 million for specific projects or activities and cut similar amount for esmd congress cut 25 million from each of the two research and technology programs as recommended by the house 34 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21720crs4 6 the apollo program was initiated by president john f kennedy in may 1961 to land man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the end of that decade nasa first developed experience with launching people into spac and extravehicular activities evas or spacewalks through the mercury 19611963 and gemini 19651966 programs the first apollo mission was to be launched in 1967 but the crew died on january 27 1967 when fire erupted in the apollo command module during prelaunch test the first successful apollo mission was launched in 1968 and the first americans landed on the m oon on july 20 1969 neil armstrong and buzz aldrin while pilot chael collins orbited above in the apollo 11 spacecraft total of six twoman crews walked on the moon from 19691972 another crew apollo 13 intended to land on the moon in 1970 but made an emergency return to earth when the service module of their spacecr aft exploded enroute to the moonfrom centennial challenges which awards m onetary prizes for developing solutions to technological challenges set by nasa as recommended by th senate and 200 million from project prometheus see below congress also passed nasa authorization act in 2005 pl109155 it endorsed the president s vision and authorized total for nasa of 179 billion in fy2007 and 187 billion in fy2008 both figures are higher than the outyear estimates in nasas fy2006 budget request 17 billion for fy2007 and 173 billion for fy2008 congress continues to stress that nasa should continue balanced set of programs including science and aer onautics not focus entirely on the vision comparison with the 1989 sp ace exploration initiative although some media stories portray presid ent bushs speech as the first new vision for nasa since the apollo era 6 president george hw bush made similar proposal on july 20 1989 the 20th anniversary of the first human landing the moon known as the space exploration initiative sei the senior president bush directed that the space station serve as stepping stone to re turning humans to the moon and someday sending them to mars in may 1990 speech he adde d more details saying that he believed humans would reach mars by 2019 richard darman then director of the office of management and budget omb stated at press conference the day of the presidents original speech that fulfilling the moonmars goals would cost 400 billion over 30 years other estimates some higher some lower were offered later by nasa sei was announced during period when congress was attempting to reduce the federal deficit and the propos was not received enthusias tically funding for sei was requested in the fy1991 fy1992 and fy1993 budgets though what constituted sei funding changed during those years for fy1991 nasa requested 953 million for sei the fy1991 nasa authorization bill pl 101611 approved almo st full funding but the appropriations bill essen tially zeroed it pl 101507 although nasa was allowed to reprogram 37 million into sei for fy 1991 for fy1992 the nasa request was 94 million congress approved 32 million fo r fy1993 64 million was requested the fy1993 nasa authorization bill pl 102588 pproved approximately half of that the appropriations bill pl 102389 essentially zeroed it implementing the vision dr michael griffin became nasas administrator in april 2005 in the early 1990s while the senior president bush was in office dr griffin headed nasas seihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21720crs5 program see above dr griffins plans for implementing the vision are somewhat different from those of his pr edecessor mr sean okeefe crew exploration vehicle cev and crew launch vehicle clv president bush directed nasa to develop cev to take astronauts to and from the moon he called for demonstration flight by 2008 and an operati onal capability to earth orbit later than 2014 during mr okeefes tenure nasa would not commit to using the cev to take crews to and from the iss wanting to keep the cev design clearly focused on lunar transportation dr griffin by st has explicitly linked the cev and the iss it will take crews back and forth to the iss and serve as crew return vehicle or lifeboat for them mr okeefes plan was to open competition for i ndustry teams to design the cev and conduct dem onstration flights in 2008 afte r which single contractor would be selected to build an operational cev by 2014 dr griffin decided that nasa itself should determine the basic design and pl ans to award single contract in 2006 he hopes for an earthorbital ope rational capability by 2012 that would leave multiyear gap between the end of the shuttle and th availability of the cev during which time nasa would be dependent on russia for tran sporting nasa astronauts to the iss the cev needs launch vehicle which is designated the crew launch vehicle clv the directive that nas terminate the shuttle in 2010 refers to the shuttle in its current configuration an ai rplanelike orbiter carrying crew and cargo with two solid rocket boosters srbs on each side and large cylindrical external tank et containing fuel for the orbiters main engines dr griffin plans to develop two shuttle derived launch vehicles sdlvs using the srbs and et but not the orbiter one is the clv which will use one srb and new upper stage with the cev spacecraft on top the other is heavy lift sdlv using the et and srbs with cargo carrying spacecraft on top for more information see crs issue brief ib93062 project prometheus nasa initiated this program to develop advanced nuclear power and propulsion systems before the visi on was announced its original goal was developing nuclear ectric propulsion nep and advanced radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs for robotic probe calle d the jupiter icy moons orbiter jimo to study three of jupiters moons rtgs have been used by nasa since the 1960s to supply power for spacecraft systems and experiments on probes that travel so far from the sun that solar energybased systems are impractical rtgs also can be used for spacecraft that land on surfaces where they will experience n ight for long periods nasa has not used nuclear propulsion either nep or different type nuclear thermal propulsion ntp in the past although nasa worked on developing ntp in the 1960s and early 1970s after the vision was announced prometheus took on gr eater importance because of its potential for providing power and propulsion for human exploration as well as robotic spacecraft however the desire to acceler ate development of the cev means that funding must be shifted to it from other nasa activities project prometheus is one of those initially dr griffin cut funds and refocused it on nuclear surface power systems for use on the lunar surface eg and ntp with nep as thir d priority in september 30 2005 update to its operating plan nasa announced it was furthe r restructuring the program yielding 76 million in fy2006 that would be redirected to the cevclv program jimo was canceled and only lowlevel f unding will be provided for ke nuclear systems research and technology issues funding for promethe us was shifted back to the science mission directorate where it originated although the program will be managed by esmd as noted congress cut 200 million from prometheus in nasas fy 2006 appropriations acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21720crs6 key issues for congress many media accounts of the vision focus on the long term moonmars goals but nearer term questions of how long to fly the space shuttle and utilize the international space station and the funding impact on othe r nasa activities are an immediate focus what are the implications of terminating the shuttle program in 2010 the shuttle program and bate about its future are discussed in crs report rs21408 the shuttle is the only us vehicle capab of taking astronauts to and from space president bush directed nasa to retire th shuttle in 2010 when construction of the international space station iss is expected to be finished dr griffin has repeatedly expressed his intention to terminate the s huttle program in 2010 whether or not iss is completed issues include whether announcing strict date for terminating the shuttle could create schedule pressure s imilar to that cited by investig ators as factor in the 2003 space shuttle columbia tragedy and whether the united states wants to be dependent on russia for human access to space during the gap between the end of the shuttle program and the availability of the new cev see above should us involvement in iss end by 2016 the iss is discussed in more detail in crs issue brief ib93017 it is being assembled in earth or bit and assembly is expected to be completed in 2010 plans had called for iss to be operated for at least 10 years after assembly complete as laboratory for microgravity experiments with research benefitting both future nasa expl oration missions and people on earth now the plan is for nasa to complete its utilization of the iss by 2016 and narrow its research program to only that needed to support human space exploration some question whether the us investment in the space station bout 35 billion through fy2005 is worth the benefits under thos circumstances the nasa authorization act pl 109155 seeks to enhance the use of the iss for scien tific research by desi gnating it as national laboratory and requiring that 15 of iss re search funds be spent on nonvision related research other questions include what will happen to the iss when nasa ends its participation will it be turned over to the other iss partners privatized or deorbited what are the costs and other details the bush administration has not provided cost estimate for the vision as whole but in 2005 nasa estimated the cost for returning humans to the moon by 2018 its current goal at 104 billion excluding 20 billion that would be spent on iss servicing using the cev september 2004 congressional budget office httpwwwc bogov report cautioned that based on historical trends at nasa the actual cost could be much higher than nasa estimates taking most of the requisite funds from ot her nasa programs instead of adding new money for the agency may mitigate concerns that the vision could increase the deficit or detract from other national prior ities it raises issues however about the impact to those other nasa programs and whethe r the level of funding is ad equate to achieve the goals dr griffin asserts that he will not take money from space science earth science or aeronautics programs to pay for the vision so the source of the needed funds is unclear especially since nasas budget is projected to rise only at the rate of inflation for the foreseeable future additional questions incl ude the extent to which other countries will want to participate in the vision and whethe r the vision is an appropriate goal for nasa some argue that space exploration can be done more safely and less expensively by robotic probes
