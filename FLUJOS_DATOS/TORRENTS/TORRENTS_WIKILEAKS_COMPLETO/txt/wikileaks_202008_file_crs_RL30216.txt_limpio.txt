issues in the reauthorization of the small business innovation research sbir program may 28 1999 wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abstract the small business innovation research sbir program is governmentwide effort to increase that portion of the federal research and development budget provided to small firms for work associated with the mission responsibilities of federal departments and agencies this activity is due to sunset on october 1 2000 in anticipation of expected congressional efforts to reauthorize the sbir program this paper focuses on the role small high tech enterprises those that provide high value added goods services and jobs play in the nations economic growth it provides background on related legislative initiatives to facilitate innovation and explores issues associated with achieving the goals of the sbir activity within the context of other federal technology development endeavors the report will be updated if events warrant such action small high tech companies and their role in the economy issues in the reauthorization of the small business innovation research sbir program summary congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in the small business sector addressing issues related to economic growth and competitiveness special consideration has been given to small high tech firms for several reasons including data that indicate such companies tend to be highly innovative play an important role in technological advancement and contribute to the high standard of living in the united states such was the rationale behind legislation creating the small business innovation research sbir program an effort to increase that portion of the federal research and development rd budget provided to small enterprises for work associated with the mission responsibilities of government departments and agencies this activity is due to sunset on october 1 2000 technological advancement is key element of economic growth entrepreneurial small firms often are important to technological progress because of their role in the commercialization of rd results they also are instrumental in allowing economic benefits to remain within region such companies create wealth through value added jobs that are longterm and require highly skilled employees that subsequently generate additional income spending and growth as well as more jobs however it appears that the ability of small firms to be innovative varies by industry and is dependent on the relationship between small and large companies in each industrial sector access to information sources also affects the contribution of these small businesses to technological progress despite little or rd small firms can generate new products and processes by relying on work performed elsewhere the importance of shared information is evident in the expansion of cooperative rd among small enterprises and between small and large companies review of legislative initiatives over the past 20 years indicates the implementation of programs and policies to provide both direct and indirect incentives for increased private sector investments in innovation while not specifically targeted to small business these efforts promote cooperative work among industry universities and government or between companies provide intellectual property rights as an incentive to commercialization andor mandate set percentage of federal rd funding be awarded to small high tech firms this has significantly affected the context within which these companies operate since many of these activities did not exist when the sbir program was created questions have been raised as to the validity of sbir goals within this new environment and whether or not the program should be altered to reflect other ongoing federal endeavors relevant to technological advancement contents introduction 1 entrepreneurial firms and economic growth 1 legislative initiatives to assist small high tech firms 6 issues and implications 8 small high tech companies and their role in the economy issues in the reauthorization of the small business innovation sbir program introduction congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in the small business sector there are many reasons for this approach including data indicating that small firms represent over 99 of all employers and employ 52 of all private workers1 certain studies while the subject of professional disagreement purport to show that these establishments are responsible for the majority of new jobs created in the united states in addition it has also been argued that small businesses are more innovative than large firms such claims have led to various legislative initiatives intended to address the needs of the small business sector among the legislatively mandated activities in this arena is program designed to insure that small high technology firms receive specified share of federal research and development rd funding the small business innovation research sbir program requires that each federal department with rd budget of 100 million or more set aside prescribed percentage of the extramural portion of this budget to support missionrelated work in small companies this activity is due to sunset on october 1 2000 in anticipation of expected efforts to reauthorize the sbir program this paper focuses on the role small high tech enterprises those that provide high value added goods services and jobs play in the nations economic growth entrepreneurial firms and economic growth technological advancement is key element of economic growth experts widely accept that technical progress is responsible for up to onehalf the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expansion was based on the use of technology to exploit natural resources and early federal support of those fledgling industries was extensive today such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge eg electronics biomedical applications and is even more dependent than before on the development and use of technology technological advance can drive the economy because it contributes to the creation of new goods and services new industries new jobs and new capital it can expand the range of services offered and extend the geographic distribution of those services the 1 small business typically is defined as firm with under 500 employees crs2 application of technology also can contribute to the resolution of those national problems that are amenable to technological solutions technological progress is achieved through innovation the process that provides new and improved products manufacturing processes and services it is an activity that may involve among other things idea origination research development engineering commercialization and diffusion throughout the marketplace concept can become an innovation without evolving through those separate steps an invention becomes an innovation when it has been integrated into the economy such that the knowledge created is applied in production to increase productivity and quality or results in new or improved product or service that can be sold in the marketplace it is only then that significant stimulus to economic growth occurs small entrepreneurial firms have role in technological advancement and economic growth however there is ongoing debate over the parameters of this contribution and the extent to which small companies innovate relative to larger businesses studies supported by several federal agencies conclude that small high technology companies are the source of significant innovation an often cited 1982 study done for the small business administration sba determined that small firms are 24 times as innovative per employee as large companies2 more recent information provided by sba on its web cite claims that 55 of the countrys innovations originated in small firms3 roland tibbets while at the national science foundation found that such companies generate six times more net new products than larger businesses for every 1 million spent on rd4 according to the sba innovations made by small firms include the audio tape recorder doubleknit fabric fiber optic examining equipment heart valve optical scanner pacemaker personal computer soft contact lenses and the zipper5 additional evidence of the part small firms play in technological progress is provided by sba data describing the concentration of small companies in high tech industries according to this material 94 of high tech companies have under 500 employees and 73 have less than 20 workers these small firms account for 18 of the total receipts generated by high tech industries6 in 1996 379 of workers in private sector high technology businesses7 were employed by small firms 222 in companies under 100 persons high tech employees comprises 31 of the total 2 national science board science and

occupations excluding technicians manufacturers and teachers crs3 number of workers in the small business community compared to 46 for the number of high tech employees in all companies regardless of size8 despite these data there is ongoing disagreement over how small firms contribute to the process of economic growth and industrial competitiveness there are experts who subscribe to the idea that most successful innovations are born bred and brought to market entirely within wellestablished organisations sic mainly large companies9 two prominent analysts in this area zoltan acs and david audretsch argue that the relationship between company size and innovation capacity varies by industry10 they note that the evidence also suggests that there tends to be more innovative activity in industries consisting of larger and not smaller firms11 others maintain that there is conclusive evidence that firm size affects the success of rd12 what appears to be an important factor affecting the ability of small companies to effect technological advance is the relationship between these firms and large corporations the globalization of the economy has changed the business environment such that operating in large foreign markets may be necessary for firms to remain competitive big corporations have an advantage in delivering and marketing innovations in the international marketplace while small companies may serve as the source of new products and processes they often cannot take advantage of their initial technological lead to establish secure foothold in the key markets and they will inevitably be ground down as the technology is diffused and the importance of scale grows13 to meet the global challenge many large companies are merging with other firms and concentrating financial manufacturing and marketing resources at the same time they are decentralizing their research and development activities as well as their manufacturing operations thereby creating external technological relationships with suppliers and outsourcing work to small companies larger corporations spend onehalf of each sales dollar on purchases from suppliers often small firms14 while possibly lacking the critical mass needed to move from hot boutique to major international force15 small firms can provide the innovation 8 draft material provided by the small business administration office

marketplace this might account for the conclusions made by acs and audretsch that small companies tend to be more innovative in industries which evidence strong concentration of large firms16 thus argues bennett harrison of carnegie mellon university big firms and their partner companies not small standalone businesses per account for most of the us industrial jobs sales and output per year in and year out in both mature and hightech sectors17 however it appears evident that small hightech companies play critical and diverse role in creating new products and services in developing new industries and in driving technological change and growth in the us economy as concluded by study conducted under the auspices of the national academy of engineering18 the reasons for this include the ability of these firms to rapidly develop markets generate new goods and services and offer product diversity small businesses tend to be willing to take technological risks that may not be amenable to large established corporations they also may be in position to quickly exploit market opportunities opportunities that may be determined by large companies as result of spinoff from corporate rd or by university research as result small businesses which are often start up firms tend to generate incremental innovations that respond to market needs rather than produce breakthrough innovations that develop entirely new markets19 small technicallyoriented companies are found more commonly and in greater numbers in industries that have fragmented fast growing and technologically changing markets offer few obstacles to entry and have history and culture of entrepreneurship in addition the availability of venture capital customer access and developed technical and business infrastructure provide an environment conducive to the establishment of such firms20 thus according to the national academy of engineering the specific contributions of small technically oriented companies in an industry depend on the following factors the size of markets current and prospective that make up the industry the degree of technical uncertainty in current or prospective markets the economies of scale and scope in production for market the dominance or lack thereof of larger companies in both final and intermediate markets in the industry21 16 acs and audretsch innovation and small firms 147

in the us is generated by industries that were just forming decade ago23 these companies create wealth through value added jobs that are long term and require highly skilled employees who generate additional income spending and growth as well as more jobs the regions that display an active entrepreneurial environment embody distinctive and similar characteristics these areas typically have knowledge source generally university that can provide supply of ideas and employees and ongoing rd venture capital is available as is skilled labor there are clusters or agglomerations of similar entrepreneurial firms and opportunities for generating new businesses through science parks or incubators good transportation and high standard of living are also complementary to entrepreneurial activity critical mass of high technology companies is necessary to sustain indigenous economic growth an existing agglomeration of firms in similar or related sectors is principal determinant of both birth rates and the distribution of small technology based firms24 clusters are groups of interrelated companies and institutions including suppliers service providers universities and trade associations etc located in specific area that cooperate as well as compete25 as such clusters provide the opportunity for ongoing innovation to meet new demands for products and processes generated by the dynamic relationships among the players diversity within the types and sizes of businesses contributes to good entrepreneurial environment26 varied educated and skilled workforce also facilitates technological advancement in and around the cluster clusters are important not primarily because of production but because of the opportunities for knowledge spillovers27 innovative

information sources affects the ability of small firms to innovate despite little or rd small businesses can generate new products and processes by relying on work performed elsewhere research has shown that firms with large number of sources for information about markets competitors and new technologies generate larger number of new goods and services30 the importance of shared information is evident in the expansion of cooperative rd activities particularly among small firms and between small and large companies such activities have been promoted by several laws including pl 96480 the stevensonwydler national technology innovation act of 1980 as amended pl 96517 the bayhdole act addressing dispensation of patent rights arising from federally funded rd pl 98 462 the national cooperative research act pl 10342 the national cooperative production act pl 97219 the small business innovation research act and pl 100418 the omnibus trade and competitiveness act31 in response to congressional legislation over 700 joint rd projects have registered under the national cooperative research act and the national cooperative production act over 5000 cooperative research and development agreements cradas have been signed with federal laboratories onethird of the awards for rd made by the advanced technology program went to joint rd ventures 48 of which were led by small companies legislative initiatives to assist small high tech firms the small business sector is often given particular consideration in addressing policy issues related to economic growth and competitiveness review of legislative initiatives over the past 20 years indicates the implementation of programs and policies providing both direct and indirect incentives to encourage increased

economic growth that flows from the commercialization and use of new products and production processes this approach involves creation of an environment within which collaborative efforts among industry government and academia can be fostered the idea of such partnerships reflects the thesis that while commercialization is the responsibility of the private sector the different communities often have complementary functions and can contribute to the goals of generating new goods and services for the marketplace joint projects allow for the sharing of costs risks facilities and expertise bipartisan legislative approach has evolved that is intended to foster innovation this includes the creation and support of various programs that offer direct federal funding often on costshared basis with the private sector for governmentindustry efforts the small business innovation development act pl97219 as amended established small business innovation research programs within the major federal research and development agencies33 the intent of the activity was to increase government funding of small high technology companies for the performance of rd relevant to agency missions and with commercial potential each federal department with an rd budget of 100 million or more is required to set aside part of this amount to finance the sbir effort from its inception in fy1983 through fy1997 approximately 76 billion in awards have been made for 46126 projects the original program has been extended several times the small business technology transfer pilot program implemented in fy1994 provides federal support for research proposals that are developed and executed cooperatively between small company and scientist in university government laboratory or nonprofit institution through fy1997 1862 million has been awarded for 1133 projects created by the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 the advanced technology program atp of the national institute of standards and technology nist department of commerce provides federal seed financing matched by private sector investment to companies or consortia of universities businesses and government laboratories for development of precompetitive generic technologies that have potential application within range of industries awards are made on technical scientific and business merit over half of

knowledge and technologies developed under the auspices of nist and other federal agencies in pursuit of mission requirements the centers receive at least half their funding from usbased non profit institutions or organizations in addition congress has enacted various laws that offer indirect measures to encourage activities leading to technology commercialization included in this is the research and experimentation tax credit which provides credit for incremental 33 for more information see congressional research service small business innovation research program by wendy h schacht crs report 96402 september 11 1998 crs8 increases in companys rd expenditures as well as for payments to universities for basic research changes to the antitrust laws made by the national cooperative research act pl 98462 and the national cooperative manufacturing act pl 10342 are designed to clarify their application in regard to collaborative research and manufacturing ventures thereby removing certain barriers to such activities other laws including the stevensonwydler technology innovation act pl 96 480 and the federal technology transfer act pl 99502 facilitating technology transfer and establishing patent ownership incentives were enacted to stimulate private sector use of the results of federallyfunded rd preference for entering into cooperative research and development agreements is given to small companies and consortia involving small firms similarly the bayhdole act pl 96517 has been of major significance to the evolution of rd in small high tech companies and academia providing title to inventions made under federal financing to small business university or nonprofit contractors has encouraged efforts to further develop products and processes based on these patents and bring them to the marketplace34 issues and implications given past congressional interest in the small business sector it might be expected that the 106th congress will explore the reauthorization of the sbir program now scheduled to sunset on october 1 2000 future discussion could involve identification of program goals and examination of their relevance within the broad context of federal efforts to promote technology development the following issues might be reviewed and considered the small business innovation research program was originally mandated to increase the participation of small high technology firms in the federal rd endeavor congressional support was predicated upon several conclusions while technologybased companies under 500 employees tend to be highly innovative and innovation is essential to the economic wellbeing of the united states sponsors of the original legislation believed these businesses were not receiving sufficient share of government research support it was necessary therefore to guarantee this sector predetermined portion of the federal budget to achieve this each applicable agency was instructed to create an sbir program to ensure expanded research and development funding for small businesses and to facilitate commercialization of new products and processes by these firms the efforts are financed by mandatory set aside provision considered necessary due to what was viewed as federal preference for financing rd in large corporations the legislatively mandated goals of the sbir program include stimulation of technological innovation in the small business sector increased use of this community to meet the rd needs of the government and expanded commercialization of the results of federally funded rd these objectives were developed at time when 34 see congressional research service rd partnerships and intellectual property implications for us policy by wendy h schacht crs report 98862 crs9 many of the current government policies and programs to assist small high tech companies in pursuit of innovation were not available this raises questions as to whether or not the goals of the sbir program remain valid is the rationale behind the effort still sound given other ongoing federal activities should the sbir program be continued andor expanded should changes be made in the activity to reflect the changes brought about by other congressional initiatives in the technology development arena there is agreement among experts that small high tech companies play an important role in innovation and economic growth one issue is whether or not the sbir program as presently constituted contributes to the creation of an environment conducive to the formation and advancement of high value added entrepreneurial firms as discussed previously these types of businesses flourish in areas that have certain characteristics including knowledge source access to capital skilled labor and critical mass of similar firms that both cooperate and compete federal initiatives to facilitate technology transfer collaborative rd and technical assistance as well as to provide matched government funding can be seen as supportive of technology development promoting this environment the small business innovation research program offers financial support while the associated small business technology transfer program encourages joint rd activities with government laboratories or universities within the context of ongoing federal efforts is this sufficient to achieve the programs goals if not are there changes that can and should be made to build upon other government activities and further strengthen the impact of the sbir program on technological advancement several studies indicate that the ability of small firms to be innovative varies by industry and is dependent on the relationship between small and large firms in each industrial sector thus question may be raised as to whether or not the sbir activity as it now operates promotes the development of productive interactions between companies of different sizes is the structure of the agencywide sbir effort reflective of the current knowledge on the interaction between small and large firms in the development of new products and processes and their commercialization and marketing might alterations be made to the current sbir program to augment opportunities for increased innovation if this is considered desirable how might it best be achieved recognizing that each agency operates an sbir program consistent with its operating procedures and mission requirements legislation promoting innovation often includes statement of preferential consideration for small companies however these laws for the most part also apply to large firms thus concerns have been expressed as to whether or not these initiatives provide the small business community with extra assistance or in effect increase competitive pressures with respect to larger domestic firms if large companies are also encouraged to undertake research development and commercialization of the results questions may be raised as to the role and position of small firms will they be hampered in rd activities due to their size and resource constraints in evaluating the possible reauthorization of the sbir program an understanding of the role of small firms in economic growth can provide information on which to decide whether or not continued special consideration of these companies crs10 is warranted however it remains difficult to determine how current legislative initiatives affect the competitiveness of small firms both in terms of comparisons to larger companies and in international activities limited measures of innovation and competitiveness impede assessment of such efforts research and development are often but two activities in generally long and costly process of bringing product process or service to the marketplace recent efforts to increase rd in small firms will not necessarily show commercial results if any for many years in many cases lag time of 5 to 15 years between idea and marketable good is commonplace although this is beginning to decrease and in some cases particularly biotechnology tends to be less while the majority of federal programs to facilitate increased private sector investments in rd leading to economic growth were not in existence when the sbir activity was initiated some analysts believe that an assessment of the total environment within which small high tech firms operate might be the most effective means to insure that congressional action achieves its intended objectives for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30216
