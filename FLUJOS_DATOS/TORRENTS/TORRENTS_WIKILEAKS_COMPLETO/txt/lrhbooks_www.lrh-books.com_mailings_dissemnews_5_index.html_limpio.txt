coming over and bringing these lrh materials more dissemination news campaign sponsors of the month bill shea regional disseminator i support this project because i have very strong purpose to disseminate there is nothing more important or more vital to than seeing to the broadscale dissemination of source planetwide lrh books in sweeping circulation out in the community is how we will eventually clear each area and then clear the planet since day one of being in scientology i knew that i had to do whatever i could to pass on this data to others i urge you to do the same every one of us plays vital role in planetary dissemination and clearing imagine what would happen if we each took it to the limit and didnt hold back i think we would capture the world book market and tidal wave of public would start walking into our orgs lets make it happen jason brawer district disseminator vegas is great town i grew up here and i have seen small desert town turn into major metropolitan area our city is expanding like mad and i love it on the other hand the people of my community suffer broken homes drugs gambling and violence all these things have people askinghow could this be all this prosperity and all this misery at the same time if people knew that scientology could help them for realthey would come thats why this dissemination project is so important i want people to know that scientology has the answers to their questions and real bona fide help thats why i donated and you should do the same your community cant be that much different than mine so get busy greg pecka citywide disseminator let give you this question and you can decide whether or not it is vital to give to the organizations that disseminate and expand scientology given choice of the following two planetary conditions which one would you prefer to be in 1 you achieve total freedom but everyone else around you on planet earth is still unaware and in the dark or 2 everyone else on the planet is made aware of and moved towards total freedom too im sure that you will agree with on 2 being the sanest and safest place to be that is why i donate to this dissemination project i want to help to disseminate and expand scientology that is why lrh did everything that he did for all of mankind dwight benesh org zone disseminator i have special spiritual interest in helping the indian nations flourish and prosper through education i began with sending several of the management series volumes and then several other lrh reference materials to sitting bull college and other native american indian colleges and i must say ive been very happy with the results it is my purpose to help pass on to others what it is that i know since 1986 when i first experienced great success with lrhs technology in my veterinary practice this success has allowed to donate source materials that make huge difference in every area of life they are distributed one then becomes more able and takes on greater area of responsibility this is very rewarding for so this project is very dear to my heart the highlight of all of this is when i went to meet with ron his horse is thunder president of sitting bull college and the greatgreatgreatgrandson of sitting bull this was fantastic experience for and truthfully my dreams and goals are being achieved thanks to this project steve lassman regional disseminator i am staff member at the boulder colorado mission and at asho for training and auditing the second day at asho i notice flipchart titled spearheading the religious movement with source it goes in to detail on the perfect dissemination program using existing comm lines and gives several examples the idea is to get book packages into the hands of vips opinion leaders university professors politicians etc follow up occurs some weeks later and live presentations are offered wow what theta effect immediately i started thinking of opinion leaders in my city of boulder colorado of course as it usually happens the one with passion is the one who pays and so i took responsibility for my region im very excited about this project it directly helps my mission community friends and family while helping to achieve the aims of scientology i cant think of better effect to create more sponsor feedback recent feedback results from the campaign presentation to professor at fisk
