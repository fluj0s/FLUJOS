internal aiu sa use only not for external distribution sexual and reproductiv rights some frequently asked qu estions april 200 7 below are frequentl asked questions an d answers on sexua l and reproductive ri ghts inclu ding abortio n which is being provide d to aiusa as an internal docum ent to assist in answ ering questions from members or the public i policy and background 1 why has ai developed policy on abortion ai recognized the stark realities of women and girls w ho are victims of genderbased violence and who be ar the consequences of the abuse of their sexual and reprod uctive rights ais policy developm ent has been driven by the organizations co mmitment to addressing the hum an rights realities confronted by victim s sur vivors and defenders for women those realities t oo often i nclude criminalizati on for seeking or having n abortion denial of acc ess to lifesav ing m edical tr eatment for abortion com plications especially when the abortion has been obtained illegall rape and incest which may lead to unwanted pregna ncies and the stigmatizatio n of victim s of sexual abuse the denial of access to saf abortion services wher continued pregnancy threatens their lives or health ai has developed its polic to enable the organizati on to dertake principled an d com prehensive hum an rights researc h and cam paigning on suc h violations in the future to continue to work toward enabling women to decide whether and under what circu mstances to engage in sexual relations and pre vent unwanted pregnanc but also to supp ort them when they face grave hum an rights violations as result of unwanted pregnanc 2 what is is policy on abortion ai does not t ake position on whether abortion shoul d be lega l or whether it is right or wrong under our policy we call on sta tes to provide women and m with full i nformation on sexual and repr oductive heal th repeal laws that allow women to be charged im prisoned or otherwise subject to cri minal sanc tions for seeking or ving an abortion ensure that any wom an who suffers com plications from an abortion will have access to the medical services she needs whether she obtained the abortion legally or illegally ensure acce ss to abortion s ervices to any woman w ho beco mes preg nant as the result of rape sexual assault or incest or when pregnanc poses risk to wo mans life or grave risk to her health ai recognizes that some state regulation of access to abor tion is just ifiable for exam ple states may properl ensure that medical practiti oners are licensed may provide ot her protection against malpracti ce and may set reasonable gestational lim its the polic is based on the principle that every wom an has the right to be free from any form of coercion discrim ination or vi olence as she makes and puts in to effect informed decisions concerning reproductio n including decisions in relation to the continuatio n or term inatio n of preg nancy ai do t counsel indi viduals as to whether they shoul d continue or terminate preg nancy nor wi ll ai cam paign generally fo r abortion the polic allows ai to address specific issu associated wit h abortion to the extent that these are di rectly relevant to ai s work such as the right to health and violence agains t women 3 how did ai decide on the scope and content of its abortion policy as dem ocratic membershipbased organization ai h as tradition of reaching major polic decisions after thorou gh internal discussion and debate with the member ship the issue of abortion has been exception 2 the issue emerged on ais policy agenda in 2003 around the time of the launch of ais global campaign to stop violence against women following series of discussions in various policy forums the 2005 meeting of the international council ais highest decisionmaking body decided to adopt polic on sexual and reproductive rights it also decided that ai should embark on move mentwide consultation to clarify its position on selected aspects of abortion all ai sections and structures consulted with their memb ers including through debates at their annual meetings workshops or other means these were aimed at explori ng the diversity of views on abortion and abortionrelated issues building better understanding of the issues and estab lishing consensus in july 2006 ai adopted broad based policy on the rights of women and men to make informed decisions about sex and reproduction free from coercion discrimination and violence the policy cove rs areas such as sex education access to sexual health information the promotion of safe motherhood contracep tion and other options to address unwanted pregnancy and reduce resort to abortion it also covers ais opposition to coercive population control measures such as forced sterilization and forced abortion the comprehensive approach that ai has adopted shows that its concern is not only related to abortion but to broader issues of sexual and reproductive rights and violence against women 4 does ai promote abortion as human right some media reports and individuals have claimed that ai promotes human right to abortion this grossly misrepresents ais policy on sexual and reproductive rights ai takes position on whether abortion is right or wrong nor on whether or not abortion should be legal the particular right ai works to protect is the right of all women to be free of any form of coercion discrimination or violence as they make and put into effect informed decisions regarding the regulation of their fertility ais sexual and reproductive rights policy emphasizes access to contraceptive services and to sexual health information so that the risk of unw anted pregnancies can be reduced 5 is it accurate to say that amnesty internationa l has neutral position on the abortion question ai takes position on whether abortion is right or wrong ai has long opposed forced abortion sterilization and contraception in all circumstances ai currently does not take position on laws regulating the termination of pregnancy other than in cases when pregnancy results from rape sexual assault or incest or where it poses risk to the womans life or grave risk to her health 6 what will ai be able to do with its policy on abortion does this not take the organization beyond its mission campaigning to stop violence against women protest to rture and illtreatment and promote nondiscrimination and the right to health are fundamental areas of ais missi on ai has increasingly had to confront the implications of restrictive abortion laws and policies in key areas of its work the ultimate objective of amnesty internationals movementwide policy consultation process over the past tw years has been to enable work that will make difference in the lives of women and girls who have suffere d egregious human rights violations and who are deeply affected by their lack of access to appropriate xual and reproductive information and services the policy now adopted allows ai to call governments to account for their laws and policies on abortion and to make appropriate policy recomme ndations toward the realization of womens human rights the policy will allow ai to address specific issues associated with abortion to the extent that these are directly relevant to ais work such as access to justice and fair process the right to health and violence against women democratic republic of congo and darfursudan ai will be able to address the cases of those who are desperately seeking to terminate their unwanted pregnanc ies in order to end the cruel treatment that such pregnancy entails for them or to avoid the trauma s tigma abandonment and even threats to their lives by their familiescommunities because they ar bearing child of the enemy b in mexico ai has interviewed rape survivors who have been denied access to legal abortion services sometimes in lifethreatening situations ai will be ab to take up their concerns regarding the abuse and discrimination they have faced in the health system and to join broadbased campaigns for policy reform c in salvador abortion is prohibited without any exceptions as the constitution establishes personhood from the point of conception this means that even in the case of ectopic pregnanc where the fetus has attached to fallopian tube rather than uterus and will not deve lop into viable human life women cannot access abortion 3 legally until the foetus has died or the tube has burst pu tting their own lives and health at grave risk ai will be able to support the right of such women to life and health d in nicaragua abortion is prohibited without any exception the consequences for women are the same as described above for women in salvador in nigeria ai has campaigned against the death penalty fo r women prosecuted in relation to abortion and culpable homicide charges under the new policy ai will also be able to oppose the imprisonment of such women on abortionrelated grounds ai will be able to argue that such imprisonment should be considered as genderbased violence or as cruel inhuman or degrading punishment f every year in the philippines approximately 800 of the 473000 women who have abortions die due to complications resulting from unsafe abortion in addition to campaigning against womens widespread lack of access to contraception including emergency contracepti on and reproductive health services ai could call for the decriminalization of abortion and for abortion law and policy reform to make abortion legal and accessible when woman faces threat to her life or grave risk to her health or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest g in the middle east and north africa ai could support abortion law reform in countries in the region including countries that have been the focus of ai research on vi olence against women such as the gulf cooperation council countries to permit legal and safe access to abor tion for victims of rape or incest who are faced with an unwanted pregnancy h in poland the law permits abortion for women who face ri sk to their health however in practice women facing this risk to their health are denied access to abortion recent decision by the european court of human rights echr ruled against poland in the case of licja tysiac for effectively thwarting her access to an abortion when it was judged necessary to protect her health medical service providers had agreed her pregnancy posed serious threat to her health but refused to give her certificate authorizing an abortion the court criticized the fact that polish law does not contain ny special procedure for handling and resolving cases where there is disagreement over the suitability of therapeutic abortion either between the mother and doctors or between doctors themselves1 ai could look at how obst acles to services in practice violate womens rights with egregious consequences 7 what impact will the abortion policy have on ais research and campaigning agenda ais policy on selected aspects of abortion recognizes the ra nge of conscientiously held views on abortion ai does not seek to declare itself for or against abortion or to take position on the rightness or wrongness of abortion ai also does not seek to counsel individuals as to what choice they should make re garding the continuation or termination of pregnancy in their particular circumstances ai does seek to ensure that women do not face risks to their life or grave risks to their health risks that may result from the denial of medical treatment for complications arising from abortions from womens fear of seeking such treatment because of fears of prosecution or imprisonment or from lack of sexual and reproductive health information under the policy ai will oppose imprisonment and criminal punishment for abortion urge governments to ensure access to health and other facilities for women who face complications arising from abor tion and call for victims of sexual violence who have become pregnant and those whose lives are at risk because of pregnancy to have access to comprehensive range of medical and other suppor t services including the option of safe early medical termination of pregnancy 8 how can ai reconcile its position on abortion with its longstanding work on the death penalty ai sees contradiction between its opposition to the deat h penalty and its policy positio n on selected aspects of abortion ai opposes the death penalty as violation of the right to life and as the ultimate cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment unsafe and illegal abortion also raises issues of the right to life and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of women denying access to safe and legal abortion in case of pregnancy resulting from rape can amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment nying medical treatment to woman who is suffering complications from an abortion whether legal or not can amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and could violate her right to life denying access to safe and legal access to abortion when womans life or health are at risk because of pregnancy is grav violation of her right to life and health 1 httpukreuterscomarticleworld newsidukl2015428920070320pagenumber2 4 the lack of safe legal abortion services is recognized as one of the leading causes of preventable maternal death worldwide the millennium development goals include goa l aimed at the reduction of maternal mortality as key to the eradication of extreme poverty according to the millennium project over half million women die every year due to pregnancy related reasons some 70000 of those deaths are attributable to unsafe abortions the human rights treaty bodies have repeatedly addressed unsafe abortion as right to life concern2 the decriminalization of abortion is death penalty issue in its own right in some countries for instance in nigeria ai has campaigned against the death penalty in cases where women were prosecuted on abortionrelated culpable homicide charges 9 does ai recognize that abortion violates the right to life of the fetus ai takes position as to when life begins ais policy on selected aspects of abortio n recognizes that states may impose reasonable gestational limitations on access to abor tion ai will not prescribe particular gestational limitations instead it will judge their reasonableness by ta king into account factors such as the evolving protection needs of the fetus and the health need s and autonomy entitlements of the woman gestational limits that provide exemptions for protecting the life of the woman for example would not be considered reasonable by ai some people believe that life begins at conception and ther efore abortion represents violation of the right of life of fetus such views are sometimes gr ounded in particular religious beliefs international law is silent on the point when life begi ns the convention on the rights of the child has been interpreted as allowing national legislation to specify the moment when childhood or life begins set in different countries at varying points between conception and birth the european court of human rights has found that the issue of when the right to life begins is question to be decided at the national level and has explicitly refrained from finding whether the unborn child is person protected by the right to life provision of the convention the interamerican commission on human rights has found that the reference in the american convention of human rights to respect for the right to life in general from conception implies that the practice of abortion for arbitrary reasons would be contrary to the achr although the achr does not absolutely ban abortion international human rights bodies as well as national legal systems recognize the need for reasonable restrictions on access to abortion for variety of ethical and public hea lth reasons including the health of the pregnant woman and the evolving protection needs of the fetus they also recognize that the protection of the fetus is inseparably bound to the right to health and life of the mother3 10 what does international law say about abortion international regional nd national human rights mechanisms have increasingly addressed unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion as major public health concern and key cause of preventable maternal illness and death ais abortion policy reflects the language of relevant hum an rights treaties and other international and regional instruments the independent expert bodies that interpret international human rights treaties for instance are increasingly supporting the position also expressed in the outcome sensus documents of major international conferences that abortion should be safe and accessible where it is legal and that it should be permitted in cases where pregnancy results from rape or poses risk to the woma ns life or health echoing the call of the 1995 fourth world conference on women for all countries to consider reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal abortions they have also expressed opposition to the imprisonment of women on abortion charges the expert bodies have similarly endorsed states agreement at the 1994 international conference on population and development that g overnments should in all cases provide for the humane treatment and counselling of women who have had recourse to abortion 2 in general comment 28 on the equality of rights between n and women the human rights committee urged when reporting on the right to life protected by article 6 states parties should provide data on birth rates and on pregnancy and childbirth related deaths of women states parties should give information on any measures taken by the state to help women prevent unwanted pregnancies and to ensure that they do not have to undergo lifethreatening clandestine abortions 3 thus for instance the committee on the rights of the child calls on states in implementing the childs right to the high est attainable standard of health to undertake appropriate measures to ensure appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care for mothers 5 the treaty bodies have repeatedly emphasised the need fo r contraception and sex education to be available as appropriate so that unwanted pre gnancies and hence womens rec ourse to abortion are minimized in accordance with the protocol to the african charter on human and peoples rights on the rights of women in africa states must ensure that the right to health of women including sexual and reproductive health is respected and promoted including by protecting the reproductive rights of women by authorizing medical abortion in cases of sexual assault rape incest and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the fetus 11 if the law provides access to abortion to women wh become pregnant as result of rape or incest why does ai also call for decrimina lization in all cases ai believes that where women have been subjected to non consensual sexual intercourse they must be able to access safe abortion services legally in timely manner where access to abortion depends on woman being able to prove that she was victim of rape women face daunting and sometimes insurmountable challenges sexua l violence remains one of the least reported and inadequately investigated and prosecu ted crimes in virtually every country there are many reasons why woman may chose not to report crime of sexual violence rape survivors may be unwilling or unable to meet access requirements such as pressing charges against the perpetra tor obtaining police reports or court authorizations providing forensic evidence of involuntary intercourse or completing other medically unnecessary steps in order to qualify for access to legal abortion within the window of time in which abortion is legally accessible ai calls on states to minimize access requirements to ones that are medically indicated and to develop and implement clear protocols to facilitate prompt referral and access to appropriate care in order to prevent juridical requirements from delaying or standing in the way of necessary care and increasing the likelihood of unsafe abortion they must also train police court officials nd health care providers to understand the need for prompt and compassionate action and to coordinate their services norms governing provision of abortion services should be part of the body of comprehensive professional standards for the overall management of survivors of ra pe covering physical and psychological care emergency contraception treatment for sexually transmitted infecti ons or injuries collecting forensic evidence and counselling and followup care4 12 ai supports the decriminalization of abortion what is the difference between decriminalizing abortion and legalizing it decriminalization means the removal of all criminal penalties including imprisonment fines and other punishments against those seeking obtaining providing information about or carrying out abortions the repeal of laws criminalizing abortion does not deprive states of their rights and obligations to promote health policies including the enforcement of gestational limitations thr ough the enforcement of appropr iate medical regulations legalization is when the state sets up regulator framework on access to abortion services for instance dictating under what circumstances woman may access abortion services regulatory framework may also establish the time limits for abortion and licensing arrangements for abortion providers according to the center for reproductive rights 38 countries treat abortion as crime and provide for criminal sanctions in all circumstances while further 35 treat abortion as crime in all circumstances except when the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother 5 in countries where restrictive laws are enforced women convicted on abor tionrelated charges have been subjected to lengthy prison sentences in nepal for example before the law was changed women were reported to have been imprisoned for life for seek ing or provi ding abortion6 in nigeria women have received the death penalty and other punishments on abortionrelated charges 4 world health organization safe abortion technical and policy guidance for health systems 2003 wwwwhointreproductive healthpublicationssafe_abortionsafe_abortionpdf 5 center for reproductive rights the worlds abortion laws april 2005 httpwwwcrlporgpub_fac_abortion_lawshtml 6 center for reproductive rights abortion in nepal women imprisoned 2002 6 however experience shows that criminalization of abor tion actually has little or impact on rates of abortion but it has dramatic impact on the safety of abortion pro cedures the highest rates of unsafe abortion in the world occur in countries where abortion is crim inalized under most or all circumstances7 unsafe abortion8 is one of the leading causes of maternal mort ality worldwide resulting in some 70000 deaths each year injuries and deaths caused by unsafe abortion harm not only women but also have an adverse impact on their children families and communities ai believes that woman should be imprisoned simply becau she has had an abortion decisions in relation to the continuation or termination of pregnancy are matter of personal conscience to be decided by the woman in consultation with her health service provider free of any fo rm of coercion discrimination or violence depriving woman of her liberty because of profoundly personal decision regarding abortion represents undue interference by the state in womens exercise of her freedom of science and her right to physical and mental integrity ais policy will not call for the legalization of abortio n except for women who require them in cases of unwanted pregnancy as result of rape incest or where pregnancy poses grave risk to the womans health or life denying access to safe and legal abortion in such circumstances amount s to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and is grave violation of womens rights to life and health 13 what position does ai take on sexselective and disabilityselective abortion ai opposes sexselective abortion ais policy does not address disabilityselective abortions which raise complicated issues of fact and are widely debated among ad vocates for the rights of persons with disabilities ais policy does oppose imprisonment or other criminal sanctions for seeking or having sought an abortion whatever the reason for doing so regulation in law and policy may place certain restrictions on access to abortion services but only where these restrictions fulfill human rights or public health goa l and where the restriction is strictly necessary and proportionate ai believes that in order to address sexselective abortion as manifestation of gender discrimination states must take all necessary steps in rms of social policy and regulatory reform toward gender equality and the elimination of gender discrimination si milarly ai believes that in order to address selective abortion on grounds of the potential disability status of the fe where this is manifestation of discrimination on the basis of disability states must take all necessary steps in terms of social policy and regulatory reform towards the elimination of such discrimination such steps in clude creating an enabling environment for people with disabilities and combating stereotypes and prejudices relating to persons with disabilities state intervention at the point of individual decision making must not however criminalize women who seek or have sought abortions because of their k nowledge of the fetus sex or of the po tential disability status of the fetus health service providers should not be imprisoned or suffer any other criminal sanctions for providing information about or carrying out abortions unless they violate reasonable restrictions on the provision of abortion 14 how does ais new position compare to the recent us supreme court decision gonzales v carhart and the standard set forth in roe v wade while amnesty international does not take position on speci fic laws regulating the term ination of pregnancy ai does oppose imprisonment and other criminal sanctions for women and their providers ai therefore opposes the provision of the federal law upheld by the court in carhartthat imposes fines and up to two years in prison for doctors who perform particul ar types of abortions ais policy addresses more limited range of circumstances than the legal standard articulated by the us supreme court in roe v wade and subsequent cases amnestys policy supports decriminalization of abortion access to medical treatment for women who have suffered complications from unsafe abortions and range of medical treatment for women who became pregnant thro ugh rape or incest or whose lives or health are at grave risk due to pregnancy including the opti on of safe early termination of pregnancy 15 where does ais policy stand in relat ion to national laws around the world 7 who 2003 millennium project cook 8 the world health organization defines abortion as unsafe when it is performed by persons lacking the necessary skills or in n environment lacking the minimal standards or both 7 in 72 countries 26 of the worlds population abortion is prohibited altogether or permitted only to save the womans life in all other countries abortion is accessible to preserve physical health 35 countries 101 of worlds population to preserve mental health 20 countries 27 of worlds populatio n and on socioeconomic grounds 14 countries 207 of worlds population in 54 countries 405 of worlds population abortion is accessible without restriction as to reason 9 16 why is ais abortion policy not more comprehensive at the 2005 international council meeting ai decided that it would undertake consultation education and awarenessraising process on possible ai positions on the issu of abortion to enable ai to take an informed decision as to the organizations position should it choose to do so on the question of whether womans right to physical and mental integrity includes her right to rminate her pregnancy subject to reasonable limitations and of whether abortion should therefore be legal safe and accessible to all women ai policy on selected aspects of abortion has been adopted as the outcome of the cons ultation education and awarenessraising process and represents position that is both principled in that it addresses the grave human rights violations that ai works on and is grounded in international standards and pragmatic in that it recognises the diversity of views on the subject of abortion ai is committed fully to work that addresses how human rights violations may result in unwanted pregnancies this includes analyzing how obstacles to womens access to information and contraceptive services are violation of the right to information the right to privacy and th right to health ai continues to work on promoting womens sexual autonomy to ensure that women are able to choose if when how and with whom they engage in sexual relations and ai continues to promote the right of women and girls to be free from all forms of violence including sexual violence by focusing ais work on these issues ai is able to promote womens rights to bodily integrity significantly lowering the risk factors for unwanted pregnancies 17 will there be further discussion of ais aborti on policy at the forthcoming international council meeting the 2007 international council meeting will provide an opportunity for sections to identify strategies for implementing the policy ais work on these issues will need to be developed and evaluated across the movement before ai can make an informed decision about further policy development in relation to these or other aspects of sexual and reproductive rights 18 will ai develop its abortion policy further in the future as with other human rights issues in implementing its po licy on selected aspects of abortion ai will develop and strengthen its expertise on the relevant issues and analyze country situations to assess priorities and identify how it can best work to prevent and end human rights violations linked to abortionrelated laws policies and practices whether ai will need to develop further its policies on abortion and other aspects of sexual and reproductive rights depends on the organizations future evaluation of the work done under the policies that have been adopted 19 some members complained that the consultations with national sections were inadequate andor biased in favor of abortion what do you say to that the consultations and policymaking pro cess have gone on for more than two years with several international meetings at which national chapters were represented had opportunities to present written views and to listen to international experts with diverse views on abortion ai is
