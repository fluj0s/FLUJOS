revised regulations in december 2002 th rules took effect in february 2003 the final rules were generally viewed as less stringent than the proposal fact that strongly influenced how interest groups have responded to them agriculture groups said that the final rules were workable and they were pleased that some of the proposed requirements were scaled back such as changes that would have made thousands more cafos subject to regulati on however some c ontinue to question epas authority to issue portions of the ru many states had been seeking more flexible approaches than epa had proposed nd welcomed the fact that the final rules retain the status quo to large extent environmentalists cont ended that the rules relied too heavily on voluntary measures nd fail to require improved technology

often have been treated differently than other types of businesses under numerous federal and state laws in the area of environmental policy agriculture is virtually unregulat ed by the expansive body of environmental law that has developed in the unite d states in the past 30 years1 some laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and some are structured in such way that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact the clean water act cwa for example expressly exempts most agricultural operations from the laws requirements while under the clean air act caa most agricultural sources are not subject to that laws regulatory programs because most of those sources do not meet the caas minimum emission quantity thresholds one exception to this general policy of exemption from environmental rules is the portion of the livestock industry that i nvolves large intensive animal raising and feeding operations these facilities which include concentrated feeding operations and feedlots are specialized and sign ificant part of the livestock production process largely separate from cropland agriculture certain large animal feeding operations are subject to explicit regula tions under the clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq that are intended to restrict discharges of animal wastes which could degrade the quality of the nations rivers streams lakes and coastal waters however existing regulations promulgate d in the 1970s have not been amended to reflect significant structural and technological changes in some components of the animal agriculture industry that have ccurred particularly during the last two decades in addition manure and wast ehandling and disposal problems from intensive animal production ve begun to receive atte ntion as these facilities increase in size and the effects of these problems reach beyond the industry to affect others in nearby communities in the late 1990s the environmental pr otection agency epa the federal agency responsible for implementing the cwa in itiated review of the existing cwa rules that govern waste discharges from large animal feeding operations the review was part of overall administration

production has become denser and more spa tially concentrated the amount of manure nutrients relative to the assimilative capacity of land available on farms for application has grown especia lly in high production areas including the central northern states from new york to nebraska west coast states and arizona and scattered areas through the southeast according to usda in 1997 66000 operati

phorus5 usda believes that where manur nutrients exceed the assimilative capacity of region the potential is high for runoff and leaching of nutrients and subsequent water quality problems geographically areas with excess farmlevel nutrients correspond to areas with increasin g numbers of confined animals and farms with poultry accounted for about twothirds of the farmlevel excess nitrogen and over onehalf of the farmlevel excess phosphorus some of these operations can export manure to surrounding properties even accountin g for offsite transfers usda believes that the number of coun ties with excess manure nutrients has increased by approximately 60 ce 1982 and that in 1997 165 counties had countylevel excess manure nitrogen and 374 counties had potential excess manure phosphorus counties with potential anima l waste problems tend to be grouped together nearly all of the counties with excess nitrogen were in the southeast in region extending from arkansas and louisi ana to virginia counties with excess phosphorus were also numerous throughout the southeast as well as in the northeast including the delmarva peninsula extr eme northwest california and the great

identify agriculture as the leading contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes and the fifth leading contributor to impairments in the nations estuaries animal feeding operations are only subset of the agriculture category but 29 states specifically identified animal feeding operations as contributing to water quality impairment 9 the primary pollutants associated with animal wastes are nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter solids pathogens and odorousvolatile compounds animal waste also contains sa lts and trace elements and to lesser extent antibiotics pesticides and hormones pollutants in animal waste can impact waters through several possible pathwa ys including surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges leaching into soil and groundwater and releases to air including subs equent deposition back to land and surface waters pollutants associated with animal waste can also originate from variety of other sources such as cropland municipal and industrial discharges and urban runoff the most dramatic ecological impacts associated with manure pollutants in surface waters are massive fish kills hi ghly publicized incidents have occurred in nearly every state from california to maryland in addition manure pollutants can seriously disrupt aquatic sy stems by overenriching wate r in the case of nutrients or by increasing turbidity in the case of solids processes that can disrupt aquatic ecosystems excess nutrients cause fastgrowing algae blooms that reduce the penetration of sunlight in the water column and reduce the mount of available oxygen in the water thus reducing fish and shellfish habitat and affecting fish and invertebrates epas 2000 water quality inventory report indicates that excess algal growth alone is among the leading cau ses of impairment in lakes ponds and reservoirs variety of pollutants in animal waste can also affect human health over 150 pathogens in livestock manure are associated with risks to humans these include the bacteria coli and salmonella species and the protozoa giardia species contact with pathogens contained in manure during swimming or boating can result in infections of the skin eye ear nose and thro at shellfish such as oysters clams and mussels can carry toxins produced by some types of algae that are associated with excess nutrients these can affect people who eat contaminated shellfish further contaminants from manure can also affect human health through drinking water sources and can result in increased drinking water treatment costs for example nitrogen in manure and liquid waste can be tr ansported to drinking water as nitrates which are associated with human health risks and which epa has identified as the most widespread agricultural contaminant in drinking water wells elevated nitrate levels can cause nitrate poisoning par ticularly in infants this is known as methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrom nitrate contamination of privatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs6 wells that has been linked to nearby liv estock and poultry operations has occurred in several areas including dela ware the maryland eastern shore and north carolina previous clean water act regulations since it was enacted in 1972 the clean wa ter acts predominant focus has been the control of wastewater from manufact uring and other indus trial facilities and municipal sewage treatment plants termed point sources wh ich are regulated by discharge permits as point source po llution has been brought under regulation uncontrolled discharges in the form of runoff from nonpoint sources have become not only greater in absolute terms but also proportionally larger share of remaining water pollution problems nonpoint pollu tion occurs in conjunction with surface erosion of soil by water and surface runoff of rainfall or snowmelt from diffuse areas such as farm and ranch nd construction sites minin g and timber operations and residential streets and yards most agricultural activities are considered to be nonpoint sources since they do not discharg wastes from clearly identifiable pipes outfalls or similar point conveyances nonpoint sources are not subject to the permit compliance and enforcement regime that applies to point sources under the cwa most afos are consid ered to be nonpoint sources however cafos large afos are specifically defined in the law as point sources and are treated in manner similar to other industria l sources of pollution such as factories they are subject to the acts prohibition ag ainst discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without permit in 1974 and 1976 epa issued regulations defining the term cafo for purposes of permit

dairy cattle swine poultry chickens and turkey s ducks sheep or horses discharge permits issued pursuant to th part 122 rules under the acts national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program establish limits on the amounts and types of pollutants that can be released into waterways permits are issued for fixed term not to exceed five years and must be renewed thereafter npdes permits may be issued by epa or state authorized by epa to implement the npdes program currently 45 states have been authorized by epa to administer this permit program in lieu of epa oklahoma has been authorized to issue permits for most sources but not for cafos the cwa allows states to impose additional requirement s on permittees and to regu late more conduct and more types of operations than those governed by the federal npdes rules the two basic types of npdes permits are individual permits which are tailored for specific facility and general permits issued by permitting authority to cover multiple facilities with similar characteristics becau of the large number of cafos epa and states increasingly are using general permits to regulate these facilities epas regulations define cafo based on the length of time animals are confined the number of animals confined and whether or not the facility directly discharges pollutants into waters of the untied states

of animal units10 at the facility the facility is cafo if it holds more than 1000 animal units if the facility holds from 300 to 999 animal units the facility is cafo if pollutants are discharg ed from manmade conveyance or are discharged directly into waters passing over across or through the site animal feeding operations that in clude fewer than 300 animal units may be designated as cafos if epa or the permitting authority determines that the facility contributes significantly to water pollution the regulations nominally impose zero discharge limitation on regulated operations because they prohibit discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except in the event of discharges that might occur during the worst 24hour storm in 25year period termed the 25year 24hour storm exception these regulations do not specifically address discharges to surface water or leaching to groundwater that may occur from animal wast or manure which are applied to land nor do they address odor problems from anima l agriculture operations these topics if regulated at all have been subject to varied state and local authority not federal law or regulation problems with cafo regulation number of problems with the cafo regu latory system that had existed since the 1970s were widely recognized th problems limited its effectiveness in preventing environmental probl ems from livestock production less than 30 of cafos have cwa permits about 4100 out of the approximately 12700 that meet the epa regulatory definitions described above one explanation is the historic emphasis by federal and state permitting authorities on re gulating other large industrial and municipal dischargers rather than agricultural sources since most of agriculture is not subject to the act another factor is that the 25year 24hour storm exemp tion has allowed large number of operations to avoid obtaining discharge permits if they discharge waste only during such storm event some sources went unregulated

states carry out most npdes permit ac tivities the nature and scope of state programs for regulating feedlots is an important consideration in evaluating overall effectiveness of current efforts an epa compendium of state programs for managing animal feedlots illustrates the variations and complexity of state activities12 according to epa state regulati on of afos and cafos often involves both federal and state laws nd regulations and several diffe rent statelevel agencies with numerous variations in approaches requirements and jurisdiction fortyfive states are authorized by epa to implement the base npdes program to regulate cafos seven states regulate cafos exclusively under this authority while 32 states administer state npdes cafo program in combination with some other state permit license or aut horization such as construc tion or operating permit six states while generally authorized to implement the npdes program have chosen to regulate cafos under sepa rate state nonnpdes programs further five states are not authorized to administer the np des program and ep retains responsibility to issue cafo permits in three of th states epa permits are the sole cafo

widely in defining what is cafo h ence the scope of the regulatory program permit conditions and siting requirements details for waste management plans if required and enforcement procedures because of the wide variability it is diffi cult to say whether the glass is half full or halfempty with regard to the adequacy of state regulatory activities epa concludes that state nonnpdes afo prog rams are often more stringent than npdes programs and often extend coverage to smaller classes of facilities further according to epa the implementation of state nonnpdes programs often receives more state agency attention than implementation of npdes programs with several states actively choosing not to use npdes permits however the gao recently found inconsistent and inad equate implementa tion of cwa requirements by states that have been authorized to administer cafo permitting permits do not meet all epa requirements and several states ev aluated by gao do not issue any type of permit to cafos thereby leaving facilities and their wastes essentially unregulated13 in revised cafo rules proposed in decem ber 2000 discussed below epa said that the number of nonnpdes permits issued to afos greatly exceeds the number of npdes permits issued there are n early 20 times more nonnpdes permits many would not meet the standards for approval as npdes permits epa said and because they are not npdes permits none meets the requirement for federal enforceability14 revising the cafo regulations in the early 1990s environmental groups ed epa for failure to revise existing clean water act permit

clean water act rules for cafos and more than dozen other industrie s under the consent decree which has been modified several times revised cafo rules were to be proposed by december 2000 and

operations the clinton administrati on proposed rules to modify the existing cafo regulations in december 200016 to address shortcomings in the existing regulations the rules propos ed to clarify the cond itions under which an afo is cafo and is therefore subject to permit requirements it proposed to increase the number of facilities required to obtain clean water act permits and to restrict land application of wastes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs10 17 66 federal register 58556 november 21 2001epa coproposed and asked for public comment on two alternative approaches for defining cafos the first would reta in the existing threetier structure see page 7 but with modifications and clearer criteria regarding the middle tier 1000 animal units or more would be cafos operations with 300 to 999 animal units would be cafos but could be exempt from permits by demonstrating potential to discharge wastes and fewer than 300 animal units would be cafos only if designated by the permit writer the second option pr oposed twotie r structure 500 animal units or more would be fined as cafos fewer than 500 animal units would be cafos only if designated by the permit writer epa estimated that under the proposed twotier structure 25590 operations would need permit compared with 12700 under existing regula tions under revised threetier structure 31930 operations would need permit while an additional 7400 in the middle tier were potentially ffected but these operations were expected to be able to avoid permitting by certifying that they are not cafos in addition permitting requirements w ould be extended to some livestock categories not previously regulated ie drymanure poultry operations and stand alone immature swine and heif er operations epa also proposed to require that permitted facilities develop and implement sitespecific plans which identify the amount of nutrients generated at the facility and determine rates for the application of the waste to agricultural land fi nally it proposed copermitting system in which permits would cover not just the grower or farmer but also corporate owners integrators who contract out to farmers to raise the animals or poultry and exercise substantial operational control over the facility there was 120day public comment pe riod following publication of the proposal in the federal register in january 2001 and on march 26 2001 the epa administrator authorized an additional 75day public comment period through july 30 epa held nine public hearings to re view the proposal in the spring and early summer of 2001 because of the change in administrations immediately following release of the proposal ne w appointees at epa undert ook detailed and thorough review of the proposal and public comment s on it before releasing

changes to certain aspects of the proposed cafo rules the agency did not formally repropose the rules but it outlined the types of changes being consid ered and sought additional public comment on the specific data and issues identified in the notice for example epa said it was considering alternative definitions of what type of feedlot is concentrated feedlot for certain types of livestock

options public response the clinton administrationproposed rule s were highly cont roversial for many reasons livestock and poultry groups as well as general agriculture advocacy groups opposed the rules arguing that they would impose excessive economic burden on farmers and ranchers they so criticized the proposal for taking uniform national approach to problems th at they asserted were better suited to management by state and local agencies environmental groups generally supported the rules while arguing that parts should be strengthened based on their concern that excessive nutrients and other contaminants in animal waste are polluting waterways and groundwater although leng thy agency review of public comments on regulatory proposal is not unusual ma ny in these groups feared that epa was planning to weaken the clinton proposal based on discussion in the first and second nodas states were divided on the rules some favored uniform national approach to regulating animal waste pollution from the livestock industry based on strengthened epa rules while many favored greater state flexibility states were concerned about diverting re sources to cafo permitting nd thus undermining other water quality programs congress expressed some interest in the revised rules in may 2001 house transportation and infrastructure subco mmittee held an oversight hearing on the proposal the hearing focused on impacts and costs on animal agriculture producers especially small producers the final revised cafo rules after nearly two years review of the clinton administration proposal epa issued final revised cafo regulations on december 11 2002 the new rules were published in the federal register on february 12 2003 with an effective date of april 14 200319 the regulations include number of elements of the proposal andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs12 20 the threshold for duck operations with dry manurehandling systems was changed from 5000 to 30000 animals for large operations thus reducing the number of regulated operations from 157 under the previous rules to 25 under the final rulesa number of modifications with retention of much of the

design standard st orage structures must be designed and maintained to contain the runoff from 100year 24hour storm event the final rules include provision that was not in the proposal allowing existing cafos to request per mit limits based on sitespecific alternative technologies established by the permitting authority to encourage innovative technologies according to epa under the new rules alternativ technology limits are required to provide pollutant control equal to or better than under the baseline rules best management practices the revised rules include best management practices bmps for land application and animal production areas bmps are measur or methods that have been determined to be the most effective practical means of preventing or reducing pollution from nonpoint sources the requirements for land application areas are to ensure the proper application of manure litter and other process wastes to land that the cafo controls they include measures such as specified setbacks from streams vegetated buffers and determina tion of application rates to minimize the transport of phosphorus and nitrogen from the field to surface waters in accordance with technical standards of the permitting authority bmps for animal production areas also are specified including daily and w eekly inspections maintenance of depth markers in lagoons and ot her

was finalized25 epa also estimated that the environmental benefits of the final rules such as improved surface water quality and reduced water treatment co sts will result in annual estimated economic benefits ranging from 204 to 355 million 2001 dollars26 annual benefits of the proposed rules were estimate d to be 146 to 163 million 1999 dollars economic costs of the rules the proposed and final

million for large cafos 39 million for medium cafos and 4 million for facilities that are designated as cafos federal and state permitting authorities were projected to incur 9 million per year in costs to imp lement the rules estimated annual incremental costs of the proposed rule s were 831930 million for cafo operators plus 68 million for permittin g authorities 1999 dollars epa also

predominantly beef cattle operations28 comparing the proposed and final rules one obvious difference between the propos ed and final rule s was retention of the previous definition and numerical categorization of regulated facilities commenting on the proposals options for ither twotier structure or modified threetier structure epa said that it agreed with commenters including many states that changing to twotier structure woul d be very disruptive to ongoing programs epa also said that it did not adopt the proposed new set of conditions for determining when facility in the middl of the threetier structure 300 to 999 animals is cafo because doing so would not necessarily have improved the clarity or effectiveness of the rules as intended but would ve caused substantial permitting burdens and impo sed costs on essentially all operations above 300 animals29 the previous discussion concerning cost s and benefits of the revised rules partially illustrates difficultie s in comparing impacts of the proposed and final rules some differences in epas discussions of the two are notable but they do not necessarily affect outcomes for example the 2000 proposed rules stated that of the 12700 medium and large cafos that should ve been subject to permits under the previous rules but that permits had b een issued for approximately 2270 facilities in the final rules while continuing to acknowledge that few ope rations have permits epa stated that the number of permitted f acilities is 410030 the notice accompanying the final rules stated as result of todays action epa is regulating close to 60 percent of all manure generated by operations that confine animals31 however the proposed rules stated that an estimated 49 of total manure would be contro lled by retaining cafo definition threshold of 1000 animals as adopted in the final rules and would increase to 64 to 72 under the regulatory options that epa coproposed in d ecember 2000 which would have adopted definition with lower threshold32 the differences in estimated pollutant reductions and amounts of ma nure controlled under the propos ed and final rules were not fully explained concerning amounts of manure controlled part of the difference between the two could be explained by th final rules inclusion of more poultryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs17 33 however in the proposed rules epa stated that for purposes of estimating compliance costs it assumed that all cafos subject to re vised regulations are currently in compliance with the existing regulatory pr ogram even though it recognized as practical matter that this is not true epa did not estimate the additional costs of complying with existing requirements because it did not consider those co sts part of the incremental costs of revised rules 66 federal register 3080 january 12 2001 34 us environmental protection agency environmental and economic analysis of proposed revisions to the npdes regulation nd the effluent guide lines for concentrated animal feeding operations january 2001 p 418 35 telephone conversation paul shriner us ep office of water office of science and technology march 3 2003operations and standalone immature animal operations than under the previous rules except for the fact that the proposed rules also included these additional operations in comparing impacts of the revised requirements to baseline neither the proposed nor the final rules were precisely clear about what baseline was utilized consequently evaluating impacts of chan ges is difficult the baseline could be assuming full compliance and control of po llutant runoff from feedlots by the 12700 operations covered by the previous rules alternatively the baseline could be the partial compliance and corresponding curre nt water discharges resulting from that fact that 30 or less of covered f acilities are actually ope rating under npdes permits if the baseline assumed complete current compliance which is not occurring in fact then the incremental pollutant reduction improvements of the revised regulatory requirements would be less than if the baseline assumed partial compliance by currently regulated facilities there is some indication that for estimating environmental impr ovements the baseline of the proposed rules was current partial compliance with previous rules33 while in the final rules the baseline was assumed to be complete compliance with the existing rules that might explain the large estimated differences in pollutant reduction between the two see for example the above discussion about estima tes of reduced sediment loadings and metals discharges34 these differences are not satisfactorily ex plained or addressed in the final rules but they are significant for evaluating the regulation in response to inquiries about these issues an epa official indicated that during review of the rules the agency completed more extensive modeling of previously available data to assess impacts including disaggregation for better geogra phic treatment to ddress differences in climate soil type and conservation practices and that the improved analysis contributed to the appare nt differences between th proposal and final rules35 reactions to the final rules the final rules were generally viewed as less stringent than the december 2000 proposal fact that strongly influenced how interest groups ve responded to themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs18 36 on most issues affecting agriculture there of ten is subset of interests most affected and likely to express views on legislation regulati ons etc their views may differ or coalesce on given issue the cafo rules discussed he re were of considerable interest to groups representing livestock and poultry producers such as the national chicken council port producers council and national cattlemens beef association as well as groups that represent agriculture as whole such as the farm bureau in epas discussion of the rules eg the federal register notice accompanying the final rules when referring to industry it did not distinguish among these gr oups nor does this crs report it appears that at least in epas judgment these groups generally reflected similar interests and concerns on the cafo rule issues other ag riculture industry groups representing interests of cropland producers for example had limited involvement in these rulesagriculture industry groups36 indicated that they believed the final rules were workable and they were generally pleased that some of the proposed requirements were scaled back including reduced definition thresholds and copermitting of corporate owners of livestock as well as of farmers who actually raise the animals however some continue to question epas authority to issue portions of the rules many states too had been seeking more flexible approaches than epa originally proposed and thus welcomed the fact that the final rules retain the status quo to large extent impacts on states will vary depending on the changes in existing state programs needed to comply with the new requirements however both industry and states were greatly concerned about ad equacy of resources to implement the requirements environmentalists conte nded that the rules relied too heavily on voluntary measures to control runoff instead of mandating strict compliance with national standards and fa il to require improved technology in the weeks immediately after publication of the rule s environmental groups and several agriculture industry groups filed lawsuits challenging the rules in number of different federal courts technology requirements environmental groups criticized epa for omitting provision in the proposal that would have required zero discharg from the cafos production area to ground water that has direct hydrologic connection to surface water hydrologic connection refers to the interflow and exchange between surface impoundments such as lagoons and surface water through an underground corridor or ground water the proposal would have required cafos to determine whether such direct hydrologic connection exists and if so to monito r ground water up gradient and down gradient to ensure that zero discharge to ground wa ter is achieved the proposal also would have adopted stringent zero discharge standard for regulated swine veal and poultry cafos with exception for chronic storm overflows this issue was key concern to environmentalists who point out that rural areas where most cafos are located often rely on ground water for dri nking water supplies in addition they criticized the final rules for omitting propos ed special requirements that would have restricted land application of wastes to frozen snowcovered or saturated soil in the final rules epa explained that the pr oposals were rejected because pollutant discharges to surface water via ground water or as result of application to frozen or saturated soil are highly dependent on sitespecific variables such as climate distance to surface water etc thus national technologybased standard is inappropriate according to epahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs19 further environmentalists asserted that the final rules fail to require performance standards consistent with the best available technology the rules perpetuate that status quo they said becau they do not require phaseout of the use of lagoons many envir onmental advocates believe that lagoons are outmoded technology that can pollute both surface nd ground water as result of weather events human error and system failures and thus are an unacceptable risk to public health and the environment likewise dvocates believe that sprayfields where waste is sprayed onto crops or pasturela nd pose significant risks and many support the position that manure waste that is land pplied should be injected or incorporated into the soil industry groups on the other hand dis puted environmentalists belief that stringent national standards requiring zero discharge would encourage development of new technologies in industrys view th previous rules zero discharge standard even with the allowance for chronic stor m event discharges had virtually ensured the use of lagoons and holding ponds to st ore cafo wastewater on site industry urged epa to adopt final rules that would encourage alternative technologies they argued that cafos like other point s ources regulated under the clean water act should be allowed to treat wastes to an established level of quality that does not impair lakes or streams and to release treated wastes to the environment the final rules appeared to respond to industrys c oncern in this area while retaining the previous rules nominal zero discharge st andard they also allow cafo to request permit based on sitespecifi c alternative technologies tablished by the permitting authority that are equivalent to the baseline standard or better epa believed that this flexibility would encourage innovative technol ogies but environm entalists believed that allowing cafos to treat and release animal waste is weaker than the previous rules and effectively allows alternative technologies to have discharge that may harm the environment air emissions environmentalists also were disappointed that the final rules did not address or restrict emissions of air pollutants afos can emit various pollutants including ammonia hydrogen sulfide methane volatile organic com pounds and particulate matter environmental impacts can vary depending on the design and operation of the facility scientists generally believe that emissions present number of issues of environmental concern but not large public health problem although more research on public health impacts is required so air emissions are important on local scale hydrogen sulfide odor and othe rs are significant nationally or globally ammonia which can be redeposited to earth and contribute to water quality degradation and the greenhouse gas meth ane industry groups pointed out that water pollution control technol ogies which were the subject of the cafo rules do not address air emissions and that prove n air abatement tec hnologies are needed before adopting regulations 2002 national research council repor t recommended deve loping improved approaches to estimating and measuring

emissions nd methane emissions by 12 and 11 respectively38 resources needed to implement the rules adequacy of resources to implement the revised regulations is an important issue for the animal agricultu re industry nd states and these groups focus on the need for federal support to meet the new federal requirements livestock operators face costs for manure handling requirements developing and implementing nutrient management plans and recordkeeping key federal financia l assistance program for producers is the environmental quality incentives program eqip administered by the natural

nonpoint source pollution management grants can be used by afos but generally not by cafos which are regu lated as point sources under that act 2003 gao report found that neither states nor epa are equipped to implement the program having not made pr ovisions for additional staffing to process permits conduct required inspections and take enforcement actions40 gao reported that the changes will create resource and administrative challenges for states and meeting these new demands w ill require additional personnel however most of the states reviewed by gao cannot hire add itional staff and would have to reassign personnel from other programs epa too will have to redepl oy staff resources gao commented in the report on epas limited past oversight of state cafo programs and concluded that the agency will need to increase its oversight of state regulatory programs to ensure that th new requirements are properly adopted and carried out by states for state agencies that implement the npdes permit program the principal existing source of financial assistance is grants under section 106 of the clean water act which states already use for various activities to develop and carry out water pollution control programs states curre ntly use section 106 grants supplemented by state resources for standard setting permitting planning enforcement and related activities in light of budgetar problems confronting many states it is unclear how state agencies will find the resources needed to carry out their responsibilities under the revised rules wit hout reducing resources for other important activities other industry views fundamentally agricultural interests emphasize that most farmers are diligent stewards of the environment since they depend on natural re sources of the land water and air for their livelihoods and th ey too directly experience adverse impacts on water and air quality when they do occur many believe that environmental problems caused by some individual farm ers do not require national solutions or standards and most are very concerned that regulatory requirements will adversely affect the economic viability of the industry especially compared with international competitors while agriculture industry groups reportedl considered the final rules workable especially with increased resources provi ded by the 2002 farm bill it was also clear that many objected to some basic elements of the regulations that were not eliminated or were changed little from the december 2000 proposal these concerns were reflected in comments on the proposed rules for example livestock and generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs22 41 within agriculture there are some groups th at reflect many interests similar to those of environmental groups such as the sustai nable agriculture coalition which promotes policies based on economically profitable environmentally sound familyfarm based systems of agriculture and livestock producti on methods at small and midsize operations that do not use animal confinement cerning cafo issues sustainable agriculture groups favored strategies based on nationally uniform standards alternatives to large cafo production public accountability in issuance of cafo permits and legal liability for corporate owners of confined animalsagriculture groups questioned epas basic au thority to impose number of the rules requirements these groups generally opposed eliminating the previous permitting exemption for facilities that discharge only in large storm event saying that such operations should not be covered by permits industry also opposed im posing on cafos duty to apply for permits and questioned epas legal authority for requiring permits from cafos that claim not to discharge pollutants since in their view the clean water act only requires permits for actual discharges some questione d epas finding that many cafos are discharging without permit which epa d cited as key reason for revising the regulations and said that vol untary programs are working adequately to address the excess manure issue some objected to putting the burden on the cafo to show that it does not discharge into waterways and argued that the cafo should not be required to apply for permit in the absence of evidence of an actual discharge some industry commenters also argued that epa lacks authority to include permit requirements governing land application of manure and process wastewater because in their view runoff from land application areas is nonpoint source discharge that is not subject to clean water act permitting epas view is that land application areas are integral to cafo operations and because there have been significant discharges from them nonregu latory controls alone are insufficient other views of environmental groups41 environmental groups were critical of several other provisions in the proposal that were omitted from the final rules chief among these was epas decision not to require copermitting of both the farmer who raises the livestock and the large companies that actually own the animals and contract with farmers this was one of the most controversial parts of the proposed rules environmental advocates believe that copermitting makes large corporations responsible for wastes produced on the farms with which they contract while th agriculture industry said it would make corporations liable for waste manageme nt decisions over which they have practical control environmental groups also had strongly favored lowering the threshold for defining when an afo is cafo which would ensure that more operations are subject to uniform cont rols and enforcement these groups criticized changes in the final rules that they believed will limit public involvement and oversight in particular they said that by not requiring thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs23 42 technologies are discussed extensively in us environmental protection agency development document for the final revisions to the national pollutant discharge elimination system regulation and the effl uent guidelines for concentrated animal feeding operations december 2002 chapter 8nutrient management plans be publicly developed and available the public will not have adequate access to the plans many environmental advocates favored including nutrient management plans in cafo permit which would make the plans an enforceable element of the permit agricu lture industry groups argued that the plan would contain proprietary in formation and that making it publicly available would both discourage innovation in developing wa ste management tec hnologies and could make cafos vulnerable to lawsuits epa pointed out that the final rules require cafos to submit nnual nutrient manageme nt reports that w ill be public and will provide information on numbers of anima ls amounts of manur generated and how the manure is being handled advocates also said that by not requiring that nutrient management plans be developed by cer tified expert or be approved by the permitting authority as had been propose d the revised rules essentially allow farmers to write their own requirements without technical or permitting authority involvement issues for congress implementation of the revised cafo rules will present large challenges for those who are directly affected by the re gulations the animal agriculture industry states and epa as well as interested members of the public likewise several issues of congressional interest are apparent adequacy of funding requests for funding assistance to help affected groups comply with the rules are expected to increase especially by feedlot operators s eeking eqip funds however even at the higher eqip contract limit provided by the 2002 farm bill 450000 per farmer there was concern that the ceiling would effectively diminish some farmers interest in the program the more recent 2008 farm bill pl 110 246 lowers the eqip payment limit to 300000 per entity in addition both states and epa are likely to face difficulties in m eeting new program and permitting responsibilities within current budget ary constraints at issue is whether adequate resources will be provided and funding priority given as needed research needs large number of trea tment technologies and best management practices exist for pollution prevention at animal feeding operations as well as for handling storage treatment and land application of wastes42 epa believes however that storage lagoons and sprayfields have been and remain the most widely used technologies research to courage new technologies and demonstration of technologies nd practices that may pose less environmental risk could be environmentally and economicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31851crs24 beneficial in this regard research ers may be interested in program established by the 2002 farm bill that authorizes usda to provide innovation grants to leverage fede ral investment in environmental protection through the use of eqip including demonstrating innovative nutrient management t echnology systems for afos in addition the national research councils recent report on air emissions from afos recommends that epa and usda aggressively pursue research in that area and identifies priorities for short and longterm research programs oversight of implementation as noted previously gao has been critical of epas past oversight of state cafo permitting activities and epa has acknowledged that ne ither federal nor state agencies have previously given much priority to regulating feedlot wastes at issue now will be how epa and states demonstrate through planning and actions their commitment to implement the new requirements usdas commitment to supporting farm ers implementation of the rules also will be of interest is federal legislation needed there also is the issue of whether the revised regulatory program reflects congress intent and expectations concerning manage ment of animal waste and its environmental impacts some stions of congressional intent were raised in legal challenges brought by agriculture industry and environmental groups to the rules such as did congress intend to authorize epa to regulate land application of wastes at the same time some may conclude that legislation amending the clean water act is needed to guide epa states and industry by clarifying congress current view of key issues compared with that acts enactment in 1972 considering for example whether the scope of requirements should be narrowe d alternatively some who see gaps in parts of the final rules may favor legisla tion to broaden requirements for example concerning copermitting or technology standards finally some may believe that another legislative vehicle entirely such as the farm bill administered by usda is more appropriate t ool for addressing animal waste management issues
