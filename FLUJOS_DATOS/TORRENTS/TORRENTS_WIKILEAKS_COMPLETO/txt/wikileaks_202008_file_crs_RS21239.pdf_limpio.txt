fund supported by tax on coal was established to finance the benefits but the fund has chronically been in deficit the tr easury department has proposed refinancing that would eventually extinguish the accumulated debt this report will be updated s hould significant legislative actions occur it has long been known that working in coal mines was associated with lung disorders but official recognition of specifi c disease caused by coaldust coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp now widely known as black lung first came in 1942 in the united kingdom cwp occurs as dust particles accumulate in the lungs the simple stage entails reduction in lung function if it progresses to the complicated stage scarring and degeneration of the lung ssue occurs physical activity becomes very difficult and the disease become s progressive nd irreversible after the scope of the problem in the united states was highlighted by studies in the 1960s and after major mine disaster in farmington wv congress passed the federal coal mine health and safe ty act pl 91173 in 1969 together with subsequent amendments the benefits progra m is codified in 30 usc 901 et seq in addition to comprehensive safety enforcement regime the act mandated limits on miners dust exposure and provided income and medical support to those who become disabled by black lung dust control has yielded some success in reduction of new cases but nearly 5000 new claims are still be ing received each year and more than 60000 primary beneficiaries remain on the rollshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21239crs2 1 in fy1998 responsibility for managing part b claims those originating before june 30 1973 were transferred from the social security administrationbenefits former miners who suffer total disability or death due to cwp or related diseases are eligible for medical and income benefits the medical benefit consists of diagnostic testing available for all claimants and serv ices needed due to the disease including drugs durable medical equipment home nursing visits and hospitaliz ation the base rate of the income benefit is equal to threeeighths of the federal salary for an employee in grade gs2 step 1 ie base rate of 518 per month in calendar year 2002 the benefit is augmented if the miner or his survivor has dependents up to as much as double the base rate when there are three or more depende nts black lung benefits are not subject to federal income tax but may be taxed by the stat the benefits may be subject to offsets depending on when the initial claim was made against various other income support systems such as workers compensation di sability insurance and social security the program is administered by the divisi on of coal mine workers compensation which is component of the office of workers compensation programs in the department of labor1 decisions can be appealed to the office of administrative law judges then to the independent benefits revi ew board and finally to the us courts of appeal eligibility definition of black lung defining and diagnosing the medical conditions that should qualify one for compensation have been contentious issues throughout the legislative regulatory and adjudicative history of the program the stat utory definition of black lung is less specific than the currently accepted medical criteria for cwp the law makes person eligible if one has chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae including respiratory and pulmonary impairments arising out of coal mine employment 30 usc 902b this clearly includes clinicallydefined cwp but it could also include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd eg bronchitis emphysema or asthma while cwp is almost always associated with mine empl oyment copd has many other common causes including smoking the current departme nt of labor regulation 20 cfr 718201 explicitly allows for copd to be compensated as black lung but the department emphasizes that the burden of pe rsuasion lies with the claimant to show that the disease arose out of his coal mine employment another point of contention has been the requirement of being totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis the difficulty again is that other causes may lead to the disability in question the current regulation 20 c fr 718 204 requires that if miner with black lung also has disabling impairment unrelated to mine employment then the black lung must at least be substantially contributing cause of his disabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21239crs3 2 the regulations were stayed upon court challe nge by the national mining association but the stay was lifted and the regulations upheld in ruling on august 9 2001 billings deborah court upholds new black lung rules daily labor report august 10 2001 p a11a12evidence and procedure one of the motivating factors behind the black lung program was to overcome what were perceived as the burdensome evid entiary requirements of state workers compensation laws in support of this objec tive the act mandated five presumptions to facilitate the consideration of claims two of which still apply to new claims generally those filed after 1981 these are 1 that if miner suffering from pneumoconiosis was employed for 10 years or more in coal mines then there is rebuttable presumption that his disease arose out of that employment and 2 that if miner suffering from chronic dust disease of the lung meets certain diagnos tic standards by xrays biopsy or autopsy then there is an irrebuttable presumption of qualifying tota l disability 30 usc 921c moreover the definition of total disability is less stringent than in most other laws miner is considered totally disabled if black lung prevents him from engaging in his usual mine employment 30 usc 902f1 the criteria in the act and amendments have been further elaborated by administrative and judicial cases and by regulation in december 2000 the department of labor issued the first comprehensive revi sion of its regulations for the program since 19832 the standards in regard to eviden tiary development now provide that the claimant is entitled to complete pulmonary evaluation performed by physician of his choice fro m list of qualified specialists both sides claimant and mine operator are limited in how much medical evidence they may present two each of chest xray interpretations pulmonary function tests blood gas studies and medical reports also one of each category of evidence may be submitted by each side in the rebuttal phase the testimony of the miners treating physician may be given additionalweight if heshe is adjudged to have indepth understanding of the miners condition in testing pulmonary function it is mandatory to use the flowvolume loop method spirometry testing and if claim is denied subsequent cla im may be made year or more later if matters have changed eg th miners condition has worsened it was expected that the changes of 2000 w ould lead to an increase in the number of successful claims but it is still too early to quantify any such effect according to the united mine workers only 7 of claims were being accepted under the previous regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21239crs4 3 title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act pl 91173 4 to date state has been found to provide adequate coverage the most recent formal finding to that effect is in the federal register december 20 2000 p 80054 5 the 1981 amendment reversed that tre nd making claims harder to sustain 6 at present the tax is 110 per ton for undergroundmined coal 055 for surfacemined or 44 of the sale price if that is lessfinancing and administration evolution of the program virtually all of the expectations for the black lung benefits act3 when it was enacted in 1969 eg the numbers of claims submitted or approved we re contradicted by subsequent experience corrective gislation was adopted in 1972 1977 and 1981 including the establishment of trust fund fi nancing in 1977 but resu lts have continued to be at variance with expectati ons as consequence the trust fund has perennially been in position of growing deficit the program initially provided part b benefit intended to deal with existing or even deceased cases caused by prior years of coal dust exposure part b was funded by general revenues and administered by the social security administration it was expected that most states would bring new black lung cases into their workers compensation laws in accord with general standards of the new federal law4 the number of new cases would rapidly dwindle due to the dust control meas ures mandated by the mine safety act and in the interim federal part c benefit administered by th labor department and funded mostly by the employers of the claimants responsible operators would serve as temporary backstop what happened though wa s that claims were much more numerous than expected while it proved difficult to find responsible operators litigate their challenges and collect from them even so th rate of claim rejec tions was high enough to produce widespread dissatisfaction and elicit liberalization of criteria via the 1972 and 1977 amendments5 in response to these developments trus t fund financing was established in 1977 to reduce reliance on the treasury and make th mining industry cover the lions share of costs this was done by levying tax on coal production6 interestingly the program then had in place financing mechanism which was mirrored few years later in the much larger environmental pr ogram known as superfund recovery of costs so far as possible from responsible parties backed up by general levy on the industry still costs continually outpaced revenueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21239crs5 7 the older part b benefits are financed from general revenues rather than the trust fund and totaled 509 million in fy2000 as of 2000 there were 89000 part b beneficiaries including 12000 miners and 62000 widows more than 80 of whom were over 75 years of agefinancial results as shown in table 1 the population of pa rt c beneficiaries7 on the rolls has been declining by about 5 per year over the st decade the decline has resulted from combination of declining employment in unde rground coal mining better control of dust hence fewer new cases and passing away of older beneficiaries the generational transition is evident in an almoststable population of widows as miners have died women have been transferred from dependent to widow status but since peaking in 1993 even the widow beneficiary ranks have been decreasing table 1 number of part c beneficiaries september 30 of each year miners widowsdependants and others total 2000 24568 39053

standards administration the treasury department has proposed restructuring the tr ust funds debt so that it could eventually be extinguished8 the plan is to convert the debt into series of zero coupon bonds payable from the trust fund to the treasury the bonds implicit interest rates would be lower than the rates on the curre nt debt because rates generally have fallen in recent years in order to reimburse the treasury for receiving less interest than currently scheduled onetime appropriation would be made it is presumed that the onetime appropriation would not trigger budgetary paygo limitations because it would be only an intragovernmental transfer treasury projects that coal tax revenues at current rates would be adequate to ev entually pay off the bonds if the tax were extended past its currently scheduled expiration of 2014
