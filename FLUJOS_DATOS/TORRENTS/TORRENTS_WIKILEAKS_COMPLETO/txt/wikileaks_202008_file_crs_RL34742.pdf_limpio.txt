market bubble and rise in foreclosures has ballooned into global financial crisis some of the largest and most venerable banks investment houses and insurance companies have either declared bankruptcy or have had to be rescued financially in october 2008 credit flows froze lender confidence dropped and one after another the economies of countries around the world dipped toward recession the crisis exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide and continues despite coordinated easing of monetary policy by governments trillions of dollars in intervention by governments and several support packages by the international monetary fund the process for coping with the crisis by countries across the globe has been manifest in four basic phases the first has been intervention to contain the contagion and restore confidence in the system this has required extraordinary measures both in scope cost and extent of government reach the second has been coping with the secondary effects of the crisis particularly the slowdown in economic activity and flight of capital from countries in emerging markets and elsewhere who have been affected by the crisis the third phase of this process is to make changes in the financial system to reduce risk and prevent future crises in order to give these proposals political backing world leaders have called for international meetings to address changes in policy regulations oversight and enforcement some are characterizing these meetings as bretton woods ii on november 15 2008 g20 leaders summit recommended several measures to be implemented by participating countries by march 31 2009 the fourth phase of the process is dealing with political and social effects of the financial turmoil the role for congress in this financial

including the g8 the european union australia and 10 major emerging economies leaders agreed to continue taking steps to stabilize the global financial system and improve the international regulatory framework the leaders announced action plan intended to be implemented by national regulators by march 31 2009 included pledges to 1 address weaknesses in accounting and disclosure standards for offbalance sheet vehicles 2 ensure that credit rating agencies meet the highest standards and avoid conflicts of interest provide greater disclosure to investors and differentiate ratings for complex products 3 ensure that firms maintain adequate capital and set out strengthened capital requirements for banks structured credit and securitization activities 4 develop enhanced guidance to strengthen banks risk management practices and ensure that firms develop processes that look at whether they are accumulating too much risk 5 establish processes whereby national supervisors who oversee globally active financial institutions meet together and share information and 6 expand the financial stabil ity forum to include broader membership of emerging economies the crisis in credit markets and the threat of bankruptcy by major financial institutions still continues with financial support package for citigroup announced on november 24 the financial crisis moreover has evolved into global macroeconomic downturn the euro zone japan and the united states are officially in recession and other countries are following to create synchronous slowdown in economies worldwide the g20 summit illustrated the growing complexity interconnectedness and shifting balance of economic power in the world china with its nearly 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves along with rising india reassertive russia and reformed brazil all had seats at the table with the usual financial leaders it wasnt apparent however that the developing world pushed for broadly different agenda from advanced nations the financial crisis and its aftermath has been remarkably indiscriminate it has struck nearly all countries regardless of political system or size and even those not exceptionally exposed to risky debt in many countries the policy issues have expanded to include what to do about nonfinancial industries that are hard hit by recession and sagging demand and prices the united states has provided 174 billion loan package to general motors and chrysler canada also is providing 329 billion in loans to the canadian subsidiaries of the two companies indonesia russia france argentina and brazil reportedly are pursuing variety of policies designed to protect domestic companies from import competition or from foreign takeovers 1 for more complete list of major developments and actions

around the world dipped toward recession the crisis exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide and despite coordinated easing of monetary policy by governments and trillions of dollars in intervention by central banks and governments the crisis seems far from over this financial crisis which began in industrialized countries quickly entered second phase in which emerging market and other economies have been battered investors have pulled capital from countries even those with small levels of perceived risk and caused values of stocks and domestic currencies to plunge also slumping xports and commodity prices have added to the woes pushing economies world wide toward recession the global crisis now seems to be played out on two levels the first is among the industrialized nations of the world where most of the losses from subprime mortgage debt excessive leveraging of investments and inadequate capital backing credit default swaps insurance against defaults and bankruptcy have occurred the second level of the crisis is among emerging market and other economies who may be innocent bystanders to the crisis but who also may have less resilient economic systems that can often be whipsawed by actions in global markets most industrialized countries except for iceland seem to able to finance their own rescue packages by borrowing domestically and in international capital markets but emerging market economies may have insufficient sources of capital and may have to turn to help from the international m onetary fund imf or from capital surplus nations such as russia japan and the european union for the united states the financial turmoil touches on the fundamental national interest of protecting the economic security of americans it also is affecting the united states in achieving national goals such as stability maintaining cooperative relations with other nations and supporting financial infrastructure that allows for the smooth functioning of the international economy reverberations from the financial crisis moreover are not only being felt on wall street and main street but are being manifest in world flows of exports and imports rates of growth and unemployment and government revenue s and expenditures the rapidity with which growth is slowing in countries seems to indicate that this global downturn is not just phase in the usual cycle of business single global financial market now seems to be an economic reality and financial troubles also affect the goodsandservicesproducing sectors of the economy as the force of the effects of the global financial market are felt popular and congressional concern may grow is the system too complex to be controlled or is it an insiders game at the expense of main street opposition to globalization from various quarters may work to shape the debate over rewriting us and international financial rules 2 prepared by dick k nanto specialist in industry and trade

the united states is still major center of the financial world regional financial crises such as the asian financial crisis japans banking crisis or the latin american debt crisis can occur without seriously infecting the rest of the global financial system but when the us financial system stumbles it may bring major parts of the rest of the world down with it3 the reason is that the united states is the main guarantor of the international financial system the provider of dollars widely used as currency reserves and as an international medium of exchange and contributor to much of the financial capital that sloshes around the world seeking hi gher yields the rest of the world may not appreciate it but financial crisis in the united states often takes on global hue emerging market economies in particular have not decoupled from the us economy the process as it has played out in countries across the globe has been manifest in four basic phases the first phase has been intervention to stop the financial bleeding to coordinate interest rate cuts and pursue actions to restart and restore confidence in credit markets this has involved decisive and in cases unprecedented measures both in scope cost and extent of government reach actions taken include the rescue of financial institutions considered to be too big to fail injections of capital government takeovers of certain financial institutions government guarantees of bank deposits and money market funds and government facilitation of mergers and acquisitions see tables 3 and 5 the second phase of this process is less innovative as countries cope with the macroeconomic impact of the crisis on their economies firms and investors many of these countries particularly those with emerging markets have been pulled down by the ever widening flight of capital from risk and by falling exports and commodity prices governments have turned to traditional monetary and fiscal policies to deal with recessionary economic conditions declining tax revenues and rising unemployment and several have turned to funding from the international monetary fund imf world bank and capital surplus countries the imf and others are in the process of providing financing packages for iceland 21 billion ukraine 165 billion hungary 251 billion and pakistan 76 billion other countries such as belarus are in talks with the imf in addition nations both industrialized and emerging facing difficult economic conditions include some other countries of the former soviet union mexico argentina south korea indonesia spain and italy some countries have raised import barriers so far arguably within the limits of world trade organization ru in an attempt to compensate for falling demand and prices the third phase of the processto decide what changes may be needed in the financial system is also underway while monetary authorities batt led the financial conflagration and slowdown in economic growth the question of what changes are necessary to prevent future crises had been left primarily to observers and academics as the triage has been applied and the crisis has ebbed somewhat attention now has turned to longterm solutions to the problems in order to give these proposals political backing world leaders began series of international meetings to address changes in policy regulations oversight and enforcement some are characterizing these meetings as bretton woods ii 4 the g20 leaders summit on financial markets and the world 3 see for example friedman george and peter zeihan the united states europe and bretton woods ii strafor geopolitical intelligence report october 20 2008 4 the bretton woods agreements in 1944 established the basic rules for commercial and financial relations among the worlds major industrial states and also established what has become the world bank and international monetary fund

first of series of summits to address these issues see appendix c in this third phase the immediate issues to be addressed by the united states center on fixing the system and preventing future crises from occurring much of this involves the technicalities of regulation and oversight of financial markets derivatives and hedging activity as well as standards for capital adequacy and schema for funding and conducting future financial interventions if necessary some of the shortterm issues that have been raised and are discussed later in this paper or other crs reports include weakness in fundamental underwriting principles the buildup of massive risk concentrations in firms the originatetodistribute model of mortgage lending insufficient bank liquidity and capital buffers 5 overall regulatory structure for banks brokerages insurance and futures lack of regulatory ties between macroeconomic variables and prudential oversight and how financial rescue packages should be structured for the united states the fundamental issues may be the degree to which us laws and regulations are to be altered to conform to international norms and standards and the degree to which the country is willing to cede authority to an international watchdog and regulatory agency what form should any new international financial architecture take should the bretton woods system be changed from one in which the united states is the buttress of the international financial architecture to one in which the united states remains the buttress but its financial markets are more europeanized more in accord with europes practices and more constrained by the broader international financial order should the international financial architecture be merely strengthened or include more control and if more controls then by whom 6 what is the time frame for new architecture that may take years to materialize some of these issues are being addressed by the presidents working group on financial markets consisting of the us treasury secretary chairs of the federal reserve board the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission on the international side the g20 nations the international monetary fund the financial stability forum and the bank for international settlements also are seeking solutions the fourth phase of the process is dealing with political and social effects of the financial turmoil these are secondary effects that relate to the role of the united states on the world stage its leadership position relative to other countries

as well as proposing longterm solutions the endofterm status of president george w bush may have contributed to this situation but over the longerrun will the financial crisis work to diminish the influence of the united states and its dollar in financial circles relative to europe and its europound this may occur in spite of the flight to safety into dollar assets during the crisis dealing with the financial crisis also may enable countries with rich currency reserves such as china russia and japan to assume higher political profiles in world financial circles the inclusion of china india and brazil in the g20 summit on financial markets and the world economy rather than just the g7 or g8 countries as originally proposed seems to indicate the growing influence of the non industrialized nations in addressing global financial issues 7 the effects of the crisis also may impede the ability of the united states to carry out certain us goals for example the financial crisis comes at time of global food shortages and has been causing recessions in countries or at least their growth rates to decline as economic conditions in developing countries worsen requests for economic and humanitarian assistance are likely to increase this coincides however with slow down in government revenues and huge costs for financial rescue packages that may reduce the us ability to increase funding for aid or other programs also if china helps to finance the various rescue measures in the united states washington may lose some leverage with beijing in pursuing human and labor rights product safety and other pertinent issues the precipitous drop in the price of oil moreover holds important implications for countries such as russia mexico venezuela and other petroleum exporters who were counting on oil revenues to continue to pour into their coffers to fund activities considered to be essential to their interests while moderating oil prices may be positive development for the us consumer and for the us balance of trade it also may affect the political stability of certain petroleum exporting countries the concomitant drop in prices of commodities such as rubber copper ore iron ore beef rice coffee and tea also carries dire consequences for exporter countries in africa latin america and asia 8 the decline in oil prices may be particularly troubling in oildependent yemen country with large population of unemployed young people and history of support for militant islamic groups also in pakistan particular security problem exacerbated by the financial crisis could be developing although the imf and pakistan have agreed in principle to 76 billion loan the country faces serious problems economic problems at time when the country is dealing with challenges from suspected qaeda and taliban sympathizers in the country and budget shortfall that may curtail the ability of the government to continue its counterterror operations 9 the role for congress in this financial crisis is multifaceted the overall issue seems to be how to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets to promote the general well being of the country

participants renounce crisis apostasy and pledge to hold firm next time 13 each financial crisis is unique yet each bears some resemblance to others in general crises have been generated by factors such as an overshooting of markets excessive leveraging of debt credit booms miscalculations of risk rapid outflows of capital from country mismatches between asset types eg shortterm dollar debt used to fund longterm local currency loans unsustainable macroeconomic policies offbalance sheet operations by banks inexperience with new financial instruments and deregulation without sufficient market monitoring and oversight as shown in figure 1 the current crisis harkens back to the 199798 asian financial crisis in which thailand indonesia and south korea had to borrow from the international monetary fund to service their shortterm foreign debt and to cope with dramatic drop in the values of their currency and deteriorating financial condition 14 determined not to be caught with insufficient foreign exchange reserves countries subsequently began to accumulate dollars euros pounds and yen in record amounts this was facilitated by the us trade current account deficit and by its

in higher yielding assets than us treasury and other government securities17 following the asian financial crisis much of the worlds hot money began to flow into high technology stocks the socalled dotcom boom ended in the spring of 2000 as the value of equities in many hightechnology companies collapsed after the dotcom bust more hot investment capital began to flow into housing marketsnot only in the united states but in other countries of the world at the same time china and other countries invested much of their accumulations of foreign exchange into us treasury and other securities while this helped to keep us interest rates low it also tended to keep mortgage interest rates at lower and attractive levels for prospective home buyers18 this housing boom coincided with greater popularity of the securitization of assets particularly mortgage debt including subprime mortgages into collateralized debt obligations cdos 19 problem was that the mortgage originators often were mortgage finance companies whose main purpose was to write mortgages using funds provided by banks and other financial institutions or borrowed they were paid for each mortgage originated but had responsibility for loans gone bad of course the incentive for them was to maximize the number of loans concluded this coincided with political pressures to enable more americans to buy homes although it appears that fannie mae and freddie mac were not directly complicit in the loosening of lending standards and the rise of subprime mortgages 20 17 see crs report rl34336 sovereign wealth funds

subprime mortgages the holders of cdos purchased credit default swaps21 cdss these are type of insurance contract financial derivative that lenders purchase against the possibility of credit event default on debt obligation bankruptcy restructuring or credit rating downgrade associated with debt borrowing institution or other referenced entity the purchaser of the cds does not have to have financial interest in the referenced entity so cdss quickly became more of speculative asset than an insurance policy as long as the credit events defaults never occurred issuers of cdss could earn huge amounts in fees relative to their capital base since these were technically not insurance they did not fall under insurance regulations requiring sufficient capital to pay claims although credit derivatives requiring collateral became more and more common in recent years the sellers of the cdss that protected against defaults often covered their risk by turning around and buying cdss that paid in case of default as the risk of defaults rose the cost of the cds protection rose investors therefore could arbitr age between the lower and higher risk cdss and generate large income streams with what was perceived to be minimal risk in 2007 the notional value face value of underlying assets of credit default swaps had reached 62 trillion more than the combined gross domestic product of the entire world 54 trillion 22 although the actual amount at risk was only fraction of that amount by july 2008 the notional value of cdss had declined to 546 trillion and by october 2008 to an estimated 4695 trillion 23 the system of cdss generated large profits for the companies involved until the default rate particularly on subprime mortgages and the number of bankruptcies began to rise soon the leverage that generated outsized profits began to generate outsized losses and in october 2008 the exposures became too great for companies such as aig g20g146g156g148g561 the origins of the financial crisis point toward three developments that increased risk in financial markets the first was the originatetodistrib ute model for mortgages the originator of mortgages passed them on to the provider of funds or to bundler who then securitized them and sold the collateralized debt obligation to invest ors this recycled funds back to the mortgage market and made mortgages more available however the originator was not penalized for example for not ensuring that the borrower was actually qualified for the loan and the buyer of the securitized debt had little detailed information about the underlying quality of the loans investors depended heavily on ratings by credit agencies the second development was rise of perverse incentives and complexity for credit rating agencies credit rating firms received fees to rate securities based on information provided by the 21 credit default swap is credit derivative contract in which one party protection buyer pays periodic fee to another party protection seller in return for compensation for default or similar credit event by reference entity the reference entity is not party to the credit default swap it is not necessary for the protection buyer to suffer an actual loss to be eligible for compensation if credit event occurs the protection buyer gives up the risk of default by the reference entity and takes on the risk of simultaneous default by both the protection seller and the reference credit the protection seller takes on the default risk of the reference tity similar to the risk of direct loan to the reference entity see crs report rs22932 credit default swaps frequently asked questions by edward v murphy 22 notional value is the face value of bonds and loans on which participants have written protection

raters however had little experience with credit default swaps at the systemic failure tail of the probability distribution the models seemed to work under normal economic conditions but had not been tested in crisis conditions credit rating agencies also may have advised clients on how to structure securities in order to receive higher ratings in addition the large fees offered to credit rating firms for providing credit ratings were difficult for them to refuse in spite of doubts they might have had about the underlying quality of the securities the perception existed that if one credit rating agency did not do it another would the third development was the blurring of lines between issuers of credit default swaps and traditional insurers in essence financial entities were writing type of insurance contract without regard for insurance regulations and requirements for capital adequacy hence the use of the term credit default swaps instead of credit default insurance much risk was hedged rather than backed by sufficient capital to pay claims in case of default under systemic crisis hedges also may fail however although the cds market was largely unregulated by government more than 850 institutions in 56 countries that deal in derivatives and swaps belong to the isda international swaps and derivatives associati on the isda members subscribe to master agreement and several protocolsamendments some of which require that in certain circumstances companies purchasing cdss require counterparties sellers to post collateral to back their exposures 24 the blurring of boundaries among banks brokerage houses and insurance agencies also made regulation and information gathering difficult regulation in the united states tends to be functional with separate government

into the global financial crisis did not take long it was triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing subprime mortgage crisis in the united states but other conditions have contributed to the severity of the situation banks investment houses and consumers carried large amounts of leveraged debt certain countries incurred large deficits in international trade and current accounts particularly the united states while other countries accumulated large reserves of foreign exchange by running surpluses in those accounts investors deployed hot money in world markets seeking higher rates of return these were joined by huge run up in the price of commodities rising interest rates to combat the threat of inflation general slowdown in world economic growth rates and increased globalization that allowed for rapid communication instant transfers of funds and information networks that fed herd instinct this brought greater uncertainty and changed expectations into world economy that for half decade had been enjoying relative stability an immediate indicator of the rapidity and spread of the financial crisis has been in stock market values as shown in figure 2

experienced sharp declines as the crisis evolved recently however they have recovered slightly for country in crisis weak currency increases the local currency equivalents of any debt denominated in

emerging market countries see box that is being viewed as greater in both scope and effect than the east asian financial crisis of 199798 or the latin american debt crisis of 20012002 although the impact on individual countries may have been great er in previous crises of the emerging market countries those in central and eastern europe appear to date to be the most impacted by the financial crisis the ability of emerging market countries to borrow from global capital markets has allowed many countries to experience incredibly high growth rates for example the baltic countries of latvia estonia and lithuania experienced annual economic growth of nearly 10 in recent years however since this economic expansion was predicated on the continued availability of access to foreign credit they were highly vulnerable to financial crisis when credit lines dried up 27 prepared by martin weiss specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division

finance linkages between the emerging markets and the industrialized countries have continued to deepen over the past decade many analysts believed that emerging markets had successfully decoupled their growth prospects from those of industrialized countries proponents of the theory of decoupling argued that emerging market countries especially in eastern europe and asia have successfully developed their own economies and intraemerging market trade and finance to such an extent that slowdown in the united states or europe would not have as dramatic an impact as it did decade ago report by two economists at the imf found some evidence of this theory the authors divided 105 countries into three groups developed countries emerging countries and developing countries and studied how

countries has decreased over time especially during the past twenty years according to the authors in particular emerging market countries have diversified their economies attained high growth rates and increasingly become important players in the global economy as result the nature of economic interactions between industrialized and emerging market countries has evolved from one of dependence to multidimensional interdependence34 despite efforts at selfinsurance through reserve accumulation and evidence of economic decoupling the us financial crisis and the sharp contraction of credit and global capital flows in october 2008 affected all emerging markets to degree due to their continued dependence on foreign capital flows according to the wall street journal in the month of october brazil india mexico and russia drew down their reserves by more than 75 billion in attempt to protect their currencies from depreciating further against newly resurgent us dollar 35 key to understanding why emerging market countries have been so affected by the crisis especially central and eastern europe is their high dependence on foreign capital flows to finance their economic growth figure 78 even though several emerging markets have been able to reduce net capital inflows by investing overseas through sovereign wealth funds or by tightening the conditions for foreign investment the large amount of gross foreign capital flows into emerging markets remained key vulnerabil ity for them for countries such as those in central and eastern europe which have both high gross and net capital flows vulnerability to financial crisis is even higher once the crisis occurred it became much more difficult for emerging market countries to continue to finance their foreign debt according to arvind subramanian an economist at the peterson institute for international economics and formerly an official at the imf if domestic banks or corporations fund themselves in foreign currency they need to roll these over as the obligations related to gross flows fall due in an environment of acrosstheboard deleveraging and flight to safety rolling over is far from easy and uncertainty about rolling over aggravates the loss in confidence 36 34 cigdem akin and m ayhan kose changing nature of northsouth linkages stylized facts and explanations international monetary fund working paper 07280

dimensions first as substantiated earlier in this report it originated in the united states with latin america suffering shocks created by collapses in the us housing and credit markets despite minimal exposure to the assets in question second it spread to latin america in spite of recent strong economic growth and policy improvements that have increased economic stability and reduced risk factors particularly in the financial sector 42 although repercussions in individual countries have varied based in part on their policy framework investors have punished the region as whole perhaps leery of its capacity to weather both financial contagion and potential global recession latin american economies have grown briskly over the past five years lending credence to the recent idea that they may be decoupling from slower growing developed economies particularly the united states 43 changes in domestic policy that have led to macroeconomic stability lower risk levels of sovereign debt stronger fiscal positions and sounder banking regulation are seen by some as key to latin americas growth with stability others note however that latin americas recent growth trend is easily explained by international economic fundamentals questioning the importance of the decoupling theory the sharp rise in commodity prices supportive external financing conditions and high levels of remittances contributed greatly to the regions improved economic welfare reflecting gains from strong global economy but all three trends began to reverse even before the financial crisis suggesting that latin america remains very much tied to world markets and trends 44 latin america is experiencing two levels of economic problems related to the crisis first order effects may be seen in the sudden volatility in the financial sector all major financial indicators fell sharply in the third quarter of 2008 as capital sought safe haven in less risky assets many of them ironically dollar denominated currencies in many latin american countries depreciated suddenly from flight to the us dollar reflecting lack of confidence in local currencies and portfolio rebalancing as well as the fall in

brazil large speculative derivative positions in the currency markets exacerbated the depreciations compounding losses stock indexes on average declined by over 40 in response to the retreat from equity markets and changes in currency values45 debt markets followed in kind borrowing became more expensive as seen in widening bond spreads over the past year bond spreads in the emerging market bond index embi and corporate bond index for latin america increased by over 600 basis points half occurring in the fall of 2008 this trend suggests first that latin america was already beginning to experience slowdown prior to the financial crisis and second that the crisis itself was sudden shock to the region compared to earlier financial crises when bond spreads on average rose by over 1000 basis points latin americas stronger economic fundamentals and regulatory regimes helped cushion many countries from more severe reaction the exceptions are argentina peru and venezuela all of which share heavy dependence on commodity exports and weak economic policy frameworks in each of these countries bond spreads have risen by well over 1000 basis points reflecting deep lack of confidence in their financial future 46 the second order effects related to the financial crisis are deteriorating economic fundamentals which could be major long term problem for latin america financial indicators all point to tightening of credit markets and sharp rise in the cost of capital for latin america which may dampen investment falling investment and consumption declining trade surpluses and deteriorating public sector budgets all point to broader economic slowdown public sector borrowing is expected to rise and budget constraints may reduce spending on social programs with predictably disproportional effect on the poor the magnitude of these trends will vary by country depending on economic fundamentals and policy choices as three examples discussed below illustrate g15g142g161g146g140g152g561 mexico faces two problems one short term the other longterm but both tied to its dependence on the us economy the united states accounts for half of mexicos imports 80 of its exports and most of its foreign investment therefore mexico despite its relatively strong fiscal position and solid macroeconomic fundamentals has begun to suffer first from direct links to the us financial fallout and second from its vulnerability to protracted us recession in the short term mexico experienced run on the peso which was particularly severe in october 2008 it fell at one point by 40 from its august 2008 high this was not due to exposure to us mortgagebacked securities but rather the rebalancing of investor portfolios away from emerging markets and the fall in commodity prices the currency also suffered because mexican firms had apparently taken to heart the notion of decoupling believing that the pesos strength would not be seriously challenged by the us crisis many firms went beyond hedging in the currency market and bet heavily on the future strength of the peso by taking large derivative positions in the currency as the peso began to depreciate companies had to unwind these large off balance sheet speculative positions accelerating its fall one large firm had losses exceeding 14 billion and filed for bankruptcy indicative of the severity of the problem

reserves and entering into an agreement with the us federal reserve for new 30 billion currency swap arrangement47 the swap arrangement is intended to undergird liquidity in the mexican financial system and ensure dollar financing for the large trade volume conducted between the two countries the longterm challenge to mexicos exports to the united states will hinge on us aggregate demand because mexico has poorly diversified trade regime the effects could be significant and have already been compounded by the fall in remittances from mexican workers living in the united states in october 2008 remittances fell by over 12 the largest yearoveryear decline since 1995 when records began in the shortterm it will be important to evaluate mexicos ability to counter the pesos decline and maintain liquidity to support both domestic financing and its trade with the united states in the medium term the depth of mexicos economic slowdown in response to the us recession will be the most telling benchmark of its economic future 48 g4g155g138g163g146g149g561 like mexico brazil entered the financial crisis from position of macroeconomic and fiscal strength the brazilian government nonetheless found itself in similar position of having to sell billions of dollars to fight rapidly depreciating currency the real which fell at one point by over 35 from its august high the real has since regained 10 of its value but volatility remains concern brazil also has large currency derivative market where speculative trades contributed to the reals decline although to lesser degree than in mexico brazil has over 200 billion in international reserves sound banking system an experienced central bank staff that has taken decisive action to maintain liquidity in the financial markets suggesting the country stands good chance of weathering shortterm repercussions of the global financial crisis depending on its severity 49 in addition to injecting billions of dollars into the banking system the government of brazil has taken many other measures to soften the effects of the financial crisis these include stricter accounting rules for derivatives extension of credit directly to firms from the national development bank bndes and the central bank authorization for stateowned banks to purchase private banks exemption of foreign investment firms from the financial transaction tax and utilization of new 30 billion currency swap arrangement as provided in an agreement with the us federal reserve50 despite such strong policy responses brazils stock market index tumbled by half in 2008 investment in both public and private projects appears to be on hold and projections of economic growth are being revised downward over half of brazils exports are commodities suggesting its trade account will likely deteriorate although the depreciated real may offset some of this effect capital inflows are also expected to slow despite brazils solid macroeconomic performance and its investment grade rating as with other countries the extent to which global demand diminishes will ultimately affect all these variables brazil has large internal market and is well 47 latin american

effects of the global financial crisis depending as with other countries on the severity of the recession51 g3g155g144g142g151g157g146g151g138g561 argentina because of its economic and financial position at the beginning of the crisis is in poor shape to deal with the crisis compared to other latin american countries although it has experienced dramatic economic growth since 2002 this reflects rebound from the previous severe financial crisis begun in december 2001 the other side of the story is argentinas litany of questionable policy choices beginning with its 2002 historic sovereign debt default and failure to renegotiate with paris club countries and private creditor holdouts others include government interference in the supposedly independent government statistics office particularly with respect to inflation reporting market intervention adoption of export taxes and most recently its move to nationalize private pension funds to bolster public finances 52 the sum total of these policies characterize an economy that is isolated from international capital markets and prone to price distortions conti nued debt buildup high dependency on commodity exports and inadequate levels of investment from an international perspective argentina entered the financial crisis with little credibility in its economic policies and hence is unlikely to obtain needed external financial assistance as have mexico and brazil from the united states argentina by all indications is poorly situated to respond to crisis argentinas currency has not fallen significantly largely due to strong management of the exchange rate in selling dollars to protect the pesos value however argentina has so far used up over 15 of its onetime 54 billion in foreign reserves forced interest rates skyward and made exports less competitive 53 given the importance of export taxes for revenue public sector revenues are expected to fall precipitously serious problem given argentinas fiscal situation was already far more precarious than either brazils or mexicos risk assessment has been swift and punishing bond ratings have fallen and yields on shortterm public debt exceed 30 the stock market has declined by over 60 since may 2008 and the interest rate spread on argentinas bonds rose by over 500 basis points for the year ending september 2008 since then they have increased by an additional 1700 basis points reflecting argentinas high risk investment profile and ostracization from the capital markets54 given argentinas large public spending needs for the coming year the high and growing cost of its debt and its inability to access international credit markets it may become the first full scale casualty in latin america of the global financial crisis 51 latin american

some measures it is an emerging market it also is highly industrialized until recently russia had been experiencing impressive economic success in 2008 however russia has faced triple threat with the financial crisis coinciding with rapid decline in the price of oil and the aftermath of the countrys military confrontation with georgia over the breakaway areas of south ossetia and abkhazia these events have exposed three fundamental weaknesses in the russian economy despite its success over the past decade substantial dependence on oil and gas sales for export revenues and government revenues rise in foreign and domestic investor concerns and weak banking system the decline in world oil prices has hit russia hard oil natural gas and other fuels account for about 65 of russias export revenues 2007 56 in addition the russian government is dependent on taxes on oil and gas sales for more than half of its revenues should the price of oil go below 60barrel the government budget would go into deficit57 should the price drop to 30 35barrel the russian economy would stop growing according to one estimate58 as of december 12 2008 the price of urals32 was 3977 711 drop from its july 4 2008 peak of 1376159 another sign of financial trouble for russia has been the rapid decline in stock prices on russian stock exchanges see figure 2 at the close of business on december 23 2008 the rts index had lost 725 of its value from its peak reached on may 19 200860 the decline was the largest since russia experienced financial crisis in august 1998 on september 16 2008 alone the rts index lost 115 of its value leading the government to close stock markets for two days the overall drop in equity prices has been blamed on the loss of investor confidence in the wake of the august 2008 conflict between russia and georgia but also because of the decline in oil prices and as result of the credit crisis that has affected markets throughout the world in addition the ruble has been declining in nominal terms because foreign investors have been pulling capital out of the market to shore up domestic reserves putting downward pressure on the ruble the ruble had declined 11 in terms of the dollar in the three months prior to the end of the dollar and was showing signs of further depreciation 61 russian official reserves have declined substantially in part because of russian central bank intervention to defend the ruble although the government has allowed some gradual depreciation between july 31 and november 30 2008 the reserves declined from 5966 billion to 4557 billion or 236 still considered an adequate level of reserves62 russias banking system remains immature and high interest rates prevail russian companies therefore have relied on foreign bank loans for financing rather than equitybased financing or 55 prepared by william h cooper specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division 56 economist intelligence unit

with company stocks as collateral because of the drop in stock values and because of the overall tightening of credit availability foreign banks have declined to rollover loans the russian government led by president medvedev and prime minister putin has implemented several packages of measures to prop up the stock market and the banks the packages valued at around 180 billion are proportionally larger in terms of gdp than the us package that congress approved in september 2008 63 in midseptember the government made available 44 billion in funds to russias three largest stateowned banks to boost lending and another 16 billion to the next 25 largest banks it also lowered taxes on oil exports to reduce costs to oil companies and made available 20 billion for the government to purchase equities on the stock market in late september the government announc ed that an additional 50 billion would be available to banks and russian companies to pay off foreign debts coming due by the end of the year on october 7 2008 the government announced another package of 364 billion in credits to banks64 in november 2008 the russian government announced group of tax cuts to boost business activity including cut from 24 to 20 in the corporate tax rate up to 4 percentage point cuts in regional taxes depending on the discretion of regional officials and cut from 15 to 5 in the business

the united states and europe have become highly integrated as result of crossborder investment by banks securities brokers and other financial firms as result of this integration economic and financial developments that impact national economies are difficult to contain and are quickly transmitted across national borders as attested to by the financial crisis of 2008 as financial firms react to financial crisis in one area their actions can spill over to other areas as they withdraw assets from foreign markets to shore up their domestic operations banks and financial firms in europe have felt the repercussions of the us financial crisis as us firms operating in europe and as european firms operating in the united states have adjusted their operations in response to the crisis within europe national governments and private firms have taken noti ceably varied responses to the crisis reflecting the unequal effects by country while some have preferred to address the crisis on casebycase basis others have looked for systemic approach that could alter the drive within europe toward greater economic integration great britain has proposed plan to rescue distressed banks by acquiring preferred stock temporarily iceland on the other hand has had to take over three of its largest banks in an effort to save its financial sector and its economy from collapse the icelandic experience raises important questions about how nation can protect its depositors from financial crisis elsewhere and about the level of financial sector debt that is manageable without risking

many of the factors that led to the financial crisis in the united states are driving similar crisis in europe68 essentially the causes were low interest rates growing complexity in mortgage securitization and loosening in underwriting standards combined with expanded linkages between national financial centers that spurred broad expansion in credit and economic growth this rapid rate of growth pushed up the values of equities commodities and such tangible assets as real estate as the combination of higher commodity higher prices including the price of crude oil and housing rose to historically high levels consumer budgets were pinched and consumers began to pare back on their expenditures in july 2007 these factors combined to undermine the perceived value of range of financial instruments and other assets and increased the perception of risk of financial instruments and the credit worthiness of broad range of financial firms as creditworthiness problems in the united states began surfacing in the subprime mortgage market in july 2007 the risk perception in european credit markets followed the financial turmoil quickly spread to europe although european mortgages initially remained unaffected by the collapse in mortgage prices in the united states another factor in the spread of the financial turmoil to europe has been the linkages that ve been formed between national credit markets and the role played by international investors who react to economic or financial shocks by rebalancing their portfolios in assets and markets that otherwise would seem to be unrelated the rise in uncertainty and the drop in confidence that arose from this rebalancing action undermined the confidence in major european banks and disrupted the interbank market with money center banks becoming unable to finance large securities portfolios in wholesale markets the increased international linkages between financial institutions and the spread of complex financial instruments has meant that financial institutions in europe and elsewhere have come to rely more on shortterm liquidity lines such as the inte rbank lending facility for their daytoday operations this has made them especially vulnerable to any drawback in the interbank market 69 recent imf estimates indicate that economic growth in europe is expected to slow sharply in 2009 while the threat of inflation is expected to lessen as indicated in table 2 economic growth as represented by the rate of increase in gross domestic product gdp for the euro area countries is projected to fall to 14 in 2009 from 39 in 2007 iceland which has been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis is expected to experience negative rate of growth of 31 in 2009 these estimates may be bit too pessimistic given the sharp drop in the price of oil and that of other commodities in september and october 2008 which likely would help to improve the rate of economic growth 68 regional economic outlook europe

imagined even decade ago at the time much of the substance of the european plan was provided by the british prime minister gordon brown71 who announced plan to provide guarantees and capital to shore up banks eventually the basic approach devised by the british arguably would influence actions taken by other governments including that of the united states on october 10 2008 the g7 finance ministers and central bankers72 met in washington dc to provide more coordinated approach to the crisis at the euro area summit on october 12 2008 euro area countries along with the united kingdom urged all european governments to adopt common set of principles to address the financial crisis73 the measures the nations supported are largely in line with those adopted by the uk and include recapitalization governments promised to provide funds to banks that might be struggling to raise capital and pledged to pursue wideranging restructuring of the leadership of those banks that are turning to the government for capital state ownership governments indicated that they will buy shares in the banks that are seeking recapitalization government debt guarantees guarantees offered for any new debts including interbank loans issued by the banks in the euro zone area improved regulations the governments agreed to encourage regulations to permit assets to be valued on their risk of default instead of their current market price in addition to these measures on october 16 2008 european union leaders agreed to set up crisis unit and to hold monthly meeting to improve financial

the euwide supervision of the european financial sector the eu statement urged the development of coordinated supervision system at the european level75 european leaders meeting prior to the november

of this architecture involves implementing measures that member states have announced as well as providing for 1 continued support for the financial system from the european central bank and other central banks 2 rapid and consistent implemen tation of the bank rescue plan that has been established by the member states and 3 decisi ve measures that are designed to contain the crisis from spreading to all of the member states dealing with the impact on the real economy the policy instruments member states can use to address the expected rise in unempl oyment and decline in economic growth as secondround effect of the financial crisis are in the hands of the individual member states the eu can assist by adding shortterm actions to its structural reform agenda while investing in the future through 1 increasing investment in rd innovation and education 2 promoting flexicurity 80 to protect and equip people rather than specific jobs 3 freeing up businesses to build markets at

wide range of ways in which eu members can increase their rate of economic growth global response to the financial crisis the financial crisis has demonstrated the growing interaction between the financial sector and the goodsand servicesproducing sectors of economies as result the crisis has raised questions concerning global governance not only relative to the financial sector but the need to maintain open trade markets the eu would like to use the november 15 2008 multination g20 economic summit in washington dc to promote series of measures to reform the global financial architecture the commission argues that the measures should include 1 strengthening international regulatory standards 2 strengthen international coordination among financial supervisors 3 strengthening measures to monitor and coordinate macr oeconomic policies and 4 developing the capacity to address financial crises at the national regional and multilateral levels also financial architecture plan should include three key principles 1 efficiency 2 transparency and accountability and 3 the in clusion of representation of key emerging economies within europe the british have been especially active in

questions of bank supervision and crisis management for governments in europe and the united states as icelandic banks began to default britain used an antiterrorism law to seize the deposits of the banks to prevent the banks from shifting funds from britain to iceland83 this incident raises questions about how national governments should address the issue of supervising foreign financial firms operating within their borders and whether they can prevent foreignowned firms from withdrawin g deposits in one market to offset losses in another in addition the case of iceland raises questions about the cost and benefits of branch banking across national borders where banks can grow to be so large that disruptions in the financial market can cause defaults that outstrip the resources of national central banks to address on november 19 2008 iceland and the international monetary fund imf finalized an agreement on an economic stabilization program supported by 21 billion twoyear standby arrangement from the imf84 upon approval of the imfs executive board the imf released 827 million immediately to iceland with the remainder to be paid in eight equal installments subject to quarterly reviews as part of the agreement iceland has proposed plan to restore confidence in its banking system to stabilize the exchange rate and to improve the nations fiscal position also as part of the plan icelands central bank raised its key interest rate by six percentage points to 18 on october 29 2008 to attract foreign investors and to shore up its sagging currency85 the imfs executive board had postponed its decision on loan to iceland three times reportedly to give imf officials more time to confirm loans made by other nations other observers argued however that the delay reflected objections by british dutch and german officials over the disposition of deposit accounts operated by icelandic banks in their countries iceland reportedly smoothed the way by agreeing in principle to cover the deposits although the details had not be finalized in joint statement germany britain and the netherlands said on november 20 2008 that they would work constructive ly in the continuing discussions to reach an agreement 86 following the decision of imfs executive board denmark finland norway and sweden agreed to provide an additional 25 billion in loans to iceland between

markets took control without actually nationalizing them of three of icelands largest banks landsbanki glitnir banki and kaupthing bank prior to scheduled vote by shareholders to accept government

collapse of the banks88 but this conclusion is controversial some have argued that at the heart of icelands banking crisis is flawed banking model that is based on an internationally active banking sector that is large relative to the size of the home countrys gdp and to the fiscal capacity of the central bank89 as result disruption in liquidity threatens the viability of the banks and overwhelms the ability of the central bank to act as the lender of last resort which undermines the solvency of the banking system on october 15 2008 the central bank of iceland t up temporary system of daily currency auctions to facilitate international trade attemp ts by icelands central bank to support the value of the krona are at the heart of icelands problems without viable currency there was way to support the banks which have done the bulk of their business in foreign markets the financial crisis has also created problems with great britain because hundreds of thousands of britons hold accounts in online branches of the icelandic banks and they fear those accounts will default the government of british prime minister gordon brown has used powers granted under anti terrorism laws to freeze british assets of landsbanki until the situation is resolved

wrenching financial crises in the past 1015 years although most observers say the regions economic fundamentals have improved greatly in the past decade this crisis provides worrying sense of deja vu and an illustration that asian policy changes in recent yearsincluding japans slow but comprehensive banking reforms koreas opening of its financial markets chinas dram atic economic transformation and the enormous buildup of sovereign reserves across the regionhave not fully insulated and so far cannot fully insulate asian economies from global contagion to date asia has not suffered largescale bankruptcy or had to come to the rescue of major financial institution with only few exceptionsmost notably in south korealeverage within asian financial systems is comparatively low and bank balance sheets were comparatively healthy at the outset of the crisis nearly all east asian nations run current account surpluses reversal from their state during the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s these surpluses have been one reason for the buildup of enormous government reserves in the region including chinas 19 trillion and japans 996 billionthe two largest reserve stockpiles in the world such reserves give asian governments resources to provide fiscal stimulus inject capital into their financial systems and provide backstop guarantees for private financial transactions where needed so overall asian economies are much healthier than they were before the asian financial crisis of 19971998 when several asian countries burned through their limited reserves quickly trying to defend

source rrill lynch still asia has not been insulated the initial stage of the crisis which centered around losses directly from subprime assets in the united states has given way to broader global crisis marked by slowing economies and driedup liquidity asia and the united states are deeply linked in many ways including trade primarily asian exports to the united states us investments in the region and financial linkages that entwine asian banks companies and governments with us markets and financial institutions as result even though asian banks disclosed relatively low direct exposures to failed institutions and toxic assets in the united states and europe asian economies appear caught in second phase of the crisis with western economies slowing and global investors short of cash

quarter to 90 in the july september period further slowing in china seems inevitable in november chinese exports dropped 22 the first monthly decline in seven years while imports plunged by 18 in the month reflecting substantial decline in domestic chinese demand this has raised concerns that further slowing could lead to unemployment and social unrest key concerns of the chinese government such concerns prompted the government to announce 586 billion stimulus package in early november 2008 although the measures included many policies that had previously been announced smaller economies dependent on the financial and trading sectors such as hong kong and singapore have been hammeredsingapore is already in recession and hong kongs government has announced it will guarantee all the 773 billion in hong kong bank deposits through 2010 one of the most worrying developments in asia is that pakistan already coping with severe political instability has been forced to seek emergency loans from the imf because of dwindling government reserves this points to the limits of bilateral solutions to the crisis for much of october and early november pakistan reportedly sought support from china saudi arabia and other middle eastern states before being forced to the imf 93 on november 13 well into discussions with the imf pakistan officials announced they had received 500 million aid package from beijing far short of the 10 billion15 billion that pakistani leaders say they need over the next two years 94 then on november 15 pakistani and imf officials confirmed that pakistan would receive 76 billion in emergenc loans including 4 billion immediately to avoid sovereign default but this remains short of what pakistan says it needs95 since the outset of the crisis governments in japan south korea hong kong singapore malaysia australia new zealand indonesia and elsewhere have been forced into range of moves to support domestic financial systems pumping money into financial markets issuing guarantees for bank deposits and providing fiscal stimulus to shore up economic growth and slow declines in local stock markets in severa l instances including in japan and south korea initial interventions failed to staunch financial market declines leading authorities to broaden their support moves as the crisis deepened so in asia belief that held sway in recent years that asian economies were starting to decouple from the united states and europe generating growth that didnt depend on the rest of the world has given way to realization that crisis that originated in the west can sweep up the region as well declines in asian stock markets are similar in scale to or larger than those in the us and europe despite the lack of bankruptcies and failed institutions in asia throughout the crisis thus far asian economies have experienced socalled flight to quality in which lenders and investors have sought safe investments and moved out of those perceived as risky this has so far included the majority of asias emerging economies some economists however believe that asias reserves and current account surpluses may recover more strongly than other emerging markets

source of relief for the global economy97 japan has contributed funding for the imf support package of iceland and on november 14 prime minister taro aso said ja pan would lend the imf 100 billion to support further packages that might be needed before the imf increases its capital in 200998 many wonder if china and other reserverich developing nations will find ways to use those reserves to support financiallystrapped governments as noted previously pakistan reportedly has approached china and several gulf states for such support one key question is whether asian countries will seek to play larger role in setting multilateral moves to shore up regulation and international support for troubled countries five asian countriesjapan china south korea india and indonesia were present at the g20 summit but asian approaches to multilateral regulation are still unclear at an october 2526 meeting of the asia europe forum asem chinese premier wen jiabao said china generally agrees with many european governments which seek an expansion of multilateral regulations we need financial innovation but we need financial oversight even more wen reportedly told press conference 99 previous asian attempts to play leadership role have been unsuccessful in 1998 in the midst of the asian financial crisis japan and the asian development bank proposed the creation of an asian monetary fund through which wealthier asian governments could support economies in financial distress the proposal was successfully opposed by the us treasury department which argued that it could be way for countries to bypass the conditions that the imf demands of its borrowers and go straight to easier sources of credit two years later in 2000 finance ministers from the asean3 nations the 10 members of the association of southeast asian nations 100 plus japan south korea and china announced the chiang mai initiative cmi whose primary measure was to provide swap mechanism that countries could tap to cover shortfalls of foreign reserves this was less aggressive proposal than the asian monetary fund although small portion of the swap lines could be tapped in an emergency most would likely be subject to imf conditions for recipients101 on october 26 japan china south korea and asean members agreed to start an 80 billion multilateral swap arrangement in 2009 which would allow countries with substantial balance of payments problems to tap the reserves of larger economies there remains however disagreement within the region about whether the imf should play an active role in setting conditions for countries that use these swap lines 97 see for instance jeffrey sachs the best recipe for avoiding global recession financial times october 27 2008 98 the moved was announced in

of the global response and the bank of japan has continued its aggressive monetary stimulus in the months since alongside other major central banks the bank of japan pumped tens of billions of dollars into financial markets in late september and early october it followed these moves with an announcement on october 14 that it would offer an unlimited amount of dollars to institutions operating in japan to ensure that japanese interbank credit markets continued to function the boj did not lower interest rates in the crisiss early stages but on october 31 it joined other global central banks including the us federal reserve by cutting key shortterm interest rate to 03 from 05 and on december 19 it cut the rate to 01 for time japan was considered relatively insulated because of its well

g5g145g146g151g138g343g342g346g561 the extent of chinas exposure to the current globa l financial crisis in particular from the fallout of the us subprime mortgage problem is mixed but is believed to be relatively small chinas numerous restrictions on capital flows to and fr om china limit the ability of individual chinese citizens and many firms to invest their savings overseas thus the exposure of chinese private sector firms and individual investors to subprime us mortgages is likely to be rather small on the other hand the exposure of chinese government entities such as the state administration of foreign exchange the china investment corporation 200 billion sovereign wealth fund created in 2007 105 state banks and state owned enterprises may be more exposed and may have suffered losses from troubled us mortgage securities the chinese government generally does not release detailed information on the holdings of its financial entities although some of its banks have reported on their supposed level of exposure to subprime us mortgage securities such entities have generally reported that their exposure to troubled subprime us mortgages has been minor relative to their total investments that they have liquidated such assets or have written off losses and that they continue to earn high profit margins 106 however chinese banks are not immune to financial problems several indicators show that an economic slowdown has been occurring in china over the past several months that could threaten stability within the banking system for example the real estate market in several chinese cities has exhibited signs of bubble that is bursting including slowdown in construction falling prices and growing levels of unoccupied buildings this has increased pressure on the banks to lower interest rates further to stabilize the market but has raised concerns that doing so could result in higher inflation in addition the value of chinas main stock market index the shanghai stock exchange composite index fell by 672 from january 1 to october 27 2008 finally chinas media reports that export orders have declined sharply more than half of chinas toy exporters shut

financial institutions around the world particularly in the united states others have contended that china could in order to help stabilize its largest export market the united states use its reserves to purchase some of the large amount of us debt securities that are expected to be issued to help fund the hundreds of billions of dollars that are expected to be spent by the us government to

become the largest foreign holder of us treasury securities at 585 billion113 on the other hand there are number of reasons why china might be reluctant to boost significantly its purchases of us assets one concern would be whether increased chinese investments in the us economy would produce longterm economic benefits for china some chinese investments in us financial companies have fared poorly and chinese officials might be reluctant to put additional money into investments that were deemed to be too risky secondly sharp economic slowdown in the chinese economy would increase pressure to invest money at home rather than overseas many analysts including some in china have questioned the wisdom of chinas policy of investing large level of foreign exchange reserves in us government securities which offer relative low rate of return when china has such huge development needs china may also be reluctant to boost investment in us companies due to concerns that doing so would be risky or could come under unfavorable scrutiny by congress some us policymakers have expressed concern that increased chinese purchases of us debt would give it greater political leverage over the united states they contend this would undermine the ability of the united states to press china to reform various aspects of its economy such as its currency policy 114

in assistance over the next two to three years to continue to service its account deficits and outstanding debt 120 several factors in addition to the current global financial crisis are contributing to the recent downturn in pakistans economy pakistans continuing struggle against islamist militancy in its tribal areas along the border with afghanistan has led to high federal deficits and uncertainty about the stability of the pakistan government recent escalation of bombings and violence in pakistan has raised the risk for and scared off many foreign investors and businesses this has worsened the nations capital shortage in addition the flight from risk that has followed the us financial crisis has apparently contributed to some capital flight from pakistan especially among

such as china saudi arabia and the united states however given the continuing economic problems of the potential donor nations pakistan may not be able to secure the full amount of assistance it says it needs as result the imf loan may end up being only shortterm patch to longterm economic problem in the meantime pakistan has announced some changes in economic policy designed to alleviate their

the elimination of fuel electricity and food subsidies and reduction in the government deficit 123 on november 3 2008 tarin announced reforms of pakistans tax system including the politically sensitive taxation of large landowners to reduce the incidence of tax evasion124 there has also been talk of cutting pakistans defense budget according to some analysts the new economic policies may foster popular discontent and threaten political stability the elimination of fuel electricity and food subsidies may cause significant harm to pakistans poor many of whom are already undernourished the tax on large landowners may undermine support for zardaris pakistan peoples party among its party members and its coalition partners cut in pakistans defense budget also could harm its military

been primarily to contain the contagion minimize losses to society restore confidence in financial institutions and instruments and lubricate the wheels of the system in order for it to return to full operation there is considerable uncertainty however over whether the worst of the crisis has passed how nations will cope with second phase of the crisis global recession and the spread of the crisis to emerging markets and whether the current crisis is an aberration that can be fixed by tweaking the system or whether it reflects systemic problems that require major surgery the challenges of the third phase still remain they arguably are to change regulatory structure and regulations and the global financial architecture to ensure that future crises do not occur or at least to mitigate their effects the fo urth phase is to cope with longterm political and social effects of the financial crisis and ensuing slow down in economic growth on more philosophical plane the fundamental assumption that markets are self correcting and that individuals pursuing their own financial in terests like an invisible hand tend also to promote the good of the global community has been questioned will the losses of this financial crisis hurt investors and institutions enough that the system will become more prudent in the future or is further regulation and oversight necessary to fill gaps in

world economy on november 15 2008 in washington dc the leaders of these nations seem to have concluded that major changes are needed in the global financial system the g20 recommendations imply that most saw the system as functional but major measures were needed to reduce risk to provide oversight and to establish an early warning system of impending financial crises the g20 leaders also agreed however that needed reforms will be successful only if they are grounded in commitment to free market principles including the rule of law respect for private property open trade and investment

provided to corporations key dispute in the cold war was capitalism versus socialism should major companies in the economy be owned by private investors and entrepreneurs or should they be national assets owned and managed by the government should the main objective of large companies be to maximize returns to shareholders or should the government use its investment in company shares to turn management objectives more toward maximizing the national well being should limits for example be placed on executive compensation in companies that receive government assistance also should the government be in the business of picking winners and losers in the process that the economist joseph schumpeter described as creative destruction in capitalism 129 should the government prop up

communications moreover works both ways it allows for instant access to information and remote access to market activity but it also feeds the herd instinct and is susceptible to being used to spread biased or incomplete information the linking of economies also transcends financial networks flows of international trade both in goods and services are affected directly by macroeconomic conditions in the countries involved in the second phase of the financial crisis markets all over the world have been experiencing historic declines precipitous drops in stock market values are being mirrored in currency and commodity markets not only are world prices for petroleum and copper plummeting but major exporting countries and companies are facing weak markets for their industrial and consumer products given the international nature of financial markets the rapid movement of capital and information and the secondary effects of financial problems on the servicesandproduction side of the economy there seems to be international architecture capable of coping with and preventing global crises from erupting the financial space above nations basically is anarchic with supranational authority with firm oversight regulatory and enforcement powers there are international norms and guidelines but mo st are voluntary and countries are slow to incorporate them into domestic law as such the system operates largely on trust and confidence and by hedging financial bets the financial crisis has been wakeup call for investors who had confidence in for example credit ratings placed on securities by credit rating agencies operating under what some have referred to as perverse incentives and conflicts of interest after such trusted aaa and aa ratings led to investments of hundreds of billions of dollars in toxic securities what will be necessary to restore confidence in the system the g20 summit on financial markets and the world economy took some steps toward more international supervision of financial markets the leaders agreed that national financial supervisors should establish colleges of supervisors consisting of national financial supervisory agencies that oversee globally active financial institutions these colleges of supervisors are to meet together to share information and strength the surveillance of crossborder firms in banking for example major global banks would m eet regularly with their supervisory college for comprehensive discussions of the firms activities and assessment of the risks it faces the g20 also recommended that the financial stability forum be expanded to include broader membership of emerging economies see appendix c and section of this report on the g20 the crisis also has shown that the international monetary fund the international lender of last resort has limited capital to cope with large financial crisis that spans both developed and emerging market countries its current 200 billion in available loanable capital of which 50 billion is from borrowed resources is dwarfed by the various rescue packages announced by national governments as the crisis has spread to smaller countries more within the purview of imf activities iceland hungary ukraine and pakistan however the imf is playing its traditional role in providing stabilization loan packages another issue is the mismatch between regulato rs and those being regulated the policymakers can be divided between those of national governments and to an extent those of international 131 morgenson gretchen behind insurers crisis blind

and regulation almost all rests in national governments as well as subnational governments such as states for insurance regulation yet many of the financial and other institutions that are the object of new oversight or regulatory activity may themselves be international in presence they tend to operate in all major markets and congregate around world financial centers ie london new york zurich hong kong singapore tokyo and shanghai where client portfolios often are based and where institutions and qualified professionals exist to support their activities the major market for derivatives for example is london even t hough sizable proportion of the derivatives themselves may be issued by us companies based on us assets similar issue exists on the tangible product side of the economy multinational producers of consumer and industrial goods can transfer production among supply bases all over the world but most manufacturing is tied to capital equipment that is fixed in place financial transactions in contrast can nominally occur anywhere unless regulations and constraints apply to other markets as well transactions can for example easily move from new york to london zurich or elsewhere could tighter regulations in the united states for example induce transactions to move to london related issue is the functional nature of us regulation separate regulatory agencies oversee each line of financial service banking insurance securities and futures hence single regulator possesses all of the information and authority necessary to monitor systemic risk or the potential that seemingly isolated events could lead to broad dislocation and financial crisis so widespread that it affects the real economy also single regulator can take coordinated action throughout the financial system other countries have addressed their own versions of this problem the united kingdom for example created tripartite regulatory and oversight system consisting of the bank of england the hm treasury and financial services agency national regulatory agency for all financial services australia and the netherlands have created systems in which one financial regulatory agency is responsible for prudential regulation of relevant financial institutions and separate and distinct regulatory agency is responsible for business conduct and consumer protection 132 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 in making policy changes congress faces several fundamental issues first is whether any longterm policies should be designed to restore confidence and induce return to the normal functioning of selfcorrecting system or whethe r the policies should be directed at changing system that may have become inherently unstable system that every decade or so creates bubbles and then lurches into crisis 133 for example in congressional testimony on october 23 2008 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stated that onceinacentury credit tsunami had engulfed financial markets and he conceded that his freemarket ideology shunning regulation was flawed134 in recent book the financier george soros stated that the currently prevailing paradigm that financial markets tend towards equilibrium is both false and misleading he asserted that the worlds current financial troubles can be largely attributed to the fact that the international financial system has been developed on the basis of that flawed 132 us department of the treasury the department of the treasury blueprint for modernized financial regulatory structure march 2008 217 p 133 for an analysis of

free market capitalism on the other hand the international monetary fund has observed that market discipline still works and that the focus of new regulations should not be on eliminating risk but on improving market discipline and addressing the tendency of market participants to underestimate the systemic effects of their collective actions136 second question deals with what level any new regulatory authority should reside should it primarily be at the state national or international level if the authority is kept at the national level how much power should an international authority have should the major role of the imf for example be informational advisory and tec hnical or should it have enforcement authority should enforcement be done through dispute resolution process similar to that in the world trade organization or should the imf or other international institution be ceded oversight and regulatory authority by national governments

meet to discuss economic issues it was not apparent that the agenda of the emerging market economies differed greatly from that of europe the united states or japan the g20 is an informal forum that

other macroeconomic considerations as well as vulnerabilities from increased banking concentration and interlinkages between different parts of the financial system 141 in short some institution could

pressed countries to counter specific risks such as how macroeconomic variables potential synergisms and blurring of boundaries among regulated entities and new in vestment vehicles affect prudential risk for insurance banking and brokerage houses the bank for international settlements makes recommendations to countries on measures to be undertaken such as basel ii to ensure banking stability and

banking industry the basel ii framework from the bank for international settlements actually has been on the table for some time awaiting full implementation by countries of the world basel ii is aimed at providing more risksensitive approach to financial market supervision by better aligning capital charges with the underlying risk that banks take on it is to help reduce the incentive for banks to shift assets off their balance sheets and it includes methodologies to arrive at minimum capital requirements for credit risk operational risk and market risk the supervisory review process and market disclosure 152 on july 20 2007 the united states began implementing pertinent parts of basel ii153 some analysts assert that the current financial crisis has already made basel ii obsolete and call for basel iii154 one analyst considers the basel capital rules to be an inappropriate basis for an international arrangement among banking supervisors155 on the regulatory level the financial

the global slowdown in economic growth and recessionary economic conditions also have come sharply into focus while these actions tend to rely more on traditional monetary and fiscal policies there have been calls for more coordination of various national economic stimulus packages in order to maximize their effect 158 table 4 lists the major problems raised by the crisis the targets of policy

financial institutions the length and breadth of the list indicates the extent that the financial crisis has required diverse and draconian action the number of policies or actions not yet taken and

capital flows and prolonged stability earlier this decade market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence at the same time weak underwriting standards unsound risk management practices increasingly complex and opaque financial products and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system policymakers regulators and supervisors in some advanced countries did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets keep pace with financial innovation or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions 4 major underlying factors to the current situation were among others inconsistent and insufficiently coordinated macroeconomic policies inadequate structural reforms which led to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes these developments together contributed to excesses and ultimately resulted in severe market disruption actions taken and to be taken 5 we have taken strong and significant actions to date to stimulate our economies provide liquidity strengthen the capital of financial institutions protect savings and deposits address regulatory deficiencies unfreeze credit markets and are working to ensure that international financial institutions ifis can provide critical support for the global economy 6 but more
