political corruption and enron introduction the failure of enron corporation has been seen primarily as an economic business failure in which excessive corporate risks and speculation deceptive bookkeeping insider profiteering and conflicts of interest and possible collusion of supposedly independent outside auditors were all part of the troubled mix at another level the failure of the enron corporation has also been seen as failure of government regulation and one which exposed loopholes and gaps in such things as government oversight and regulation of derivative trading required public reporting and record keeping by publically traded corporations regulations on the independence of public auditors and rules for the protection of corporate sponsored or assisted employee pension plans there has also however been persistent undercurrent in news and business commentary that the entire picture of the enron collapse involves elements of government or political corruption and the illegal or improper influence of monied corporate business interests over both elected and appointed officials in the federal government these contentions often involve allegations of improper influence purchased by soft money campaign contributions from enron the receipt of political contributions by political figures in return for favorable government treatment conflicts of interest of government officials with personal financial interests in enron and abuses of the revolving door between employment in private industry and positions with the federal government this report will

may be used in connection with or for the purpose of influencing federal elections under the feca hard money restrictions apply to contributions and expenditures from any person as defined to include an individual partnership committee association corporation labor organization or any other organization or group of persons but not including the federal government3 feca defines contribution to include anything of value given to federal candidate or committee including money loans loan guarantees and inkind contributions such as office space equipment and fundraising expenses for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office4 feca further defines expenditure to include any purchase payment distribution loan advance deposit or gift of money for the purpose of influencing any

voluntarily contributed noncorporate and non union treasury funds10 the supreme court in federal election commission fec v massachusetts citizens for life mcfl11 evaluated the constituti onal application of fecas prescription of separate segregated fund or pac for corporate political expenditures in this case the requirement was applied to nonprofit corporation founded for purely political purposes the founding charter of mcfl was to foster respect for life purpose motivating various educational and public policy activities12 drawing from its general treasury the corporation funded preelection publication entitled everything you need to know to vote prolife which triggered litigation under 441b13 as the publication was tantamount to an explicit directive to vote for named

corporate pacs and the court held that concentration of wealth in itself is not valid object of regulation18 the court noted that corporations ability to amass large treasuries confers upon it an unfair advantage in the political marketplace as general treasury funds derive from investors economic evaluation of the corporation not their support of the corporations politics19 by requiring the use of pac 441b ensures that corporations independent expenditure fund indexes for the popular support of its political ideas20 the court held that by prohibiting general treasury fund expenditures to advance political point of view the regulation ensured that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas21 while the court found these interests compelling as applied to most corporations it held the restriction unconstitutional as applied to mcfl specifically the mcfl court found the following characteristics exempt corporation from the regulation 1 its organizational purpose is purely political 2 its shareholders have economic incentive in the organizations political activities and 3 it was not founded by nor accepts contributions from business organizations or labor unions22 carving out an exception for corporations with these characteristics the court raised equitable grounds for the regulation stressing that regulation of corporate political activity has reflected concern not about the use of the corporate form per but about the potential for the unfair deployment of general treasury funds for political purposes23 the court held

political ideas24 thus according to the court purely political organizations such as mcfl cannot constitutionally be regulated by 441b because their treasuries already embody what the regulation purports to achieve an index of the corporations political support in other words mcfl is an example of corporation that is not at risk for gaining an unfair advantage in the electoral process25 in austin v michigan state chamber of commerce26 the suprem court affirmed and clarified its mcfl holding when it considered whether nonprofit corporations free speech rights were unconsti tutionally burdened by state prohibition on using general treasury funds to finance corporations independent expenditures in state elections while prohibiting expenditures from general treasury funds27 the statute permitted independent contributions as long as they were made from separate segregated fund or pac28 plaintiffcorporation nonprofit founded for political and nonpolitical purposes asserted that the regulation burdened its first amendment interest in political speech by limiting its spending29 further the plaintiff contended that the regulation was not narrowly tailored to obtain the states interests in avoiding the appearance of corruption by limiting corporate entitys inherent ability to concentrate economic resources30 although economic power in itself does not necessarily index the persuasive value of corporations political ideas the state argued corporat ions structural ability to amass wealth makes it formidable political presencea presence which triggers its regulatory interest31 unpersuaded by the corporations assertion of right the court upheld the regulation under buckley32 and mcfl33 the court addressed whether the plaintiffs free speech interests were burdened by the regulation evaluated the states regulatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31288crs6 34see austin 494 us at 657 antecedent to these inquiries the court affirmed that the plaintiffs interest in using general funds for independent expenditures is political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the first amendment freedoms id at 657 quoting buckley 424 us at 39 moreover the court noted that the plaintiffs status as corporation did not completely erode its free speech interest under the first amendment see austin 494 us at 657 citing first national bank of boston v bellotti 435 us 765 777 1978 35see austin 494 us at 657 36for example the court noted that the regulation required corporation to appoint treasurer to administer the fund keep records of the

committee 470 us 480 496497 1985 and mcfl 479 us at 258 42id at 660interests and asked whether the regulation was narrowly tailored to achieve those interests34 the court found that the plaintiffs freedom of expression was burdened by the regulation but held that the state achieved its compelling interests by narrowly tailored means by limiting the source of corporations independent expenditures to special segregated fund or pac the austin court held that the regulation burdened the plaintiffs freedom of expression35 the regulation placed various organizational and financial burdens on corporations management of its pac36 limited pac solicitations to corporate members only37 and prohibited independent expenditures from corporate treasury funds38 similar to its finding in mcfl the court found that the statutes requirements burdened but did not stifle the corporations exercise of free expression to point sufficient to raise genuine first amendment claim39 thus to overcome the claim the regulation had to be motivated by compelling governmental interests and be narrowly tailored to serve those interests first the austin court evaluated the states regulatory interests the state argued that corporations unique legal and economic characteristics40 renders it formidable political presence in the market place of ideas which necessitates regulation of its political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption41 the court stressed that the regulations purpose was not to equalize the political influence of corporate and noncorporate speakers but to ensure that expenditures reflect actual public support for political ideas espoused by corporations42 moreover the court was careful to emphasize that the mere fact that corporations can amass large treasuries was not its justification for upholding thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31288crs7 43id 44see id at 663 45id at 665 46the desire to counterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate form is the states compelling interest in this case id but see mcfl 479 us at 259 regulation of the corporate political activity thus has reflected concern not about the corporate form per but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes 47see austin 494 us 662664 48id at 662 quoting mcfl 479 us at 264 49id at 663 quoting mcfl 479 us at 264 50id at 664 citing mcfl 479 us at 264statute rather the court identified the compelling state interest as the unique state conferred corporate structure which facilitates the amassing of large amounts of wealth43 on these grounds the court appeared to recognize valid regulatory interest in assuring that the conversion of economic capital to political capital is done in an equitable way in other words the court held that corruption of the electoral process itself rather than just the corruption of candidates is compelling regulatory interest after finding compelling state interest the austin court determined that the regulation was neither overinclusive nor under inclusive with respect to its burden on expressive activity responding to the plaintiffs argument that the regulation was overinclusive insofar as it included closely held corporations which do not enjoy the same capital resources as larger or publiclyheld corporations the court ruled that the special benefits conferred to corporations and their potential for amassing large treasuries justified the restriction44 plaintiffs underinclusiveness argument alleging that the regulatory scheme failed to include unincorporated labor unions with large capital assets fared better the court distinguished labor unions from corporations on the ground that unions amass large treasuries without the significant stateconferred advantages of the corporate structure45 here again the court remarked that the corporate structure not corporate wealth triggers the states interest in regulating corporations independent expenditures46 hence despite the burden on political speech the court upheld the regulation because it was narrowly tailored to reach the states compelling interests in sum the austin court clarified mcfl and upheld the threepart test for when corporation is exempt from the states general interest in requiring corporation to use separate segregated fund or pac for its independent expenditures47 under austin corporation is exempt from the pac requirement when 1 the organization was formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas48 2 entity or person has claim on the organizations assets or earnings such that persons connected with the organization will have economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity49 and 3 the organization is independent from the influence of business corporations50httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31288crs8 51for further discussion of soft money see campaign finance constitutional and legal issues of soft money by l paige whitaker

are not regulated by feca ie hard money sometimes referred to as nonfederal funds the term soft money often refers to nonfeca funds raised by the national committees of the two major political parties soft money may also refer to corporate andor labor treasury funds and individual contributions in excess of federal limits which cannot legally be used in connection with federal elections but can be used for other purposes in addition soft money is also used to describe funds spent for issue advocacy communications by corporations and labor unions political party soft money political party soft money funds are raised by the national parties from sources and in amounts prohibited in federal elections by the feca and are then largely transferred in accordance with applicable state law to state and local political parties for grassroots and partybuilding activities overhead expenses and issue ads since the 1979 feca amendments certain grassroots voterregistration getoutthevote and generic partybuilding activities are exempt from feca coverage52 therefore money raised and spent for these activities is not regulated and hence is considered political party soft money corporate and labor union soft money generally contributions and expenditures by corporations labor unions membership organizations cooperatives and corporations without capital stock have been prohibited in federal elections53 feca however provides for three exemptions from this broad prohibition that is contributions and expenditures for 1 communications by corporation to its stockholders executive or administrative personnel and their families or by labor organization to its members or families on any subject 2 nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthevote activities by corporation aimed at its stockholders and executive and administrative personnel and their families or by labor organization aimed at its members and their families and 3 the establishment administration and solicitation of

issue advocacy communications is another use of soft money that has gained popularity in recent federal election cycles issue advocacy communications are paid for by group such as forprofit or nonprofit corporation or labor organization for advertisements that could be interpreted to favor or disfavor certain candidates while also serving to inform the public about policy issue the prevailing view in the lower courts is that supreme court precedent requires that only those communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate can be constitutionally regulated any such communication that does not meet this express advocacy standard is constitutionally protected first amendment speech which cannot be regulated hence issue ads may be paid for with unregulated soft money origin of issue advocacy in buckley v valeo 56 the supreme court provided the genesis for the concept of issue and express advocacy communications in order to pass constitutional muster and not be struck down as unconstitutionally vague the court ruled feca can only apply to noncandidate expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate for federal office ie expenditures for express advocacy communications57 footnote to the opinion provides examples of such express advocacy terms such as vote for elect support cast your ballot for smith for congress vote against defeat reject58 communications without these magic words are often classified as issue advocacy thus falling outside the scope of the feca in its rationale for establishing such bright line distinction between issue and express advocacy the court noted that the discussion of issues and candidates as well as the advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application that is according to the court candidates especially incumbents are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions59 in the 1986 decision of federal election commission v massachusetts citizens for life inc mcfl60 the supreme court continued to distinguish between issue and express advocacy holding that an expenditure must constitute express advocacy in order to be subject to the feca prohibition against corporate use of treasury funds to make an expenditure in connection with any federal election61 in mcfl the court ruled that publication urging voters to vote for prolife candidates whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31288crs10 62id at 249250 63807 f2d 857 9th

raise the names of certain politicians instead the court found the publication in effect provided directive to the reader to vote for the identified candidates and ergo constituted express advocacy62 in fec v furgatch 63 the ninth circuit presented the following threepart test to determine whether communication may be considered issue advocacy first even if it is not presented in the clearest most explicit language speech is express for the present purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous suggestive of only one plausible meaning second speech may only be termed advocacy if it presents clear plea for action and thus speech that is merely informative is not covered by the act finally it must be clear what action is advocated speech cannot be express advocacy of election or defeat of candidate when reasonable minds could differ as to whether it encourages vote for or against candidate or encourages the reader to take some other kind of action64 however the trend in the circuit courts appears to be away from the furgatch and fec definitions toward more limited interpretation of what type of speech will constitute express advocacy hence regulation of fewer types of communications are being upheld as constitutionally permissible and therefore more issue ads are permissibly funded with soft money in maine right to life committee v fec 65 the first circuit affirmed the district courts opinion that the fec surpassed its authority when it included reasonable person standard in its definition of express advocacy the court reasoned that such standard threatened to infringe upon issue advocacy an area protected by the first amendment id at 12 the fourth circuit reached similar conclusion in fec v christian action network66 likewise in vermont right to life committee v sorrell67 the second circuit found that state campaign regulations triggering disclosure and reporting requirements of speech that expressly or implicitly advocate the success or defeat of candidate were facially invalid under the first amendment because they would result in regulation of constitutionally protected issue advocacy emphasis added in vermont the court held that the supreme court in buckley had established an express advocacy standard in order to insure that regulations were neither too vague nor intrusive on first amendment protected issue advocacy accordingly the court

distinguished from independent expenditures soft money spent for issue advocacy communications is sometimes confused with independent expenditures although both types of expenditures are purportedly independent indeed justice kennedy argues that by nature practical ly all expenditures are coordinated with candidate and thus cannot be considered independent69 only independent expenditures are subject to the feca the colorado i court held that the first amendment would prohibit the application of feca provision 2 usc 441ad3 limiting political party expenditures made independently and without any coordination with candidate or his or her campaign essentially the colorado decision banned any limitations on political party expenditures when they are made independently of candidates campaign70 since political committee making independent expenditures however is still subject to feca restrictions regarding sources and contribution amounts it may receive from person see eg 11 cfr 1100d an independent expenditure is not considered soft money in fec v colorado republican federal campaign committee colorado ii71 the supreme court held that political partys coordinated expenditures unlike genuine independent expenditures may be limited in order to minimize circumvention of the federal election campaign acts feca contribution limits while the courts opinion in colorado i was limited to the constitutionality of the application of fecas party expenditure provision 2 usc 441ad3 to an independent expenditure by the colorado republican party in colorado ii the court considered facial challenge to the constitutionality of the limit on coordinated party spending persuaded by evidence supporting the fecs argument the court found that coordinated party expenditures are indeed the functional equivalent of contributions72 therefore in its evaluation the court applied the same scrutiny to the coordinated party expenditure provision that it has applied to other contribution limits inquiring whether the restriction is closely drawn to the sufficiently important governmental interest of stemming political corruption

the totality of campaign contributions made by those associated with the enron corporation to national political parties to candidates and to public officials pacs and the subsequent adoption of governmental policies that were particularly favorable to the corporation75 the term public or political corruption has enough imprecision and gradations of meaning to include merely perversion76 of political system which ideally is intended to operate to the benefit of the general public rather than for the enrichment of few or where the motivations of public officials are not based on the general public interest77 however if the term corruption is used in the more narrow technical sense generally employed when analyzing the operation of governments there would then need to be developed

contributions of socalled hard money while regulated in amount and source were also permitted from individuals such as corporate officers and from political action committees but not directly from

lawful campaign contributions and the subsequent votes or policies favorable to the political donor necessarily indicate corruption in government the correlation between campaign contributions and for example votes in congress for or against particular legislation has always been difficult subject for analysis both in proof and in theory in the first instance there is what has been described as the

raised with respect to administration positions on legislative issues regulatory policy and other executive policy initiatives and campaign contributions to presidential candidates and to the national committees of those candidates parties81 it is understood that as general matter individuals and organizations will make campaign contributions to those officials and political entities with whom they agree on most matters of public policy82 it would therefore be as little of surprise to find that those affiliated with an energy corporation such as enron would make 73 of their campaign contributions to members of or entities affiliated with the republican party83 which as general matter is perceived as being more ideologically consonant with the interests of ownership and management of such businesses than to discover that those affiliated with labor organizations made the largest percentage of their contributions to members of the democratic party84 which is perceived as being more aligned with the interests of the workers in those businesses it is of course always difficult to discern the real motivation behind position policy or ideology adopted by public official unless some empirical evidence like candid writings or statements is produced clearly tying position vote or action to contribution or other private promise or thing of value motivations besides generally being hidden are often complex or mixed and even those actions by public official which seemingly benefit only few favored donors at the ultimate expense of the general public might arguably have been based on an officials notions of the public interest and the public policy belief that what is good for the profitability of large business entity is generally good for the entire country even in the broadest definition of corruption as perversion of public officials motive to act in the interest of the public good there is universal consensus as to which public policies best serve the public good the fact therefore that political contributions were made to candidates and political parties and that those candidates or members of that party when elected or appointed eventually voted on or pursued policies favorable to those campaign contribution donors does not in our system of privately financed political campaigns necessarily implicate per government corruption or illegal actions

example common cause life of the party soft money in the 1st half of 2001 2002 cycle at 3 many special interests are still playing it safe by making significant contributions to both partiesthis is not to say however that the independent judgment of public official could not be subtly influenced by the reliance and dependence on large contributors such that the public official could rationalize that whats good for his or her private benefactors is always good for the country nor is it to suggest that the overall influence on government policy from large contributors could not be undue or severely imbalanced in favor of those interests represented by accumulated and aggregated wealth at the expense of other competing but less wellfinanced well organized or politically astute public interests there is fairly widespread agreement on at least the potential for public corruption if not the appearance of corruption in the distortion of the independent judgment of government officials endemic in system which breeds dependance on large campaign contributors the united states supreme court has noted the danger to the country in the severe eroding of confidence in the system of representative government of the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in regime of large individual financial contributions85 the noted and respected ethicist the late senator paul douglas explained in his treatise ethics in government that often the corruption of public officials by private interests takes more subtle form than outright bribes through indirect financial support which may put the public official under such feeling of personal obligation that the latter gradually loses his sense of mission to the public 86 douglas noted that sometimes subtle shifting loyalties from the community to narrow private interests may lead such an official to make decisions favorable to his private benefactors and patrons while all the time the official will claim and may indeed believe that there is causal relationship between the favors he received and the decisions which he makes87 one other allegation of corruption that is consistently heard is that the large campaign contributions and wealth of enron allowed it more access to government officials than typical member of the public or constituent would have evidence of the desire for access or at the least to create good will may be observed in the increasing tendency for large contributors to give campaign contributions to both political parties or to both candidates of the parties running in the same election88 it is theorized that in such cases the organization or entity making such contributions to both sides is looking to ensure access to the elected official rather than basing contributions on ideological factors or more immediate attempts at influencing public policy receiving access or facetime because of ones campaign contributions to the political party or to that official however it may offend notions of equality and republican egalitarianism is current fact of life in our political system of privately financed campaigns where

through new regulatory and remedial legislation which addressed the matter in more systemic fashion as explained by the supreme court in upholding contributi on limitations of socalled hard money to candidates current federal laws on corruption such as bribery and extortion deal only with the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action89 as discussed in more detail below federal criminal corruption statutes such as the federal bribery or extortion laws would require evidence of more particularized connection or linkage between the contribution of money and particular official act that is generally quid pro quo arrangement than has been reported in the enron matter thus far in the press or in revelations from congressional hearings bribery the most persistent allegations of political corruption in the enron matter is that the company bought through large campaign contributions widely distributed particular official favors official acts or official forbearance from officers or employees of the federal government such allegations would as an initial matter raise questions of violations of federal criminal law under the federal bribery statute the federal bribery statute at 18 usc 201 provides criminal penalties for any federal public official90 who corruptly seeks receives accepts or agrees to receive anything of value personally

be implicated in bribery scheme if the other elements of the crime of bribery are present95 however for bribe to be present in the case of campaign contributions there must be shown specific quid pro quo that is corrupt agreement or understanding between the parties that the public official will do some specific official act in return for the receipt of certain valuable consideration when such corrupt agreement exists eg i will support this legislation or policy in return for you providing campaign contribution to my political committee there exists the requisite element of being influenced to do the act in return for the campaign contribution96 when there is only campaign contribution and subsequent official act favorable to the donor but evidence of such an agreement directly linking the motivation for the official act to the contribution then there is bribe this is why the supreme court has noted that bribery is among the least subtle and most blatant forms of public corruption97

be bribes where there exists corrupt bargain quid pro quo arrangement campaign contributions given to candidate or official merely as support or in appreciation or thank you for certain official positions or votes taken as is the case for many or most campaign contributions are not considered to be bribes the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in united states v anderson supra for example where conviction of lobbyist was upheld for bribing senator with campaign contributions to influence the senator on particular postal rate legislation approved the jury instructions given by the trial judge which exonerated campaign contributions inspired by the recipients general position of support on particular legislation100 campaig n contributions may also be in the nature of general contributions donations or payments to causes entities or to other persons sometimes called goodwill payments which are given merely to create favorable atmosphere or feeling of gratitude in the recipient or with some generalized hope or expectation of ultimate benefit on the part of the donor but which are not given nor received in the context of any express or implied agreement and are therefore not considered bribes under the statute101 political contributions to entities such as candidates political campaign committee do not in themselves constitute bribes even though many contributors hope that the official will act favorably because of their contributions102 court of appeals in united states v allen interpreting bribery statute being used as predicate offense for rico charge explained as follows accepting campaign contribu tion does not equal taking bribe unless the payment is made in exchange for an explicit promise to perform or not perform an official act vague expectations of some future benefit should not be sufficient to make payment bribe103 the concept of the lack of corrupt agreement generally in campaign contributions as distinguished from bribes was discussed in terms of reciprocity and obligation by author john t noonan jr in his work entitled bribes discussing what he calls donations of democracy noonan raises the issue of the differences between such contributions and bribes and later in his work attempts to answer the question raised normally at any rate money is given to an officeseeker whose views on

are intended to express an identification with cause they are not wholly the recipients their purpose is restricted they are given in response to work done or expected to be done they do not express or create overriding obligations that is there is absolute obligation on the part of the contributor to recognize past work by the candidate and there is absolute obligation on the part of the candida to do the work the contributor expects absence of absolute obligation creates one difference between contributions and bribes104 the issue of providing access to elected public officials for private individuals in return for campaign contributions has been examined in several court decisions in the context of bribes or under similar standard for extortion even where campaign contribution might be accepted in return for or as the quid pro quo for particular opportunity for access or personal meeting with public official there remains the question as to whether special access to and the meeting with contributor by public official particularly an elected official constitutes an official act of that public official as contemplated by the bribery law an official act is defined in the bribery statute to mean any decision or action on any question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy which may at any time be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in such officials official capacity or in such officials place of trust or profit105 while the term official act is often interpreted broadly to include any decisions and actions on governmental matters taken by an official within his official capacity even if such duties are not prescribed by statute or regulation such as those activities established by settled practice106 there needs generally to be involved some decision recommendation or forbearance on governmental matter pending or to be brought before the official voting on legislation recommending the adoption or rejection of particular official policy or intervening on behalf of private party before another public official or agency on an official governmental matter would all most likely involve official acts while merely meeting with constituent or other private individual on the other hand has not been found to involve any specific decision duty or official act the department of justice has explained in congressional testimony that the courts that have addressed the issue have held that such access in exchange for political contributions is not an official act that can provide the basis for bribery or extortion

treatment or special access is offered as incentives for such contributions senate select committee on ethics interpretative ruling 427 september 25 1987constitute an official act of the legislator108 and in united states v sawyer the court found that the desire to gain access by itself does not amount to an intent to influence improperly the legislators exercise of official duties109 being available for and showing deference towards contributors particularly generous contributors by offering special more regular or greater access for such contributors has thus been found to involve conduct which constitutes what might be considered an unavoidable reality in the world of political fund raising that is kind of access payment which is permitted in practice in our form of private funding of campaigns for elective office110 granting or denying access to an elected officials time based on levels of contributions noted the court in carpenter appears to be conduct that should not be criminalized since it is as expressed by the supreme court unavoidable so long as election campaigns are financed by private contributions and has long been thought to be well within the law111 the court in carpenter noted specifically elected officials must ration their time among those that seek access to them and they commonly consider campaign contributions when deciding how to ration their time112 while such explicit connections between contributions and personal access may offend americans sense of equal representation fairness and egalitarianism it appears that it has not been

1999illegal gratuities within the bribery statute is the socalled illegal gratuities clause which penalizes public official who other than as provided by law for the discharge of official duties agrees to accept something of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official114 this provision has been found to be lesser included offense of bribe115 and does not require corrupt intent for violation the different intent elements for an illegal gratuity that is the absence of required corrupt intent and the absence of need to show an intent to influence or be influenced are among the principal distinctions between bribe and an illegal gratuity what is required for violation of the illegal gratuities clause is that public official receive or seek something of value other than as provided by law personally or for himself116 for or because of an official act done or to be done by him there does not have to be an express or implied quid pro quo or corrupt bargain for an illegal gratuity117 but the thing of value must be received personally or for the official himself and must be for or because of an official act that is connected in some way to an official act function or duty performed or to be performed thing of value received even after an official act is performed as thank you or in appreciation for doing an act that would have been done in any event uninfluenced by the donation might therefore still constitute an illegal gratuity while bribe on the other hand must be shown to be the prime mover influencing the act the intent factor in the bribery provision as distinguished from the intent required in the illegal gratuities clause was expanded on by the supreme court the distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element bribery requires intent to influence an official act or to be influenced in an official act while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted for or because of an official act in other words for bribery there must be quid pro quo specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act an illegal gratuity on the other hand may constitute merely reward for some future act that the public official will take and may have already determined to take or for past act that he has already taken118

shown there is criminal intent required of an illegal gratuity which would distinguish this wrongful receipt of payment from mere gift unrelated to any official act or from lawful campaign contribution given to an elected public official because of his stand vote or position on an issue the intent has been described by one court as the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded for particular official act or acts under the gratuity section otherwise than as provided by law for or because of any official act carries the concept of the official act being done anyway but the payment only being made because of specifically identified act and with certain guilty knowledge best defined by the supreme court itself ie with knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act evidence of the members knowledge of the alleged bribers illicit reasons for paying the money is sufficient119 as far as otherwise lawful campaign contributions that are given for or because of an official position official vote or other official act of government officer the donation or the receipt of such campaign contribution is generally not considered to be an illegal gratuity substantially because such payments are not considered to have been received or sought with the requisite intent to compensate the public official personally for his acts as they are not received by the official for himself or personally but rather by another entity or person for campaign or other similar political uses120 under federal campaign laws all federal candidates are required to have principal campaign committee to which all campaign contributions are given or transferred and from which they are expended under authority of the committees treasurers only for campaign or other designated purposes121 furthermore federal law provides that candidates may not convert campaign contributions to their own personal use122 it may therefore be difficult in the case of campaign contributions to candidate committees or even in the case of soft money contributions to political party committees or socalled leadership pacs to show that the money donated was received by the official with the requisite criminal intent to be personally compensated or rewarded for or because of an official act as stated by the united states court of appeals for the district of

even gifts unconnected to any official act may however violate ethics rules and continuedif facts are developed however that contributions or payments made to third party or entity for or because of official acts done or to be done by public official were used or expended in manner to financially enrich or financially benefit the official personally then it might be argued that such funds were received personally or for himself even if originally directed to thirdparty entity contributions to committee or any third party therefore which are used for example to pay for personal living expenses of public official personal car or other personal expenses such as transportation clothing food or the college tuition for ones child might arguably be considered payments for the official himself124 in the brewster case the court found that the monies given ostensibly as campaign contributions were given by lobbyist to sham committee which was merely the alter ego of the senator which did not report or keep records such as other political committees under the federal law at that time and from which the senator freely drew funds for his own personal use and thus could be considered illegal gratuities received by the senator125 it has been suggested in some commentary that payments other than the reported campaign contributions may have been made by enron corporation to various public officials but that such payments may be hard to track because enrons reporting and recordkeeping are not very good 126 if it were found that other monies gifts or things of value other than campaign contributions to committees were given by the enron corporation to federal officials then questions of whether such donations or gifts were illegal gratuities under the federal law would most likely involve whether such gifts or other things of value had the requisite connection to any official acts of those federal officers while some cases in the circuits had gone so far as to find that specific official act need not have been contemplated or identified for payment or compensation to constitute an illegal gratuity as long as payments were given to recipient who was in position to use his authority in manner which could affect the gift giver127 the supreme court in 1999 in the sundiamond case found that such socalled status gifts unconnected to any identified official act were not violative of the illegal gratuities provision128httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31288crs24 128continued regulations such as those promulgated for the house of representatives house rule xxv5 the senate

related to the bribery offense is the extortion provision of federal law commonly known as the hobbs act which prohibits the interference with commerce by way of extortion defined as the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force violence or fear or under color of official right 129 demands by elected public officials on private citizens for payments such as for campaign contributions even when the payments are to be made to third parties such as campaign committees may fall within the extortion provisions when there is some wrongful use of ones official position to induce or coerce the contribution as stated by one court the hobbs act would penalize those who under the guise of requesting donations demand money in return for some act of official grace130 federal courts have noted that the crime of extortion and the crime of bribery under federal law are really different sides of the same coin and that the intent requirements of the two federal offenses are parallel131 the supreme court has found that elected officials who ask for bona fide campaign contributions only violate this law when there is evidence of specific quid pro quo similar to the bribery statute the court noted in mccormick v united states132 that the mere nearness in time of official acts by recipient public official and campaign contributions from the beneficiaries of those acts that is shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from those beneficiaries does not evidence extortion under the law and is an unrealistic assessment of the requirements of the crime particularly in light of how election campaigns are financed by private contributions and expenditures133 rather the court found that the statute would be violated by request from an elected official to member of the public for voluntary campaign contribution only if the payments are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act where the official asserts that his official conduct will be controlled by the terms of the promise or undertaking134 the supreme court in mccormick explained serving constituents and supporting legislation that will benefit the district and individuals and groups therein is the everyday business of legislator it

behalf of candidates who run on platforms and who claim support on the basis of their views and what they intend to do or have done whatever ethical considerations and appearances may indicate to hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for the benefit of constituents or support legislation furthering the interests of some of their constituents shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from those beneficiaries is an unreal assessment of what congress could have meant by making it crime to obtain property from another with his

financial interests of the officers spouse and minor children or the financial interests of certain businesses or organizations with which the officer is currently affiliated137 underlying the statutory and regulatory scheme for avoiding conflicts of interest with respect to certain assets and ownerships is the financial disclosure requirement under federal law which assists in identifying potential sources of conflicts of interest138 persons who are entering government service and who have assets and ownerships which may create the potential for regular conflicts of interest such that

those particular matters in the statute have been recognized to be comprehensive of all matters that come before federal department or agency148 since for the statutory disqualification requirement the particular matter need not involve specific or identified parties149 such term has been broadly interpreted to mean any discrete and identifiable matter such as general rulemaking or proposed

issued under the statutory disqualification provision has explained that the recusal requirement will extend to governmental action such as legislation or policymaking that is narrowly focused on the interests of discrete and identifiable class of persons152 the regulations note however that the disqualification provision will not apply to the consideration or adoption of broad policy options that are directed to the interests of large and diverse group of persons153 financial interest required the statutory language of 208 requires disqualification of government employee in matter in which the employee the employees family or connected organization has financial interest this has been interpreted to mean that the particular governmental matter in which the employee would be involved has substantial probability of affecting those financial interests154 the regulations of the office of government ethics state that an employee must recuse himself or herself if the governmental matter will have direct and predictable effect on those covered financial interests155 and explains that matter will have direct effect on financial interest if there is close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect that is if the chain of causation is not attenuated nor contingent upon the occurrence of events that are speculative or that are

particular financial interest if the employee advises the government official responsible for his or her appointment about the nature and circumstances of the interest discloses the interest and receives written determination from the appointing official that the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the government may expect from such officer or employee159 regul atory recusals in addition to and beyond the statutory disqualification in 18 usc 208 the office of government ethics oge has promulgated regulations requiring recusals of federal officials in other situations to help ensure the avoidance of an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of official duties by federal employee160 this regulation in comparison to the statutory recusal requirement expands the persons and entities who are deemed to be so connected to the employee that their financial interests may be imputed to that employee and as such would constitute cause for recusal or disqualification of the employee from governmental matter affecting those interests but as compared to the statutory disqualification narrows those matters that are included in the disqualification requirement as to current associations and relationships the regulation requires government employee in the executive branch to recuse himself or herself from particular matter involving specific parties when the employee knows that the matter will have direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of for example member of his or her household who is relative on the financial interests of an entity in which the employees spouse children or parents are serving or seek to serve as an officer employee or director or on an organization other than political party in which the employee is an active participant and where the employee believes that his or her impartiality may be questioned unless the employee first advises

financial interests and associations of the executive branch official the regulatory disqualification provision in the regulations of the office of government ethics discussed above may reach some past interests and affiliations of the government official the regulatory recusal requirement includes recusals from certain governmental matters which affect the financial interests of any person or entity for whom the government official served within the last year as an officer director trustee general partner agent attorney consultant contractor or employee162 if one of those persons or entities to which the employee had been connected within the past year has financial interest which may be directly and predictably affected by particular governmental matter involving specific parties then the employee should consider recusal or seek to receive specific authorization to participate in the matter it should be noted that particular governmental matter involving specific parties is narrower than merely particular matter and would not include such things as general rulemaking affecting an industry but rather would apply only to matters such as determination contract claim controversy investigation charge accusation arrest or other such matter involving particular party where the united states is also party or has direct or substantial interest particular matter involving specific parties is generally or typically matter involving specific proceeding affecting the legal rights of the parties or an isolatable transaction or related set of transactions between

negotiating private employment the conflict of interest considerations for one leaving the government for the private sector begin before the official actually leaves and begin in earnest as soon as negotiations and discussion for private employment commence with prospective private employer the principal federal conflict of interest law for executive branch employees at 18 usc 208 provides among other restriction s that once any federal employee or officer in the executive branch begins negotiating subsequent employment with private employer that employee or officer must disqualify himself or

nagging and persistent conflicting interests of the government official who has his eye cocked toward subsequent private employment164 as noted in law review by roswell perkins the chairman of the special bar association study which was the model for the 1962 conflict of interest legislation the lure of lucrative job following government employment is often great and it is essential that quarantine on official dealings with prospective employers be established as soon as future employment becomes matter of discussion or understanding165 judicial interpretations of the disqualification requirement concerning the negotiating provision have focused on the types of conduct and discussions which would constitute negotiating under the statute it appears that the judicial interpretations of the criminal provision may require at the least some beginning of mutual discussion rather than merely unilateral overtures concerning the possibility of future employment in conlon v united states supra the court of appeals district of columbia circuit reversed lower court decision that had dismissed charges under the statute and had given the term negotiating very narrow reading the court of appeals explained that to comport with the legislative intent of the measure we must conclude that congress meant the words negotiating and arrangement in 208a to be given broad reading rather than the narrow reading accorded them by the district court166 the court of appeals found that in the context of the statute the term negotiating is not exotic or abstruse but is common word of universal usage167 the common legal and general usage of the term negotiate it may be noted denotes communications which pass between parties or the process of arriving through discussion at some kind of agreement168 or to confer with another to arrive at settlement of an issue169 thus in united states v gorman the 6th circuit court of appeals noting that negotiation is to be given its common everyday meaning found that negotiations may be evidenced by the defendant federal employees initial conversation with prospective employer and the federal employees list of conditions for taking

potential conflict of interest the regulations interpret 18 usc 208a as well provide ethical standards of conduct beyond the narrower restrictions of the criminal statute171 under the regulations and as the regulations interpret 18 usc 208a federal employee is negotiating private employment such that disqualification is required when the employee is engaged in mutually conducted discussion or communication with an employer with view toward reaching agreement about prospective employment even if specifics about terms conditions of employment or particular positions are not discussed for these purposes as for 18 usc 208a the term negotiations means discussion or communication with another person or such persons agent or intermediary mutually conducted with view toward reaching an agreement regarding possible employment with that person the term is not limited to discussion of specific terms and conditions of employment in specific position 172 furthermore in addition to the criminal statutory restrictions on negotiating the regulations of the office of government ethics oge may require recusal and disqualification even when an employees actions in seeking employment fall short of actual employment negotiations173 the regulations also require recusal and disqualification from an official matter affecting private employer if the federal employee has begun seeking employment with that private employer even if negotiations or mutual discussions were involved simply by making an unsolicited communication regarding employment to private firm other than merely asking for an application or sending resume to someone who is affected by the employees duties only as part of an industry or other discrete class174 or if the employee has made response other than rejection to an unsolicited communication from private source concerning employment175 as noted in the oge regulations disqualification is accomplished by not participating in the particular matter176 there is general requirement for written or filed disqualification however the regulations provide that during the time one is within this status of negotiating employment an employee should notify the person responsible for his assignment or if the individual is responsible for his or her own assignments then the official must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance177
