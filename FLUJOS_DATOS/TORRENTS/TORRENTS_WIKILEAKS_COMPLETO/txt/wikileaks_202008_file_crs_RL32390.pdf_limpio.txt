implementation and international court of justice icj interpretation of consular notification requirements summary on march 31 2004 the international court of justice icj ruled in the case of avena and other mexican nationals that the united states had failed to comply with its obligations owed to mexico and its foreign nationals under the vienna convention on consular relations it furthe r instructed the unite d states to review and reconsider the convicti ons and sentences of foreig n nationals denied requisite consular information owed under convention article 36 and held that us state or federal procedural default rules should not prevent relie f from article 36 violations the vienna convention on consular re lations is multilateral agreement codifying consular practices originally governed by cust omary practice and bilateral agreements between states most countries including th united states are parties to the convention the united states is also party to the conventions optional protocol concerning the compulsory ttlement of disputes under which it has agreed to accept the jurisdiction of the ic j to settle disputes between convention parties regarding the agreements provisi ons in recent years three countries paraguay mexico and germany have brought cases to the icj disputing us practice in relation to conven tion article 36 article 36 pr ovides that when foreign national is arrested or deta ined authorities of the receiving state must notify him without delay of his right to have his countrys local consular officer contacted while the united states has adopted measures to ensure federal law enforcement compliance with the provisions of article 36 federal law ensures state and local compliance with conven tion consular notifi cation requirements regardless us federal and state courts have generally not granted foreign nationals relief for article 36 violations often becau state and federal procedural default rules including those federal rules enacted pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa prevent consideration of such claims if they are not raised on timely basis in breard v greene the supreme court upheld the application of federal pro cedural default rules to convention claims including in instances where such rules precluded fede ral habeas relief from sentences imposed by state courts if the united states decided to comply with the icjs ruling legislative measures might be required us jurisprudence concerning the vienna convention along with the requirements of aedpa make it unlikely that us courts will uniformly abide by the icjs ruling in order to comply with the icjs decision concerning the nonapplicability of th procedural default rule to convention claims aedpa may need to be amended to permit further review of article 36 claims further the united states could seek to improve state and local compliance with convention provisions through federa l legislative measures whether or not congress has the power to commandeer state and local officials to execute us treaty obligations remains an undecided issue and congress might decide to implement less direct

established w ould constitute breach of an international obligation and 3 the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation6 in its declaration however the united states made clear that the declaration accepting compulsory jurisdiction by the icj did not apply to disputes with regard to matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of th united states of america 7 in 1985 the united states informed the icj that it longer recognized the icj as having compulsory jurisdiction of matters involving the united states8 nevertheless the united states did not rescind certain inte rnational agreements that it had entered including the optional protocol which recognized icj jurisdiction to resolve particular international legal disputes whether icj decisions concerning the vienna convention are legally binding upon us courts pursuant to the optional prot ocol is matter of debate majority of supreme court justices has implicitly suggested that icj opinions are only advisory for purposes of domestic law9 while vocal minority of justices has argued that icj decisions regarding the vienna convention are binding on us courts pursuant to the optional protocol10 background on the vienna convention article 36 traditionally states ie countries have provided consular services to assist their nationals in other countries the vi enna convention on cons ular relations was completed in 1963 as means of codifying c onsular practices originally governed by customary international law and bilateral agreements between states most countries including the unite d states are parties to th vienna convention and the united states has relied increasingly on it as the principal basis for the conduct of its consular activities11 the vienna convention enumer ates basic legal rights and duties of signatory states including inter alia 1 the establishment and conduct of consular relations and 2 the privileges and immunities of consular officers and offices in the receiving st ate the country where the foreign consular office hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs3 12 vienna convention at art 722 13 id at art 36 14 id 15 idbeen established if the receiving state infringes upon the legal rights afforded to the sending state the state that has established consular office in the receiving state under the vienna convention the sendi ng state is permitted to reciprocate this treatment against the foreign consulates that the receiving state has established in the sending state12 article 36 of the vienna convention provides that when foreign national is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner appropriate au thorities within the receiving state must inform him without delay of his right to have his native countrys local consular office notified of his detention13 with the detained nationals permission consular officer from his country may then converse and corres pond with him and arrange for his legal representation14 article 362 provides that th rights shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving state subject to the proviso however that the said laws and re gulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this article are intended15 the consular notification provisions of article 36 can potentia lly have number of benefits for detained fo reign national if sending state is made aware of the arrest or detention of one of its nationals in the receiving state it might take diplomatic or other steps to ensure that its national is treated fairly by the receiving state consular official might also have more exper tise in the laws and practices of the receiving state than the detained national and might also be able to arrange for the arrested national to receive better legal representation than he might otherwise receive in the receiving state consular assistance might also be useful to detained foreign national in building defense to criminal charges raised against him in the receiving state for example consular official might be able to assist the detained national in obtaining evidence or witnesse s from the sending state that will either bolster the nationals defense against the charges made against him or in cases in which the national is subse quently convicted assist th national in arguing for leniency in sentencing because different states provide differe nt degrees of protections to foreign nationals the advantages accrued by fo reign national via consular access may vary from state to state for example whereas the united states provides detained foreign nationals in criminal cases with the same degree of constitutional protections as us citizens including the right to courtappointed lawyer and various other due process protections certain ot her parties to the conventi on may not guarantee foreign nationals such protections therefore us citizen detained in country without such protections might suffer more seri ous consequences from being deprived of information relating to his consular officials than foreigner detained in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs4 16 s exec rep 919 app at 5 1969 17 id 18 s exec rep 919 at 2 1969 19 28 cfr 505a1 20 id at 505a2 21 8 cfr 2422gus implementation and judicial interpretation of vienna convention article 36 the united states ratified the vienna convention in 1969 six years after signing the agreement the legislative history concerning ratification of the convention suggests that the united states believed that the convention would have minimal impact upon us domestic law and prac tice prior to the senate giving its advice and consent to ratifi cation of the vienna conve ntion the state department legal advisor submitted testimony to the senate committee on foreign relations concerning the departments understanding of the conve ntions purpose and effect according to the state department th vienna convention was entirely self executing and therefore did not require any implementing or complementing legislation to come into force16 indeed the state depar tment concluded that the convention did not have the effect of overcoming federa l or state laws beyond the scope long authorized in ex isting consular conventions17 the senate committee subsequently transmitted the vienna c onvention to the full senate with recommendation of consent to ratifica tion along with an accompanying report listing factors that had resulted in the committees approval of the convention the first factor described in the report wa s the committees belief that the convention does not change or affect present us laws or practice18 the following sections describe us impleme ntation of vienna convention article 36 as well as judicial interpretation of convention re quirements as they relate to claims for relief raised by foreign nationals who were not notified of their right to contact their countrys consular officials fo llowing their arrest us implementation of article 36 requirements at the federal level the view of the state department and senate committee on foreign relations that ratification of the vi enna convention requi red implementing legislation was perhaps influenced by the adoption of certain federal regulations two years earlier under regulations first adopt ed in 1967 by the department of justice doj in every case in which foreign na tional is arrested the arresting federal officer shall inform the foreign national that his consul will be advised of his arrest unless he does not wish such notification to be given19 the arresting federal officer is further required to inform the nearest us attorney of the arrest and of the arrested persons wishes rega rding consular notification20 immigration officials are also required to notify all detained aliens of their right to communicate with their local consulate21 although these regulations were adopted two years prior to us ratification of the vienna convention in order to comp ly with various bilateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs5 22 indeed some courts have stated that th vienna convention was the basis behind these regulations despite the convention being ratif ied two years after

the vienna convention makes distinction between the notification duties owed by federal state and local officials within receiving state but while federal law enforcement officials are required by regulation to act in manner compliant with the vienna convention fe deral law or regulation has been adopted to compel state or local law enforcement officials to tify foreign nationals of their right under convention article 36 possibly b ecause of federalism concerns23 instead the state department has attempted to ensure state and local compliance with article 36 by regularly distributing manuals pocket cards and training resources to state and local officials concerning the consular notif ication obligations owed under the vienna convention24 these materials characterize vienna convention obligations as binding on federal state and local government officials to the extent that they pertain to matters within such officials competence and stress that in all cases the arrested or detained foreign national must be told of the right of consular notification and access 25 in written brief to the icj during the avena case the united states noted that some states have incorpor ated consular notification procedures into their booking procedures as the department of state has recommended while others have not26 other states have incorporated consular information into their statements of miranda rights but most have not taken such action27 judicial remedies available for article 36 violations at the federal or state level despite the existence of federa l regulations concerning

demonstrated to justify claim of relief for article 36 viol ation foreign national must demonstrate that continuedposit that the convention arguably confers private right of action for an arrested or detained foreign nati onal who was subject to an article 36 violation31 regardless of this split the courts have recognized that violation of any right provided to foreign national by vie nna convention artic 36 would warrant judicial relief only in limited circumstances the courts have routinely found that article 36 violations do not require the s uppression of evidence or dismissal of an indictment against an arrested foreign national drastic remedies that are generally available to an arrested individual only when fundamental constitutional right is implicated32 the failure to notify an individual of his consular rights would not deny him the right to courtappointed attorn ey speedy trial or any of the other due process protections generally afforded to us citizens and the courts have therefor concluded the article 36 viol ations do not implicate an affected foreign nationals constitutional rights33 accordingly even in cases where foreign national is recognized as having an enforceable ri ght under the vienna convention the courts have generally concluded that such right entitles the national to relief only in circumstances where an article 36 violation prejudiced him in some capacity either by altering the outcome of his case or ch anging the actions that the defendant took34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs8 continued there was likelihood that the

371 37 the supreme court characterized th evidence indicating breards guilt as overwhelming id at 373in many instances lawyers representing foreign nationals do not raise the issue of article 36 violations at trial or pretrial hearings possibly because neither they nor their clients are aware of the vienna conve ntion as result potential claims for relief from article 36 viola tions may be precluded from being raised under state or federal procedural default rules if petitioner fails to raise claim in state court concerning an article 36 violation prior to being convicted and sentenced state courts acting under state pro cedural default rules will lik ely deny him an opportunity to reopen his case for purpose of raising th article 36 claim regardless of whether or not his failure to be informed of his right to consular notification prejudiced him in some capacity although congress has provided the lower fe deral courts with authority to review state court criminal c onvictions on writ of habeas corpus the scope of this review is limited by statute pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa enacted by congress in 1996 foreign national petitioning for habeas relief in federal court must have first raised the allegation of treaty statutory or constitutional violation in state court if he is to be provided an evidentiary hearing on the basis of that violation for purposes of federal habeas review35 accordingly the failure of foreign national to timely raise an article 36 claim for relief may preclude him from receiving judicial relief regardless of the merits of his claim the supreme court discussed us inte rpretation of its obligations under the vienna convention as well as the applicab ility of the procedural default rule to claims of relief from article 36 violations in the case of breard v greene 36 the breard case concerned paraguayan nationa l angel francisco breard who though convicted on rape and murder charges and sentenced to death by virginia state court37 had not been informed of his right under article 36 to have the paraguayan consulate contacted at any point prior to being convi cted and sentenced to death breards

icj di d not prevent the supreme court from issuing per curiam opinion denying breard and paragu ays claims for relief and breard was subsequently executed while noting that respectful consideration should be given to the icjs interp retation of the vienna convention39 the supreme court apparently did not view the icj as having definitive authority to either resolve questions of convention in terpretation or issue lega llybinding orders upon us courts40 the supreme court held that it was clear that breard proce durally defaulted on his article 36 claim by failing to raise the claim in state court and he was therefore precluded from relief by federa l courts on those grounds both paraguay and breard had argued that even if foreign national failed to raise an article 36 claim in state court on timely basis that claim could nevertheless be heard in federal court because as treaty ratified by the united states the vienna convention held status as the supreme law of the land and th erefore trumped the procedural default doctrine41 the court however ruled this interpretation to be plainly incorrect for two reasons42 first the court concluded that the vie nna convention itself did not require any modification to us procedural default rules the court found that it has been recognized in international law that absent clear and express statement to the contrary the procedural rules of the foru m state govern the implementation of the treaty in that state43 examining the language of the convention the court concluded that article 36 di d not alter or create an exception to traditional us procedural default rules in cases wher foreign national was not provided with requisite consular information44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs10 45 id at 376 quoting reid v colvert 354

523 us at 378 52 see eg torres v mullin 124 sct 919 2003 denying cert secondly the court rejected breard and paraguays claim that the vienna convention superceded federa l procedural default rules on account of the lastin time doctrine the lastintime doctrine recognizes that an act of congress is on full parity with treaty and that when statute is subsequent in time and is inconsistent with treaty the statute to the extent of the conflict renders the treaty void45 claims for relief under the vie nna convention are subject to this subsequently enacted rule just as any claim would be46 accordingly the court concluded that the enactment of aedpa limited any rights afforded to foreign national under convention artic 36 so as to prevent petitioner an evidentiary hearing in front of federal habeas cour t on account of an artic 36 violation if he has failed to develop the factual basis of the claim in state court proceedings47 further the breard court noted that even if an article 36 claim was not precluded by aedpa it would be extrem ely doubtful that the remedy for an article 36 violation would ever be the overturning of fi nal judgment of conviction absent showing that the violation had an effect on the trial the court seemed to be skeptical that consular notification w ould make difference in trials outcome positing that us attorneys are likely far better to explain the united states legal system than any consular official 48 the court also rejected pa raguays claim that the c onvention raised private right of action on behalf of foreign nation to set aside its nationals criminal conviction and sentence for violation of article 36 first the court noted that neither the conventions text nor history cl early provided for such right of action secondly the court concluded that the eleventh amendment of the us constitution provides more f undamental barrier to such relief as it has been interpreted by the courts to stand for th proposition that the states of the united states in the absence of consent are immune from suits brought against them by foreign state49 though possible exception to th standard exists when judicial relief is necessary to prevent continuing violation of federal right by state50 the breard court concluded that such continui ng violation had occurred with respect to paraguay as the failure to notify the paraguayan consul occurred long ago and has continuing effect upon his rights51 following breard the supreme court has denied petitions for writ of certiorari in cases claiming vi enna convention violations52 in doing

case with the icj karl lagrand had already been executed and walter lagrands execution was impending day before walter lagra nds scheduled execution germ any filed its petition with the icj and the

states was obligated to provide foreign nationals covered under the convention with means to challenge their convictions and senten ces on account of ving not been provided with the requisite consular inform ation owed under article 3664 secondly the icj held that us pro cedural default rules as they had been applied in the cases of the lagrand brothers had the effect of preventing full effect from being given to the purposes for wh ich the rights accorded under article 36 are intended and therefore cons tituted violati on of article 3665 indeed the icj concluded that claim for redress for convention violations could be raised regardless of whether consular notifica tion would have resu lted in different verdict66 because failure by the receiving state to fully comply with the requirements of article 36 was sufficient to enable the sending state and its affected nationals to raise claim seeking redress67 in cases where foreign national had not been provided with requisite consular info rmation and had been sentenced to severe penalties an apology by the united states to the sending state would be an insufficient form of redress68 finally the icj disputed the refusal by the united states to abide with the pmo instructing the united states to take all necessary measures to prevent walter lagrands execution before the icj had issued final ruling on the merits of germanys case the icj characterized its pmos as binding law upon participants in icj cases and held that the united states therefore had legal obligation to fully comply the icjs pmo and final rulings69 in reaching its decision in lagrand the icj took note of the us commitment reiterated throughout the proceedings to ensure implementation of the specific measures adopted in performance of its ob ligations under article 36 and concluded that this commitment must be regarded as meeting the federal republic of germanys request for genera l assurance of nonrepetition70 the icj held however that should nationals of germ any nonetheless be sentenced to severe penalties without their righ ts under article 36 having been respected the united states by means of its own choosing sh all allow

delay of their arrests with many of th named nationals having not been informed of their right to consular notification at any time prior to being convicted and sentenced unlike in the previous cases filed with the icj by paraguay and germany none of the named nationals in mexicos application to the icj was scheduled to be executed in the near future72 on march 31 2004 the icj issued judgment partially in favor of mexico in doing so the icj first dismissed the jurisdictional and admissibility challenges presented by the united states of particul ar note the icj concluded that mexico did not have to exhaust local remedies within the united states ie allow mexican nationals to exhaust their judi cial appeals before mexico could seek determination by the icj that its rights under vi enna convention had been violated73 further although the united states alleged that mexi cos own failure to consistently comply with its vienna convention obligations towards detained us citizens precluded it from raising claim against the united states the icj found that even if these claims were accurate this would not constitute ground of objection to the admissibility of mexicos claim74 with respect to the merits of mexicos claims the icj concluded that the united states had violated its obligations under th vienna convention by failing to properly notify mexican nationals of their right to have mexican consular officials notified of their arrest which in turn deprived mexi can consular officers of their right under article 36 to render assistance to their detained nationals75 further the icj ordered the united states to remedy these viola tions holding that the united states is required to provide by means of its own c hoosing review and r econsideration of the convictions

reexamination of the mexican nationals convictions and sentences77 the icj made clear that it was not requi ring that the convictions and sentences of the mexican nationals named in avena be overturned only that both the convictions and sentences needed to be reviewed in light of the violations of the vienna convention that had occurred and that this reconsideration must focus on the manner in which convention violations might have affected the nationals convictions and sentences78 the united states had argued that the possibility of executive clemency in cases where convicted foreign national had been denied consular information owed under article 36 constituted sufficient review and reconsideration and also complied with the icjs previous ruling in lagrand 79 the icj disagreed however and made clear that such reconsiderati on was to made via judicial review having concluded that clemency review through the executive branch was not sufficient in itself to serve as an appropriate means of review and reconsideration80 further the icj held that the united states must take additional steps to grant prospective relief to mexico against future vienna convention violations although the icj acknowledged us efforts to ensure that us state and local law enforcement authorities complied with the vienna conve ntion including via outreach efforts by the us state department the icj conclude d that in all cases foreign national of convention party must be informed of rights under article 36 once grounds exist to believe the person is fo reign national going so far as to suggest though not require that such notice could be given along with the reading of an arrestees miranda rights81 importantly the icj did not limit the scope of its holding to the mexican

82id at 151 to avoid any ambiguity it should be made clear that while what the court has stated concerns the mexican nationals whose cases have been brought before it by mexico the court has been addressing the issues of principle raised in the course of the present proceedings from the viewpoint of the general application of the vienna convention the fact that in this case the courts ru ling has concerned only mexican nationals cannot be taken to imply that the conclusions reached by it in the present judgment do not apply to other foreign nationals finding themselves in similar situations in the united states 83 see supra at pp 411 84 pursuant to article 722 of the vienna convention when state infringes upon the legal rights afforded to another state the offende d state may proportionately restrict the legal continuedconvention82 accordingly the avena decision could potentially provide mexico and all other convention signatory states with grounds to challenge alleged article 36 violations and demand judicial review of their affected nationa ls convictions and sentences potential us responses to icj decisions concerning implementation of convention article 36 according to the icjs holdings in lagrand and avena the united states is not presently complying with its treaty oblig ations under vienna convention article 36 the united states has number of options to deal with these icj decisions the first would be to maintain its current position if the united states decided to comply with these decisions it may need to 1 provide further judici review of the convictions and sentences of the named defendants in avena and 2 prospectively modify federal and possibly state procedural default rules so as to prevent foreign nationals from being denied the opportunity to seek remedies against violations of their rights under article 36 the united states might also consider methods to improve notification procedures by state and local law enforcement officials so as to reduce the possibility that an article 36 violation will occur the united states could potentially respond to the icjs deci sions in number of ways though various us options have differing policy and constitutional implications possible considerations in decidi ng whether to comply with the icj decisions in avena and lagrand one possible way for the united states to respond to the icjs rulings in avena and lagrand is to simply disregard them in support of this policy some might argue that it would be too costly and burdensome for the united states to ensure that every foreign na tional covered by the vienna convention is provi ded requisite consular in formation and guaranteed judicial access to pursue claims for re lief from convention violations those opposed to complying with the icj decision might further argue that the united states should not alter its domestic crimin procedures on account of the opinion of nonus judicial body especially given the fact that the icjs interpretation of the vienna convention appears to run contrary to historical us legislative executive and judicial interpretation of u s obligations under the convention83 on the other hand some might argue that failure to comply with the icj rulings might have significant diplomatic consequences upon us relations with mexico and other convention parties and might make other countries less likel to afford us citizens article 36 protections84 further some might argue that us noncompliance withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs17 continued rights it affords to the offending state under the convention 85 the united states has relied on icj rulings in the past to condemn certain practices taken by other nations for example the united stat previously sought and received

united states diplomatic and consular staff in tehran united states of america v iran judgement may 24 1980 on the other hand the united states has also previously chosen not to comply with an ic j

alia to defend central american allies of the united states against communist insurgents allegedly harbored and supported by nicaragua see case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and

undermine international legal institutions in manner ar guably contrary to longterm us interests85 judicial compliance with icj decisions interpreting article 36 if the united states chose to comply with the icjs holdings in lagrand and avena some might argue that further legislative action is necessary to ensure us compliance it could be argued that by ratifying the optional pr otocol of the vienna convention the united states agreed to accept icj rulings concerning us obligations under the vienna convention as binding accordingly then some might argue that the federal courts have legal obligation to recognize icj decisions as binding law concerning the nonapplicability of the procedural default rule to convention claims and these courts must so apply the icjs interpretation of us convention obligations when reviewing stat and federal claims for habeas relief because the supremacy clause of article vi of the us constitution states that the laws of the united states all treaties

conclude that it is the us supreme court rather than the icj that has final say under the us constitutional system as to the meaning and applicability of the vienna convention or any other treat at

deemed it appropriate to ensure review and reconsideration of state convictions and sentences of foreign nationals denied the rights owed to them under article 36 when the foreign national has not raised an article 36 claim in state court it would likely have to amend aedpa to enable federal habeas review of such claims absent such authorization it app ears unlikely that the united states could fully comply with the icjs rulings requiring the elimination of procedural default rules that inhibit foreign nationals from raising article 36 claims unless the fifty states amended their procedur default rules to allow re view and reconsideration of the sentences and convictions of foreig n nationals raising article 36 claims better state and local law enforcement article 36 notification procedures because present outreach efforts by the state department have not been wholly successful in ensuring that foreign nationals arrested by state and local law enforcement officials are provided with necessary consular information congress also might consider employing more direct measures to ensure state and local law enforcement compliance with convention requirements one such option would be for congress to enact legislation requiring state and local authorities to 1 inform arrested persons of their right to have their consulate notified in manner similar to traditional miranda procedures and 2 contact relevant consular authorities on an arrested foreign nationals behalf if the national approves of such notification direct gal requirement on stat and local officials to comply with article 36 requirements would likely reduce the frequency of vienna convention violations at the state and local level and also reduce the possibility that review and reconsideration of foreign nationals convi ction and sentence would be warranted on account of the national having been deprived of requisite consular notification information the constitutional grounds c oncerning

might argue that applying printz federal law requiring state and local law enforcement officials to provide arrested or detained foreign na tionals with consular information and access would be constitutionally impermissible on the other hand the supreme court has previously upheld congressional action taken to give force to ratified treat even when such action would otherwise impede on states rights under the nth amendment in the 1920 case of missouri v holland the supreme court upheld fede ral law regulating the killing of migratory birds that had been adopted pur suant to treaty between the united states and great britain despite tenth amendment challenge by the state of missouri98 notwithstanding the fact that similar statute enacted in the absence of treaty had been ruled unconstitutional the court ruled in an opinion by justice holmes that the federal law at issue in holland was proper exercise of congresss power to make laws necessary and proper for the execu tion of binding treaty and it was not forbidden by some invisible radiati on from the general terms of the tenth amendment99 accordingly some might argue that applying holland congress has constitutional authority to enact legislation requiring state and local officials to take actions that will comply with us obligations under the vienna convention the holding of holland appears to remain good law as the supreme court has continued to cite to it approvingly even following its decision in printz100 albeit apparently never in support of the proposition that the treaty power goes so far as to permit congress to enact legislation commandeering state and local officials to perform actions to fulfill us treaty obligations101 however the scope of the courts holding in holland especially with respect to the scope of the invisible radiation emanating from the tenth amendment remains open to interpretation one constitutional and international legal scholar has argued that justice holmess opinion in

pursue this question to affect state and local law abidance with the vienna convention in manner bey ond the outreach program already employed by the state department it might instead consider legislation that influences states and localities less directly than through commandeering such as legislation conditioning federal funding for state services upon state compliance with the procedures described in vienna convention article 36 and the icjs rulings in lagrand and avena conditioning federal fundi ng upon state performance of particular function has been longstanding practice that has been upheld on several occasions by the supreme court105 although conditioning federal funding on state compliance with vienna conve ntion procedures would not guarantee that every state would adopt necessary measures it may provide states with strong incentive to take actions necessary to ensure us compliance with the icjs rulings concerning application of the vienna conventionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32390crs22 106 see testa v katt 330 us 386 1947it might also be possible to argue that the commandeering principle does not apply to federal legislation concerning state courts and that congress might therefore enact legislation requiring state courts to inform alien prisoners at court proceedings of their right to have releva nt consular officials notified of their arrest and detention the cases of printz and new york established constituti onal prohibitio ns on the federal commandeering of state executive and legislative branches but did not speak to the subject of federal commandeering of the state judiciary the supreme court has previously found that requiring stat courts to enforce federal laws was permissible under the supremacy clause106 it might be argued however that while the supremacy clause may permit the federal government to require state courts to adjudicate federal claims it does not go so far as to permit the federal government to commandeer state courts to perform non adjudicatory functions such as informing foreign nationals of their righ ts under the vienna convention
