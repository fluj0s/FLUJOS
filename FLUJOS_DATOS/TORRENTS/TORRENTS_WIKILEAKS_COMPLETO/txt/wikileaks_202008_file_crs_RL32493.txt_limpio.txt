analysis summary north koreas dire economic straits provides one of the few levers to move the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk or north korea to cooperate in attempts by the united states china south korea japan and russia to halt and dismantle its nuclear program these five countries plus north korea comprise the six parties who are engaged in talks currently restarted to resolve issues raised by the dprks development of nuclear weapon this report provides an overview of the north korean economy its external economic relations reforms and us policy options in june 2008 the bush administration announced that it was lifting restrictions under the trading with the enemy act and was starting the process to remove the dprk from the list of state sponsors of terrorism other sanctions including sanctions imposed following north koreas nuclear test still remain in place the economy of north korea is of interest to congress because it provides the financial and industrial resources for the kim jongil regime to develop its military and to remain in power constitutes an important push factor for potential refugees seeking to flee the country creates pressures for the country to trade in arms or engage in illicit economic activity is rationale for humanitarian assistance and creates instability that affects south korea and china in particular the dismal economic conditions also foster forces of discontent that potentially could turn against the kim regime especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of communist party leaders becomes better known or as poor economic performance hurts even the elite economic conditions in north korea have been improving since the disastrous conditions in the mid1990s but still are dismal for those out of the center of power crop failures and flooding have reportedly increased the potential for mass starvation in 2008 although progress in the six party talks have open the way for deliveries of humanitarian assistance from the united states and south korea the dprk has embarked on program of limited economic reforms that include allowing open markets allowing prices to better reflect market values reducing dependence on rationing of essential commodities trimming centralized control over factory operations and opening areas for international investment north korea has extensive trading relationships with china and south korea and more limited trade with russia because of economic sanctions us and japanese trade with north korea in 2006 and 2007 was virtually nil the dprk has been

country in the sixparty talks with north korea 57 the north korean economy leverage and policy analysis major points and recent developments the economy of the dprk north korea is one of the few policy levers that countries can use to induce pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program the economy of the dprk is in dire straits with considerable share of its population on the edge of starvation and in need of outside food aid in 2008 pyongyang is placing more emphasis on feeding its people this likely is one reason that north korea has been more cooperative in disclosing and ending its nuclear weapons program china and south korean investments and trade with the dprk are helping the country to secure needed imports of energy food and machinery for factories north koreas trade deficit is being financed primarily through foreign aid investments and remittances from overseas workers as well as through various illicit activities other than recent financial sanctions economic sanctions appear to have had little effect on the pyongyang regime because china russia south korea and other nations have traded and provided assistance to the dprk and the kim jongil regime seems willing to allow starvation rather than open the country to outsiders fall of the kim jongil regime seems unlikely at this time although pressures apparently are building in some quarters in north korea to look beyond the aging leader kim economic reforms adjustments in the dprk are gradually being implemented but the pace is slow and reversals of reform measures are frequent february 2007 sixparty agreement calls for providing fuel and eventual normalizing of relations with the dprk in response to specific actions by pyongyang in regard to its nuclear program1 1 for details on the

million for energy assistance for north korea in may 2008 the bush administration announced it would resume food assistance to north korea by providing 500000 metric tons2 options for congress include increasing its role in the sixparty talks through oversight hearings legislation and policy discussions with the executive branch continuing with the status quo primarily state department effort including an emphasis on human rights nonproliferation and actions to counter illicit activities or to take more rigid stance toward pyongyang until it fulfills its commitments under the 2007 sixparty agreement recent events on july 11 2008 park wangja 53yearold housewife was shot dead by north korean soldier while taking predawn stroll near south koreamanaged resort on mount kumkang in north korea south korea halted further tourist visits to the mountain resort worth about 10 million per year to north korea there is some speculation that this could be the dprk militarys attempt to derail denuclearization under the sixparty process on july 12 2008 north korea agreed to disable its nuclear facilities by the end of october and in return the other parties pledged to provide promised energy aid to the north by that time in june 2008 the dprk disclosed additional detail on its nuclear program the bush administration announced that it was lifting restrictions under the trading with the enemy act and was starting the process to remove august 11 2008 at the earliest the dprk from the list of state sponsors of terrorism other sanctions including sanctions imposed following north koreas nuclear test remain in place introduction on june 26 2008 president bush announced the lifting of the application of the trading with the enemy act twea with respect to the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk or north korea and notified congress of his intent to rescind north koreas designation as state sponsor of terrorism3 according to 2 for information on us aid to the dprk see

terrorism as of august 11 2008 following the 45 day period in which congress could have passed joint resolution blocking the proposed rescission the united states reportedly is waiting for more complete verification of the dprk nuclear program4 recent progress being made under the six party talks on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula also enabled the united states to resume

korea democratic peoples republic of korea or dprk faces dilemma as its economy stagnates goods are unequally distributed and much of the population undergoes severe privation in the ongoing sixparty talks on the dprks nuclear weapons economic assistance has been the primary incentive for pyongyangs leaders to proceed with commitments relating to the closure of its nuclear weapons program despite resistance from domestic interests particularly the military north koreas leaders seem to perceive themselves as being in policy dilemma they see the united states as hostile power and perceive themselves as possible target of us military action they have pushed to become nuclear power despite warnings not to do so even from china their major ally yet north koreas nuclear weapon development has become rallying point for national pride and what they see as deterrent against hostile action yet january 2008 joint newspaper editorial by the communist party military and youth militia stated that at present other task is more urgent or more important than solving the peoples food problem and eating problem6 in january 2008 kim jongil reportedly stated the most important and urgent issue for us now is to bring about turnabout in the building of the economy and in the lives of the people7 pyongyang currently faces the archetypical economic tradeoff between guns and butter but in their case the question is whether to retain the guns nuclear weapons or give them up in order to obtain butter food imports in negotiating with the dprk the united states has five major policy levers international political pressure economic assistance economic sanctions diplomatic isolation and the threat of preemptive military action this report examines the economic side of us leverage with north korea the security side is addressed in other crs reports8 here we provide an overview of the north korean economy survey its economic relationships with major trading partners and conclude with discussion of us policy options information on the dprks economy is scanty and suspect the closed nature of the country and the lack both of comprehensive datagathering structure using modern economic concepts and systematic reporting mechanism make quantitative assessments difficult still sufficient information is available to provide sketch of the north korean economy that has enough details to address different policy paths 5 global insight subscription econometric forecasting service north korea updated july 23 2008 6 full text of north koreas 2008 new years joint editorial bbc monitoring

rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons program and crs report rl33567 koreaus relations issues for congress both by larry niksch crs5 us interest in the moribund north korea economy goes beyond the leverage that economic assistance provides in negotiations over pyongyangs nuclear weapons the economy provides the financial and industrial resources for pyongyang to support its military and nuclear weapons program it constitutes an important push factor for refugees seeking to flee the country it creates pressure for the country to engage in illicit trade when the economy is performing poorly it diverts international food aid that could be used elsewhere and creates instability that raises the risk of desperate action by pyongyang dismal economic conditions may foster forces of discontent in the dprk that potentially could turn against the ruling regime of kim jongil especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of regime leaders and the higher standard of living in south korea spreads or if the poor economic performance hurts even pyongyangs elite despite over decade of hardship however most dissatisfaction or opposition to the regime seems to be muted this crs report notes that the worst of north koreas economic crisis reached in the mid1990s seems to have passed but the economy is still struggling and heavily dependent on foreign assistance to stave off starvation among sizable proportion of its people in 2008 survey the world food programme wfp found that food availability accessibility and utilization have deteriorated sharply since 2007 close to three quarters of the households have reduced their food intake and that more malnourished and ill children are being admitted to hospitals and institutions the conclusion was that millions of people in the dprk are experiencing hunger not seen in almost decade9 severe floods in 2007 worsened situation that had been improving so far deliveries of food aid pyongyangs reforms and increasing trade with south korea and china have enabled the country to bridge to some extent its shortfall between food production and basic human needs trade sanctions along with us financial sanctions may have had some effect judging by the complaints coming out of pyongyang and progress in the six party talks us trade sanctions alone however tend to have little impact because the united states already has virtually trade with the dprk the country can turn to other nations for needed imports and sanctions do not halt humanitarian aid shipments the sixparty agreement of february 13 2007 included an economic incentive of heavy fuel oil and humanitarian food aid as well as the prospect of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the dprk and the united states and japan in exchange for north koreas freezing and allowing inspections of the activity at its yongbyon nuclear reactor the agreement is being implemented on the basis of actionforaction 9 world food program dprk survey confirms deepening hunger for millions newpress release july 30 2008 crs6 overview of the dprk economy the north korean economy is one of the worlds most isolated and bleak10 it was completely bypassed by the asian economic miracles of the past three decades that brought modern economic growth and industrialization to south korea taiwan singapore and hong kong as well as rapid growth and trade liberalization to china thailand malaysia and other asian nations the stalinist north korean economy can be characterized by state ownership of means of production centralized economic planning command and monitoring of political attitudes and an emphasis on military development the economic system is designed to be selfreliant and closed the irony of the situation is that the longer the economy tries to remain self sufficient the poorer its performance and the more dependent the country becomes on the outside world just to survive during the 1990s major portions of the north korean population survived primarily through transfers of food and other economic assistance from abroad the worst of the food crisis has passed but shortages are still there and the country depends on staples from china south korea and when allowed from the world food program to stave off mass starvation11 during the 1990s the inefficiencies of north koreas centrally planned economy especially its promotion of stateowned heavy industries along with high military spending about 1525 of gdp joined with drought and floods to push the economy into crisis in addition the collapse of the soviet bloc meant the loss of russian aid export markets and cheap oil trade with the former soviet union dropped from as much as 358 billion in 1999 and has recovered to only 230 million mostly petroleum by 200512 this added to disastrous domestic economic conditions in north korea13 food has been so scarce that north korean youth are shorter than those in other east asian nations14 since 1998 the military reportedly has had to lower its minimum height requirement in order to garner sufficient new recruits life expectancy has been contracting with the help of the wfp which had been feeding more than quarter of north koreas 23 million people chronic malnourishment among children reportedly fell from 62 in 1998 to about 37 in 2004 about onethird of mothers are considered to be both 10 for an indepth study of the

refers to this period of hardship as the arduous march an apparent comparison to the long march in chinese revolutionary history in january 2006 pyongyang ordered the wfp to stop food deliveries to the dprk but limited food assistance about 75000 tons annually was resumed after an agreement in may 200617 over the winter of 20072008 the abnormally dry and cold weather reportedly has seriously affected the growth of autumn wheat and barley when combined with severe flooding during the summer of 2007 the wfp predicted the dprk will be short about 14 million tons of food in 200818 an extensive analysis of the famine in the 1990s concludes that the ultimate and deepest roots of north koreas food problems must be found in the very nature of the north korean economic and political system19 since 2002 pyongyang has allowed some reforms that may ease the economic pressures over the long term in sense these reforms legitimized what was already occurring following the collapse of the centrally planned economy20 the kim regime refuses to call the economic measures reforms but as will be discussed later in this report that in essence is what they are north korea prefers to characterize the reforms as utilitarian socialism this includes the introduction domestically of market economy elements called the july 1 2001 measures and in the international arena the pursuit of normalization of relations with countries that have traditionally been hostile toward their country the dprks gross national product in 2007 in purchasing power parity prices ppp prices adjusted to

econometric consulting firm estimated north koreas gdp in 2006 at 229 billion 239 billion in 200723 remarkable fact is that in the postkorean war and into the mid1970s living standards were higher in north korea than in either south korea or china now north korea is far behind its rapidly growing neighbors as shown in figure 1 growth in estimated real gross domestic product gdp in the dprk was dropped into the negative for most of the 1990s before beginning to recover in 1999 in 2004 to 2006 growth has been continuing at about 2 up slightly from earlier years in 2006 the economy shrank by 11 and continued to decline in 2007 by an estimated 23 in essence the economy appears to have recovered moderately after the 1990s but has contracted again over 20062007 it should be noted that various scholars and government officials produce variety of estimates of north korean growth rates and gdp some estimates show gradual recovery but others argue that real per capita gdp has been stagnant or even declining over the past decade one problem is that estimates of inflation are difficult to obtain and are inherently unreliable the reason is that households in different sectors of the economy may pay different prices for the same commodities particularly staples that have been distributed through official channels to some but must be purchased in markets by others rice for example may be sold in an official market for one price sold in an irregular market for another or distributed as ration to certain households basically for free another problem is that officials who report data often are under pressure to meet certain targets unlike in the west where data may be sugar coated to make them more palatable in the dprk the underlying statistics often are rubberized they may be stretched or compressed according to official expectations 22 ppi figures are from the world bank world development indicators 23 global insight subscription service north korea economic

1986 88 90 92 94 96 98 2000 2 4 6 7 year source data from bank of korea another problem with north korean data is that there is huge difference between the official exchange rate and the free market rate this problem is avoided in ppp estimates that compare purchasing power and adjust for exchange rate differences in estimates of gdp expressed in dollars however the exchange rate is used to convert north korean won to us dollars according to global insight the official exchange rate in north korea has been 2 per dollar while the free market rate has ranged between 200 to3000 won per dollar24 what can be said for certain is that sizable part of the dprk population lives on the edge of existence in few countries today does small decline in gdp or summer flooding cause massive starvation and growth stunting as it does in the dprk also despite the threat of imprisonment for crossing the border into china and being repatriated to north korea large number of refugees still attempt to flee the economic and political conditions in the country in this land of scarcity consumer necessities have been rationed and used to reward party loyalists under pyongyangs economic reforms this system appears to be phasing out but in the fall of 2005 north korea backtracked on some of its economic reforms by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting centralized food rationing system pyongyang also reportedly closed its food markets but then opened consolidated markets that carried food and other items 24 global insight subscription econometric forecasting service north korea updated july 23 2008 crs10 the combination of weak economy unable to provide basic food and necessities and ruling regime intent on maintaining its power has created economic divisions within society north korea reportedly officially classifies its citizens into three ranks and fiftyone categories based on their ideological orientation however in actuality the economy has created five classes of people the official categories are used to allocate rations for daily necessities jobs and housing25 the facto categories have resulted from the intrusion of market forces and trading on the official class divisions the top class consists of the elite who claim the first rewards from society they are the party cadres who are leaders in the military and bureaucracy and who enjoy privileges far above the reach of the average household while starvation haunts the provinces many of the privileged class live in pyongyang where provincial north koreans cannot enter without special permission some drive foreign cars acquire imported home appliances reside in apartments on lower floor so they do not have to climb too many stairs when the electricity is out and buy imported food medicines and toiletries at special hard currency stores26 the elite have strong vested interest in maintaining the current economic system despite its problems their incomes originate from the treasury from foreign investors mostly south korean remittances from ethnic koreans in japan although these have been curtailed and the countrys shadowy trade in everything from missile technology to fake banknotes and narcotics27 after the elites surrounding kim jongil the second group comprises business traders with access to foreign capital and international transactions the third consists of organized thugs who make their money through public trading and markets the fourth class is composed of urbanites and others who scrape by on government rations while the fifth class is farmers who support their way of life through farming private plots and selling goods in markets28 despite hushed grumbling about economic deprivation forced food deliveries to the central government rationing system with insufficient stocks to deliver and new prohibitions on markets that are difficult to understand and rationalize dissent in north korea remains stifled support for the ruling regime appears strong even among the lower classes of people although this support is often enforced by severe squashing of even the slightest hint of dissent even suspicious comments in casual conversations may be reported to the authorities the country is far from developing middle class with independent economic means personal sources of information and thirst for more democratic institutions 25 south korea

cited in napsnet september 21 2007 crs11 in 2007 south koreas new president lee myungbak stated in his plan vision 3000 denuclearization and openness that if north korea denuclearizes and opens his administration will help to make north koreas national income 3000 per person within ten years the plan however does not provide an alternative if north korea does not denuclearize29 economic philosophy the pyongyang regime has pursued policy of selfsufficiency and isolation from the world economy that they call juche or selfreliance juche goes beyond economics as it has been used since the 1950s to perpetuate power by the central government and to build an aura of the supernatural around their supreme leaders kim both father and son30 although the regime does not emphasize the connection the current system of dynastic succession with paramount father figure also harkens back to confucianism and the powerful dynastic tradition that united the korean peninsula for hundreds of years the economic practice of juche has minimized international trade relations discouraged foreign direct investment and fostered what it considers to be core industries mostly heavy manufacturing while promoting such heavy industry for most of the postkorean war period pyongyang has emphasized the parallel development of military strength current head of state kim jongil often referred to as dear leader has given highest priority to the military this places the army ahead of the working class for the first time in the history of north koreas socalled revolutionary movement31 under kim ilsung kim jongils father the juche ideology placed equal emphasis on political independence selfdefense and economic selfsupport capabilities kim jongil however insists that north korea can be country strong in ideology and economy only when its military is strong32 the country therefore has been developing its industries within the context of militaryindustrial complex with strong links between heavy industry and munitions production some of north koreas munitions industries manufacturing dual use products are virtually indistinguishable from those supplying civilians33 in 1998 at the 10th supreme peoples assembly the militarys national defense commission arguably eclipsed the politburo as the supreme national 29 analysis team of the daily nk lee myungbaks administration

making body in north korea in the years since the term militaryfirst politics has been used to signify the privileged status the korean peoples army holds and to stress the ascendant position of the military relative to the power of the korean workers party the traditional center of the dprks decision making34 of course the ultimate decision maker in pyongyang is the dear leader kim jongil in 2006 pyongyangs defense budget was an estimated 23 billion to maintain its 11 million member military35 south korea estimated the norths military expenditures at 5 billion in 2003 in 2005 north korea stated that the defense budget was 159 of its total annual budget36 but others had put the figure at 272 in 2003 even defense budget of 23 billion however implies an expenditure of 2090 per member of the military woefully small amount this implies that the tug of war between guns and butter within the north korean regime must be quite intense given the scarcity of resources throughout the country even though the military does operate businesses that bring in additional revenues the heavy weight of the military in pyongyangs decision making may help explain what to outsiders seem to be inexplicable actions by the north korean government for example almost immediately after negotiators had issued the september 19 2005 sixparty statement in which north korea ostensibly committed itself to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs pyongyang began backtracking and within two months announced boycott of future sixparty talks37 it also may help explain north koreas carrying out its first nuclear test on october 9 2006 despite being warned not to do so by the united states china and other nations recent progress in the sixparty talks under which north korea shut down its yongbyon nuclear reactor as required in phase i of the february 13 2007 agreement arguably represents defeat for the military but the slow progress in phase ii to date could indicate strong resistance by military interests to cutting more deeply into north koreas nuclear program38 when juche is combined with central planning command economy and government ownership of the

on crop rotation or new varieties of rice for example may be viewed as too risky39 foreign investment also is hindered partly because the regime abhors being exploited by capitalists who seek to make

floods lack of fertilizers and other inputs antiquated farming methods and lack of incentives for private production report in 2003 from north korea indicated that the situation along the border with china had deteriorated to the point that rates of starvation disease and even suicides were reaching crisis point45 in recent years there has been new emphasis on fishing using both traditional methods and new aquaculture technology according to the food and agriculture association in 2007 north koreas harvesting of winter crops and potatoes accounting for about 10 of total production had risen by 18 to 523000 tons due primarily to increased potato production46 however severe flooding had damaged grain crops in the southern cereal bowl provinces this resulted 7 decline to some 38

north korea has been plagued with the negative effects of its attempts at self sufficiency technological obsolescence uncompetitive exports economic privation and lack of foreign exchange these difficulties together with advice from china and russia have compelled the pyongyang regime to introduce some economic reforms to large extent they are adopting the sequence of chinese reforms with

style of gradual economic reform rather than the abrupt chinese style49 the reforms began in july 2002 when pyongyang announced series of measures that some surmise may mark the beginning of the end of the stalinist controls over the economy and the onset of more use of the market mechanism to make economic decisions particularly production and consumer purchases although the government has dubbed the reforms an economic adjustment policy50 the actions appear to be desperate attempt to revive the moribund economy the reforms also dovetail with north koreas military first policy as kim jongil has given first priority to the military the rest of the population has suffered51 this in turn has raised pressures on pyongyang to reform its economic system the adjustments reforms featured an end to the rationing system for daily commodities except for food huge increase in prices of essentials and in wages major devaluation of the currency official exchange rate abolishment of the foreign exchange coupon system increased autonomy of enterprises authorization of the establishment of markets and other trading centers and limited opening of the economy to foreign investment prices still remain under centralized control but at levels closer to those existing in peasant free markets north korea has not abandoned the socialist planned economy but it has been compelled to adjust certain aspects of it under the reforms overall prices were increased by 10 to 20 times government prices for many essential items however rose by much more the price for rice rose by 550 times for corn 471 times for diesel oil 38 times and for electricity 60 times wages also were raised but not enough to keep pace with skyrocketing consumer prices wages rose by 18 times for laborers and 20 times for managers52 even though not all workers received the promised wage increases the price and wage reforms caused households to face rampant consumer inflation and many people ended up worse off financially than before the reforms in north korean factories reforms include greater control over prices procurement wages and some incentives to increase profits in order to distribute them based on individual performance the regime also is looking to implement reforms in agriculture similar to those implemented in china along the lines of the rural household contract system in the mid1990s north

individuals to keep profits earned through legitimate economic activities53 now free markets and shopping centers that use currency not ration coupons are spreading the pyongyang central market for

chinesemade television sets and beer from singapore also is bustling with sellers and consumers reminiscent of those in other asian countries54 visitors to pyongyang in late 2006 indicated that the market was thriving with all types of products and shoppers driving european cars55 the north korean population is gradually becoming reaccustomed to operating in open markets this has raised fears by the dprk regime of encroachment by capitalism into their socialist economic system on august 26 2007 kim jongil announced that markets have become antisocialist westernstyle markets this has led to steady stream of government edicts restricting market activity across the country at first authorities prohibited women under the age of 40 from selling goods in pyongyang markets then on december 1 the authorities banned women under the age of 49 from running businesses in pyongyang since males are officially required to be at their assigned workplaces women generally run the businesses certain products such as videos of south korean dramas movies and other socalled nonsocialist elements are also banned from central markets56 enforcement of the new regulations at first was spotty but in late 2007 it appears to have become more strict according to news reports policing is also being conducted by central government security agencies organizations that normally deal with issues such as intelligence gathering and sedition57 the extent of the kim regimes attempts to control the development of market economy can be illustrated by the increased difficulty of acquiring travel permits for persons suspected of being wholesale merchants intending to carry goods from one place to another this crackdown on travel also is affecting normal tourist and family trips 53 jeong changhyun

by the international monetary fund the dprk had at least some trade with 80 of the 182 countries or customs territories that report their trade data to the fund77 for pyongyang the foreign economic sector plays an important role in that it allows the country to import food technology and other merchandise that it is unable to produce in sufficient quantities at home since north korea does not export enough to pay for its imports it generates deficit in reported merchandise trade that must be financed by other means pyongyang has to find sources of foreign exchange other than from its overtly traded exports to pay for the imports experts point out that the dprk has used its military threat to extort aid and other transfers from the united states japan south korea and the humanitarian agencies this along with various illicit activities has helped pyongyang to finance surfeit of imports detailed data on the countrys external economic relations suffer from reliability problems similar to those associated with the domestic economy the foreign economic data on actual commercial transactions however tend to be more accurate since they also are reported by trading partner countries and are compiled by the international monetary fund and united nations individual countries for example report on their imports from and exports to north korea these mirror statistics however differ from north koreas actual annual numbers because of differences in data gathering methods coverage timing and reporting countries also may misreport trade with the republic of korea as trade with the democratic peoples republic of korea detailed and reliable data on trade in military equipment and illegal drugs also are notoriously difficult to obtain and to verify 77 international monetary fund direction of trade statistics it should be noted that countries occasionally misreport trade with south korea as trade with the dprk crs25 south korea also compiles statistics on trade with north korea that differ from its data reported to the united nations south korea considers trade with the north as interkorean trade not foreign trade the trade figures that south korea reports to the imf for its commercial transactions with the north are considerably lower than the figures that it reports as interkorean trade usually available from the korea tradeinvestment promotion agency kotra the interkorean trade data reported by south korea also include more detail on nontransactional trade mostly foreign aid with north korea imf data also differ somewhat from those reported by data vending companies such as global trade atlas and global insight this report uses combination of trade totals mirror statistics from the imf partner country data from the global trade atlas intrakorean trade from south koreas kotra and references some estimates of total trade from global insight the dprks policy of juche its suspicion of foreign countries and the collapse of its industrial production has resulted in minimal level of commercial relations with other nations in the world this trade has been rising in recent years although much of this increase can be attributed to investments by south korea and china in dprk mining and manufacturing as shown in table 1 in 2007 north korea exported an estimated 1854 million in merchandise down from 2048 million in 2006 while importing 3242 million up from 2962 million in 2006 for merchandise trade deficit of 1388 million in recent years north koreas exports to and imports from china and south

ministry recent remarkable development has been north koreas increase in exports of primary products such as fish shellfish and agroforest products as well as mineral products such as base metallic minerals pyongyang reportedly has imported aquaculture technology to increase production of cultivated fish and agricultural equipment to increase output of grains and livestock it also has imported equipment for its coal and mineral mines much of the coal and mineral exports have resulted from partnering with chinese firms through which the chinese side provides modern equipment in exchange for supply of the product being mined or manufactured the production from the kaesong industrial complex also has become significant north korean imports from south korea and china both exceeded 1 billion in 2006 and north korean exports to south korea reached 765 million and to china 582 million meanwhile traditional exports of textiles and electrical appliances have been declining this reflects north koreas unstable power supply lack of raw materials and components imported from abroad and the need to ship finished goods to china or another third country for final inspection this diminishing ability of north korea to provide reliable manufacturing platform for the least complicated assembly operations without help from foreign investors does not bode well for the countrys future ability to generate the exports necessary to balance its trade accounts crs29 other sources of foreign exchange north koreas annual merchandise trade deficit of about 1 billion implies that pyongyang must either be receiving imports without immediate payment required aid and capital flows or be generating foreign exchange through some means either legal or illegal legal means include borrowing foreign investments foreign aid remittances from overseas north korean workers selling military equipment not reflected in trade data and by selling services abroad illegal methods include the counterfeiting of hard currency illegal sales of military equipment or technology sales of illegal drugs or by shipping illegal cargo between third countries the country also can dip into its foreign exchange

is relatively small amount only about 2 per capita total liabilities to bis banks including those located in north korea came to 1532 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 up considerably from 489 million in first quarter 2007 most of these liabilities appear to be export credits north korea also had deposits of 388 million in bis banks at the end of 200780 international bond issues are not major source of funds for north korea in may 2003 the country issued tenyear bonds the first since 1950 but since its sovereign securities are not rated by major western credit rating agencies the issue has generated little interest on international financial markets and is aimed at domestic investors pyongyang claims that million people had signed up to receive the bonds but many speculate that the deductions from the salaries of north korean purchasers in amounts equivalent to four months wages to buy the bonds is not voluntary81 north korea does not pay interest on the bonds rather the government holds lottery in which the winners receive monetary prizes greater than the foregone interest on the bonds82 although north korea is not major recipient of foreign direct investment fdi

banks dprk support fund c includes cultural exchanges and aid to nongovernmental organizations another major source of income for certain north korean families has been in remittances from overseas koreans particularly those who live in japan88 most of the north koreans in japan either remained there after world war ii or are descendants of those people some had been forcibly brought there to work in coal mines or factories during the 50year japanese occupation of korea currently of the approximately 650000 ethnic koreans who live in japan an estimated 56000 to 90000 are from the north korean area and many are reported to be actively involved in supporting the pyongyang regime ethnic koreans in japan work in variety of businesses and occupations but they face discrimination in japanese society and are known for operating pachinko pinball parlors and other enterprises providing entertainment and night life as well as being involved with japans yakuza or gangsters many of these as well as managers of north koreanrelated credit unions regularly have sent remittances to relatives or associates in north korea 88 for details see crs report rl32137 north korean supporters in japan issues for us policy by emma chanlettavery dprk workers also are countries such as those in the middle east china and russia crs34 one unusual method of smuggling money to north korea has been to hide 10000 yen bills worth roughly 90 each under expensive melons being shipped to kim jongil as gifts89 given the decade of stagnation of the japanese economy and rising tensions between japan and north korea these remittances have reportedly been declining 2003 japanese newspaper report placed the amount at between 200 million and 600 million per year but that figure could be exaggerated90 in testimony before parliament japans finance minister stated that in japans fy2002 34 million had been sent from japan to north korea through financial channels that required reports to the japanese government91 working estimate would be approximately 100 million per year in such remittances anecdotal evidence indicates that considerable amounts of currency from japan are simply carried by individuals on ships and not reported more than 1000 north korean freight vessels had been traveling between north korea and japan each year japan however has tightened inspections of north korean ships and curtailed operations of ferry boats traveling between the two countries92 in summary the dprks net total receipts plus remittances aid and investments from south korea and special food and fuel assistance in connection with negotiations over pyongyangs nuclear program constitute most of the overt resource inflows that north korea receives each year over and above its export earnings these amount to perhaps 700 million on net per year north korea must finance the remainder of its trade deficit about 800 million by other means it appears that these other means include exports of military equipment and illicit activity illegal or questionable sources of funds93 data on north korean sales of military equipment abroad is understandably murky but the country is thought to have sold hundreds of ballistic missiles to iran iraq syria pakistan and other nations in the past decade to earn foreign currency94 the interdiction by spain of an unmarked vessel in december 2002

out that north korea possesses scud and dong missiles and is developing the taepodong 2 he stated that the country is by far the most aggressive proliferator of missiles and related technologies to countries of concern these sales are one of the norths major sources of hard currency96 according to us military officer quoted in the japanese press north korea exported 580 million worth of ballistic missiles to the middle east in 200197 between 1998 and 2001 north korea is estimated to have exported some 1 billion in conventional arms to developing nations98 with respect to illegal drug trade officials from the us military command in seoul reportedly said that north korea is earning between 500 million and 1 billion annually from the narcotics trade99 north korea is thought to produce more than 40 tons of opium per year which would make it the worlds thirdlargest opium exporter and sixthlargest heroin exporter the regime also is accused of trafficking in methamphetamine stimulants us counternarcotics officials are reported to have said that since 1976 there have been at least 50 arrests or drug seizures involving north koreans in more than 20 countries japanese authorities say that nearly 50 of illegal drug imports into japan come from north korea100 according to the us state department although such reports have not been conclusively verified by independent sources defector statements have been consistent over years and occur in the context of regular narcotics seizures linked to north korea the state departments international narcotics control strategy report for 2007 stated its view is that it is likely but not certain that the north korean government has sponsored criminal activities in the past including narcotics production and trafficking but notes that there is evidence for several years that it continues to traffic in narcotics during 2006 the japanese media reported that drug trafficking occurred along the dprkprc border with japanese

released usdprk trade relations us trade with the dprk is quite limited the united states does not maintain any diplomatic consular or trade relations with north korea and the country does not have normal trade relations most favored nation status this means that north korean exports are subject to the relatively high tariffs existing before world war ii in the united states for example womens blouses of wool or cotton carry 90 import duty if from north korea but are duty free if from freetrade agreement countries such as canada israel or mexico or are subject to 9 to 10 duty if from most other nations as communist nation north korea also does not qualify for dutyfree treatment of certain products that are imported from designated developing countries under the generalized system of preferences program108 the united states moreover maintains various economic sanctions on north korea because the country is on the us state department list of state supporters of international terrorism is considered threat to national security is communist state and it proliferates weapons of mass destruction109 in june 2008 however the bush administration announced that it was lifting restrictions under the trading with the enemy act and was starting the process to remove the dprk from the list of state sponsors of terrorism other sanctions including sanctions imposed following north koreas nuclear test still remain in place the united states resumed shipments of food and heavy fuel oil to north korea as humanitarian aid travel to and trade with north korea in other than dualuse goods are allowed if overarching requirements are met and there are restrictions on the amount of money americans may spend in the dprk the sanctions related to the proliferation of weapons of

the consolidated appropriations act 2008 hr 2764 pl 110161 signed december 26 2007 provided for up to 53 million for energyrelated assistance for north korea the united states uses trade with north

discussions to normalize relations with the dprk has taken steps to remove it from the terrorism list114 and has indicated its willingness to negotiate peace treaty to formally end the korean conflict the way also could be opened for north koreas admission to membership in international financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund and asian development bank this would

standoff over the norths nuclear program one that will lead to lessening of tensions and steady integration of north koreas economy into the global economic and financial system as with other countries divided by ideology and history of hostilities as pawns on the chess board of the cold war the two halves of the peninsula face numerous issues to be resolved before they can normalize relations let alone contemplate reunification south korea has much to gain from rapprochement with the north its strategy has been to use its economic leverage and family reunions families separated by the division of the korean peninsula to open channels with the north korean people while maintaining credible military deterrent to overt hostile action by pyongyang south korea recognizes that essentially it has won the cold war on the korean peninsula but it recoils at the prospect of funding economic rehabilitation in the dprk as west germany did with east germany seoul also recognizes that its economic ties are gradually shifting from reliance on the american market to greater integration with china japan and other countries of asia its labor costs are rising and many of its companies are remaining competitive only by manufacturing in china and other lowwage markets for them the prospect of abundant cheap labor just short distance to the north is appealing and perhaps an alternative to cheap labor in china in 2007 total merchandise trade between the two koreas increased to 17979 million up from 13497 million in 2006 and more than triple the 4030 million just six years

of northsouth economic cooperation now is the kaesong industrial complex kic managed by south koreas hyundai asan and korea land corporation and located just over the border in north korea this 810

workers and provides needed hard currency for pyongyang north korea depends more on south korea in international trade than south korea does on the north north korea accounts for less than 1 of total

referred to pyongyangs missile and nuclear tests also with respect to north korean refugees their first destination is usually northeastern china according to human rights watch china labels north

relations japans economic relations with north korea have declined sharply as tension over pyongyangs nuclear and missile programs has spiked after north korea test launched several missiles in july 2006 and then detonated nuclear device in october 2006 japan imposed strict unilateral sanctions causing bilateral trade to plummet japan banned imports and most north korean nationals from entering japan prohibited all north korean ships from entering japanese ports and outlawed the export of luxury goods to north korea including caviar jewelry liquor and any food known to be favored by north korean leader kim jongil tokyo has also ceased sending any humanitarian aid to north korea and has refused to provide economic or energy assistance until their concerns with pyongyang are resolved this pattern is reversal of earlier economic relations although japan and north korea have never established official diplomatic relations the two nations maintained significant economic ties for well over decade from the end of the cold war japan was second only to china among north koreas top trading partners bilateral trade declined considerably in the 1980s but the drop was attributed primarily to the steep overall downturn of the north korean economy as much as the state of bilateral relations before relations deteriorated japanese leaders made several efforts to normalize relations with north korea promising considerable economic assistance to the country since 2002 however north koreas provocative missile and nuclear device tests along with the issue of japanese citizens kidnapped

manmade filaments wool and articles of iron or steel to north korea some japanese lawmakers have argued that japan should expand the ban on imports from north korea to cover exports as well japans food aid to north korea has also dwindled as relations soured the pattern of japanese aid reflects developments in the political relationship between tokyo and pyongyang shipments began in 1995 and 1996 when relations warmed were temporarily suspended periodically as tensions mounted and eventually ceased altogether in late 2004 because of disagreement over the abduction issue between 1995 and 2004 japan provided 12 million metric tons of humanitarian food aid to north korea mostly through the united nations world food program133 group of propyongyang ethnic koreans living in japan known as the chosen soren chongryun in korean in the past provided north korea with additional funds in the form of cash remittances and possibly facilitated illicit trade such as drug trafficking and counterfeiting although the exact amount of remittances is unknown the total appeared to be in the neighborhood of 100 million per year but declined sharply since the early 1990s series of scandals involving ethnic korean banks in japan revealed that money was illegally channeled to north korea through the network of chosen sorenaffiliated credit unions following the missile tests in 2006 japan froze fund transfers and overseas remittances by 15 groups and one individual suspected of links to north korean weapons programs and established rules that require financial institutions to report to the japanese government remittances overseas of more than 300 million yen russiadprk economic relations russian reforms and the end of the cold war greatly reduced the priority of the dprk in the strategy of russian foreign policy following soviet support of north korea in the korean war the ussr provided assistance to pyongyang that helped equip its military and create its heavy industrial sector in 1998 at the peak of the bilateral relationship about 60 of north koreas trade was with the soviet union much of the trade was in raw materials and petroleum that moscow provided to pyongyang at concessional prices relations between the two cooled in the 1990s 133 crs report rl31785 foreign assistance to north korea by mark manyin crs49 as russia recognized south korea announced that trade with north korea was to be conducted in hard currencies and opted out of its bilateral defense agreement134 recently overall relations between russia and north korea have been improving russia is upgrading its railway connections with the dprk and has been participating in an ambitious plan to build transkorean railway as is the case with china and south korea russia is critical to north korean security since russia shares border with the dprk and russian cooperation would be necessary to enforce any security guarantee as fuel aid from abroad has decreased moreover north korea has turned again toward russia as source of supply an observer of russiadprk relations views russian policy toward north korea as an important component of moscows general strategy toward what it considers the critically important asiapacific region russias strategic course includes calculating and pragmatic approach toward north korea and the korean peninsula in general moscow has gained unique and exclusive communications capabilities with pyongyang based on the development of trust between the leadership of the two states at the highest political levels135 this observer also points out that the perspective of russia on the north korea nuclear issue does not fully coincide with that of the united states while moscow has insisted on denuclearized korean peninsula and the irreversible dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons and nuclear development programs it also firmly supports the peaceful resolution of the issue russia is participant in the sixparty talks moscow apparently has concluded that the kim jongil regime does not face impending collapse and therefore outside pressure and economic sanctions intended to bring about regime change work only to increase tensions and the probability of military confrontation russia also does not favor korean peninsula unified by military force with american help this would put us forces on the russiakorean border rather russia supports unified korea that would maintain friendly relations with all countries including russia and opposes foreign interference in the unification process136 as is the case with china russia also is concerned that economic hardships in the dprk push refugees across the border into russian territory moscow also supported security council resolutions in 2006 that condemned north koreas missile and nuclear tests this has cooled the relationship to some extent the dprks trade with russian lags behind what it has been in the past in 2007 north korea ranked 88th among

126068 159607 92529 sources russian data as supplied by world trade atlas 199496 data from international monetary fund direction of trade statistics in december 2006 russia reportedly agreed to write off some 80 of the 8 billion in debt owed it by the dprk north korea had borrowed the funds in the 1960s to build power plants this opens the way for russia to engage in more crs51 economic cooperation with the dprk and to facilitate progress in the sixparty talks137 us interests strategy and policy the three legs of any grand strategy toward the dprk include economic diplomatic and military means to accomplish us goals and protect us national interests this report examines the economic side of this triad of strategic policy instruments but also reviews the diplomatic and military aspects of us policy in order to provide policy context us interests goals and strategy the dprk threatens several us national interests it threatens us security through its development and potential proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction north koreas missile delivery systems currently can reach south korea and japan and it is reportedly developing missile taepo dong 2 that can reach the continental united states138 its conventional forces are concentrated along the demilitarized zone within striking distance of south korean population centers and us forces north koreas dictatorial communist and oppressive regime headed by kim jongil runs counter to us values of freedom liberty human rights democracy and economic choice the national security strategy of the united states touches on north korea mainly through the following broadly stated goals 1 to prevent enemies from threatening the united states allies and friends with weapons of mass destruction 2 to strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and to work to prevent attacks against the united states or friendly countries 3 to work with others to defuse regional conflicts 4 to ignite new era of global economic growth through free markets and trade and 5 to champion aspirations for human dignity139 as applied to the dprk the immediate us goals include 1 to halt or eliminate north koreas development of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction 2 to preventhalt proliferation of weapons of mass destruction particularly to terrorist groups 3 to curtail illegal and questionable activities by north korea to include illicit sales of missiles140 dealing in illegal drugs and counterfeiting of currency 3 to reduce the threat of war on the korean peninsula 4 to ensure that north korea does not participate in international terrorist activity 5 to induce economic political and societal change in the country that could bring 137 russia to forgive most of n koreas debt the chosun ilbo digital version january 5 2007 138 see crs report rs21473 north korean ballistic missile threat to the united states by andrew feickert 139 the white house the national security strategy of the united states of america september 2002 140 see crs report rs21473 north korean ballistic missile threat to the united states by steven hildreth crs52 about favorable changes in the kim regime in governance in the standard of living of its people and in attitudes toward the united states and 6 to enhance the security of south korea and japan with respect to the dprk conventional wisdom with respect to north korea includes the following assumptions 1 without stringent monitoring mechanisms pyongyang probably will cheat on any agreement 2 north korea regularly engages in illicit activity and may take actions opposed to normally accepted international law or standards of national behavior 3 economic privation in north korea mainly affects the population outside of the political and military elite particularly in the countryside 4 popular sentiment opposing the current regime although reportedly on the rise appears weak or suppressed sufficiently for kim jongil to remain in power for an indefinite period of time 5 us military attack on north korea would result in an immediate counterattack on seoul and other targets in south korea using existing conventional weaponry that would cause extensive damage and 6 any north korean use of nuclear bombs on the united states or its allies would trigger retaliation that likely would destroy pyongyang its military installations and other targets other factors to be considered include the following 1 south korea has been pursuing policy of rapproachment and eventual normalization of relations with north korea although it maintains considerable distrust and hostility toward the country 2 among the countries with interest in north korea china appears to have the most influence and economic and political interaction although ties with russia still are strong and south korea has been major source of economic assistance and trade 3 japan would likely provide large monetary settlement to pyongyang in return for its years of occupation should peace settlement be reached 4 the border between china and north korea is porous particularly in the winter when the rivers are frozen and electricity so scarce that few lights operate at night 5 centrally planned communist economies that have been operating for several decades create distortions and consumer dissatisfaction that enable rapid transition to market economy once those economies are liberalized 6 economic reform and the opening of trade and investment in north korea would likely induce large increases in production and economic wellbeing but most dprk production facilities are so lacking in new machinery and equipment that major investments would be needed to raise them to world standards and 7 the level of distrust between the united states and the dprk is deep and longstanding given us interests and goals it appears that us strategy may include the following 1 convincing the pyongyang regime that developing nuclear weapons decreases not increases its security 2 creating tension within the regime over the allocation of resources between nuclear and conventional weapons and between the military and civilian economies 3 weakening the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of its citizens and support of kim jongil by fostering alternative centers of power facilitating the transition to market economy and increasing information flows into the country 4 depriving the central government of revenues derived from illicit activities and 5 eliciting greater cooperation from china and russia to induce them to apply more pressure on pyongyang to make suitable concessions and carry through on commitments deriving from the sixparty talks crs53 an economic strategy would be to generate interests in and dependency on international trade investment and greater interaction with the outside world that could weaken the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of citizens and bring the country more into the globalized world such economic liberalization also could reduce pressures on north korea to engage in illicit trade in order to cover its trade deficit and diminish the need for pyongyang to saber rattle in order to divert attention from its domestic problems major us policy options given the above interests goals assumptions and strategies with respect to the dprk include the following continue current policies of negotiations with the promise of lifting sanctions as dprk denuclearization progresses under the sixparty process intensify negative pressures on the dprk tighten economic and financial sanctions restrict trade between north korea and countries such as china japan south korea and europe and discourage foreign investment in the dprk increase engagement to include positive incentives for reform over the long term loosen sanctions encourage reforms facilitate foreign investment promote trade and allow north korea to join the international monetary fund and asian development bank combine policy options into package of incentives current us policy current us policy with respect to the dprk includes 1 diplomatic engagement through the sixparty talks and related bilateral meetings 2 non proliferation efforts including the proliferation security initiative 3 international efforts to counter trafficking by north korea in illegal drugs counterfeit currency or other contraband 4 maintenance of us military forces in south korea japan and elsewhere in the pacific as credible deterrent against north korean aggression 5 economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation and 6 keeping north korea from joining international financial institutions as the bush administration nears close it has shown new willingness to negotiate directly with the dprk although it maintains the umbrella of the sixparty talks the february 13 2007 sixparty agreement includes provision that north korea is to freeze its nuclear installations at yongbyon and invite back the international atomic energy agency to monitor the freeze north korea also is to discuss with the other six parties list of all its nuclear programs including plutonium extracted from used fuel rods from the five megawatt reactor which north korea claims to have reprocessed into nuclear weaponsgrade plutonium in exchange south korea is to provide financing for 50000 tons of heavy oil to be shipped to the north the dprk and the united states also are to start talks aimed at resolving bilateral issues and moving toward full diplomatic relations and the united states was to settle the banco delta asia issue under the agreement north korea and japan also were to start bilateral talks toward normalization of relations crs54 on the basis of settlement of outstanding issues of concern which japan interprets as requiring settlement of the issue of north koreas kidnapping of japanese citizens the february 2007 agreement represented clear change in strategy by the united states and other parties to the talks for the first time the banco delta asia action was linked by the united states to the sixparty talks and nuclear issues in essence the united states agreed to see that the banco delta issue was settled before pyongyang would have to take action to invite international atomic energy agency inspectors back into the country and to shut down its nuclear plant for the dprk this meant that the 25 million in frozen funds from banco delta accounts would be released first this was done the agreement also implied that strategy of regime change appeared to be off the table the question now is whether the dprk will live up to its commitments under the agreement and what leverage the united states china and other participants have to ensure pyongyangs compliance as result of the february 2007 sixparty agreement the united states has begun providing fuel and food aid and has held out the prospect of eventual normalization of relations with the dprk in response to specific disclosure and other actions by pyongyang in regard to its nuclear program141 on june 26 2008 president bush announced the lifting of the application of the trading with the enemy act twea with respect to the dprk and notified congress of his intent to rescind north koreas designation as state sponsor of terrorism142 according to the state department these actions were taken following the dprks submission of declaration of its nuclear programs as agreed to under the six party talks the earliest date august 11 2008 for the state sponsor of terrorism recision has passed the secretary of state reportedly is waiting for more complete verification on the part of the dprk before proceeding what is evident from the experience of the past seven years is that pyongyangs stalling and the united states refusal to negotiate bilaterally even under the umbrella of the sixparty talks provided time for pyongyang to continue to pursue its nuclear program given north koreas nuclear test in 2006 it is now obvious that the dprk actually had created nuclear device and may still have as many as five or six still in its arsenal143 north korea claims that the reasons for its nuclear program are to deter an attack by the united states and to use the bombs if south korea starts war or to devastate japan in order to prevent the united states from participating in such 141 for details on the sixparty talks see crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons program and crs report rl33567 koreaus relations issues for congress both by larry niksch 142 us department of state north korea presidential action on state sponsor of terrorism sst and the trading with the enemy act twea fact sheet june 26 2008 this began the clock on 45day period of prior notification of congress ending august 11 for delisting north korea as state sponsor of terrorism 143 for details see crs report rl34256 north koreas nuclear weapons latest developments by mary beth nikitin crs55 war144 the nuclear program also enables it to gain international prestige to exercise degree of hegemony over south korea and to extract economic assistance from other countries pyongyang is unlikely to abandon this nuclear program without significant changes to the underlying reasons for the programs existence its fear of being attacked had been exacerbated by its inclusion in the axis of evil the bush doctrine of preemptive strikes and the usled invasion of iraq145 some also consider pyongyangs nuclear program to be bargaining chip to be traded for economic assistance and to gain international recognition what also can be said about us policy is the renewed willingness to negotiate bilaterally under the sixparty process the banco delta asia action poor economic conditions and crop harvests in the dprk and pressures by china south korea and japan have brought some apparent progress in situation with north korea precisely what pyongyangs intentions are is still murky but it is clear that the dprk is now placing higher priority on food supply and economics in policymaking after north koreas 2006 nuclear test moreover it became evident that even china opposed the path pyongyang was taking following the nuclear test the united states took the issue to the united nations the resulting security council resolution 1718 october 14 2006 called on north korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and imposed several sanctions the resolution imposed an arms embargo on north korea banned trade in materials related to ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction and barred exports of luxury goods to the dprk it also froze funds and other financial assets owned by people connected with north koreas unconventional weapons program and banned travel by such people china and russia supported this resolution japan responded by curtailing imports from and travel to north korea banned north korean ships from entering its ports and prohibited exports of 24 luxury products to the dprk it appears however that despite deep privation and negative growth during the mid1990s economic sanctions had little effect on pyongyangs behavior in ways that would achieve us ends the ruling elite and military have first priority on scarce food and other supplies the kim regime allots economic privileges to its insiders peasants may starve but ranking communist party members live in separate world of relative luxury146 the poor economic conditions also do not appear to have materially undermined the kim regime experts consider internal dissident forces too weak and kims control over his military too strong for domestic coup to occur147 pyongyang has taken halting steps toward opening its 144 janes information group armed forces korea north janes sentinel security assessment march 4

and has allowed more private markets but these are similar to policies nearly all centrally planned economies are taking and china and russia have been recommending that north korea adopt them also irrespective of whether the us economic sanctions worsened north koreas economy the poor state of the north koreas agriculture and industries has indirectly affected us national interests it has necessitated humanitarian aid and has generated deficit in trade that pyongyang has attempted to fill by dealing in illegal drugs and missiles food scarcity also has pushed numerous refugees into china and south korea in terms of nonproliferation the proliferation security initiative now has more than 60 governments participating including russia although aimed at stopping trade in weapons of mass destruction and their components the prospect of ships being inspected complicates north korean efforts to smuggle illicit weapons drugs and counterfeit currency148 the sixparty talks current engagement with north korea is being conducted under the sixparty talks plus bilateral discussions between pyongyang and other nations the talks include the united states dprk china japan south korea and russia this brings all major players to the table exposes china and russia to north korean obstinacy enables china and russia to exert pressure on pyongyang and includes japan and south korea who have direct interests in peaceful resolution of the problem and are likely to be the major providers of aid to the dprk for discussion of the talks see crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons development and diplomacy and crs report rl33567 koreaus relations issues for congress both by larry niksch table 11 summarizes the major negotiating priorities and bargaining chips for each side in the sixparty talks any policy package would have to address at least some of the priorities of each nation the highest priority for the united states japan and russia reportedly is for north korea to scrap its nuclear weapons program in manner that is verifiable japan also is concerned about north korean missiles which have been fired over japan and full accounting for the abduction of its citizens in addition the united states china russia and japan seek stop to weapons proliferation while japan also seeks normalization of relations with the dprk and south korea seeks framework for rapprochement possible reunification with the north less military tension along the demilitarized zone dmz and access to cheap labor and markets in the north 147 continued sentinel security assessment

policy directions east asian review vol 15 3 autumn 2003 p 31 pyongyangs primary goals appear to include 1 preservation of communist rule under kim jongil 2 obtaining security guarantee that would preclude possible preemptive attack by the united states or its allies 4 maintaining key elements of its nuclear weapons programs 3 establishing diplomatic relations with the united states and japan 4 reunification with the south on its own terms and 5 obtaining economic assistance for its ailing economy while maintaining its juche philosophy risk of any policy package such as the february 13 2007 agreement is that north korea might not scrap its nuclear program once energy and other aid starts to flow again or the economy recovers sufficiently to become more self sustaining some surmise that the dprk military is still resisting complete shutdown and dismantling of the dprks nuclear program if pyongyang does not follow through on the agreement tensions could escalate and punitive measures could be considered149 absent settlement of the nuclear issue the world may have to learn 149 see oplan 5026 air strikes httpwwwglobalsecurityorgmilitaryops crs58 to live with nucleararmed north korea much as it has learned to live with nucleararmed pakistan and india japan and south korea would have to consider whether to develop nuclear capability themselves another risk of providing policy package that includes real incentives could be that the united states would be perceived as being blackmailed and giving away too much to dictator who regularly violates the human rights of his people the costs of diplomatic solution to tensions with north korea however seem relatively small compared with nuclear arms race in northeast asia the possibility of nuclear proliferation or preemptive military action opening trade and diplomatic relations would be of relatively low cost for the united states but this would require resolution of certain issues it also appears that in the final year of its second term the bush administration is seeking diplomatic success story with the dprk negotiations with pyongyang bilaterally and under the sixparty talks have proceeded in earnest humanitarian aid has been resumed it is now up to pyongyang to follow through on its commitments under the sixparty agreement particularly to disclose all of its nuclear programs possible economic incentives the february 2007 sixparty agreement includes various economic incentives for the dprk the shortterm incentives included providing fuel and releasing the banco delta funds removing the dprk from the us terrorist list and recinding its designation as state sponsor of terrorism while longterm incentives include normalization of economic relations and allowing north korea to join multilateral financial institutions such as the asian development bank and international monetary fund the list of potential economic incentives include the following normalizing diplomatic relations normalization of diplomatic relations with the dprk would apply to the united states japan and south korea north korea already has diplomatic relations with china russia and the european union including an embassy in london associated with normalizing relations would be peace treaty formally ending the korean war for japan the dprk would have to resolve certain issues including full accounting of the status of kidnapped japanese citizens north koreas missile firings over japan and incursions by suspected dprk espionage and drugrunning ships into japanese waters upon conclusion of these normalization talks japan is likely to offer 5 billion to 10 billion to north korea in compensation for its occupation150 normalizing diplomatic relations allows countries to communicate with each other in more direct fashion enables diplomats to gather information directly and provides more interaction on personal level normalized relations can help to overcome the pyongyang propaganda machine both within the dprk and on the world stage normalization however can imply that the united states is willing to tolerate conditions in north korea this may be unacceptable to some absent 149 continued oplan5026htm 150 see crs report rl32161 japannorth korea relations selected issues by mark manyin crs59 normalized relations washington could seek relationship similar to that with cuba even without diplomatic ties the us mission in havana is attached to that of switzerland and maintains staff similar in size to regular embassy north korea has been member of the united nations since 1991 and has representatives in new york japan has initiated talks with pyongyang that could lead to normalized relations and south korea has been seeking diplomatic ties and possibly some form of reunification in the future in 2007 bilateral talks between japan and the dprk on normalization were stymied by the abduction issue but they have resumed in 2008 negotiating trade agreement after normalization the united states could negotiate trade agreement with the dprk that would cover goods services and investments and could be modeled after the 2001 bilateral trade agreement concluded between the united states and the socialist republic of vietnam151 upon implementation of the trade agreement each country would accord the other normal trade relations most favored nation status the immediate effect would be to allow north korean exports to the united states to enter at the lower rates of duty accorded to nearly all other nations of the world the trade agreement also could cover investment and other us interests while the dprks market currently is small eventually it could reindustrialize and become larger economic player in the region liberalization of north korean trade and investment relations moreover can work through the economy in the same way that it did in china and russia by exposing the public to the benefits of increased wealth the major negative to establishing trade with north korea is that unless it is part of larger package that includes other concessions the united states could be viewed as exchanging an important bargaining chip for minimal gain easing us sanctions the united states could ease economic sanctions on north korea if the country resolves the issues that caused the sanctions to be imposed initially since north koreas other trading partners have more liberal trade with north korea it is mainly american companies and traders that are impacted by the sanctions pyongyang can spend its available foreign exchange in any of number of world markets in china russia south korea europe or elsewhere moreover as north korea opens its economy us businesses would be able to decide whether or not to invest there based on their own economic interests and not because they are hindered from doing so by us law allowing the dprk to join international financial institutions ifis the united states could stop blocking the dprk from joining the major ifis particularly the asian development bank world bank and international monetary fund152 pyongyang is particularly interested in joining the asian development bank but ifi procedures require membership first in the international monetary fund the imf requires certain economic data which the world bank or asian 151 the white house george w bush presidential proclamation to implement the agreement between the us and socialist republic of vietnam on trade relations june 1 2001 152 for information on requirements to join the international monetary fund see primorac marina how does country join the imf finance

mechanisms as well as open their country to visits surveys or assessments by the ifi as an incentive special fund could be set up in the world bank or asian development bank to assist north korea in its economic transition this fund could be financed by japan or south korea in conjunction with their normalization of relations with the dprk removing the dprk from the terrorism list the 45day period for notification to congress of the us intent to rescind the listing of the dprk as state sponsor of terrorism passed on august 11 2008 if the president rescinds this listing north korea would become eligible for us foreign aid loans from the us exportimport bank loans from any international financial organizations in which it has membership and an easing of us export control requirements153 fuel and food aid the bush administration resumed shipping fuel and food aid on humanitarian basis to the dprk south korea also has resumed shipments of fuel but it has insisted that food and fertilizer aid be sent only if requested by north korea products from the kaesong industrial complex when south korea was negotiating the proposed koreaus free trade agreement signed but not yet approved by congress they asked that products from the kaesong industrial complex in north korea be included under the fta and be accorded dutyfree entry into the united states the resulting fta language however does not provide for dutyfree entry into the united states for products made in kaesong annex 22b to the proposed fta however does provide for committee on outward processing zones opz to be formed and to designate zones such as the kaesong industrial complex to receive preferential treatment under the fta such designation apparently would require legislative approval by both
