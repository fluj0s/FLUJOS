and industry division gasoline and oil prices summary american gasoline consumers faced rapidly escalating prices during the first half of 2008 followed by declining prices in the second half as prices increased to over 400 per gallon consumers faced difficult choices concerning how to allocate limited budgets as the economy slowed the price increases also adversely affected major industries including automobile production transportation and agriculture the high gasoline prices also were thought to contribute to the slowdown in economic growth and the potential for general price inflation the oil industry earned record corporate profits while other sectors of the economy were negatively affected gasoline prices did not increase on their own over this period the rising price of gasoline was driven by the increasing price of crude oil the major cost component of gasoline crude oil prices which peaked at just under 150 per barrel in july and then turned down rose more quickly than gasoline prices and the cost share of crude oil per gallon of gasoline rose putting cost pressure on the refining distribution and marketing sectors of the gasoline supply chain while the recent increases in the price of crude oil began in late 2007 the price of oil has been increasing at different rates since 2004 many factors have contributed to the price increases over this period over the past five years the mix of factors affecting price at any particular time has varied recently several factors including the continuing increase in world oil demand the effect of speculation on energy futures markets the transformation of the energy futures market into pure financial market rather than commodity market the declining value of the dollar foreign governments fuel subsidization and limits to the ability of the market to increase supply have been identified as key in explaining oil and therefore gasoline price volatility the key factor of world oil demand is rapidly weakening as world growth in gross domestic product slows in the fourth quarter of 2008 and forecasted growth estimates for 2009 are reduced policy debates have focused on curbing speculation on oil futures markets by increasing regulatory presence over three dozen pieces of legislation have been introduced in the 110th congress to address speculationrelated issues other possible policy directions have included declaring moratorium on collection of the federal excise tax on gasoline conservation and the use of oil in the strategic petroleum reserve to augment us supplies of crude oil additionally the possibility of drilling in currently excluded areas on the atlantic and pacific outer continental shelf as well as the gulf of mexico have been considered the potential opening of the alaska national wildlife refuge for oil exploration and development has also been debated the oil market has demonstrated tendency to be cyclic and sharply volatile policy measures that assume longterm stability in the market are unlikely to attain the multiplicity of goals for oil policy the american public desires contents gasoline and oil price volatility 1 factors affecting oil prices 4 world

purchases by index speculators 9 table 7 opec excess crude oil capacity 12 gasoline and oil prices during the summer of 2008 american consumers faced gasoline prices that attained record high levels of over 400 per gallon and oil prices of more than 140 per barrel1 these high prices contributed to downturn in economic growth and an increase in inflation they forced consumers to make difficult choices concerning spending patterns while their general economic wellbeing declined the record prices raised costs and adversely affected wide variety of industries including transportation automobiles and agriculture as of the week of october 20 2008 gasoline prices were at 291 per gallon and the price of oil was below 70 per barrel2 however this favorable news for us consumers came in an environment of financial and credit market problems and growing fears that the nation was facing an economic recession because there does not seem to be one easily identifiable factor that has caused the quick surge in oil prices consensus on how to mitigate the situation through policy has been elusive calls for increased exploration and drilling in alaska and currently restricted offshore areas energy conservation increased reliance on alternative energy sources curbing speculation on oil futures markets releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve suspending the federal tax on gasoline and taxing the profits of oil companies have all been debated while it may be easier to identify the firstorder causes of the rapid decline in oil prices declining oil product demand linked to worldwide slowdown in economic growth other factors that contributed to the price increases earlier in 2008 could also be identified this report examines the extent of price volatility in gasoline and oil markets focuses on the linkage between the two and analyzes the causes of the price increases and the likelihood that they have been reversed through market responses or policy measures gasoline and oil price volatility the energy information administration eia reported that retail gasoline prices increased by 33 from january through july 2008 or by over 1 per gallon3 although the price was higher in each month in 2008 on monthbymonth basis 1 diesel and aviation fuel prices increased at least as much as gasoline prices 2 energy information administration west texas intermediate spot price and weekly gasoline price data available at httpwwweiadoegov 3 table 1 represents us regular gasoline all formulations crs2 compared to 2007 the greatest differential was observed in july when prices were about 110 per gallon higher than in the previous year these price increases led consumers to respond by using less gasoline and driving fewer miles by midjuly 2008 gasoline demand had declined by about 340000 barrels per day bd or 36 compared to similar period in 20074 by october 2008 gasoline demand compared to the same period in 2007 was down by about 392000 bd or 425 miles traveled declined by 37 in may 2008 compared to may 2007 and 36 in july 2008 compared to july 20076 these responses are important because they represent potential market adjustment that could result in the moderating of the price increases of the first half of 2008 if consumption did not decline in the face of sharp price increases there would be little incentive for producers not to continue raising prices table 1 us monthly gasoline prices cents per gallon 2007 2008 january 2240 3043 february 2278 3028 march 2563 3244 april 2845 3459 may 3146 3766 june 3056 4054 july 2965 4062 august

they could provide consumers an incentive to increase consumption however slower economic growth job losses and reduced incomes are likely to depress gasoline consumption as result the price effect which acts to stimulate gasoline consumption is likely to be offset by an income effect which acts to reduce gasoline consumption 4 energy information administration this week in petroleum gasoline july 23 2008 5 ibid october 22 2008 6 federal highway administration traffic volume trends may and july 2008 crs3 during the price increases of the first half of 2008 the cost composition of gasoline changed table 2 shows that not only did crude oil cost more per gallon of gasoline but its share of the total price increased crude oil cost about 154 per gallon of gasoline in june 2007 rose to 300 per gallon of gasoline in june 2008 and fell to 216 per gallon by october 2008 table 2 cost composition of gasoline june 20072008 percent 2007 2008 crude oil 505 730 refining 227 100

50 and fell from 069 per gallon in 2007 to 036 per gallon in 2008 this nearly 48 fall in cash flow to refiners has reversed the economic performance of refiners in recent years and puts into even greater question the possibility of expanding the us refining capacity base distribution and marketings share of the price of gallon of gasoline also declined from june 2007 to october 2008 putting pressure on gas station owners as they saw their net return per gallon sold fall taxes were less affected by the growing role of crude oil in the cost structure of gasoline because while the federal excise tax on gasoline is fixed 0184 per gallon and as result will decline in percentage terms as the price of gasoline rises some state and local taxes on gasoline are percent of value or ad valorem taxes and will retain constant share of cost as the price of gasoline rises the data presented in table 2 suggest that the major reason the price of gasoline has been volatile in 2008 is because the price of crude oil has been volatile the rise and fall in the price of crude oil has not only affected consumers it has affected virtually all the parts of the gasoline supply chain crs4 table 3

oil rose by about 24 in the second half of 2007 the price of gasoline rose by only about 2 over the same time period while crude oil prices increased by another 44 in the first half of 2008 gasoline prices increased by 34 over the same period anticipated and actual cuts in demand for gasoline may have caused firms to resist passing the full cost increases of crude oil on to consumers in 2007 increasing the rate at which gasoline prices rose in early 2008 crude oil prices fell by 22 from july through september 2008 while gasoline prices fell by only about 9 partial data for october 2008 suggest that the average price of crude oil fell to about 86 per barrel or 17 compared to september 2008 while the price of gasoline fell by about 14 during the same period the lags in passing declining costs on to consumers may be due to inventory policies that require the covering of past costs or to attempts by the refining industry to enhance returns after period of reduced earnings in 2008 factors affecting oil prices the price of oil is set on world market over which firm has direct control however the market differs in significant ways from the economic conception of free competitive market five countriesthe united states china japan india and south koreaconsumed over 45 of the world demand of 852 million barrels per day in 2007 while producing only 14 of world production as result these countries as well as many other net consuming nations depend on world trade in crude oil since production of crude oil depends on geological formation to yield the oil only certain places in the world can produce oil at high levels in excess of crs5 their own consumption these areas are concentrated in the persian gulf where over 60 of known proved reserves are located reserves can be augmented and production can be increased only after the expenditure of billions of dollars and years of development after discovery the persian gulf oil producers and others attempt to exercise control of the price of oil through the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec because of the characteristics of consumers and producers in the market both the demand and the supply sides of the market are very inelastic or price insensitive in the short and intermediate term since neither consumers nor producers can easily make quantity adjustments in response to changing prices the market price may not be singular there may be range of prices that are consistent with the market avoiding physical shortages or surpluses in this type of market environment high levels of price volatility are likely world demand frequently cited reason for high crude oil prices is the growth of world demand driven by china and india table 4 world oil demand 19972007 thousand barrels per day year demand of growth year demand of growth 1997 73598 58 2003 79296 19 1998 73939 005 2004 82111 35 1999 75573 22 2005 83317 15 2000 76340 10 2006 84230 11 2001 76904 007 2007 85220 12 2002 77829 12 source bp statistical review of world energy 2008 note growth is the percentage change in year over the previous year table 4 shows that the total growth in demand over the past five years of 75 is higher than the total growth of 53 over the previous five years over the past five years from 2003 to 2007 consumption growth in china totaled 35 higher than the world growth rate however the growth of chinese demand cannot be considered in isolation since the crude oil market is worldwide the high level of chinese growth should be considered only in the context of total world demand growth7 although 1997 and 2004 stand out as years in which annual growth exceeded the ten year average of 13 the data in table 4 might not appear to suggest that 7 for example total consumption demand in japan and europe declined between 2006 and 2007 this reduced demand translated into more available supply to satisfy chinese demand crs6 demand growth could be sufficient to push crude oil prices to the record levels observed in july 2008 in the case of the oil market it may be that percentage changes taken alone are misleading because of the nature of oil production which is characterized by time lags an inability to easily expand output from existing fields and low incentives to keep production as excess capacity the actual volume of demand increases irrespective of the percentage value is key factor this differentiates the oil industry from other manufacturing and service industries where marginal percentage increments in output can be met by using the existing capital stock and labor force more intensively the demand increase of 35 or over 28 million bd in 2004 reduced spare capacity in the world and created tight balance between demand and supply when growth fell to 15 in 2005 that nonetheless represented further expansion of required world production by 12 million bd because world production could not expand quickly enough to meet this new demand further reductions in excess capacity occurred and the tight market conditions continued when an increase in demand causes total demand to exceed current production it must be met by reducing excess capacity when excess capacity in the industry falls markets anticipate that the reduced excess capacity is less able to accommodate future possible supply disruptions and as result the price increases the solution to rising prices if one concludes that world demand growth cannot be controlled in the long run is expansion of output however the largest oil reserves are believed to be already discovered and in production future fields might well be smaller and more costly data shows that in 2007 the world level of proven reserves declined from 1239 trillion barrels to 1237 trillion barrels suggesting that new discoveries did not offset 2007 production levels8 estimates of world oil demand for 2009 are being revised downward the international energy agency iea cut its forecast world demand for crude oil by 500000 bd for the second half of 2008 in addition it cut 400000 bd from its forecast for 2009 these revisions yield 2009 world oil demand of 872 million bd some 700000 bd over 2008 levels9 although the iea sees demand declining in the industrialized nations it sees demand continuing to increase in emerging markets the reason for the reduction in forecast world oil demand is declining outlook for world economic growth the international monetary fund imf forecast for world gross domestic product growth for 2008 was 39 and for 2009 is 30 after 50 growth in 2007 the financial crisis being experienced on world markets and the continuing effects of high commodity prices are blamed for reduced growth10 8 bp statistical review of world energy 2008 june 2008 p 6 9 international energy agency oil market report october 10 2008 10 international monetary fund world economic outlook october 2008 crs7 financial speculation one of the most debated factors in rising oil prices has been the role of speculators particularly those investing through commodity index funds speculators have always been part of energy futures markets but it generally has been as the other side of hedging transactions by physical traders11 their role has been to accept price risk when physical traders sought to transfer it and lockin prices recently however commodities futures markets have become part of financial investor portfolio strategies as result the market has seen an inflow of new participants that have interest in the physical commodity beyond the possibility of profiting from its price variations the oil futures market is actually composed of three different markets regulated futures exchanges like the new york mercantile exchange nymex electronic trading facilities like the intercontinental exchange ice and the over the counter otc or swap market each market offers different contract traded under different rules and with different degrees of regulatory control12 the focus for oil price effects has recently been on the nymex where standardized futures contract based on west texas intermediate wti crude oil deliverable at cushing oklahoma is traded under the regulation of the commodities futures trading commission cftc this market is financial in nature in the sense that little or oil actually is traded or changes hands almost all contract gains and losses are settled in cash and positions either long as holder of the right to buy oil or short as holder of the right to sell oil can be closed out or offset by purchasing contract that offsets the original position in principle there is little reason why any transaction on the oil futures markets should affect the current price of oil what is being traded in these markets is contract that obligates an investor to buy oil one month or more in the future at known set price if more investors desire to be in that position the demand for the contract goes up taking with it the contract price at which that oil might be traded again in principle this transaction does not affect any demand or supply fundamental in the physical oil market and should not necessarily affect the current price of oil in general it is more likely that shifts in the underlying fundamentals of oil demand and supply could affect the expectations of future prices held by investors and alter their behavior causing them to buy or sell leading to price variations that reflect the evolving market forces in the physical market in the real market for oil it is possible that purely financially based expectations realized through changing positions in the financial markets might affect the real price of oil the spot market market for the delivery of real crude oil bases its price on the futures market and eia data show that the two prices vary only by few cents as observed in table 5 11 see crs report rl31923 derivatives risk management and policy in the energy markets by robert pirog for more on the mechanics of the hedging process 12 see crs report rl34555 speculation and energy prices legislative responses by mark jickling and lynn j cunningham for more on the focus and degree of oversight and regulation crs8 the reason for this close correlation is that the spot price is in itself forward price oil contracted today on the spot market must generally be delivered within twentyone days with notice given to the buyer prior to delivery the near month futures contract generally covers thirty days or less into the future hence there is substantial overlap between futures market contract delivery and spot market delivery as result the nymex near month futures price is the basis for the spot market price adjusted for relatively minor differences in delivery time and other factors this linkage between the spot and futures market price is the connection between the financial oil market and the real oil market it allows investment decisions by financial institutions and investment funds to be transferred quickly and directly to gasoline consumers table 5 futures and spot prices for wti crude oil 20072008 dollars per barrel spot price future price spot price

httpwwweiadoegov it is possible to take almost the reverse position on the spot versus future price correlation in this view the futures price must always adjust to the spot price at the expiration date of the futures contract the spot price must equal the futures price on the expiring contract because the holder of futures contracts can always choose to receive oil rather than cash settlement if desired futures prices are seen as driven by expectations of the future spot price in this market conception the primary control mechanism is that essentially all of the futures market participants are real commodity hedgers13 13 david l crawford oil futures are phony target philadelphia daily news august 4 2008 crs9 several factors are important in balancing these arguments the approach that claims futures markets control the spot price are based on investor behavior that is at odds with that of the perfectly rational financial investor of economic theory for this approach to have validity two tests should be met first there should be class of participants in the market that are not hedgers in the sense of having need to lock in the price of oil for commercial use for example purely financial investors second there should be some explanation and evidence that the noncommercial class of market participants were likely making investment decisions driven by some other rationale beyond that of rational economic financial analysis definite quantitative evidence is available for either condition however testimony given at congressional hearings indicates that new participants may be entering the oil futures markets in the form of investment by commodity index funds14 table 6 commodity purchases by index speculators millions of barrels holdings 1103 holdings

governmental affairs united states senate may 20 2008 the data in table 6 show that over five year period holdings of crude oil and gasoline in the form of futures contracts by investors in commodity index funds increased by over 500 in the case of wti crude oil and over 200 in the case of gasoline investors in these funds include pension funds university endowments private investors hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds commodity index funds pool investors funds and purchase futures contracts in wide variety of commodities markets including agriculture livestock energy base and precious metals in each of these markets the funds have expanded their holdings since 2003 in amounts comparable to those observed in table 615 the purpose of commodity index fund investment is not to gain title to commodities the funds settle their contract positions in cash the goal is the benefit of diversification as well as the potential for high rates of return commodity prices are thought to vary inversely with financial investments in traditional corporate shares and bonds for example if the dow jones industrial average of corporate shares declines on particular day investors might expect to observe an increase in the index value of commodity futures this inverse performance of financial and commodity markets reduces the overall risk in investors portfolios and presents investors more favorable riskreturn profile 14 michael w masters testimony before the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs united states senate may 20 2008 15 ibid p 3 crs10 since futures contracts in energy markets have finite time horizon when the contracts expire new contracts must be purchased to keep the target balance between stocks bonds and commodities in place as result once commodity index fund managers determine that commodity investments are desirable part of their portfolios this new source of demand is in effect permanent any new source of demand driven not by the fundamentals or expectations of oil demand and supply but by portfolio decisions is likely to raise the price of an oil contract on the futures market which is transmitted directly to consumers through the linkage between the futures and spot market prices for commodity index investments to be an important factor in the increasing price of oil over time not only must there be an initial expansion of demand but growing demand in each subsequent time period this type of demand growth might result from favorable expectations concerning the fundamentals of the oil market or it could result from herd mentality among portfolio managers which could contribute to financial bubble due to speculators entering the commodity futures market and driving up prices of contracts if the commodity futures market has bias toward this type of upward price movement and it is supported by strong fundamentals in the real commodity markets growing demand andor tight supplies it is likely that the result will be increasing prices as observed in the price of oil since 2004 if the effects of financial speculation either increased the price of oil or caused the price to rise faster than justified by market fundamentals during the first half of 2008 they are likely to have similar but reverse effects during the current market downturn the financial crisis has provided incentives for financial firms and hedge funds to move to more liquid investment position increasing their cash balances this allows the firms to strengthen their balance sheets by reducing their holdings of risky assets and provides readily accessible reserves should investors demand to withdraw their funds although data is not available it is likely that some speculative financial positions on commodity markets have been liquidated as firms strive to increase their cash holdings this attempt to sell oil could possibly cause the price of oil on the nymex to fall or fall more quickly than justified by the weakening fundamentals in the world oil market value of the dollar many analysts believe the price of oil varies inversely with the value of the dollar against other major currencies notably the euro oil is priced in dollars on the international market if the dollar falls in value against another currency it takes fewer units of that currency to purchase the requisite number of dollars needed to buy barrel of oil as result oil becomes cheaper in the other currency say the euro than in dollars the price of oil measured in dollars then rises each dollar purchases smaller fraction of barrel of oil as result holding oil rather than dollars becomes way to protect against declining dollar over the period of rising oil prices 2004 to mid2008 the eurodollar exchange rate has been variable from january 2 2004 to january 3 2005 the euro increased in value relative to the dollar by 7 from january 3 2005 to january 3 2006 the crs11 euro declined in value relative to the dollar by 11 from january 3 2006 to january 2 2007 the euro increased in value relative to the dollar by 108 from january 2 2007 to january 2 2008 the euro increased in value relative to the dollar by 10916 the increasing value of the euro in 2007 may have been factor in the increasing price of oil over the same period as of the end of october 2008 the dollar had begun to strengthen or increase in value with respect to the euro and the british pound sterling this increase in the value of the dollar would tend to weaken the price of oil if the same relationship observed in 2007 continues to hold national subsidies in many areas of the world gasoline consumers have been protected from the effects of higher world oil prices by their governments through fuel subsidies for example it was reported that in july 2008 the price for gallon of gasoline in venezuela was 012 040 in iran 045 in saudi arabia and 089 in egypt17 high population countries like china indonesia and russia also subsidize gasoline the effect of fuel subsidies is to reduce the ability of the natural market forces of demand to lower price consumers make decisions based on artificially set prices consumption is higher than it would be if they faced the market price producers see less reason to lower prices because demand continues to be strong the demand effect also affects consumers in nations that do not subsidize although consumers in the nonsubsidy countries may cut back on consumption when faced with higher prices their decisions may be negated by demand growth in subsidized markets in this way governments that subsidize fuel costs in their domestic markets are adopting strategy which supports oil producers and high prices nations that subsidize fuel costs do pay price whether they are oil exporters or not the subsidy is generally large drain on the national treasury causes inefficient allocation of resources and anomalies in trade for example iran exports over 2 million barrels per day of crude oil but imports gasoline because of domestic demand for gasoline that exceeds irans refining capacity oil supply oil supply is relatively insensitive to price changes in the short run more oil production can enter the market in times of high prices only if excess capacity exists at producing fields given the level of demand18 similarly production only minimally declines when prices fall because it is uneconomic to cut production rates at producing fields due to the wide spread between the cost of extraction and typical levels of price observed over the past five years as well as high fixed costs excess capacity is thought to exist only in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec 16 an increase in the value of the euro is the same as decrease in the value of the dollar 17 cnn special report us gas so cheap it hurts july 15 2008 18 excess capacity is sometimes referred to as spare capacity crs12 excess capacity hit recent peak of about 7 million barrels per day in 2002 and has been lower than peak but increasing since 2004 table 7 shows the pivotal role played by saudi arabia in the world oil market saudi excess capacity accounted for 82 of opec spare capacity in 2005 and 61 in 2007 nigerian oil production is subject to disruption due to political upheaval and iran and the oil importing nations are at odds over irans nuclear ambitions the most direct way to augment spare capacity in the shortrun is through demand reduction generally as result of higher prices and slowing economic growth because excess capacity has increased over the 20072008 period it is unlikely that excess capacity constraints were the major factor in the recent price increases in the longer term if world demand for oil continues to grow as more nations develop and gain income and wealth excess capacity is likely to be tight unless high levels of investment in productive capacity take place investment in productive capacity is limited by resource nationalism resource nationalism refers to the practices of countries with known or suspected oil reserves that limit access to those potential supplies if national oil companies either due to lack of funding or expertise or political direction fail to develop oil resources the world oil market is likely to have difficulty keeping up with world demand perpetuating high prices table 7 opec excess crude oil capacity

source petroleum intelligence weekly september 3 2007 values for 2008 and 2010 are estimates crs13 oil importing countries can create excess capacity in the world market by reducing their own demand or augmenting their own oil production if they hold oil reserves while it is unlikely that any importing countries hold undeveloped reserves comparable to those in the larger opec nations even more modest increases in production may reduce prices due to the price insensitive nature of oil demand in this type of market with low degree of price sensitivity relatively small changes in production might affect both current and future prices policy issues the increases in gasoline and oil prices have led to number of congressional initiatives based on the number of bills introduced primary focus of the 110th congress has been on curbing oil speculation activities proposed legislation has focused on closing variety of regulatory loopholes that have prevented regulatory authorities from exercising oversight increasing regulatory resources assigning emergency regulatory powers and attempting to reduce the desirability of energy futures trading by increasing margin requirements as well as data reporting19 over three dozen pieces of proposed legislation were considered in the 110th congress it is possible that because activities on the oil futures markets may have escaped regulatory scrutiny strategies were undertaken that resulted in price manipulation other policy approaches suggested to reduce gasoline prices included the suspension of the federal excise tax on gasoline this tax is 0184 cents per gallon and the revenue generated is applied to the highway trust fund concern was expressed as to whether the tax suspension would be passed on to consumers by refiners who collected the tax and whether highway construction projects and the local employment they support would be adversely affected20 in september of 2008 the highway trust fund was approaching zero balance condition that would threaten the continuation and completion of construction projects all over the country the shortfall in funds came about as result of reduced revenues linked to declining gasoline purchases resulting from higher prices transfer of 8 billion from the us treasury to the highway trust fund pl 110 318 was authorized on september 15 2008 the united states maintains strategic petroleum reserve of almost 750 million barrels of oil some have suggested that releasing oil from the reserve might reduce prices at the pump others felt that the amounts of oil that could be
