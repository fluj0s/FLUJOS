brown santiago 00000324 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador paul simons for reasons 14 bd 1 u march 28 2009 830 am vina mar chile 2 u participants us joseph biden vice president antony blinken national security advisor to the vice president brian mckeon deputy national security advisor to the vice president brian harris notetaker politicaleconomic officer us embassy guatemala city united kingdom gordon brown prime minister thomas fletcher private secretary to the prime minister stuart wood special advisor to the prime minister douglas alexander secretary of state for international development 3 c summary during bilateral meeting on the margins of the progressive governance leaders summit in chile vice president joseph biden and british prime minister gordon brown discussed the economic crisis in terms of the upcoming g20 summit and afghanistan and pakistan on economic issues brown pressed vice president biden to push the germans to move forward with 250 billion in special drawing rights sdrs for the imf to use imf gold sales to support poorest countries and to take the initiative to restart sectoral negotiations related to doha on pakistan and afghanistan vice president biden noted our increased troop commitment to afghanistan and the need to lower expectations as to what is achievable in afghanistan given enormous governance issues end summary trade and economic issues 4 c pm brown opened the meeting by thanking vice president biden for recent statement on revising the supervisory structure for the g20 5 c vice president biden asked whether capital flight from developing countries would be high on the g20 agenda and noted that argentinean president fernandez has requested additional assistance without the usual imf conditionality brown responded that he was worried about capital flight particularly in eastern europe the current financial crisis will test whether eastern european nations have developed sufficiently strong institutions since the fall of communism to withstand the downturn politically and socially as well as economically it is test of whether freedom can be successfully combined with economic stability imf conditionality has long been an area of contention for latin america and it is not surprising that argentina would ask for preventative funds without conditions brown presses on imf and trade 6 c prime minister brown delivered several requests on economic issues to vice president biden the first was the need to secure financing for an additional 250 billion in special drawing rights sdrs for the imf to help vulnerable economies withstand the economic downturn brown commented that his understanding was this was an amount that the administration could support without the need to consult congress us support on the issue would be particularly helpful with the germans who as yet do not support additional sdrs parallel discussions were going on with china japan saudi arabia and several other gulf nations to secure 400 billion in additional financing rapid approval of the imf portion would help catalyze these parallel negotiations 7 c pm brown also noted that the imf was being forced to sell gold to raise funds to pay its administrative staff there had been far fewer loan programs this decade than in the 1990s the result was reduced revenue from countries repaying loans and consequent budget shortfall there is santiago 00000324 0022 of 003 pending sale of 11 billion in imf gold that should be used to help the poorest countries rather than pay imf staff the us position had been that interest from gold reserves could be devoted to imf programs but that capital sales should not pm brown asked vice president biden to reconsider this position 8 c pm brown said successfully concluding the doha round would be difficult but the obama administration should agree to deal with environmental and labor commitments outside the formal trading framework in relevant institutions such as the ilo brown suggested that if the united states allowed resumption of the next round of sectoral discussions it would create momentum for the rest of the world including india to reengage in the discussions opening new sectoral discussions on doha would garner the administration international support without needing to make difficult political compromises or commitments for the time being 9 c uk secretary of state for international development douglas alexander said it was important to find way to move forward on the doha agreement trade discussions are like riding bike ie you have to keep moving forward or you fall down if we do not proactively move forward and eventually come to successful conclusion to the doha round the united states could be blamed in some quarters the doha round was meant to be the development8 round of negotiations with significant aid from donor nations contingent upon the agreements successful conclusion if it did not pass some governments that stand to lose aid such as brazil would likely blame the united states 10 c vice president biden did not commit on any of these issues but noted that labor interests in the united states were not satisfied and were looking to the administration to establish its labor bona fides8 in year he said movement on economic and trade issues would either be easier or impossible depending on the direction of the world economy afghanistanpakistan 11 c turning to afghanistan and pakistan vice president biden described the importance of combating terrorism and noted the different elements of the obama administrations policy first the focus in afghanistan is on qaida the obama administration will not make an openended commitment to building freedom and democracy in afghanistan because it is not realistic second there is real possibility of defeating qaida without also dealing with pakistan third he recognized that the united states cannot solve the problem on its own the whole world needed to engage 12 c vice president biden said he worried that nato countries in europe underestimated the threat from the region and viewed the problem as an economic development issue rather than security issue despite the fact that afghan opium is primarily exported to europe and europe has been the victim of several terrorist attacks originating from the region vice president biden described the complex nature of the security problem in afghanistan commenting that besides the demography geography and history of the region we have lot going for us8 13 c vice president biden noted that the current us commitment of 63000 troops to afghanistan is the result of vigorous internal policy debate and would not be sustainable politically for more than two years without visible signs of progress after two years the extraordinary cost of maintaining robust military presence in afghanistan would make additional commitment increasingly difficult after afghan elections the administration intends to review the situation again currently there is little capacity for the afghan government to execute many of the functions of government in many areas of the country local officials have close to knowledge of how to govern or even basic knowledge of payroll or budget part of the reason the taliban is strengthening is since the taliban has the local capacity to settle basic disputes quickly while central government courts can take six to eight months to process case 14 c the idea of strong rule of law under centralized santiago 00000324 0032 of 003 karzai government was not realistic new policy towards the taliban should reflect the reality of the afghan governments lack of capacity our policy should first aim to stabilize the urban areas and surrounding rural communities and then seek to exploit divisions within the taliban coopting moderate elements rather than simply defeating militarily all elements of the taliban 15 c on pakistan vice president biden commented that it was difficult to convince pakistan to commit to developing its counterinsurgency potential the threat from india leads pakistan to devote the bulk of its defense spending to conventional warfare capabilities however something must be done in the meantime we need to develop our relationship with pakistan beyond its current transactional nature to longterm strategic partnership we should begin with 15 billion per year in economic assistance that is unconditional and supplement that with military assistance that is conditioned on the modernization of its command structure and active action in the field to combat insurgents it would be difficult to convince congress to support such plan particularly the unconditional civilian component 16 c vice president biden noted that the united states wants to empower the and wants active european participation in resolving the threats in pakistan and afghanistan with the exception of the uk and few others very few europeans are taking action germany completely dropped the ball on police training but nato countries should continue to provide assistance that is within their capacity to deliver 17 c brown agreed that there was significant terrorist threat emanating from the region more than 30000 pakistanis travel back and forth to the uk each year and twothirds of the terrorist threats that uk security forces investigate originate in pakistan including one ongoing investigation the roots of terrorism in pakistan are complicated and go beyond the madrasas to in some areas complete societal incitement to militancy zedaris commitment to combating terrorism is unclear although he always says the right things 18 c brown agreed on the need for shared commitment and noted that the only way to reduce the threat and eventually draw down natos commitment to the region was by increasing the capacity of afghanistani and pakistani security services dividing the taliban would greatly reduce its effectiveness though doing this made the iraq problem look easy by comparison 19 s vice president biden commented that zedari had told him two months ago that isi director kiyani will take out8 brown thought this unlikely and said that kiyani did not want to be another musharraf rather he would give civilian leadership scope to function however he was wary of the sharif brothers and zedari 20 u the office of the vice president cleared this message simons
