extended the elementary and secondary ducation act of 1965 esea esea programs are authorized through fy2008 and the 110th congress is considering whether to amend and extend the esea the nclb signed into law on january 8 2002 expanded requirements for the use of standards and assessments to m easure student academic achievement and it strengthened state local educationa l agency lea and school accountability provisions related to student achieveme nt and other outcomes this report summarizes the provisions and implementation status to date of several major nclb requirements as they relate to specific nclb programs and it examines some of the implementation issues that have arisen as consequence of these requirements this report is divided by topic into eleven sec tions following the sequential order to the extent feasible of nclb provisions alt hough the report may be read in its entirety each section is written to stand alone to ssist readers who may elect to read only about topics of particular in terest selected issues rais ed in each section are briefly highlighted in the following synopsis section 1 of the report examines new standard and asse ssment requirements contained in title ia of the esea as amended by the nclb as well as how these requirements build upon preexisting require ments and the timeline for their adoption section 1 also addresses two major questions regarding the implementation of sta ndard and assessment requirements what is the additional financial cost borne by states as th ey implement the ne wly required annual assessments in additional grades and inco rporate new standard s and assessments at three grade levels in science and what ar the potential educati onal costs and benefits of these changes section 2 of the report focuses on th national assessment of educational progress naep federally funded ries of assessments of the academic performance of elementary and secondary students in the united states the nclb includes new requirement that states wishing to remain eligible for grants under esea title ia participate in biennial state naep tests in 4th and 8th grade section 2 addresses three implementation issues will these new requirements increase the influence of naep on state standards and assessments will problems arise as result of the new mandatory requirement for pa rticipation of states but continuinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs2 voluntary participation of pupils and can nae p results be used to confirm state test score trends section 3 of the report addr esses the implementation of adequate yearly progress ayp requirements that were made more challenging under the nclb the primary purpose of ayp requirements is to serve as the basis for identifying schools and leas where performance is inadequate so that these inadequacies may be addressed first through provision of increased s upport and ultimately th rough variety of corrective actions the nclb requires st ates to make conc rete progress toward meeting an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or advanced level of achievement within 12 years some of the implementation issues discussed in section 3 include whether th department of education s ed reviews of state ayp policies are rigorous transpar ent appropriate nd consistent whether the goal of all students reaching proficient or higher level of achievement within 12 years will lead to states weakening pupil achieveme nt standards whether too many schools and leas are failing to meet ayp goals whether the wide variations in state standards for pupil achievement are unde rmining ayp provisions whether some states are effectively excluding some disadvantaged pupil groups from being considered in schoollevel ayp determin ations by setting minimum group sizes for these pupil groups too high and whether th nclb requirement for disaggregation of pupil groups in ayp determinations makes it too difficult for schools or leas with diverse populations to meet ayp standards section 4 of the report looks at new outcome accountability requirements established in the nclb leas and sc hools are being held to higher accountability standards under the nclb this section di scusses in detail the system of rewards and sanctions that has been establis hed to hold title ia schools and leas accountable for their performance some of the implementation issues discussed in section 4 include the impact of eds approval of changes in state accountability plans difficulties that have arisen in implementing the requirement that students attending schools identified for school improvement be provided public school choice and difficulties that have arisen in the implementation of the requirement that students attending schools id entified for second year of school improvement corrective action or restructuring be offe red supplemental educational services section 5 of the report examines nclb changes to esea provisions regarding the education of limited english proficient lep students among other things the nclb changed two grant programs for lep students from competitive grants to formula grants and it added new assessm ent and accountability provisions including requirements regarding englis h language assessments implementation issues that have arisen include the eff ect on states of yeartoyear fluctuations in funding under the newly adopted formula grant progra ms the shortage of qualified bilingual teachers and difficulties in meeting the new requirements for english language assessments section 6 of the report discusses nclb changes regarding teacher quality issues major changes include requirement that all teachers be highly qualified by the end of the 20052006 school year and the replacement of the esea eisenhower professional development and class size reduction programs with new teacher and principal training and recruiting fund one implementation issue concerns thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs3 scope and application of the highly qua lified teacher requirements hqt the meaning of some of the hqt requirements and the ability of different kinds of districts to meet them second imple mentation issue concerns the impact of enhanced flexibility in the new teacher nd principal training and recruiting fund concerns have been raised that this may result in shift away from the emphasis on math and science profe ssional development in the eisenhower program section 7 of the report focuses on the reading first rf program the rf program was newly authorized by the nclb the program is intended to incorporate the latest scientific understanding of what works in teaching reading to improve and expand k3 reading programs to address concerns about student reading achievement and to reach children at younger ages impl ementation issues that have arisen include criticisms by some of the perceived overprescriptiveness of the rf program as it has been administered perceptions of insufficient transparency regarding eds requirements of states and llegations of conflicts of interest between consultants to the program and commercial reading and assessment companies eds oig has issued several critical aud it reports on reading first in addition the house committee on education and labor has held oversight hearings on reading first and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions issued report on reading first technical assistance direct ors with financial ties to publishers section 8 of the report discusses nclb changes that strengthen parental involvement requirements examples of these changes include new requirements for schoolparent compacts requirement that 1 of lea title ia grants be set aside for parental involvement activities nd requirement that states and leas participating in title ia provide aggregate assessment results and certain other data to parents and the public th rough report cards nationa l studies on implementation issues of current parental involvement provisions are not yet available however studies of previous parent involvement requirements found that 25 of title ia schools had not implemented schoolparent compacts that parents remained less involved with their childrens schools than desirable and th at parents were not receiving the desired leve l or types of informati on from school report cards section 9 of the report addresses nclb provisions requiring leas receiving funding under the esea to provide military recruiters with the same access to secondary school students that they pr ovide to pos tsecondary in stitutions or prospective employers implementation issues that have arisen concern some confusion and controversy ove r the implementation of the requirements in part due to provisions permitting secondary school students or their parents to choose to notify the lea that they are opting out of the disc losure of this information among other concerns ed has stated that some leas have misapplied the parental opt out requirements by requiring written parental consent before providing information to military recruiters thereby creating an opt in rather than an opt out policy on the other hand some parent groups have criticized schools for failing to make the opt out option clearer to parents section 10 of the report addresses nclb changes to esea requirements applicable to the participation of child ren enrolled in private schools the most significant changes address how services to eligible children must be arranged between leas and the private schools in wh ich eligible children are enrolled thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs4 1 this section of the report was written by wayne c riddle for additional information on this topic see crs report rl31407 educational testing im plementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddle 2 this currently includes all states including the district of columbia and puerto rico which are generally treated as states under esea programsspecific programs under which services must be provided and how the effectiveness of these services must be assessed impl ementation issues that have arisen include concerns regarding the timeliness of lea c onsultations with private school officials and concerns regarding the availability of funding to serve eligible private school students section 11 of the report discusses the unsafe school choice option established by the nclb this new provision requires st ates to establish statewide policies that provide an opportunity to transfer to anot her school within the same lea to students attending persistently dang erous public schools and to students who are victims of violent crime that occurred on thei r school grounds in implementing this provision concerns have been raised because although most states have established criteria for identifying uns afe schools and have established student transfer policies fe w schools have actually been identified as unsafe section 1 standards and assessments1 the provisions of the elementary and secondary education act esea title ia as amended by the child left behind act nclb regarding standards and assessments reinforced and expanded upon provisions initially adopted in the improving americas schools act of 1994 i asa these standard and assessment provisions are linked to the r eceipt of financial assistan ce under esea title ia that is they apply only to states wishing to maintain eligibility for title ia grants2 requirements initially dopted before the nclb the iasa of 1994 required states to adopt standards and asse ssments in the subjects of readinglanguage arts and mathematics at three grade levels at least once in each of the grade ranges of 35 69 and 1012 states wishing to re main eligible for title ia grants are required to develop or adopt curriculum content standards as well as academic achievement standards and ssessments tied to the standa rds states were given several years to meet the iasa requirements the full system of standards and assessments was not require d to be in place until the 20002001 school year these requirements continue under the nclb standard and assessment requirements newly dopted under the nclb in addition to the iasas requirement for states to implement standards and assessments in readinglangua ge arts and mathematics at three grade levels the nclb required states participating in esea title ia tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs5 3 leas may continue to administer assessments to pupils in nonenglish languages for up to total of five years if on casebycase basis they determine that this would likely yield more accurate information on what the students know and can do 4 for further information on this and related topics see crs report rl32913 the individuals with disabilities education act idea interactions with selected provisions of the child left behind act nclba by richard n apling and nancy lee jonesdevelop and adopt standards and assessments in the subjects of mathematics and readinglanguage arts in each of grades 38 by the end of the 20052006 school year assuming certain minimum levels of annual federal fundi ng are provided for state assessment grants adopt standards in science at thr ee grade levels by the end of the 20052006 school year and adopt assessments in science at thr ee grade levels by the end of the 20072008 school year to the extent practicable limited englis h proficient lep pupils are to be assessed in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what they know and can do in academic content areas in subjects other than english itself however pup ils who have attended schools in the united states excluding puerto rico for three or more consecutive school years are to be assessed in english3 in addition reasonable adap tations and accommodations are to be provided for students with disabilities consistent with the provisions of the individuals with disabilities education act idea4 achievement standards must establish at least three performance levels for all pupils advanced proficient and partially profic ient or basic if agency or entity in state has authority to establish statewide standards or assessments as is generally assumed to be the case for iowa and nebraska then the state may adopt either statewide standard s and assessments applicable only to title ia pupils and programs or b policy providing that each lea receiving title ia grants will adopt standards and assessmen ts that meet the requireme nts of title ia and are applicable to all pupils served by each such lea state educational agencies seas must provide evidence from test publisher or other relevant source that their assessments are of adequate technical quality for the purposes required under title ia seve ral statutory constrai nts have been placed on the authority of the secretary of education to enforce these standard and assessment requirements first the esea states that nothing in title i shall be construed to authorize any federal official or agency to

9526 and 9527 second states may not be required to submit their standards to the us secretary of educa tion section 1111b1a or to have their content or achievement sta ndards approved or certified by the federal government section 9527c in order to receive funds under the esea other than the limited review necessary in order to determine whether the state meets the title ia technicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs6 requirements finally state plan ma be disapproved by ed on the basis of specific content or achievement standards or assessment items or instruments section 1111e1f assessment results must be provided to leas schools and teachers before the beginning of the subse quent school year so that they might be available in timely manner to make adequate yearly progress determinations for schools and leas discussed later in this report in addition as discussed late r in this report states ar to provide that their leas will annually assess the englis h language proficiency of their lep pupils including pupils oral reading and writing skills finally as is also discussed later in this report the nclb requires stat receiving grants under esea title ia to participate in biennial statelevel administrations of the national assessment of educational progress in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics the timing of several of the key requirements listed above is summarized in the following box schedule for implementation of nclb standard and assessment requirements school year 20002001 states were to have adopted content and performance standards plus assessments linked to these at thr ee grade levels in mathematics and reading these requirements were included in the 1994 reauthorization of the esea school year 20022003 states were required to begin to annually assess the english language proficiency of lep pupils states were first required to particip ate in biennial administration of the naep school year 20052006

during the initial years following enactment of the nclb wa s focused on the extended process of implementing the requirements adopted under the previous version of the esea the iasa these requirements for standards nd assessments in readinglanguage arts and mathematics at three grad levels were supposed to ve been met by the end of the 20002001 school year but few states met that initial deadline6 in their reviews of state systems of st andards and assessmen ts peer reviewers and ed staff have been considering onl various forms of evidence submitted by the states that are intended to document that state standards and assessments meet the specific title ia requirements that is they are not reviewing the standards and assessments themselves the peer revi ews identified number of common problem areas including the following lack of adequate accommodation or incorporation of alternate assessments fo r lep and disabled pupils b insufficient documentation of the technical quality of assessments and c inadequate timelines for implementation of the assessments the departments final regulations on the nclb standard and assessment requirements were publis hed in the federal register on july 5 20027 ed published supplementary nonregulatory draft guidan ce on all of the standard and assessment requirements as well as those relate d to naep participa tion on march 10 20038 this document was intended to provide more detailed guidance consistent with the regulations discussed above more recently ed offi cials have published regulations and other policy

april 2006 by the assistant secretary for ementary and secondary education10 describes the current categories of results from the state reviews these categories and the number of states in each category as of january 3 2008 include the following full approval meets all statutory and re gulatory requirements 24 states alabama alaska arkans as arizona delaware florida georgia idaho iowa kansas ke ntucky maryland massachusetts michigan missouri montana north dakota ohio oklahoma pennsylvania south carolina tennessee virginia and west virginia full approval with recommendations meets all statutory and regulatory requirements but ed makes selected recommendations for improvement three states indi ana north carolina and utah approval expected evidence to date suggests that the states assessment system is fully compliant with the statutory and regulatory requirements but some elements of the system were not complete as of july 1 2006 the state must provide evidence of compliance with remaining requirements before administering its assessments for the 20062007 school year five states connecticut maine new mexic new york and rhode island plus the district of columbia approval pending limited number generally one to three of fundamental components of the stat assessment system fail to meet the statutory or regulatory require ments 18 states all of those not listed in another category plus puerto rico finally one state mississippi has been granted oneyear waiver to meet the assessment requirements in recognition of delays arising from the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes states in the last two categories bove approval pending and not approved face the possibility of loss of title ia admin istrative funds 25 in the case of the two not approved states 10 or 15 in the case of approval pending states plus the additional sanctions of limitations on approval of flexibility requests and heightened oversight by ed according to ed withheld funds from the sea would be distributed to leas in the state in addition states that persistently and thoroughly fail to meet the standard nd assessment requireme nts over an extended period of time potentially may be subject to elimination of their title ia grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs9 11 thus far the sanction of withholding 25 of state administration funds for failure to meet the 1994 assessment requirements has been applie d at least twice to georgia in 2003 and the district of columbia in 2005 for failure to administer assessments linked to state content standards 12 the document is available from the department of education at httpwwwedgov policyelseclegnclbbuildingonresultspdfaltogether since they would be out of compliance with basic program requirement11 bush administration r eauthorizati on proposals the bush administrations reauthorization blueprint12 released in january 2007 contains proposal regarding the esea title ia st ate assessment provisi ons participating states would be required to develop cont ent and performance standards in english and math covering 2 add itional years of high school by 20102011 and assessments linked to these standards by 20122013 th assessments would include pair of 11th grade assessments of college readiness in reading and math however states would be required only to repor t the results of these assessments not to use them for adequate yearly prog ress determinations implementation issues issues raised in the implementation of the esea title ia standards and assessment requirements thus far include the following what is the financial cost of developing and implementing the required assessments and to what extent have federal grants been sufficient to pay for them the addition of re quirements to conduct annual assessments in at least f our more grades than required previously and to include standard s and assessments at three grade levels in science have required most states to significantly increase their expenditures for standard and test development and administration it is very difficult if not impossible to specify all of these potential costs with preci sion the nclb conference report directs the government account ability office gao to conduct study of the costs to each state of developing and administering the assessments required under title ia however information is yet available from the study studies by private organizations of the costs of meeting the nclb assessm ent requirements and of whether those costs exceed the aggregate level of assessment development funds provided under the nclb have reached contradictory results what are the likely educational benefits and costs of the expanded title ia assessment requirements the primary benefit from annual administration of consistent seri of standards based tests would be the provision of timely inform ation on the performance of pupils schools and leas throughout most of the elementary and middle school grades the availability of such consistent annual assessment results would be of value fo r both diagnostic and accountability purposes arguably additional assessment information will improve the quality of the adequate yearly progress ayp determinationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs10 13 this section was written by wayne c riddle for additional information on this topic see crs report rl31407 educational testing impl ementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddlethat are based primarily on the assessments and help determine whether title ia is meeting its primary goals such as reducing achievement gaps between disadvant aged and other pupils at the same time the expanded title ia assessment requirements might lead to variety of educational costs or unintended consequences one such cost would be expande d federal influence on state and local education policies for ex ample assessment requirements attached to an aid program focused on disadvantaged pupils may broadly influence policies regard ing standards assessments and accountability affecting all pupils in participating states in the majority of states that did not pr eviously administer standardsbased assessments in each of grades 3 8 their policy may have resulted primarily from cost or time constraints or the states may have determined that annual testing of this sort is not educationally appropriate or at least that its be nefits are not equa l to the relevant costs these costs may include an increased risk of overemphasis on preparation for the tests especially if the tests do not adequately assess the full range of knowle dge and skills that schools are expected to impart section 2 national assessment of educational progress13 the national assessment of educational progress naep is federally funded series of assessments of the academic performance of elementary and secondary students in the united states naep tests generally are administered to sample of public and private school pupils in grades 4 8 and 12 in variety of subjects including reading mathematics science writing and less frequently geography history civics social studi and the arts naep asse ssments have been conducted since 1969 naep is administered by the national center for education statistics nces with oversight and several aspects of policy establishe d by the national assessment governing board nagb both entities are part of the us department of education since 1983 the assessment s been developed primarily under cooperative agreement with the educationa l testing service ets private non profit organization that also develops nd administers such assessments as the scholastic assessment test sat naep consists of two separate groups of tests one is the main assessment in which test items questions are revised over time in both content and structure to reflect more current instruc tional standards and practices the main assessment also reports pupil scores in relation to performance levels which are standards for pupil achievement that are based on score th resholds set by nagb the performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs11 14 since the longterm trend assessment is not involved with the esea title ia assessment requirements it will not be discussed furtherlevels are considered to be developmental and are intended to place naep scores into context they are based on deter minations by nagb of what pupils should know and be able to do at basic partial mastery proficient solid academic performance and advanced superior performance levels with respect to challenging subject matter the second group of naep tests form the longterm trend assessment which monitors trends over time in math and reading achievement14 all naep tests are administered to only representative sample of pupils enrolled in public and private k12 schools and the tests are designed so that pupil takes an entire naep test the use of sampling is intended to minimize both the costs of naep and test burdens on pupils it also makes it possible to include broad range of items in each test ce individual pupil takes an entire naep test it is impossible for

program until enactment of the nclb participation in naep was voluntary for states the additional cost associated with state naep administration was borne by the states and after par ticipating in any

the period since enactment of the nclb number of steps have been taken toward implementation of the new requirements for state participation in naep first the schedule for test administration has been

grade reading and mathematics results for all states but not puerto rico see below were released in november 2003 subsequent rounds of naep tests was administe red in all states in 2005 and 2007 in addition several changes to nae p policies and prac tices have been implemented to complement the ex panded role of naep under the nclb16 for example in recognition of the increased emphasis on measurement of performance gaps among different demographic groups of pupils in the nclb more questions are being added at the upper and wer ends of the difficulty range so that achievement gaps among pupil groups can be more reliably measured special issues arise with respect to puer to rico which is treated as state under esea title ia but did not participate in state naep tests prior to the enactment of the nclb questions have been raised bout the comparability of tests administered in different languages especially in reading naep tests in mathematics were administered to 4th and 8th grade pupils in puerto rico in 2003 and 2005 results from both test administrations were released in 200717 bush administration reauthorization proposals t h b u s h administrations reauthoriza tion

biennial statelevel naep assessments in reading and math to the 12th grade in 2009 implementation issues although the naep par ticipation requirements of the nclb are being implemented fully nd on schedule number of issues have been raised regarding these requirements might the influence of naep on st ate standards and assessments be increased as result of the increased attention to and required participation in naep tests state involvement with naep has changed significantly under the nclb although the stakes for states remain relatively low state results are being published as an implicit confirmation of test score trends on state assessments but these naep scores still have direct impact on state eligibility for federal assistance nevertheless even small increase in the stakes associated with state performance on naep tests attracts attention to the possibility that naep frameworks and test items might influence state standards and assessments to the extent that the required participation in naep increases attention to state performance on these tests there might be basis for concern that states would have an incentive to modify their curriculum content standards to more closely resemble the naep test frameworks to counteract this potential issue th nclb prohibits the use of naep assessments by agents of the fede ral government to influence state or lea instructional programs or assessments neve rtheless subtle indirect andor unintended form s of influence may be virtually impossible to detect or prohibit might conflict arise between the requirement for naep participation by states partici pating in esea title ia and the provision that participation in n aep tests is voluntary for pupils some have expressed concern that in time of likely increased assessment activity for pupils nationwide resistance to participation in naep might grow to an extent that it threatens the quality of the national and state samples of tested pupils leaving states stuck between requirement to participate in naep and an inability to recruit sufficiently large sample of pupils to participate in order to produce valid and reliable assessmen t results the primary counter to this concern is that the policies regarding voluntary participation in naep have in practice change d only modestly while states or leas previously could have mandated pa rticipation by pupils in the past apparently they generally attempted to avoid doing so can naep results be used to c onfirm state test score trends and for the participating leas can results under the trial urban assessment be used to confirm score trends on state tests an unstated but clearly implicit purpose of the state naep participation require ment is to confir m trends in

as the content and skills that they are designed to assess their format the time of year that tests are administered the stakes associated with test performance and modes of response state assessmen ts are explicitly linked to state content and performance standards which is not the case with naep at the same time there is substantial evidence that naeps pupil performance standards are significantly more challenging than those of most states18 as result some state assessments will be much more similar to naep in these important respects than others and there will be consequent variation in the significance of similarities or differences when comparing trends in naep versus state assessment score trends for pupils section 3 adequate yearly progress19 since the 1988 reauthorization of th esea pl 100297 the accountability provisions of title ia have been increasingly focused on achievement and other outcomes for participating pupils and schools since the subsequent esea reauthorization in 1994 the improving americas schools act of 1994 pl 103 382 and particularly under the child left behind act of 2001 nclb pl 107 110 key concept embodied in these out come accountability requirements is that of adequate yearly progress ayp for schools leas and with much less emphasis states overall the primary pur pose of ayp requirements is to serve as the basis for identifying schools and leas where performance is inadequate so that these inadequacies may be addressed fi rst through provision of increased support and ultimately through variety of correc tive actions these actions are to be taken with respect to schools or leas that fail to meet ayp for two consecutive years or more action need be taken with re spect to school or lea failing to meet ayp standards for only one year at time see discussion below on outcome accountability under esea title ia through the nclb the title ia requirements for statedeveloped standards of ayp were substantially ex panded in scope and specifi city the nclb provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs15 regarding ayp may be seen as an evolu tion of and as reaction to perceived weaknesses in the ayp requi rements of the 1994 iasa the latter were frequently criticized as being insufficiently specific detailed or challenging especially in their failure to focus on specific disadvantag ed pupil groups or to require continuous improvement toward any ultimate goal under the nclb ayp is defined primarily on the basis of multiple aggregations of pupil scores on state asse ssments of academic achievement state ayp standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator in the case of high schools this additional indi cator must be the graduation rate for elementary and middle schools the attendan ce rate is often used as the additional indicator the additional indicators may not be employed in way that would reduce the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards in addition ayp calculations must be disaggreg ated that is they must be determined separately and specifically for not only ll pupils but also for several demographic groups of pupils within each school lea and state the specified demographic groups are economically disadvantaged pupils lep pupils pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups as well as all pupils however there are three major constrai nts on the consideration of these pupil groups in ayp calculations first pupil groups need not be considered in cases where their number is so relatively small that achievement results would not be statistically significant or the identity of individual pupils might be divulged the selection of the minimum number n of pup ils in group to be considered in ayp determinations has been left largely to state discretion and state policies regarding n have varied widely from as few as 5 pupils to as many as 200 in some cases with consequent wide varia tion in the extent to which pupils in the groups listed above are actually taken into specific c onsideration in ayp determinations for schools and leas second it has been left to the states to defi ne the major racial and ethnic groups on the basis of which ayp must be calculated some states have identified substantially more such groups than have other states and third pupils who have not attended the same school for full year need not be considered in determining ayp at the school level although they are still to be included in lea and state ayp determinations if they atte nded schools in the same lea or state for the full academic year ayp standards under the nclb must be applied to all public schools leas and to states overall if state chooses to receive title ia grants however corrective actions for failing to meet ayp standards need only be applied to schools and leas participating in title ia and there are consequences for states failing to meet ayp standards beyond the provision of technical assistance ayp standards developed by the states must incorporate concrete movement toward meeting an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or advanced

thresholds had to occur after more than two years and remaining increases at least once every three years several states have accommodated these requirements in ways that assume much more rapid progress in the later years of the peri od leading up to 20132014 than in the earlier period the primary basic structure for ayp unde r the nclb is now specified in the authorizing statute as group status model20 uniform bar approach is employed states are to set threshold per centage of pupils at pr oficient or advanced levels of performance each year that is app licable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determina tions the threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for reading and ma th and may be set separately for each level of k12 education lementary middle and high schools in determining whether scores for group of pupils are at the required level the averaging of scores over two to three years is allowed in addition the nclb statute includes an alternative safe harbor provision under which school that does not meet the standard ayp requirements may still be deemed to meet ayp if there is 10 reduction compared to the previous year in the number of pupils in each of the pupil groups failing to reach the standard requirement and those groups also make progress on at least one other academic indicator included in the states ayp standards this alternative provision adds successive group improvement as secondary type of ayp model under the nclb third basic type of ayp model not explicitly mentioned in the nclb statute is the individualcohort growth model the key characteristic of this model is focus on the rate of change over time in the level of achievement among cohorts of the same pupils growth models are longit udinal based upon the tracking of the same pupils as they progress through their k12 education careers although the progress of pupils is tracked individually results are typically aggregated when used for accountability purposes in general growth models would give credit for meeting steps along the way to profic iency in ways that stat us model typically does not in november 2005 the secretary of

disabilities lep pupils and st participation rates b limiting identification for improvement to schools that fail to meet ayp in the same subject area for two or more consecutive years and limiting

year graduation rates used as the additional academic indicator in ayp dete rminations for high schools would have to be disaggregated according to the same demographic groups as achievement levels further states would be require d to use standard measure in calculating graduation rates known as the averaged fre shman graduation rate afgr finally the administration proposes that scien ce test

mathhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs19 implementation issues number of issues have arisen during the implementation of the nclb provisions regarding ayp they include the following have eds reviews of state ayp policies been appropriately rigorous transparent flexible and consistent as ed staff and designated peer reviewers have examined initial and revised state ayp policies several obs ervers have expresse d concerns about lack of transparency in the review procedures and criteria inconsistencies especially over time in the types of changes that ed officials have approved for example approving number of requests to increase minimum group sizes during some periods of time but approving few or such changes during other periods whether the net effect of the ch anges is to make the accountability requirements more reasonable or to undesirably weaken them whether the changes may make an already complicated accountability system even more complex and timing whether decisions on proposed changes are being made in timely manner by ed is the ultimate goal embodied in the nclbs ayp provisions all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within 12 years of enactment both desirable and achievable without substantial weakening by states of pupil achievement standards the required incorporation of this ultimate goal is one of the most significant differences between the ayp provi sions of the nclb and those under the previous iasa without an u ltimate goal of having all pupils reach the proficient level of achievement by specific date states might simply establish relative goals that provide real movement toward or incentives for significant improvement especially among disadvantaged pupil groups proponents of such demanding ultimate goal argue that schools and leas frequently meet the goals established for them even rather challenging goals if the goals are very clearly iden tified defined and established and are attainable demanding goal might maximize efforts toward improvement by state public school systems even if the goal is not met nevertheless goal of having all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within any specified period of time may be criticized as being unrealistic if one assumes that proficiency has been established at challenging level it is likely that many states schools and leas will not meet the nclbs ultimate ayp goal unless state standards of proficient performance are significantly lowered andor states aggressively pursue the use of such statistical techniques as setting high minimum group sizes and confidence intervals to substantia lly reduce the range of pupil groups actually considered in ayp determinations and effectively lower required achievement level thresholds are such statistical techniques as confidence intervals and data averaging being appropriately app lied in state ayp policies many states have used one or both of th statistical techniques to attempthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs20 to improve the validity and reliability of ayp determinations with an effect in most cases of re ducing the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards the averaging of test score results for various pupil groups over two or threeyear periods is explicitly authorized under th nclb the use of confidence intervals was not explicitly envisioned in the drafting of the nclbs ayp provisions but has been appr oved by ed and widely adopted by states the use of confidence intervals to determine whether group test scores fall below required thresholds to statistically significant degree addresses the fact that test scores for any group of pupils will vary from one test administration to another and these variations may be especially rge for relatively small group of pupils at the same time the use of confidence intervals reduces the likelihood that schools or leas will be identified as failing to make ayp for small pupil groups and high levels of desired accuracy the size of confidence intervals may be rather large ultimately the use of this technique may mean that the average achievement levels of pupil groups in many schools w ill be below 100 proficiency by 20132014 yet the schools would still meet ayp standards because the groups scores are within relevant confidence intervals are some states setting minimum group size levels so high that large proportion of some disadvantaged pupil groups is not being considered in schoollevel ayp determinations another important technical factor in state ayp standards is the establishment of the minimum size n for pupil groups to be considered in ayp calculations the nclb recognizes that in the disaggregation of pupil data for schools and leas ther might be pupil groups that are so small that average test scores would not be statistically reliable or the dissemination of average scores for the group might risk violation of pupils privacy rights the selection of this minimum number has been left to state di scretion and the range of selected values for n is rather large the higher the minimum group size the less likely that many pupil groups will be separa tely considered in ayp determinations this gives schools and leas fewer thresholds to meet and reduces th likelihood that they will be found to have failed to meet ayp standards at the same time relatively high levels for n weaken the nclbs specific focus on variety of pupil groups many of them disadvantaged does the requirement for disaggregation of pupil groups in ayp determinations make it too difficult for schools or leas with diverse pupil populations to meet ayp standards all other relevant factors especially minimum group size bein g equal the more diverse its pupil population the more thresholds school or lea must meet in order to make ayp while this was an intended result of legislation designed to focus on specific di sadvantaged pupil groups the impact of making it more difficult for schools and leas serving diverse populations to meet ayp standa rds may also be seen as an unintended consequence of the nc lb number of studies havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs21 concluded that when comparing public schools with comparable aggregate pupil achievement levels or aggregate percentages of pupils from lowincome families schools with larger numbers of different nclbrelevant demogra phic groups are substantially less likely to meet ayp standards however without specific requirements for achievement ga ins by each of the major pupil groups it is possible that insufficient attention would be paid to the performance of the disadvantaged pupil groups among whom improvements are most needed and for whose benefit the title ia program was established since it is possible for many schools and leas to demonstrate improvements in achievement by their pupils overall while the achievement of their disadvantaged pupils does not improve significantly are too many schools and leas failing to meet ayp standards as is discussed in the following section of this report relatively large percentages of public school s and leas overa ll have failed to meet state ayp standards future increases in performance thresholds as the ultimate goal of all pupils at the proficient or higher level of achievement is approached may result in higher percentages of schools failing to make ayp ed officials have emphasized the importance of taki ng action to identify and improve underperforming schools matter how numerous they have also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility in taking corrective actions with respect to schools th at fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to which they fail to meet those standards further some analysts argue that set of ayp standards that relatively high percentage of public schools fails to meet may accurately reflect pervasive weaknesses in public sc hool systems especially with respect to disadvantaged pupil gr oups others have consistently expressed concern about the accuracy efficacy and complexity of an accountab ility system under which such relatively high percentage of schools is identif ied as failing to make adequate progress with consequent strain on financial and other resources necessary to provide technical ssistance public school choice and supplemental services options as well as other corrective actions are the nclbs ayp provisions being undermined by wide variations in state standards for pupil achievement the percentage of public schools and leas failing to meet ayp standards is not only relatively large in the aggregate but varies widely among the states it is likely that state vari ations in the percentage of schools failing to meet ayp standards are based not only on underlying differences in achievement levels as well as variety of technical factors in state ayp provisions but also on differences in the degree of rigor or challenge in stat pupil performance standards and assessments while the basic stru cture of ayp definitions is now substantially more consistent across states than before enactment of the nclb significant variations remain with respect to technical factors such as minimum group size and confidence intervals andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs22 30 this section was written by david p smole with contributions from wayne c riddlethere appear to be substantial differences in the degree of challenge embodied in state standards and assessments such variation reflects and may be the inevitable result of federalism in education policymaking nevertheless as the nclb is considered for reauthorization by the 110th congress there may be interest in attempting to make pupil performance expectations more consistent across the nation is the 95 assessment partici pation requirement too high i n several cases schools or leas fa il to meet ayp solely because participation rates in assessments fall marginally below the required level of 95 of all pupils as well as 95 of pupils in each of the relevant demographic groups mee ting the minimum size threshold while few argue against having an participation rate requirement it may be questioned whether it needs to be as high as 95 the average percentage of enrolled pupils in attendance at public k12 schools in recent years 935 is below this level and such attendance rates are generally assumed to be substantially lower than this national average in schools with high proportions of disadvantaged pupils even thoug h schools are explicitly allowed to administer assessments on makeup days following the primary date of test administr ation and it is probable that more schools and leas will meet this requirement as they become more fully aware of its significance it is likely to continue to be very difficult for some schools and leas to meet 95 test participation requirement according to the recent ed report national

discussed below identification of schools and leas for improvement over the past several years states have sought and in many cases have had approved by ed changes to their state accountability plans in most instances these changes have facilitated relaxation of acc ountability requirements result has been that some schools and leas that would have been id entified for improvement under state plans as initially approved might not be so identified under am ended versions of state plans examples of approved changes include the use of confidence intervals increasing the minimum subgroup sizes used to calculate ayp and specifying that leas need to fail to make ayp for two consecutive years in the same subject area and across each of the elementary middle and high school grade spans in order to be identified for improvement or that schools should be identified for improvement only if they fail to make ayp in the same subject area for two consecutive years47 the expansion of the minimum subgroup sizes to large numbers such as 40 students or 10 of school rollment may have the effect of excluding students from subgroups with small populations from cons ideration in the termination of ayp at the school level since beginning with the 20052006 school year states are now required to administer assessments in readinglanguage arts and mathematics to all students in each of grades 38 it is exp ected that fewer student subgroups will be excluded from ayp determinations on the basis of minimum subgroup size also at the lea level it is more likely that there will be sufficient students

charter schools to provide school choice transfer options concerns about the implementation of public school choice include that information identifying schools for improveme nt has in many instances been released during the summer only short time before the new school year was about to begin and as consequence parent s have had limited time to select new schools for their children to attend also as more schools have been identified for school improvement corrective action or restru cturing some leas have experienced difficulty in making space available in sc hools that have not been identified for improvement many of wh ich were already overcrowd ed meanwhile leas with few or schools identified for improvement may decline to accept transfers from neighboring districts in very rural ar eas public school choice can be difficult to implement because of the great distances between schools finally concerns have been raised that despite provisions designed to give priority for public school choice to lowachieving and lowincome students higherachieving students and those from moderate to upperincome fa milies may be most alert t or more willing to take advantage of school transfer options thus leaving lower achieving students behind in underperforming schools48 supplemental educational services beginning with the 20022003 school year students attending schools identified for s econd year of school improvement corrective action or restructuring have been required to be offered the opportunity to receive supplemental educa tional services issues regarding the

resulted in fewer students receiving supplem ental educational services than might be entitled to receive them50 the availability of providers has also been concern in some leas particularly in rural

be able to serve students with special needs or limitedenglish proficiency however in instances where providers are available to serve students with special needs or limitedenglish proficiency the lea

promulgated by ed prohibit schools and leas that ve been identified for improvement from being approved as ses provide rs ses providers may not be required to hire only staff who meet the highly

for overseeing ses providers leas may impose certain cond itions on providers such as requiring background checks on personnel requiring liab ility insurance and charging for the use of school

increases in grant awar ds of 20 or higher 13 of these increases were 30 or higher and 1 increase exceeded 98 four states lost more than 10 of their funds and one lost more than 20 of its funds these

from fy2007 to fy2008 implementation issues large yeartoyear fluctuations in title iii awards could pose problems for program implementa tion such shifts reflect instability in the underlying population estimates on which th formula is based instability in the current lep data provided by the acs derives primarily from the small and concentrated nature of lep populations it had been anticipated that once the survey was fully implemented that the lep popula tion estimates would become more stable from year to year64 the acs was fully implemented in 2005 and used to make fy2007 awards while the number of states experiencing increas or decreases in state grant amounts of 20 or more declined in fy2007 and fy2008 12 states in fy2007 and 13 states in fy2008 continued to see fluctuations of 20 or higher changes in funding of the magnitude ju st discussed might make it difficult for schools to provide service continuity to lep students and ma be particularly challenging in states experiencing large increases in funding one year and large decreases the next schools with sm all number of lep students and single teacher qualified to teach them might not be able to retain that teacher in consecutive years under such budget conditions an lea that in given year had an lep population large enough to exceed the minimu m grant requirement may in the next year fall below

in determining when lep students should be tested in english is insufficient the group size issue discussed earlier in th is report is partic ularly relevant in the application of ayp require ments to lep students in some instances the state may set minimum group size at level so high that few leas or schools are held accountable for properly serving lep student s on the other hand setting group size too low may make it difficult for leas pa rticularly those with diverse student populations to meet nclbs annua l requirements for improvement states face additional difficulty implementing ayp requirements for lep students because these students are likely to fall into several subgroups there exists high correlation between membership in the lep subgroup and membership in the hispanic and the economically disadvantaged groups in light of this some have advocated that students classified in two or more categories should be counted only in one category or weighted proportionally in each of the categories in which they are classified for example st udents who are lep hispanic and poor could have their scores given onethird weight in each subgrouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs43 76

average between 2004 and 2006 the 26 states with baseline data increased the performance of students meeting or exceeding proficiency on fluency outcome measures by 16 for 1st graders 14 for 2nd

graders and 12 for 3rd graders94 however state assessment measures and cutoff scores for determining reading proficiency vary from state to state making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions on

focuses on the application of sbr to the reading first program the nclb language authorizing reading first makes clear that the intent of the program is to require recipients of readin g first funds to imple ment programs which are based on scientifically based reading research sbrr eds application of sbrr to the reading first program draws extensively on the work conducted by the national reading panel nrp in 2000 the nrp issued report titled teaching children to read the nrp was convened by the na tional institute of child health and human development nichd in cons ultation with ed in response to congressional charge to review the literature on reading and use it to assess the effectiveness of different techniques fo r teaching reading and whether these techniques were ready to be applied to classroom settings based on the nrps research the nclb incorporated five essential components of reading as requirements for reading inst ruction funded under the reading first program these essential components are define d in the nclb as explicit and systematic instruction in phonemic awareness b phonic s c vocabulary development d reading fluency including oral reading skills and

scientific basis for research education week january 30 2002implementation issues criticisms of the application of scientifically based reading research to the reading first program some criticisms have been raised regarding eds application of sbrr to the reading first program for example robert slavin of the success for all program has argued that the nclbs requirement that interventions be ba sed on sbr does not di fferentiate between programs that have themselves been rigo rously evaluated and those programs that have not been rigorously evaluated for fficacy but can cite sbr that supports their interventions the success for all foundation argued in letter to the office of the inspector general of the u s department of education oig that ed has inappropriately narrowed the definition of scientifically based research in its implementation of the reading first program in essence through the implementation of reading first the us department of education has narrowed the definition of sbrr to the five essential components of reading as identified by the national reading panel research on program efficacy has been ignored because reading first was so closely managed by the us department of education and because it contains such strong focus on the use of scientifically based research it is paving the way for how states districts and schools are coming to understand the meaning of sbr and how they will apply it to other federal programs97 as consequence of the alleged narro wing of the definition of sbrr states have been unnecessarily limited in their choices of reading programs assessments and professional development packages acco rding to critics of eds implementation of reading first limitations of existing research some of the cont roversies that have surrounded implementation of sbrr in the reading first program reflect the current state of sbrr and the difficulties of applying existing research to concrete educational interventions so observers have noted th at there are many areas of education research with few if any rct studies to draw upon98 some have argued that navigating the existing array of resources is difficult for states and leas because much of the re search is academic in addition although there is more userfriendly material availa ble than ever before evaluations of the application of sbrr to concrete educational interventions is still limited and there is single federal website or resource that currently catalogs and evaluates all the available userfriendly resources the follo wing discussion summarizes some

involvement of parents in the education of their educationally disadvantaged children has been stated goal of esea title i part since the beginning of the program in 1965 for many years representative advisory committees of parents at the school and lea level were major concrete aspect of these parental involvement requirements the statut ory requirement for these committees was dropped under the education consolidation and improvement act of 1981 although some schools and as have continued to support such committees at their own discretion the parental advisory committee requirement was dropped in part in response to progra m studies that found the role and authority of the committees to be ambiguous leadin g to occasional tension between parent groups and school administrators113 the relatively numerous current esea title ia statutory requirements for parental involvement114 are summarized below they include many broad statements about the importance of parental invol vement activities nd their effective implementation but comparativ ely few concrete requirement s many of the specific requirements deal more with notification of parents than with more active forms of

provides that the student or the parent of the student may request that this information not be released without prior wr itten parental consent that the lea notify parents of this option and that the lea comply with the parents written request122 implementation issues national studies on the implementati on of current parental involvement provisions are not yet available it is po ssible that such studies may find some issues similar to those found by past national st udies for example the most recent published esea title ia evaluation that focused in part on the impact of the parental involvement provisions was p romising results continuing challenges the final report of the national assessment of t itle i published by the department of educa tions planning and evaluation service in 1999123 chapter 7 of this report reviews the parental involve ment provisions of t itle ia particularly those that were newly adopted in th 1994 reauthorization of the esea the improving americas schools act thes provisions included the requirements described above for schoolparent compact s and in most cases the reservation of at least 1 of lea title ia grants for pa rental involvement ac tivities this report chapter also provides review of research on the importance and effects of increased parental involvement in re latively high poverty schools key findings of this study included the following the staff at high proportion of sc hools especially schools with the highest poverty rates among pup ils families found the school parent compacts to be helpful in promoting desired behaviors among pupils such as homework completion however only 75 of representative sample of title ia schools had actually implemented this provision overall parents remain ed less involved with their childrens title i schools than is desirable major obstacles to increased involvement included failure of many schools to offer outreach and assistance to parents lack of time on the part of both school staff and parents and lack of education on the part of parents of children attending high poverty schools school staff found there to be s ubstantial overlaps and duplication in the parental involvement re quirements of multiple federal programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs62 124 it should be noted that this report was published before enactment under the child left behind act of 2001 or impl ementation of the school and lea report card requirements discussed earlier in this memorandum 125 american public calls on bush administration congress to strengthen public information involvement in nclb to hold states accountable for progress press release from the public education networ k march 16 2005 available at httpwwwpublic educationorgdoc pre ss_releases march16_2005doc

httpwwwpubliceducatio norgpdfnclbhearings ny_news_releasepdfin many cases parents were not r eceiving the desired level or types of information from school report cards124 information from some education advocacy groups suggest that similar implementation issues are s till relevant in press re lease announcing an open letter to president bush and secretary of education spellings the public education network pen maintained that in most school districts parents reported having met resistance from school officials when they tried to get involved and 75 percent of survey respondents had not been involved in any nclbrelated activity by enforcing provisions already in the law the federal government can send strong signal to states and school districts that parents can nd should be active partners in school improvement and can build public ownership of the schools125 another press release issued jointly by pen and campaign for fiscal equity inc cfe reported on testimony by parents in the new york city area among other concerns pen and cfe reported that parents expressed frustration over the lack of communication and timely information from schools about school performance and services available to students while nclb requires reporting of school and student performance through annual report cards parents testified that sc hool information rarely reaches parents and when it does it is often late and difficult to understand in particular parents expressed the need for timely information about supplemental educational services and recommended that school data be made available in multiple languages parents also testified that they often feel unwelcome by administrators at the school and district levels making it difficult for them to get involved126 since one rationale for current parental involvement provisions is to empower parents so that they can influence sc hool improvement cen tral implementation issue is the degree to which parents involvement improves schools and improves student achievement the washington post reported on recent study based on data from 257 california elementary schools with high numbers of lowincome pupils the study found that parent involvement is positively correlated with student achievement however the study also f ound that other factors most of which are also emphasized in current law such as emphasizing

although there has been general compliance with requirements that high schools grant access to military recruiters there has also been confusion and controvers over the implementation of the requirements142 according to the us department of ducation ed two areas of concern have focused on the application of 10 usc 503 and the opt out provision in the esea143 requirements similar to those included in the esea for the release of student information are included in 10 u sc 503 as amended by section 544 of the national defense authorization ac t for fiscal year 2002 pl 107107144 in addition 10 usc 503 only applies to as including private secondary schools that receive funds under the esea under 10 usc 503 the governing body of an lea eg school board could vot to have policy to deny litary recruiters access to students or students directory information the esea requirements on providing access to military recruiters do not include this policy exemption thus while denying access to military recruiters would be permitted under 10 usc 503 and not subject the lea to any sanctions145 the action would vi olate the statutory requirements of the esea and the lea c ould be subject to sanctions by ed the second major issue according to ed focuses on compliance with the provision specifying that secondary school st udent or the parent of the student may request that directory information not be released without prior written parental consent146 according to ed this provision s been misapplied by leas that require written parental consent before they will provide information to military recruiters thereby creating an opt in rather than an opt out policy statutory requirements do not permit leas to establish an opt in policy leas have interpreted the opt out pr ovision in different ways regarding what type of notification is provi ded how parents response to notification is interpreted and whether they have actually implemented an opt in policy rather than an opt out policy for example some schools ve provided general notice to parentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33371crs67 147 schools and military face off privacy rights clash with required release of

by david p smole 153 pl 8910 205a2 about their rights to opt out of the rel ease of student directory information without mentioning how the information will be us ed while other schools have issued more explicit notices informing parents that student information may be shared with military recruiters unless they opt out in some cases lack of response to the notification of the opportunity to opt out is interpreted as willingness to have information released while other leas inte rpret lack of res ponse as an indication that parents do not want to have th eir childrens information released147 the latter interpretation requires pare nts to opt in to have information released some parents and organiza tions have criticized school s for failing to make the opt out policy clearer to parents for example the national parentteacher association pta is asking that statut ory language be changed to require that parents provide explicit permission for military recr uiters to access students information148 some schools and school distri cts are examining their current policies on military recruiters149 for example tucson ified school district in arizona established policy limiting military recruiters to one visit per month at each school in response to complaints receive d from parents about the number of days military recruiters were spending at schools150 the seattle school

that timely consultati on continues to remain cern in response ed and many seas have highlighted the equitabl participation requi rements to address concerns about consultation and the availability of services163 the amount of funding available to serve eligible priv ate school students under title ia also has been raised as concern this is due to the statutory require ment addressed earlier that leas reserve up to 20 of their title ia allocation to cover the costs of transportation for public school choice and supplemental educational services for students enrolled in public schools identif ied for improvement corrective action or restructuring depending on how leas pay for school choice transportation and supplemental educational services this re quirement may result in proportionally less funding being available for services to pr ivate school students than before enactment of the nclba because private school stude nts are not eligible for these services several provisions of the

beginning with the 20022003 school year each states usco policy is somewhat different while most states establish some threshold number of violent offenses relative to school enrollment that must be exceeded for either two or three consecutive years in order for school to be designated as persistently dangerous the definitions of violent offenses or incident s measured tend to vary considerably across states typically states usco policies identify which crimes or types of crimes constitute violent offenses alt hough these tend to differ from state to state some state policies reference primarily felony offenses eg homicide manslaughter aggravated assault or sexual assault others also referen ce violation of weapon possession laws eg gunfree schools acts or drug po ssession laws some state policies also consider student expulsions for offenses such as drug or alcohol possession or violence167 limited information is available on both sc hools being determined to be persistently dangerous and on students tr ansferring to different schools under the usco policy however it does appear that differences in the criteria used by states to identify schools as persistently dang erous may be factor that has led to considerable variation among states in the number of schools determined to be persistently dangerous the us department of educati on office of safe and drug free schools

department of educati on office of inspector general oig has examined five states for compliance with the usco requi rements and has found that in general four of these states ca lifornia georgia iowa

found that texas had not adequately implemented the usco policy at the state and lea levels170 while as noted above relatively few sc hools have been identified as unsafe school safety remains an im portant concern for students and their families for example according to the school survey on crime and safety ssocs the percentage of schools experiencing one or more violent incidents eg rape sexual battery other than rape physical attacks or fights with or without weapon threat of physical attack with or without weapo n and robbery with or without weapon increased from 71 in 19992000 to 81 in 20032004171 in 20032004 18 of schools reported at least one rious violent offense eg rape sexual battery other than rape physical attack or fight with weapon threat of physical attack with weapon and robbery with or without weapon172 the ssocs survey found that on perstudent basis middle schools had th highest rates of crime with 53 violent crimes per 1000 students versus 28 violen t crimes per 1000 students in elementary schools and 28 violent crimes per 1000 students in high schools173 given these findings it appears that the small numbe r of schools identified as persistently dangerous may be result in part of the hi gh thresholds for identification set by many states which often must be met for two or three consecutive years
