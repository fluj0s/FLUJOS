the righteous power party correcting the unfair distribution of global wealth multiplying every national average wage avoiding natural economic decline unifying economy making society righteous preventing every evil and building utopia one people one government one economy one utopia introduction and summary the sufferings in humanity calls us to take control of the financial system the only power that can end human suffering and alleviate these pains there are clear wrongs in society that the present system is powerless to correct the envisioned new system created by the righteous power party with the power of global economy in selfless hands will correct every wrong in society with wrong overlooked allowing righteous freedom only the proposed righteous power party unified public owned economy and one world government with the fair distribution of global wealth offers an enhanced more righteous and more powerful political system than any other creating system that neither allows nor encourages wrong there will be ill gains in the new society created by the righteous power party other political systems are incapable of tackling every global problem or even most the envisioned righteous power party system is the only political system that can political system that will heighten every area of society by achieving every target that which society aspires end every form of injustice in society and rid this world of every evil the global economy will be restructured to be owned by and to serve the people first the most that it can perfecting and unifying economy with many direct and surprising positives the application of every power righteously including the financial system has amazing promise for everyone rightful and legal claim for ownership by the nations and their peoples of all economic capital and profits past and present is proven and shown in this document with the illegality of the present disassociated and weak economic ownership by individuals which derives from false and illegal claims of royal ownership of all lands being granted by god is highlighted this illegal royal ownership was later sold off and handed out to individuals shaping the modern age the universal policing laws on receipt of illegal property will apply and public ownership of economy will be enacted in law before royal ownership of economic wealth economic wealth was public owned serving local villages and all their people public ownership the rightful natural and true ownership of economic wealth and will be restored with legal action or national conversion to the righteous power party third world debt that limits government service healthcare and education will be cancelled in light of this fact on false ownership of the original loans deriving from illegally claimed royal wealth rights to home surrounding lands and property within will be upheld by the righteous power party as they are seen as natural human need but lands and resources that are part of national economies or are public parks or are environmental habitats will be determined to be owned by people representing governments for the benefit of all the unfair and unequal distribution of global wealth is described in this document and will be corrected with righteous power party policy preventing future monetary injustice and correcting past monetary injustice future monetary injustice will be prevented with reasonable and high wages for all workers nations gross domestic product its productivity funding ongoing national wages the ongoing average wage in twenty 20 representative nations under the proposed righteous power party system is calculated in this document and is more than double the average wage for developed economies in the present disassociated capitalist system and many times more than the average wage in underdeveloped economies past monetary injustice will be corrected by readjusting wage histories correcting the natural economic decline that has weakened present economies with repetitive recessions over the last century by minority hoarding the majority of economic wealth and continuing to take the majority of new wealth out of economies this ultimately damning economies long term and those it supports mass poverty and its problems will remain and increase without change to the righteous power party repetitive recessions throughout modern history is proof of natural economic decline and long term recession is predicted without the correction of the unfair distribution of wealth the economic wealth claimed for the people will be put back into economies ensuring the longevity and continued success of economies economies will be developed to their full potential every charitable cause will be funded to completion cost of living will be lowered full services and amenities will be provided to every community and full funding to protect society from crime will be enacted using the funds made available due to this correction reasonable wage history will be judged to replace past over the top and underpaid wage histories with nations claiming money assets and profits that rightfully belong to the people and correcting underpaid wage histories within nations ability the majority of economic wealth will be claimed by the representatives of the people from minority of individuals with this policy when claiming assets from the minority of individuals whose wage histories have been negatively readjusted these individuals will be given first option to buy back their claimed assets these assets will be valued not at their original cost price but at the lower value they will be worth in the deflated market for rich assets that change to the righteous power party will create the price difference will be writtenoff any debt caused by readjusting wage histories this increasing the chance of the citizen whose wage history has been negatively readjusted retaining hisher assets the many families who have large amount of land around their homes will have these lands confiscated for housing developments but will most likely keep their homes those who lose assets of necessity by this repossession policy will be provided with substitute new high quality assets that they can afford before repossession with average wages more than doubling the majority of people will have their wage histories readjusted positively by this policy and will receive bulk sum to correct past monetary injustice positive wage history readjustments will target those in need at first and will be limited for the rest of the people to attain funds to develop underdeveloped economies to their full potential for public service and to fulfill every charitable cause monies remaining after these vital activities will be used to positively affect wage histories most of the people in the developed world will earn more than double their present wages and wages in the underdeveloped world for most of the people will multiply several times and again as underdeveloped economies are developed to their full potential wage ladders will remain more important tougher and more trained for positions earning higher wages wages judged on these criteria commission extra pay for amount of work done and the threat of losing ones job will be policies used to motivate the worker and make righteous power party economies as productive as possible the workers career choices and education will be dictated by government so there are worker shortages in any sector and educated that are out of work in the sector that their education is directed to the reasoning for and benefits of global unification are mentioned righteous power party nations will unify when their economies are developed to their full potential with their gross domestic products as high as can be and as full global conversion to the righteous power party approaches and all economies are completely developed one world government with unified economy under the management of global economy organisation and global defence organisation will be setup in the interests of global prosperity and global security criticisms of disassociated capitalism and communism are included and comparisons with the righteous power party are made righteous power party economies will be stronger because their success will be dependant on total economic profits with the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy when there is unified economy which is assured even in negative economic climates and not on the number of jobs an economy can create as of traditional economies this not sustainable in negative economic climates they will be more profitable streamlined full employment will be ensured indefinitely desired businesses and services will be protected from closure by the combined nationalglobal economies profits and business commitments such as past employee pensions will survive business closure in unified economy righteous power party economies are economies able to better withstand recessions the potential of cheap compressed air powered engines is explored to power cars turn seawater to drinking water and irrigation water and produce electricity prolonging the longevity and success of economies improving and saving lives and helping the environment many new lifeenhancing policies are introduced including streamlining the new unified economy which acts as one by twenty five to fifty percent 25 50 with the creation of co operative unified economy with interbusiness competition sectioned out and with mechanization investment this with business commerce and service maintained then with one hundred and thirty three to two hundred percent 133 200 more workers than the workforce capacity of the economy the total workforce will be applied upon this lesser number of employment positions this having all workers employed matter how many jobs are available in an economy and creating between three to six 3 6 months holiday time year for workers with year long wages when there is greater number of workers sharing lesser number of employment positions this only possible in unified economy full employment will be ensured indefinitely employee wages funding economies will be ensured and of greater number and the less expensive streamlined economies with competition sectioned out will also lower the cost of living and increase economic profits standards of living will be highered in every economy and cost of living lowered with services and goods produced and delivered of the highest quality possible and supplemented to affordable prices from the combined nationalglobal economic profits quality of goods will longer be stunted due to the eradication of the present system that is directed for the replacement of material goods over time to maintain jobs and businesses jobs and businesses are assured in righteous power party economy so goods can be produced and delivered of the highest quality possible the standard of goods and services will also improve with all business secrets and procedures freely available to be used by every business in cooperative unified economy better health services free education university level education allowances rehousing schemes and housing renovation schemes will be funded from the greater finance of the global economies profits and many life changing services such as satellite television and essential better healthier foods will be provided for free or at supplemented low prices ninetynine per cent 99 of housing will be rebuilt and upgraded to the highest level where previously substandard housing had been built complete complement of community amenities for performance and tuition of sports and the arts will be funded and provided to every community those with disabilities will be provided with daycare centres education healthcare carers and employment where appropriate throughout the world the working poor will be given fair wages better employments and improved working conditions immigrants and refugees will be accommodated with national refugee camps by righteous power party nations in response to the present day humanitarian crisiss of war genocide political persecution and impoverishment the previous owners of the newly owned peoples businesses will be given the highest new jobs made available when total workforces are sharing lesser number of employment positions replacing their lost positions and claimed economic wealth with top jobs and salaries business management being the most probable position offered to previous owners sports clubs and religious organizations will not be claimed to be owned by righteous power party governments as they perform an important moralelifting function for the people and will be allowed continue on successfully as before but economic wealth from outside the sporting economy will be reclaimed by the nation from sports clubs sports organizations and participants in sport the over funding of religious organizations will be corrected also the entertainment industry is important to society and will be maintained and kept functional but the massive finances involved in this industry will be claimed for the benefit of the people and wages and wage histories made reasonable the massive extra funds of people owned world economy will end poverty and fund every charitable cause to completion putting in place every measure to eradicate and treat disease provide vaccinations against disease provide clean water to all cure the worlds twenty eight million 28000000 curable blind end child labour and slavery which affects millions 1000000s the homeless and slum dwellers will be given homes and made prosperous food supply will be controlled protected and improved all around the world with healthy varied diets promoted to end malnutrition and its ill effects on mental and physical health water pipelines will be provided from temperate climates to hot dry nations the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes will be responded to with greater maximum resource and more will be done to fight global warming and protect the environment fair trade will be attained trade unions encouraged and worker conditions and wages will be improved the scientific community are called on in this document to gain complete knowledge of nature formation science to achieve the potential from this science of immortality for all life and curing every sickness we also have the potential with this science to produce foods petroleum and raw materials external from living bodies alternative theories on nature formation science and disease origination are offered and genetic engineering is encouraged to modernize our immune systems to protect us from every sickness and cure every sickness maintaining health forever crime and violence will be made impossible by establishing massive public defence forces in every nation who secure and section areas with use of checkpoints cctv sniffer dogs and searches of areas if under suspicion to seize guns bombs dangerous weapons illicit health harming drugs and other illicit materials to find and save any falsely imprisoned people and to protect the public public defence forces will also have peacekeeping function to be armed protection for civilian populations and prevent wars ninety per cent 90 of armies will be converted into public defence forces and for the remaining military common world language will be selected for them to learn so armies of every nationality can communicate and work together crime will be further prevented with employment and education dictated and with laws put in place to recoup all past illegal monies through certification and identifying the nature of all monies this shutting down criminal industry and preventing and recouping corruption laws and policies will be enacted to protect unborn children families from domestic abuse and abolish the death penalty laws and procedures against forced marriage mistreatment of females hinduism and cultures of discrimination will also be enacted prisons will empty over time with zero crime enforced and the nobility and the humanity of the prisoner will be instilled this encourages exprisoners to be successful in life after release from prison heavy work introduced to prisons will also encourage this drug rehabilitation and treatment services will be made freely available to those who cant afford it world peace will be secured with world unity with the policy of democratic tribal sovereignty enforced with the suffering peoples of censorship of the media nations liberated and with winning arguments against the socalled modern muslim jihad and racism if they enter public awareness and with world peace secured all child soldiers will be integrated back into society the loss of life from war will be prevented and the massive spending on world military of over one trillionone thousand billion 1000000000000 us dollars every year can be reduced substantially and these monies redirected to public protection and service global security and public safety will also improve with the just and likable society the righteous power party will create the principals and ethics of democracy and peace will be embraced and adopted by righteous power parties all these policies can be achieved by every economy in this modern age with the power of economy serving the people the most that it can developed nations will be developed more to new first world standard and developing nations will be developed at great speed to meet this standard government and business the main forces that structure every life will unite and be people orientated under the peoples authority and will serve the people first greatly improving quality of life for all our future is better in our own hands rightful and legal claim for ownership of all economic wealth past and present by the people is shown with the illegality of the present disassociated and weak economic ownership by individuals deriving from false and illegal claims of royal ownership of all due to false claim of royal oneness with god the creator royal greed and need for favour later sold off and gave out all lands and resources to individuals shaping the modern age the source of modern ownership false and illegal the universal policing laws on the receipt of illegal property will apply and economic ownership will pass into public hands economic ownership before royal ownership was naturally public ownership this the true rightful and legal ownership of economic wealth and will be restored legally or politically third world debt will also be cancelled due to the illegality of the original loans that started third world debt deriving from illegally claimed royal wealth the legality and rightful claim of ownership of all economic wealth past and present by the people is shown in this document through analysis of the origin of modern ownership of all lands resources and businesses being from false claim of royal ownership of all lands being granted by god through false claim of royal oneness with god the creator through this claim lords and royal figureheads sold and handed out all lands and resources worldwide to individuals shaping the modern age the source of modern ownership false and illegal the authorities of the day should have kept the lands and resources for the people serving and prospering them all instead of giving all lands and resources away to individuals before royal ownership resources and lands were public owned shared by our distant ancestors of long ago serving all the people in an area then the royal lie of rule and ownership of all with royalty being chosen by and sharing the one being with god took all lands and resources illegally from the people royal greed and need for favour then sold off and handed out all economic wealth except for royal estates to individuals this crime will be corrected by righteous power party policy or through legal action and economic ownership will return to the people considering the illegality of the ownership of all lands and resources that has passed down through the ages and the rightful claim of ownership of all lands and the resources within by the people represented by their governments the people can claim the wealth of their nations the business and natural resource industries capital and profits past and present through law and even if the aforementioned was not claimable by law ownership would still change into public hands to heighten humanity and to save humanity from the modern day crisiss of poverty homelessness third world debt drug dependence crime war famine disease drought unclean drinking water lack of sanitation genocide inadequate responses to natural disasters slavery child labour underfunded health systems unfair trade unfairly low wages lower worker conditions lack of services and natural economic decline that weakens the power of government to correct these problems all these problems present in todays modern society could have been avoided if peoplerepresenting ownership of economy had been policy enacted throughout history these tragedies are prominent in the present peoplepowerless capitalist system peoplefirst righteous power party capitalism will raise the world out of these tragedies and allow everyone to thrive and prosper with zero neglect the righteous power party urges governments or groups to take businesses representative bodies and legal entities to court to recognize the claim of ownership of all businesses by people representing governments through national and world law and to advertise the righteous power party and its causes and solutions there is circumstantial evidence that proves that all lands and resources derive from false and illegal royal claims of ownership being granted by god this evidence will be used with the universal policing laws on the receipt of illegal property and ownership of all economic wealth will pass into public hands represented by their governments by law there is also case for canceling third world debt which has been caused through borrowing loans illegally derived from previous royal wealth third world debt has limited government service heathcare and education throughout modern history these debts legally should be cancelled in light of this circumstantial evidence public ownership of economic wealth what is proposed by public ownership is that the governments of every nation the representatives of the people claim ownership of every nations businesses and natural resource industries capital and profits past and present realigning capitalism away from the weak and illegal system of disassociated ownership to stronger and legal system of unified public economic ownership this creating powerful and caring people orientated and public owned unified capitalism capitalism is the greatest force on this earth involving people and needs to be controlled and to serve the people primarily that it is not owned organized and controlled under people serving unified system has lessened the life of every human and is tragedy upon history modern political systems internationally are trying to provide enough for all sectors of societys welfare but they fail even in this task with many sectors of society impoverished unemployed homeless enslaved child labouring starving diseased criminal warring refugee and lacking services and these other political systems offer way to end these problems public ownership of economy with righteous power party policy will rectify these problems and quality of life for every person will improve also natural economic decline will be avoided under righteous power party policy and economic wealth will be kept within economies ensuring the longevity and greater success of economies natural economic decline due to the hoarding of economic wealth has caused mass impoverishment throughout the modern age and this will only increase if it is not corrected repetitive recessions throughout the modern age is proof of natural economic decline and this has only been alleviated with new technologies and new enterprise being created by economies this need for new wealth to be created for economies to be relatively successful will run dry and economies will fail causing long term recession public ownership of economy past and present with wage history readjustment correcting past monetary injustice and with wages delivered fairly from nations productivity preventing future monetary injustice will prevent natural economic decline with economic wealth kept within economies and long term recession averted under public ownership the peoples of the nations can claim ownership of all businesses within their boarders through law and where there are sections of foreign multinational companies claimed by nation the nation will inherit the productionsales contracts previously attained by the sections of the multinational companies and these sections of the multinational companies will still function as if they are still part of the multinational organization as they legally belong to the nation and will be seen as such in national and world law company names and logos will be replaced with national names and emblems under public ownership public ownership economy is an economy working for standards and quality of life first and profit second the right to home surrounding lands and property within will be upheld and determined legal by the righteous power party as they are considered natural human need but lands and resources that are part of national economies or are public parks or are environmental habitats will be owned by peoplerepresenting governments for the benefit of all the distribution of global wealth and saving the future of economy from natural economic decline by correcting past and present monetary injustice according to the united nations world institute for development economics research zero point six one per cent 061 or thirty seven million 37000000 people out of worlds population own forty per cent 40 of global wealth two per cent 2 owns over half 50 of global wealth and ten per cent 10 of the worlds population owns eighty five per cent 85 of global wealth and half 50 of the worlds population owns only one per cent 1 of the worlds wealth wealth distribution within wealthy nations is also extremely unequal with five per cent 5 of wealthy nations populations owning half 50 of national wealth the great profit ages with new wealth created that is dependent on economic development new enterprise and new technology will fail medium term causing long term recession the bubble will burst at the loss of the majority in the developed world natural economic decline has already impoverished the majority of humanity and condemns future generations unless righteous power party policy is enacted the hoarded wealth that the rich are sapping out of economies is going to weaken economies and cause mass job loss with new enterprise to invest in the minority profiting the majority left with nothing the righteous power party will step in and save humanity from natural economic decline by correcting past and preventing future monetary injustice keeping accumulated past and ongoing economic wealth within economies safeguarding the future and success of economies this ten per cent 10 of global population with eighty five per cent 85 of global wealth have not invested and will not invest their money into economies to develop economies to their full potential they have not invested and will not invest their money to fulfill every charitable cause to completion this within their ability the righteous power party will invest into developing economies to develop them to their full potential and fulfill charitable causes to completion this that disassociated capitalism fails to do money is spent better in righteous power partys hands righteous power party economies are economies of greater action and better prospects than disassociated capitalism and centrally managed communist economies both of which only resource ongoing wealth their fundamental failure value of average wages in rich nationspoor nations after conversion to the righteous power party and developing economies to their full potential the average wage after tax in every nation that converts to the righteous power party will be calculated from the nations gross domestic product ie the value of the nations productivity after tax divided by the nations labour force these figures resourced by the united states central intelligence agency world fact book do not include nations accumulated past economic wealth which will be used with nations tax revenue to develop economies to their full potential for public service to fulfill every charitable cause to completion and to pay off national debts the average global tax is calculated to be forty three per cent 43 of global productivity and was 496 trillion49600 billion international dollars in 2007 when adjusted according to national costs of living ppp purchasing power parity in every nation the international dollar is worth 154 times the value of the us dollar so calculated global taxes in us dollars is 76384 trillion us dollars all the figures mentioned in the rest of this section will be presented in us dollars adjusted to cost of living in every nation and calculated after tax the idea would be to fund national wages with nations gross domestic product and to invest national taxes and national accumulated past economic wealth attained with conversion to the righteous power party into underdeveloped economies to raise the average wages in previously underdeveloped nations to the same wages as in completely developed rich nations when economies are developed to their full potential and unifying these nations and economies after development nations will invest past economic wealth and taxable income also to fulfill every charitable cause to completion righteous power party investment into economies developed and underdeveloped will heighten national gross domestic products and cost of living will lower with supplementing goods and services from past profits and taxes excluded from gross domestic product with investment in modernization infrastructure education and new enterprise national economies will develop to their full potential with gross domestic products and hence average wages multiplying in size it is presumed the economic potential for poor nations economies is equal to the potential already achieved by rich nations the yearly average wage for the world as whole if the world converted to the righteous power party at the end of 2007 would be 10136 trillion us dollars divided by the estimated global labour force of 3001 billion 33775 us dollars but average wages vary very much between rich nations and poor nations the yearly average wages in nations according to gross domestic product figures for the end of 2007 before investment to develop economies to their full potential are calculated for twenty 20 representative nations wages will not be equal the nation over with some jobs earning marked amount more than others this creates desire for the worker to attain the more difficult better paid employment there will be an estimated twenty to thirty per cent 20 30 difference in national wages for higher and lower rated jobs the importance toughness and amount of training for every job will be rated and will be paid more or less according to the rating judged if nations converted to the righteous power party at the end of 2007 and the average wage was gross domestic product divided by national labour force the yearly average wage calculated for rich nations adjusted according to national costs of living is calculated in us dollars at 108335 for australia 109606 for canada 99989 for the european union 114666 for france 99995 for germany 129483 for ireland 101298 for japan 135817 for saudi arabia 107664 for the united kingdom and 139414 for the united states of america the yearly average wage for poor nations according to national gross domestic products at the end of 2007 adjusted according to national costs of living is calculated in us dollars at 28454 for brazil 13505 for china 29574 for egypt 3052 for ethiopia 8841 for india 12056 for indonesia 48031 for mexico 9055 for nigeria 42570 for russia and 25588 for south africa with average wages under disassociated capitalism in the developed world less than fifty per cent 50 of the calculated average wage under righteous power party unified capitalism and with average wages multiplying several times in the undeveloped world and again when the extra finances of past economy are made available to developed underdeveloped economies to their full potential the proposed change to the righteous power party proves to be more attractive to the average global citizen in whichever nation they belong to the recent history of global gross domestic product in us dollars adjusted according to national costs of living is displayed next in 1973 world gross domestic product was 247 trillion us dollars in 1998 world gross domestic product was 519 trillion us dollars and in 2007 world gross domestic product was 1013 trillion us dollars the ability to multiply the productivity of economies is evident from these figures and full potential of economies must be reached as soon as possible this will be speeded up with investment of tax revenue and accumulated past economic wealth in all underdeveloped economies so all citizens on this planet can be rich as already mentioned it is presumed that the economic potential for poor nations is equal to the potential already achieved by rich nations and rich nations productivity could even increase beyond their present level if the poorest nations gross domestic product per worker equaled the richest nations the average wage for ethiopias workers under the righteous power partys system would multiply forty five 45 times this is the potential of ethiopias economy the potential to fully develop economies must be met and only can with the opportunistic selfless investment of global wealth that the righteous power party offers claiming the rightful ownership of past economic profits by replacing over the top wage histories with reasonable fair wage histories and claiming money and assets on behalf of the people and replacing possessed assets with high quality substitute assets before repossession readjusting wage histories is the only way to protect from and correct past natural economic decline also those who have been underpaid over the years will have their wage histories positively readjusted and wage ladders will remain wages judged relative to job rating system with rightful and legal ownership of economic capital past and present the people will want proportion of past profits from every business to correct past monetary injustice and the unfair distribution of global wealth to correct past natural economic decline caused from minority of individuals hoarding the majority of economic wealth and to fund global utopia that will last indefinitely nations gross domestic product its productivity will fund ongoing national wages the ongoing average wage in righteous power party economies will more than double the average wage in the present disassociated capitalist economies in the developed world and average wages will multiply several times in the undeveloped world and again when the extra finances of past economy are made available to develop underdeveloped economies to their full potential meaning the majority of people will have their wage histories positively readjusted reasonable wage history will be judged to replace past over the top and underpaid wage histories with peoplerepresenting nations claiming money assets and profits that rightfully belong to the people and correcting underpaid wage histories within nations ability the majority of economic wealth will be claimed by the representatives of the people from minority of individuals with this policy when claiming assets from the minority of individuals whose wage histories have been negatively readjusted these individuals will be given first option to buy back their claimed assets these assets will be valued not at their original cost price but at the lower value they will be worth in the deflated market for rich assets that change to the righteous power party will create the price difference will be writtenoff any debt caused by readjusting wage histories this increasing the chance of the citizen whose wage history has been negatively readjusted retaining hisher assets the many families who have large amount of land around their homes will have these lands confiscated for housing developments but will most likely keep their homes those who lose assets of necessity by this repossession policy will be provided with substitute new high quality assets that they can afford before repossession with average wages more than doubling the majority of people will have their wage histories readjusted positively by this policy and will receive bulk sum to correct past monetary injustice positive wage history readjustments will target those in need at first and will be limited for the rest of the people to attain funds to develop underdeveloped economies to their full potential for public service and to fund every charitable cause to completion monies remaining after these vital activities will be used to positively affect wage histories average wages will further increase with development of underdeveloped economies all of which are underdeveloped to different degrees wage ladders will remain more important tougher and more trained for positions earning higher wages the importance toughness and amount of training for every job will be rated and will be paid more or less according to the rating judged this creates desire for the worker to attain the more difficult better paid employment individual business ownership has an unhealthy aspect for economies and nations they store large proportion of total economic wealth putting the majority of nations economic wealth out of use lessening the economic power of the nations which should be at its most this continues to happen with ongoing new wealth created the majority of it falling into minority of individuals hands this natural economic decline uncorrected has destroyed communism and damaged the success of disassociated capitalism with masses impoverished and masses given earnings as little as possible the future of global economy will only worsen with long term recession predicted unless past monetary injustice is corrected and future monetary injustice prevented in the form stated in this document when the public represented by their governments seize the hoarded economic wealth that damns the masses the performance of economies will improve and wealth for the average citizen will increase many times employment contracts within every nation will be rewritten by the representatives of the people to make wage readjustment and wage history readjustment official tax records bank records and valuers will all be used in the process of readjusting wage histories the potential to protect society from crime with identifying the nature of all monies is discussed later motivating the worker for high production economies commission and extra pay for amount of work done are important incentives that will be implemented to motivate the worker also those who under perform or dont work to the best of their ability will be under threat of losing their positions to further motivate the worker these policies will promote the highest productivity of economies possible and the ultimate prosperity of all government dictation of education placements and employments under this new system of full employment upon lesser number of work positions the government will dictate employments and education places to meet the needs of society exact this creating perfect economies and replacing criminal careers amongst the unemployed also there will be worker shortages in any sector with government employment direction and there will be educated that are out of work in the sector that their education is directed to the number of education places will equal the number of employments required in each employment sector the education system directly linked to the job system with students competing in examinations for available educationemployment positions the new government owned economy will also restructure employments deciding and re aligning present worker positions to meet the needs of society exact providing training to the repositioned workers for their new roles those unable to work at the normal standard will be made work as much as they are able and will receive fair wage the reasoning and benefits of economic unification of righteous power party nations righteous power party nations when they are two or more and fully developed will unify on economic levels leaving nobody within these nations excluded from the great financial potential for all individuals and families of perfect unified global economy developed to its full potential unification will occur as more and more will want the better system protection and quality of life that only unified economy under proper management offers unification will mean economies can be configured better and streamlined more nations must unify so masses are not left in poverty this after economic development so poverty doesnt increase wealth will multiply for poorer nations medium term with process towards economic unification as has happened with ireland joining the european union for example unification will save the impoverished and ensure global security lessening security expenses and with hatred of the just society created and with poverty eliminated and hence crime global security and public safety will improve once more it is wrong morally and legally to leave any nation of people excluded from the potential wealth global economy is capable of creating humanity can be as one and should be unified not divided economies fully developed are economies whose value will multiply several times the present disassociated capitalist world fails to invest in this potential only unified righteous power party global economy whose soul purpose is to develop for the benefit of all can the full potential of global economy be met multiplying profits and wages several times all people are using and have been using money developed from international illegal royal ownership in ages gone this wealth previously belonged to disassociated communities in local areas under centrally managed public ownership with rights for all local people to any economic wealth created the history of economy has been global and should be administered in such way all people should be bestowed with this universal international wealth as has been the way with our distant ancestors before corruption of economy progression to one world government with unified global economy under the management of global economy organisation and global defence organisation and steps to unification outlined to protect wealth and create wealth one world government never seemed attractive or useful without economic control and ownership past and present without this government has been too weak to tackle global issues the present illegal disassociated economycapitalist system unaware and unable to properly respond to humanitarian crisiss caring global righteous power party government with full usage ownership and control of the global economy and its finances can solve and tackle all the worlds problems responding completely to humanitarian crisis and fulfilling every charitable cause to completion established righteous power party political parties and nations must encourage foreign nations to convert to the righteous power party established rich righteous power party nations can do deals with poor foreign nations to fund development of their economies if they convert to the righteous power party and enter process of unification this is how the european union successfully developed economies and unified nations to degree and is proof that the righteous power party policy of unifying and developing nations to their full potential works righteous power party nations will rise alone at first but as more and more nations convert to the righteous power party and economies are completely developed nations will unify and as the world approaches full global conversion one world government will be set up third world debt that limits government service healthcare and education will be cancelled consequently of this action if it is not already cleared by the legal argument mentioned previous there must be steps to unification so the wealthy developed nation doesnt sell out their citizens lower quality of life for their citizens or increase poverty firstly political change to the righteous power party is required secondly investment with tax income and the massive savings of past economy will take place to develop underdeveloped economies to their full potential with investment in mechanization infrastructure education and new enterprise finally with gross domestic product per worker as high as can be between nations unification will take place leading eventually to one world government and unified global economy global economy organisation and global defence organisation will both be setup in the interests of global prosperity and global security global economy organisation would control and configure for success the worlds total businesses and resource sectors developing all economies to new first world standard with zero neglect global defence organisation would also be created with control of every army to ensure the security of every nation and ensure trust and cooperation between the nations armies common world language being selected for all armies to learn making armies of every nationality able to communicate and work together the righteous new society created will also eliminate hatred of society improving security and public safety with unified global military the nations safety from war is assured and the nations massive military spending on security can be redirected to public protection and service international government on defence and financial organisation levels while national government maintained as an administrative body and as service provider both active on diplomatic levels global unification is both righteous and worthwhile criticism of communism and disassociated capitalism and comparison to the righteous power party disassociated capitalism and communism has made random unorganized mess of economies with low quality everything including housing family cars and foodstuffs the righteous power partys unified people serving capitalism will higher the standard of everything improving life for the masses and will orchestrate economic development and redevelopment of the nations economies so they are perfectly put together and are beautiful and will also multiply the worth of global economies and their productivity communism took business ownership but didnt correct past monetary injustice from past business ownership leaving most economic wealth in the hands of minority of individuals and out of economy this is where communism failed before it started and where disassociated capitalism repetitively fails but is still creating economic growth due to the generation of new wealth with new technologies this wont last and disassociated capitalism will ultimately fail causing long term recession due to natural economic decline with loss of the majority of economic wealth into minority of individuals hands and out of economy impoverishment of the masses predicted even in the developed world this can only be avoided with change to the righteous power party with its policy of correcting past monetary injustice this large amount of wealth attained from correcting past monetary injustice will be used to develop economies to their full potential serving the public with average wages multiplied from economic development and eradicating poverty the total workforce guaranteed employment with the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy also gives the righteous power party envisioned system big advantage over communist and disassociated capitalist systems that cant accommodate everyone in employment communism denied the human freedom of the individual the righteous power party will promote human freedom and will provide services that add to human freedom that even the present disassociated capitalism of the free world fails to provide such as complete compliments of community amenities free or cheaper satellite television free education and free healthcare communism was movement against the mass impoverishment of disassociated capitalism like the righteous power party but communism failed to end poverty and failed to create riches amongst the masses the righteous power party succeeds in this goal disassociated capitalism only offers riches and complete fulfillment to the few as it has throughout history righteous power party unified economy will offer complete fulfillment to all people concede to disassociated capitalism and say its the best but with the righteous power party being brought into existence this is longer the case better run unified capitalism will transform underdeveloped economies in much the same way as irelands economy was improved from second world economy to one of the richest per capita in the world with membership of an international economic union similarly the wealth of the world can multiply medium term as has happened in ireland over the last thirty years but this will only happen with the opportunistic unselfish and massive investment that only the righteous power party can do with the ownership organization and control of the global economies profits and liquid wealth developing economies with investment in mechanization infrastructure education and new enterprise the rich live off those who are poorer the rich getting richer the poor barely surviving as new wealth is created the poor being the majority and given earnings as little as possible this is criticism of disassociated capitalism and its associated problems such as third world debt and inadequate responses to poverty and diseases with the potential to create new wealth maximized under fair ethical and selfless global economic control all can be made rich to relatively neglible different degrees depending on their type of job and nobody will be left poor stronger economies and future economic projections comparing righteous power party economies with traditional economies and the potential of compressed air powered engines righteous power party economies will be stronger because their success will be dependant on total economic profits with the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy which is assured even in negative economic climates and not on the number of jobs an economy can create as of traditional economies this not sustainable in negative economic climates they will be more profitable streamlined full employment will be ensured indefinitely desired businesses and services will be protected from closure by the combined nationalglobal economies profits and business commitments such as past employee pensions will survive business closure in unified economy the current unprotected economy fails communities and employees with mass job losses and lost pensions occurring even in the developed world nations are certain to meet economic recessions in the future due to natural economic decline as has happened repetitively in history with traditional economy todays illegal economies being weak divided and vulnerable in unfavorable economic climates the perfect and stronger righteous power party economies envisioned will better withstand economic crisiss without change to the righteous power party economies will falter medium term due to natural economic decline natural resource depletion and material possession buildup the masses suffering job loss and impoverishment probable though the recent invention of cheap compressed air powered engines to power cars may save humanity from being dependant on depleting stocks of oil compressed air powered engines may also be used for electricity production and for saltwater to freshwater conversion desalination this irrigating lands in and providing drinking water to hot dry nations helping the environment saving the future of economy and improving and saving lives the use of international water pipelines for this cause also is mentioned in this document even in relatively positive economic climates change to the righteous power party will greatly improve the nations and lives of those who dwell within peoplerepresenting government owned economy is stronger economy ensuring the economic future of nation more so than traditional economy and must be converted to more benefits of unified righteous power party economies streamlining unified economies by sectioning out competition and through mechanization reducing employment capacities by twenty five to fifty percent 25 50 and then applying total workforces upon the employment capacities of economies giving full employment indefinitely and between three to six 3 6 months time off for workers with year long wages great and surprising benefit of unifying economies under central government ownership is that full employment can be easily achieved and all workers can receive three to six 3 6 months time off with year long wages when economies are completely developed under righteous power party policy with revolutionary employment policy as is described next inter business competition created more jobs and business outlets than is needed in cooperative unified economies when national ownership comes into effect and economies are as one interbusiness competition will be sectioned out streamlining economies with greater profits and lower prices from less business overheads all economies are also underdeveloped to different degrees which can be further streamlined with mechanization these policies streamlining economies to the extreme will make an estimated twentyfive to fifty percent 25 50 less jobs available with business commerce and service maintained and in what is termed the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy with an estimated one hundred and thirtythree to two hundred percent 133 200 more workers than employment positions workforces will share lesser number of employment positions creating three to six 3 6 months time off for workers workers covering for each other using rotation policy when taking time off the more workers per employment sector the more time off for each worker every year under this employment policy also full employment is ensured indefinitely matter how many employment positions there are and poverty and unemployment will be eliminated forever economies will be resilient to recessions dependant on the massive total profits of economies which is assured even in negative economic climates and not on the number of employment positions an economy can create as of traditional economies which is not sustainable in negative economic climates anticompetitive business cooperation pooling profits business secrets and procedures for higher standards of living and lower cost of living public owned economy with the economy acting as one will cut out lower standard produce and provide the highest standard of goods at affordable prices supplemented from the combined nationalglobal economies profits and lower cost of living and increased profits will also be attained due to the streamlined economies the righteous power party will create when competition is sectioned out the standard of goods and services will also be heightened when all business secrets and procedures are pooled to be used by every business in cooperative unified economy the food industry for example when pooling together business secrets will provide the best foods from the recipes of the combined menus of all the worlds food industries cutting out lower standard food products from public consumption this effect will apply to every business sector highering the quality of every life material prosperity and more need for system creating below standard goods to maintain jobs and businesses cheaply made goods that break and underdeveloped goods that become outdated prevent the build up of material prosperity for the population with system directed for the replacement of material goods over time for profits this occurs to keep businesses afloat and maintain jobs this policy criminal yet understandable when maintaining businesses and jobs in the new righteous power party economy with full employment ensured always the need for creating below standard goods to maintain jobs and services is removed so all goods will be produced of the highest standard promoting the material prosperity of all people maximization of business and government services upgrading housing the world over providing more freely available goods and services and an idea to have internet like television servers righteous power party policy will be to saturate business service potential with outlets serving every area also maximization of government services that operate at optimum levels will be delivered free education will be provided university level education allowances will be provided topgrade health services with zero waiting lists will be provided rehousing schemes and housing renovation schemes for all living in substandard accommodation will be provided the building industry will serve the people and high standards first not profit first at the cost of standards as has occurred ninetynine per cent 99 of the substandard housing that cost cutting disassociated economies built over the last century will be rebuilt and upgraded the world over to provide housing of the highest standard this affordable and doable by unified righteous power party economies and will be long term policy put into action this ensures and increases jobs within the building trade long term increases nationalglobal productivity with prolonged demand for new house related goods and will make housing more suited to the better lives within the new economic environment that the righteous power party will create and many services such as satellite television can be provided for free or more affordably where previously kept for minority prices of essential better and healthier foods can be reduced and many other life changing service industries can be supplemented as desired this all will be delivered with the extra backing of the massive profits generated by public owned economies also an idea that may be possible is to have big television servers like internet servers for every home where one can pick what you want to view from massive database of television shows movies music videos and documentaries this would add to the joy of every life and is probably possible providing full complements of community amenities to every local area most local communities in the first world and in the developing world lack many amenities that should be provided to every community all local communities having complete complement of amenities will be policy attainable and affordable with the righteous power party in power theatresmusic auditoriums will deliver plays musicals classical music and modern music performed by local talents and traveling entertainers music art and film tuition will be financed and provided social events can be staged and facilitated and also popular sports amenities will be provided the expression arts and sports should be enjoyed by all peoples and will be available to be enjoyed by every community in righteous power party world providing for those with disabilities the extra finances of righteous power party governments will be able to provide daycare centres education healthcare and carers to all those with disabilities throughout the world and where appropriate provide them with employment improving employment for the working poor the labour force of this planet is estimated to be 3001 billion 3001000000 according to the united nations international labour organisation 137 billion 1370000000 of this labour force are termed the working poor living on less than two us dollars 2 day by correcting monetary injustice developing first world economies to new first world standard and developing other economies to meet this standard using the increased potential of righteous power party unified economies large proportion of the working poor will be redirected to better employments their working conditions will be improved and their wages can be increased to level that is fair accommodating immigrants and refugees there is an everpresent ability to accommodate any number of immigrants into national refugee camps at little cost to the nations this is the most that can be offered under present economy if it is feasible to offer employment at later stage this will be done the immigrantasylum seekerrefugee did flee their home due to war genocide political persecution wrongful imprisonment unemployment or impoverishment many immigrants are refused entry into nation and have worser life than the security of national refugee camps which could have been offered this within nations means food drink healthcare education and full compliments of community amenities to provide to national refugee camps are feasible and will be provided humanity in the present day is in state of crisis and national refugee camps are the appropriate response to this crisis to not accommodate immigrantsasylum seekersrefugees when it is in nations means is crime the righteous power party in government will always accommodate everyone including immigrants pragmatically accommodating the previous owners of businesses the previous owners of the newly owned peoples businesses will be given the highest new jobs made available when applying total workforces upon lesser employment capacity policy replacing their top jobs and claimed economic wealth with the highest jobs and salaries made available in the new system created business management being the most probable position offered to previous owners sports clubs and religious organisations ownership will not be claimed by righteous power party governments sports clubs and religious organizations will not be counted as businesses to be owned by peoplerepresenting governments they perform an important moralelifting function amongst the people and will be allowed to continue on successfully as before but economic wealth from outside the sporting economy will be reclaimed by the nation from sports clubs sports organizations and participants in sport the over funding of religious organizations will be corrected also and the underpaid in these areas will be supplemented and made work the entertainment industry is important to society and will be maintained and kept functional but the massive finances involved in this industry will be claimed for the benefit of the people and wages and wage histories made reasonable funding every charitable cause to completion curing curable blindness providing greater funding for the health sciences and eradicating and treating disease according to the sightsavers charity the blindness of twentyeight million 28000000 of the worlds thirtyseven million 37000000 blind people is curable if the money is provided to treat them the charity sightsavers restored the sight of over two hundred thousand 200000 people last year but clearly curing all the curable blind is out of sightsavers reach this effect is similar for most charitable causes charities unable to completely provide for or treat all the poor and sick this is the same with the united nations millennium project which is also unable to tackle most global poverty righteous power party funds will be able to fulfill every charitable cause to completion to greater fund the health sciences and put in place every measure to eradicate and treat disease including providing contraceptives and vaccinations to all to prevent transmission of disease saving millions of lives and lifeexpectancy for those whose life expectancy is unnaturally shortened will be highered ending low level heavy labour upon children righteous power party national funding will eliminate child labour united nations statistics estimate there are over one hundred and thirty two million 132000000 children between the ages of five to fourteen 5 14 working the lowest employments in the world seventy per cent 70 of them in the agriculture sector the work that they do is in hazardous conditions is harmful to their health and hinders their education and future careers they must be offered better life and can with the finances and care of righteous power party world governments banning child labour providing for children and families correcting monetary injustice and developing economies to new first world standard creating economies everywhere which are free from child labour and its ill effects upon childrens lifestyles health educations and futures slavery eradication in recent history slavery has emerged into third world and second world nations in the tens of millions 10000000s the two systems of slavery involved are called caste system slavery and debtbonded slavery caste system slavery occurs where families have been determined by radical religions or society to be part of slave class and spend their lifetimes as slaves debtbonded slavery occurs where people have taken loan for as little as the cost of medicine for sick child but are unable to repay the loan and so are claimed to be owned by employers available to be bought and sold for profit and are forced to work long hours 365 days year for lifetime these cases of forced slavery are most prominent in west africa latin america and asia peoples business authority government will succeed in abolishing this evil industry and liberate the worlds slave populations by enforcing antislavery laws correcting monetary injustice and by developing all economies to new first world standard creating economies which are without forced slavery giving homes and prosperity to the homeless and slum dwellers righteous power party governments will have the extra resources and finances to make prosperous lives out of all the homeless and slum dwellers accommodation will be provided or rebuilt food and clothing will be provided job training programs and job placements will be made available and health recovery services will be provided all this provided to give prosperity and livable life to all the homeless and slum dwellers ensuring and protecting food supply for nutrition immunity strength mental and physical health and to prevent famine global system of righteous power parties will take control protect monitor and distribute the worlds food supplies distributing food so all peoples have enough foods protected and the future of food supply safeguarded in the recent past millions have died each year as direct result of hunger and malnutrition and this continues every year these deaths from starvation or number of treatable infectious diseases their bodies and immune systems weakened by hunger and malnutrition these sorts of deaths are horrendous in nature and number and must not take place anymore installing one world government under righteous power party policy would oversee and protect global food supply world hunger malnutrition tiredness and mental and physical unhealthiness will end with righteous power party nations finances and organisation securing and improving global food supply providing all peoples with appropriate strength health and immunity from healthy varied diets water pipelines to dry nations with all the water available on this earth we could provide water for irrigation drinking and sanitation in those places in need of freshwater there are oil pipelines internationally over great distances surely we could build international clean water pipelines for those in need of it with diseases and famines being caused by lack of clean water and lack of sanitation we must investigate the potential for clean water pipelines and have them built the use of desalination plants with cheap compressed air powered engines to turn saltwater into freshwater may also help this cause with complete economic control the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes can be responded to with greater maximum resource and more can be done to fight global warming and preserve the environment with complete economic control under public ownership of economies the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes can be responded to with greater maximum resource rising sea levels droughts forest fires floods the spread of tropical diseases and hurricanes and typhoons as well as earthquakes have ruined many lands and lives already every nation on this earth needs heavy funding to respond to and prepare for these natural disasters to avoid tragedy righteous power party nations have the greater funds to achieve this also with complete economic control the nations and one world government can do more to fight global warming and protect the environment being able to lessen pollution and preserve and plant forests allowing trade unions and correcting unfair trading practice trade unions are banned in some cases in second and third world nations they will be encouraged and allowed under righteous power party global leadership many unjust companies also only allow nations raw materials exports only and dont let them manufacture and develop the raw materials to gain from the most profitable parts of their business sectors this will change when these companies are owned under the jurisdiction of righteous power party one world government and the developing worlds nations will be allowed fair trading to gain the profits and wages they are entitled to unlocking nature formation science for immortality cures and food petroleum and raw material production alternative theories on nature formation science and disease origination are offered and genetic engineering is encouraged to modernize our immune systems for immortality and to protect us and cure us from every sickness the righteous power party calls on the worlds scientific community to learn how plants and animals make certain materials so we can produce food petroleum and raw materials directly external from living bodies genetic engineering of fungi such as the fungus that makes quorn protein enriched foodstuff made from edible fungus may be key to making foods petroleum and raw materials external from living bodies learning also how plantlife makes oxegen from carbon dioxide may lead to oxegen generating machines to help the environment or to use in the home also we have the potential with complete knowledge of nature formation science to live on indefinitely and to cure every sickness an alternative theory on how nature formation science works is that formative cells for every species of life may be instructed by radio signals constructed for the dawn of life on earth millions of years ago the diversity complexity and majesty of life on earth could not have been made randomly from beginner cells with evolution life was definitely developed by an intelligence and the amount of dna formation information needed to form the human body for example could not possible be contained in beginner egg cells and sperm cells instructive radio signals upon dna is possible and probable way this could have occurred there are new dna sequences which appear as bodies form and grow which points to the instructive radio signal theory for explaining the formation and development of all life with alternating dna sequencing through bodies lifespan heart attacks can be explained in light of this theory they may be caused from radio signal instructed dna receptor cells receiving instructive signals upon human hearts intended for other species who have faster and stronger hearts the human heart unable to cope with these signals causing heart attacks and death diseases cancers and every other sickness may also originate from accidental signal crossover creating bad dna sequences or these occur randomly we can learn to read how every cell is instructed by testing what every type of cell forms or produces when grown and then with complete knowledge of how every cell works we can control every organ in the human body with cell emplacement replacing diseased or weakened cells in organs curing diseases and maintaining health forever there may be already an organ regrowth system starting from beginner cells that replace weakened aged organs if this is the case we have to tap into this system to regrow organs of the same health and age as before maintaining health forever also genetic engineering to modernize our immune systems is encouraged and needed to protect and control our health from modern sicknesses which occur due to viral contraction the aging process and drug usage we have the potential also with this immunity science to live forever on earth we have rejectiondetection systems in our bodies that give us immunity if we could reconfigure these systems we could potentially protect our health from every sickness and cure diseases and cancers with bodily rejection of diseases and cancers if we can protect our health with genetic engineering drugs can be legalized and enjoyed if they longer harm our health the formers of life on earth did ancient genetic engineering to form and provide for life at the dawn of life on earth but their work hasnt been developed or updated with changes to our environment as new threats to human life appeared we need to update the formers of lifes genetic engineering work with modern genetic engineering work to sustain our lives we should create new types of immune cells using genetic engineering based on the format of the ancient and still in use immunity cells of today with correct engineering of immune cells we can defend our bodies from diseases and cancers that appeared after the dawn of life after the formation and development work of our still in use immune systems ended modern day illnesses and diseases werent configured for when our immune systems were formed in ancient times we must further on the work that the formers of life did do to further defend our health from cellular threats its up to humanity to defend itself and this is done with genetic engineering to defend the body massive public defence forces to eliminate and prevent crime with the finance of business and natural resource industry ownership massive international public defence forces can be created and deployed throughout every nation securing public safety and ensuring global security financed protection force to compliment the forces of law and add strength to the military power of the nations will be created and if the aims of the righteous power party to unify the world give every human tribe sovereignty and end censorship of the media and if the arguments the righteous power party has against modern muslim jihad and racism are heeded the massive resources used for military can be redirected to public protection and service and ninety per cent 90 of global armies will be converted into public defence forces with global military scaledown these public defence forces will be massive forces as large as is needed for public defence in national cities coasts and countrysides these forces securing and sectioning areas with checkpoints security scanners cctv systems and sniffer dogs monitoring what goods move through internal area divisions within nation and through nations borders preventing dangerous goods and dangerous people moving into or inside nation complete lockdown on illegal movements effectively ending crime and harm public defence forces will search any area within nation if under suspicion to eliminate the threat from guns bombs dangerous weapons illegal health harming drugs and other illicit materials and will seize them they will find and save any falsely imprisoned people within nation and they will protect the public public defence forces will also perform peacekeeping function preventing war in volatile nations useful policing training and military training will be gained by the public defence forces so they can handle themselves against any force global guard setup for the strength of the nations protecting the nations from military terrorist and criminal threats all potentially harmful goods and chemicals produced on this planet will also be put under guard and those who order them will be tested and examined and the food industry will be protected and secured the present forces of law are globally under funded in number and cant halt the continuous wave of crime upon the nations righteous power party funding into public defence forces with their possible massive number will halt crime completely when complimenting police forces the public completely safe and prisons emptying over time with crime made impossible giving unrestricted powers in creating system to identify the legality of all monies preventing and recouping corruption and seizing illegal monies from criminal industry ending crime corruption has undermined the strength and service of many nations throughout history this has lessened in modern times but is still prevalent the righteous power party will employ the preventative systems on corruption that current economies employ will create an anticorruption taskforce and will put in place system that certifies the legality of all monies with all other monies placed under suspicion and investigated complete knowledge of all monies by the law will protect society from crime and improve government efficiency and service the righteous power party will employ an army of investigators to do this and implement standard banking practice that identifies the source of all lodgments these investigators monitoring and identifying the nature of all monies and seizing illegal monies the monies the result of past corruption being recouped and future corruption prevented and also the criminal monies from the drugs industries the sex industries the criminal arms trade the humantrafficking industries and the slave industries can be identified with the system of certifying all monies and seized putting these evil industries out of commission and protecting would be victims of criminal industry abortion abolition and providing for unwanted children and orphans abortion of developed humans beyond cellular existence is to be made obsolete and illegal people talk of the womans rights and freedoms and people talk of the infant childs rights and future freedoms we need to compare these rights and decide on the right to live for both against the right to live for one the time for the right to choose has passed for the mother after the baby has formed the death of infant children in the womb will cease with laws in place against abortion and with government services providing and caring for unwanted children after birth it is wrong and evil for the infant child to be murdered in hisher halfsleep and even if the child is the product of rape the child must live on the family suffering less with the child living on if they have any heart abortion will be made illegal globally and services will be provided for unwanted childrens welfare when the parent doesnt feel able to better care for the child or doesnt want to the nation will provide services for these orphan children such as mansionesque housing schooling and living expenses with carers until the child reaches maturity and becomes self sufficient protecting families from domestic abuse united nations population fund study says domestic violence has occurred or does occur in every global nation to different degrees ranging from ten to seventy per cent 10 70 of national populations where this does occur in most cases domestic violence is not reported as victims have alternative to or ways to escape the traumatic situations they are put into public owned economies can afford to give help to victims of domestic violence in the form of mansionesque boarding housing living allowances and protection in the form of twentyfour hour 24hr public defence guards and escorts making it so they can escape and be independent from households where there is violence raping or psychologically condescending behavior many individuals within family are trapped into domestic situations without the finances and qualifications to live independently if family life becomes unlivable with the services offered by the righteous power party and with safety and protection assured for the victimized family members the chances of the crime being reported and the victims of domestic violence escaping traumatic situations increases the people who undermined the sanctity of the pastvictims will never have access to the past victims again if that is the wishes of the past victims the harmer of the pastvictims will be persecuted if that is the wishes of the past victims and the pastvictims life will become livable once again laws and actions against forced marriage mistreatment of females hinduism and cultures of discrimination bride price in hindu religion is an amount of money property or wealth paid to the parents of female for the right to marry their daughter bride price is received by parents who send their children off to be married rather than willing union between man and woman marriage in hindu religion becomes transaction between families in many cases pre teen girls and older women are decided upon to marry older men the families and men who arrange for young girls and women to marry older men are sick depraved paedophilic and evil there has been cases brought to attention by the new york times of nine year old girls and eleven year old girls being forced to marry older men over forty that benefits the girls family and evil opportunistic older men the girls wishes are not considered little girls and young women are enslaved and lose their choice of consent they are put under pressure from their own families to not speak out or alert the authorities to their own predicament according to the united nations childrens fund unicef fifty million 50000000 females have died in india in recent times as result of female discrimination in religion and way of life with financial inequality towards females with both loss of family wealth with the marriage of female as is more common with less employment opportunities for women and with the murder of wives when their husband dies giving families the husbands inheritance instead of his wife this gender discrimination results in abortion infanticide and murder of females wrongful actions will longer hide behind the term religion when they are antihuman religion must revere the human or be made illegal and eradicated it is shameful that powerful group has put in place measures that protect our neighbours children and women from these evils that the authorities havent stamped out these practices is disgrace we will enact laws against hindu practice or against hinduism itself to protect the worlds children and vulnerable women from the abuses of human rights and dignity that this religion is guilty of suicide cults that brainwash their followers to their death are already criminalized and in the same way the hindu religion will also be criminalized with national conversions to the righteous power party the authorities will track down enslaved young girls and women and liberate them providing care education and housing to liberated girls and women and their children and the perpetrators of these crimes the females and husbands families and the females forced husbands will be punished with arrests and jailing or fines gender preference also leads to the abortion of millions of female infants in many other cultures anywhere where females are not treated equal females will be given equal status to males in every area of society enforced by law and those responsible for mistreatment of females will be persecuted equality will save millions of females lives in many nations from the day its established onwards the forces of law to be correctional integrating the criminal instilling nobility within the prisoner and execution to be abolished the law courts destroy the lives of not only the criminal but also the criminals family sometimes beyond repair when they jail the criminal righteous power party policy will be governed to correct and nurture the life not destroy the life of the criminal and hisher family the justice system is right to punish the criminal this shows the wrongness of crime and makes crime negative risky gamble for the would be criminal deterring crime the justice system also protects the people from criminal acts upon them but the justice system should do more to change the criminal to instill nobility and values upon the criminal and to set the criminal for success after release from prison with change nobility and values instilled upon the criminal safer society is made nobility values and opportunities are the enemies of every criminal act and should be promoted with work training and rights to family and friends for the prisoner rights to visitation from friends and family are already available in most prisons but once year all criminals should be released to stay with family and friends in their homes this will expose the prisoner to the richness of life and motivate himher to be successful in life upon hisher final release but psychological testing is needed upon dayleave weekendleave and weekleave prisoners to ensure they dont commit crimes upon their release and that they are prepared to return to prison also work should be assigned to every prisoner working environment within the prisons will also instill nobility and values upon the prisoner under righteous power party policy prisons around the world will add manufacturing factories to them and not only be places of confinement it is criminal in its effects the policy of solitary confinement with work prisoners waste away and are unable to cope with and unsuited to the working world after release working within prisons will make the justice system more successful at reforming the prisoner as opposed to the system of neglect that is currently employed with many offenders recommitting being lazy and unreformed under present prison policy with manufacturing factories within prisons prisons also have the capability of paying for their keep and not be massive cost negatively to the nations prisons globally will become correctional and reforming institutes enforcing moral ethics classes job qualification programs and heavy work changing the basis of the criminals antisocial views and integrating the criminal back into society this will save the public from the exprisoner recommitting its the governments responsibility to do all it can to protect the health and safety of the public and this is achieved by reforming and integrating the criminal not solely punishing the criminal prison conditions globally will also be improved to standard livable and dignified level also execution of the criminal will be abolished under righteous power party policy execution is wrong when the criminal is capable of change and the system is capable of changing the criminal we need to guide the lost souls of the criminals not condemn them justice must be right and execution must be abolished in every righteous power party nation drug rehabilitation and treatment services to be made freely available to those who cant afford it drug rehabilitation and treatment services and rehabilitation retreats will be made freely available for all peoples who cant afford it there are some neglectful nations that dont offer free drug treatment to those who cant afford it universally this will be made available to those who cant afford private treatment in every righteous power party nation many families are ruined financially physically and spiritually by health destroying and willpower controlling drugs if drugs become problem for people and they cant afford to get treatment free addiction treatment services and retreats will be made freely available to save and repair lives and families democratic tribal sovereignty territorial disputes and desire for sovereignty amongst numerous populations has been the reason for many violent conflicts and actions throughout the ages the righteous power party proposes lasting resolution to these disputes called democratic tribal sovereignty democratic tribal sovereignty involves nations people voting for what country they would like to belong these votes deciding which state the voter should pay taxes to and consequently the state provides services such as policing defence health services schooling electricity water transport and telecom to their newly declared citizens where there is mix of sovereignty declared in an area the declared for states involved will share expenses to provide the areas people with services according to percentage of the population that belongs to each state not only will democratic tribal sovereignty give happiness to those populations looking to realign their sovereignty it will also end the reasoning and tribal grasps for power that causes the occurrence of war terrorism famine and genocide from the time of declared sovereignties onwards with many marginalized tribal populations neglected and mistreated when they are minority in nation and with war terrorism famine and genocide threat upon public lives the righteous power party calls for democratic tribal sovereignty to be enforced immediately under world law with political movement and if that fails through the strength of military the suffering peoples of censorship of the media nations to be liberated huge cause for concern is the censorship of the media by tyrannical governments and genocidal regimes governments that censor the media suppress the suffering voice of their own people to hold on to power limiting knowledge and lies has allowed genocide torture war terrorism and slavery to go on within nations unchallenged and famine to happen without humanitarian assistance the limiting of the media and subsequent lies has also allowed regimes such as hitlers and husseins to be maintained and served during years of tyranny murder and neglect people have right to know how their distant neighbours welfare is and people have right to protect their neighbour near or far if they are endangered these rights are denied with censorship of the media by tyrant nations we must ensure the voice of every people with freedom of the media and put down those who prevent it governments that dont allow freedom of the media will be made illegal under righteous power party policy censorship of the media is then to end with better existence propaganda and revolution within nations supported by military action to liberate populations who are at present ruled by and suffering due to tyranny the righteous power party offers the best political system for nation to convert to and will elect this new honourable powerful and humanitarian political way after the fall of tyrant nations showing the socalled modern muslim holy warjihad to be unholy and blasphemous the original muslin holy warjihad was conquest to spread their religion their perceived word and teachings from god killing people was not the message of the jihad promotion of religion of god was the revered god of the quran did not allow war on the christians or the jews who worshiped and still worship the same god as that of islam the holy warjihad that god ordered was war on the godless religion of the idols long after mohammed long after the revelations of the quran long after gods commands did muslims fight war against the christians of spain this war was against christian followers of the same god as that of islam and was not truly war for god it was not holy warjihad it was not ordered by god the original muslim holy warjihad was ordered by god it was war perceived wrongly to be for god and was wrongly called holy warjihad as many muslim conflicts have been since those who say that this war or that war is for god does not know if god approves of their war they are colouring humanities view of god with their beliefs of allegiance to god above others they have place to deliver testimony of gods will and are delivering blasphemy when declaring holy warjihad the modern muslim insurgency and terrorism is an example of this the insurgents and terrorists say they are fighting for god and that god favours their war they have place to say this these claims are false and are blasphemy also god has not shown he supports the insurgency and terrorism and yet the insurgentsterrorists claim god is on their side and is terrorist this blasphemy is an insult to our god and his name we cannot allow any longer the use of gods name as support for their violent cause we must protest and publicize against this terroristinsurgent blasphemy god and mohammed did not fight war against christians or jews these being followers of the same god of the revelations of the quran nonreligious even have sense and reverence for the god of jew christian and muslim and their followers in this modern enlightened age with the modern ability to easily learn languages and influence the media converting others to god with word and delivering gods universal teachings is the true path of the follower of the enlightening and proud god of jew christian and muslim he the raiser of the humanitarian spirit of all this the strongest teaching from religion of god and is antiterrorist what can be done with this enlightenment religiously on the subject of terrorism and war is turn the terrorists and insurgents against violence to use the exterroristsex insurgents knowledge to fight terrorism and socalled holy war and to speak out against terrorism war and violence publicizing and televising the view of those who have changed allegiance as propaganda to prevent terroristinsurgent belief and related atrocities and violence the delusion of different human races the concept of different races of humanity is false

heavily tanned semitanned and nontanned skin colour and also different regional looks are caused by different food diets molding general appearance over the generations this analysis shows that racial distinctions are more than references to regional genetic evolutionary coding affecting skin shading and appearance of the body humanity has different species but regional appearance differences of
