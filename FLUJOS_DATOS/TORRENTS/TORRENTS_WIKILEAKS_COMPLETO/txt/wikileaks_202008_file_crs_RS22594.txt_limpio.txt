developing appropriate bsa risk assessments another goal was to help ensure check cashers and other msbs have reasonable access to banking services concurrent with the 2005 guidance an advisory was issued addressing the bsa obligations of check cashers and outlining the documentation an msb may be expected to provide when establishing an account relationship at bank the advisory was issued as part of an ongoing campaign to inform msbs about their bsa requirements fincen has recognized that outreach to the msb industry is essential they found that many of the businesses especially the

assessment and monitoring required of them by the regulatory agencies remains burdensome and costly despite the 2005 guidance of particular concern is determining the delineation between low and high risk profiles and the corresponding due diligence expectations in addition bankers suggested that regulators should not expect banks monitoring activity to extend beyond the check cashing business to the activity of the check cashers customers they argue fincen should further clarify that banks are not expected to be facto regulators of check cashers by instituting system that more clearly defines the responsibility for oversight of the bsa obligations of check cashers and other msbs policy issues in march 2006 fincen news release17 acknowledged the ongoing concerns of both the banking industry and money service businesses relating to bsa regulations despite the previous steps taken including the april 2005 guidance to address the issues the difficulties involve how to minimize the resources and costs borne by financial institutions while ensuring the effective administration of the antiterrorism financing and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22594 antimoney laundering programs the news release announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking input on what additional guidance or regulatory action would be appropriate to address the ongoing concerns about check cashers and other msbs access to banking services the news release emphasized the important role of msbs and the negative effect on the health and safety of the us financial system if these businesses are driven underground comments received by fincen are under review and potential next steps are being considered on june 21 2006 the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit of the house committee on financial services held an oversight hearing on the bank secrecy acts impact on money services businesses there was general agreement that banks were reevaluating their businesses strategies in light of bsa due diligence costs there were reports of individual institutions concluding that opening and maintaining accounts for msbs did not make economic sense regulatory and supervisory adjustments were discussed as means of easing the burden on banks stronger state msb regulatory oversight was encouraged joint industrygovernment training on bsa obligations for banks bank examiners and msbs was suggested in addition fisca the trade association representing 6000 check cashing operations and nonbank financial service centers suggested the need for legislation that would remove state regulated check cashers from high risk categories in its view legislation could also limit administrative enforcement actions against banks that service check cashers in good faith 17 the
