during operation enduring fr eedom oef and operation iraqi freedom oif revealed that forward operations bases face an increased threat posed by asymmetric forces consequently the di rector operational testing and evaluation dote authorized joint forward operat ions base jfob quick reaction test qrt this qrt under the guidance of army test and evalua tion command and the joint chiefs of staff deputy directorate for antiterrorism and homeland defense j34 developed this jfob handbook with significan t assistance from us central command the aim of this handbook is to describe thos tactics techniques and procedures ttp and best practices suited to counter the ro cket artillery mortar ram and improvised explosive device ied threats to jfobs in iraq the objective is to reduce the casualty rate during combat operations this handbook provides quickreference guide for systematic approach to planning developing and improving jfob defensive capabilities the handbook is linked to the current evolution of forward operations base s by design and can be located on the joint staff antiterrorism enterprise portal atep for access by users the handbook is also available on cd and limited hard copy the jfob handbook is designed to be quick look reference and is broken into major subject areas to facilitate use the series of chapters is listed on the back of the book with corresponding black

of appendixes ii for official use onlypreface scope this publication addresses force protect ion fp at joint forward operations bases jfobs in the iraq theater of ope rations the focus is on defense against rockets artillery and mortars rams and vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbieds it describes how dversary and friendly courses of action coas are evaluated and implemente d to support the jfob commanders decision making process this publication is geared primarily towards engineer and fp specialists to assist with operati onal level fp planning it also addresses best practices for defe ating rams and vbieds purpose this publication has been prepared unde r the direction of the office of the secretary of defense as result of quick reaction test program series of best practices for jfob defense emerged from current doctrine joint tactics techniques and procedures jttps and curr ent practices in theater it provides recommendations for the exercise of fp by combatant commanders and other jfob commanders for jfob defense it provides military guidance for use by the armed forces in preparing their appropriate plans it is not the intent of this publication to restrict the authority of commanders from organizing the force and executing the mission in manner inconsistent with established plans and operations application this publication is compilation of the latest joint and service doctrine it includes tactics techniques and pr ocedures ttps available from the combined force land component co mmand cflcc and multinational corpsiraq mnci units that have been or are currently serving in the iraq theater of operations it also contains the best validated blast mitigation materials and designs from various depart ment of defense dod laboratories the guidance in this publication is not necessarily authoritative however many of the practices that result from this osd qrt may be incorporated into future doctrine or ttps the contents of service publications will take precedence for the activities of joint for ces unless the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff normally in coordination with the other members of the joint chiefs of staff has provided more curre nt and specific guidance commanders of forces operating as part of multina tional alliance or coalition military command should follow multinational doctrin and procedures ratified

sovereignty negotiations have been required between the interim iraqi government iig and coalition forces for use of terrain for joint forward operations bases jfobs status of forces agreement sofa is being developed at th is time much of the land currently used for jfobs belongs to the iig and consists of former military and government sites some land however does belong to local governments and individuals corps of ngineers real estate teams crests are the us governments real estate ag ents and acquire required real estate in most instances units w ill occupy jfobs that are mature and master planning will be complete jfobs will remain dyna mic as coalition forces and threats continue to change the latest master planning informati on is found in mnci operations order 0502 some cha nges are planned and some are not currently there is strategy to cons olidate jfobs in all instances consolidation will increase vulnerabili ty and force protection fp personnel must remain vigilant agains t overconsolidation on terrain the jfob maintains and sustains the force while providing an island of relative security for service members to rest rearm and refit in operation iraqi freedom oif the jfob has been target of harassment by anticoalition and antiiraqi forces aif the dominant tactics used to harass coalition forces and disrupt operations have been rockets artillery mortars for official use only 11rams and improvised explosive devices ieds that are either vehicle or manpack delivered key concerns of tenant involvement in oif have been tr aining rehearsals coordination and competing requiremen ts between the security mission and other operational tasks commanders re main concerned about friendlyfire incidents and accidental discharges at entry control points ecps and in periods of heightened alert with spectators gathering in areas of recent attacks where they impede incident responders and create additional targets see figure 11 tenant force pr otection

defense dod developed global defense posture it redefined basing for dod to align with us defense strategic objectives us central command uscentcom regulation 4151 describes these categories of bases this handbook only highlights conti ngency basing as it relates to iraq we acknowledge the concepts of global defense structure as it deals with strategy and the planning programming and budgeting execution system ppbes but for simplicity and consiste ncy we will refer to all bases currently in iraq as jfobs basing categories basing falls into one of two categories permanent or contingency permanent basing is associated with longterm stra tegic force stationing while contingency basing is associated with shortterm contingency operations specific locations and sizes of these bases are determined during the course of the contingency operation permanent basing the basing of forces is dictated by the guidance published by the secretary of defense in the integrated global presence and basing strategy igpbs bases included in the igpbs are at those locations where the jfob force protection handbook final draft 12 for official use onlyus is expected to have long term presence or at ke locations within the area of responsibility aor where there is possible need to rapidly expand sites contingency operation bases cob contingency base is usually occupied by an element larger than unit of action ua size from single service or joint services its purpose is typically command and control hub andor regional logistics hub characterized by advanced infrastructure for facilities and communications for the expected durati on of the operationexercise cob may include an airfield capable of c130 or larger aircraft contingency operation sites cos contingency site is usually occupied by ua size element or smaller capab of providing local and regional operations security andor humanitarian assistance relief the site size and capabilities are scalable to support rota tion of forces or prolonged contingency operations it is characterized by limited infrastructure and may be dependent on some contracted services contingency operation locations col contingency location is usually occupied by battalionsized element capable of quick response to operations security civic assistance or humanitari an assistance relief col will be dependent upon cos or cob fo r logistical support

command and control functions of jfobs jfobs can be located in urban or rural ar eas on former iraqi bases in former palace complexes on former religious s ites at critical points on main supply routes msrs or on rivers jfobs can be single service multiservice or coalition to include shared jfobs with the new iraqi army jfobs support myriad of missions th following section describes many of those missions with brief description of the types of activiti that will be conducted within the jfob as well as the t ypes of assets that could be available to assist in fp operational support overwatch this jfob is used to provide elements that can respond to incidents and provide stability and suppor t operations saso in given area of operations the mission can range from civil military support with small force to major interface with the local or regional government the base is operationally oriented usually short lived and austere in construction maximum use of existing facilities is encouraged local control this jfob is dedicated to inte rface with the local government in support of transition to iraqi control it provides support to security and reconstruction efforts in local area and usually provides mixture of command and control and the base defense system for official use only 15operational and support capability that in terfaces with the cal population this base may also be shared coalitioniraqi forces base regional control this jfob is similar to local control base but supports regional government regional in frastructure and security strategic overwatch these major jfobs work at the state level to execute overarching security programs to include stand up of police and army forces they interface with senior government offi cials and are prime targets due to the highlevel personnel operating in and around them these jfobs are of the most durable construction and have th highest level of security command and control these jfobs contain brig ade division or corps command elements they are usually located in former palace or military compounds near major centers of gravity for the operation these jfobs contain robust fp and have augmente d security forces due to the high percentage of support personnel operating there river crossing control point these jfobs are designed to protect key water crossings and are usually placed where military fixed or float bridge has been used to create temporary crossing nd chokepoint has resulted these areas are extremely vulnerable to indirect fire or vbieds as traffic can back up and usually there is little time to do effective screening prior to crossing currently these areas are offlimits to most civili an traffic but as the nation of iraq continues to gain control of its own secu rity more civilian traffic will become mixed with military convoys traffic control point these jfobs are offensive in nature and combat oriented they are usually temporarily placed in support of shaping operations and are becoming jointly run or controll ed by iraqi forces they are prime targets of aif and must be constructed with adequate overwatch and the ability to withstand effects of larger vbieds cea ammunition storage areas these jfobs are associated with the former captured enemy ammunition c ea program and current unexploded ordnance uxo program these jfobs are used to secure hold turn over and destroy former regime ammunition that is either unserviceable or is to be used by iraqi security forces they are usually formed around the ammunition storage areas and many are lightly guarded thes areas are constantly pilfered by aif for materials to be used in ieds or for indirect fire munitions detainee operations these jfobs are used to house detainees awaiting release interrogation or turn over to iraqi control they are run as law enforcement and intelligence bases under the direction of the deputy commanding general for detention at the force level they are heavily fortified and isolated from friendly force operations insurgents target these jfobs for media attention they can become symbolic targets for attack temporary support to kinetic op selectionsspecial events these are temporary jfobs established to consolidat forces for special events elections or kinetic operations usually these jfob s are established for specific event and then dismantled after the event so metimes these jfobs are warm bases in areas that will continue to occasionally require temporarily increased numbers of forces jfob force protection handbook final draft 16 for official use onlymultinational security transition corpsiraq mnstci the mnstci jfobs are established to provide for the training and handover of security operations to iraqi army iraqi national guard and iraqi police these jfobs are built and occupied by us and coalition forces as the iraqi forces are trained and take over the security mission the bases are turned over to them for operation centers logistics support general support gs hub ground this jfob supports joint theater distribution and sustainment it is nor mally commanded by the senior logistics commander and usually requires augmented security forces due to the size of the facility and relatively light firepower of the units that occupy it it is normally considered favorite target for asymmetric threats because of its perceived vulnerability it has large numbers of critical assets to be isolated and protected and requires large amount of engineer support to harden and protect it is usually embedded in the division battle space but is usually corps asset gs hub air this jfob is quite similar to the ground jfob with the added problem of needing protection from shoulderfired weapons which makes control of additional terrain necessary fp requirement coordination with the terrain manager is vital to provide ad equate defense against shoulderfired weapons such as rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and manportable air defense manpads protection rest overnight these jfobs are placed along supply and sustainment routes to provide secure rest areas for convoys and combat patrols traveling through the battlespace they have cadre force to maintain the facilities and protect the area high volumes of traffic create compressed targets and increase the likelihood that vehicleborne improvise d explosive devices vbieds may breach the facility extra care must be take n to assure vehicles are screened and quarantined if they are not under consta nt surveillance of convoy escorts refuel on the move these jfobs are temporary rest stops for convoys to refuel and move on they are usually only lightly defended and convoys must provide selfprotection issu at these sites are the increased vulnerability of convoys to indirect fire weapons and snip ers since most are usually protected by wire also local vendors encroach into the area to sell to convoys and can approach vehicles close enough to detonate manpacked ied relay points these austere jfobs are placed along the msrs to provide safe havens in case of convoy br eak downs or emergencies as well as retransmission capability for fm radios they are small and dispersed and contain small numbers of cadre personnel they are ma inly in the southern area of iraq and receive mainly harassing attacks they have bermed sides and heavily defended access points they are also capable of mutual reinforcement when required ammunition holding areas these coalition areas used to store friendly force ammunition are heavily fortif ied and isolated they are designed and built to ammunition safety requirements issues here include protection from indirect fire weapons that could create sympat hetic detonation of the stockpiles command and control and the base defense system for official use only 17power projection these are intermediate staging bases located outside the area of operations and are currently in kuwait and qatar they project forces into the aor and provide necessary support for the current operation these are usually large areas with high concentrations pe ople and equipment that are under the control of cencom and have their ow n mixture of milita ry and contract security these areas are much more vulne rable to vbieds than indirect fire weapons and are normally protected by fe nces berms and fortified barriers conclusion understanding the c2 relationship for fp of jf obs early is critical to the staff in establishing successful program this is key operational task that requires full commitment of resources and great deal of synchroni zation to assure it does not conflict with mission tasks engage the commander early and often and seek full participation of the entire staff to assure success resources the

protection annex to the deployment op ord using the mdmp there is also time to prepare and rehearse execution of this mission as part of the pre deployment preparation and tr aining prior to execution jfob force protection handbook final draft 22 for official use onlyplanning focus areas fifteen specific focus areas have been identified to support successful pre deployment planning for jfob force protecti on in support of oif these are complying with mnci oplan 0502 this is the comprehensive effects based plan that includes the theater basing master plan as it supports the commanders desired end state for oif this document is available on the multinational corpsiraq mnci sipr site and is the first document you should read as you plan the mission integration of the master plan this is the comprehensive plan that drives basing evolution in oif it is conditi onbased but sequentially programmed for consolidating bases from local overwatch to regiona l overwatch and strategic overwatch fp is driven by this plan and includes evolution from austere to containerize to concrete struct ures in some areas this plan is critical subset of the fp plan and will include installation property critical equipment communication systems sensors and class iv barrier materials that must be accounted for in your planning developing continuity of operatio ns aka coop plan aka battlebook this is the electronic file cabinet andor physical notebook that will be used to consolidate all resources contact info rmation plans sketches and other information as you perform mission analysis and develop forces and strategies to accomplish the fp mission devel opment of this resource during pre deployment enhances communication cooperation and transition between deploying and redeploying forces it minimizes turmoil and expedites the transition of authority for fp finding information operation iraqi freedom is mature operation with numerous websites for research and co llaboration an initial part of research will include accessing the mnci usce ntcom and doctrinal lessonslearned sites development of web resources reference is highly encouraged while most information resides on sipr sites large amount of information is available from open sources establishing relationships as soon as possible you should contact your counterpart at the site where you are deploying and establ ish communication plan develop your list of information requirements and pass these forward to begin populating your continuity of operations plan establishing communication with other units that will deploy as part of your rotation is just as important also exchange any speci fics regarding commanders intent or mission change that may affect transition of authority training and tools integration the fp and security engineering areas are being rapidly overwhelmed by technologi and software tools that require special training or skills to be develope d prior to mobilization identify these

mission analysis 1 on 19 march 2003 the united st ates and its coalition partners began operation iraqi freedom oif the multinational effort to liberate the people of iraq from the oppressive regime of saddam hussein after nearly dozen years of husseins non compliance with security council resolutions the us led coalition after months of di plomatic solutions failed the coalition fought to achieve these specific aims find and eliminate iraqs w eapons of mass destruction wmd b capture terrorists and disestabl ish suspected terrorist cells c secure iraqi oil fields and offshore oil

although the military action co ncluded quickly insurgent forces moved in attempting to fill power vacuum created by the dismantling of the saddam husse in regime the resulting violence against coalition forc was initially focused on disrupting transition work emba rrassing the united states and destroying the coalition since the iraqi nationa l elections of 30 january 2005 more iraqis hav been killed than coalition service members 3 political and economic stabilit in postsaddam hussein iraq depends on government of all peoples of presentday iraq the transition to political plur alism is not easy because iraqis lived more than three decades under saddam husseins one party dictatorial system coalitio n forces must ensure peaceful jfob threat analysis for official use only 35means for political parties to coexist with respect to their differences this political plural ism which is one of the most elementary foundations of democracy is process that requires time to shape the aim of the tr ansfer of power from the us and coalition administration to the newly formed iraqi government is progressive sh ift of power together with the consolidation of new iraqi political institutions 4 the coalition mission remains to organize train equip and mentor iraqi security forces in order to support iraqs ultimate goal of unified stab and democratic iraq the end state of the new iraqi government is one which provides representative government for the iraqi people is underpinned by new and protected freedoms for all iraqis and growing market economy and is able to defend itself and not pose threat to the region the coalit ion will continue to transition responsibilities to iraqi security forces until the leadership and loyalty of the iraqi security forc are sufficient enough to take on the insurgency and ultimately defeat it without the coalition presence b battlespace boundaries 1 iraq is located in the middle east bordering the persian gulf between iran and kuwait the total area is 437072 sq km land 432162 sq km water 4910 sq km roughly twice the size of the state of idaho iraq is within the united states central command uscentcom area of responsibility aor 2 iraq land boundaries total 3650 km land boundaries along its border countries are iran 1458 km jordan 181 km kuwait 240 km saudi arabia 814 km syria 605 km and turkey 352 km iraqs coastline is 58 km with 12 nm of territorial sea 3 the iraqi terrain is mostly broad plains there are reedy marshes along the iranian border in the south with large flooded areas and mountains ong the borders with iran and turkey the lowest point is the persian gu lf 0 m elevation the highest point is an unnamed peak 3611 m elevation other notable peaks are gundah zhur 3607 m elevation and kuhe hajji ebrahim 3595 m elevation t he most significant natural hazards are dust storms sandstorms and floods 2 the battlespace effects weather and climate the iraqi climate is mostly desert with mild to cool winters and dry hot cloudless summers the northern mountainous regions along the iranian and turkish borders experience cold winters with occasi onally heavy snows that melt in early spring sometimes causing ex tensive flooding in central and southern iraq jfob force protection handbook final draft 36 for official use only1 the extremely hot dry clear summer months last from may through october daytime temperatures range from 2229 c 7284 f to 3743 c 100110 f maximum summer daytime temperatures can exceed 46 c 115 f temperatures are cooler in the northeast highl ands the summer months also feature strong winds and sandst orms baghdad averages five dust storms month during july during the winter the mean minimum temperatures range fr om near freezing to near 5 c 41f daily maximum temperatures rise to around 17c 64f however temperatures are colder in the highlands 2 ninety percent of rain falls between november and april most of that falls between december and march the remaining six months particularly june through august are dry precipitation is highest in the northeast high lands which receives 760 to 1000 mm 30 to 40 in of rain and sometimes snow annually mean annual rainfall ranges between 100 and 170 mm 4 to 7 in elsewhere in the country 3 the summer months also feature two types of wind the southerly and southeasterly sharqi is dry dusty wind with occasional gusts of 80 kmhr that occurs from april to early june and again from late september through november from mid june to midseptember the prevailing wind is called the shamal it is steady wind that blows from the north and northeast the arid air brought by the shamal allows the sun to heat the land surface but the constant breeze has some cooling effect b terrain within the iraq area of operation ao there are two dominating battlespace environments the desert and the urban area each environment has unique effects 1 desert environments are arid r egions usually partly covered by sand having scant vegetation an annual rainfall of 250 mm 10 in or less and extreme temperature ranges precautions must be taken to protect individuals and equipment personnel effects the desert is not pristine environment diseases commonly found in sert environment include plague typhus malaria dysent ery cholera and typhoid potable water is the most basic need in the desert in desert terrain service members need approximately 9 quarts of water each day it is important to separate drinking and nondrin king water drinking any water from an untested source is dangerous and will likely cause illness because of water shortages sanitation and personal hygiene are often difficu lt to maintain in arid regions if neglected sanitati on and hygiene problems may cripple entire units heat illnesses are common in desert environments psychologically the monotony of the desert its emptiness and the fear of isolation c an eventually affect jfob threat analysis for official use only 37personnel the relatively constant climatic conditions add to this monotony and boredom lowers morale b equipment effects the extreme condit ions in an arid environment can damage militar equipment and facilities temperature and dryness are ma jor causes of equipment failure and wind action lifts and spreads sand and dust clogging and jamming anything that has moving parts vehicles aircraft sensors and weapons are all affected rubber components such as gaskets and seals become brittle and oil leaks are more frequent the desert takes particularly heavy toll on tires modern forces rely heavily on the electronics in computer s radios sensors and weapon systems the intense he at of the desert adds to the inherent heat that electrical equipment generates heat must be considered with resp ect to weapon effectiveness as well besides heat dust and sand are very serious impediments to the efficient f unctioning of equipment in the desert dust adversely affects communications equipment such as amplifiers and radio teletype sets the winds blow sand into engines fuel and moving parts of weapons which can reduce equipment lif by up to 80 percent the sandblasting also affects optic glass and windshields as sand particles can scratch the surface damaging the equipment c combat operations effects the key to success in desert operations is mobility traffi cability and crosscountry movement are critical to tactics in the desert trafficability is generally good in the desert but it cannot be assumed salt marshes wadis shifting sand andor rocky areas can render some areas unsuitable given ample fuel and water however areas can be circumvented because of the loose surface material movement c an easily be detected by the sand and dust kicked up to av oid detection movement at night is an option dust is st ill problem but temperatures are cooler and the element of surprise is not necessarily lost logistical support is more critical in arid regions because of the few manmade f eatures and the lack of resources available from t he terrain logistics weighs heavily on desert operations bu t it must not dictate the plan 2 urban environments pose enormous difficulties for planning and conducting military operations the heightened risk of collateral damage during operations in urban environments partially offsets us technological superiority and provides adversaries with expanded opportunities to ex ploit us military doctrine consequently urban combat opti ons available to planners and leaders are generally more restri ctive international law and jfob force protection handbook final draft 38 for official use onlyselfimposed political constrai nts also severely restrict maneuver options the densities of both people and buildings in urban areas create familiar operational difficulties for deployed force structures and public works infr astructure inhibit maneuver and firepower open and close fiel ds of fire and severely degrade command and control c2 capabilities urban residents create conditions for restrictive rules of engagement increase stress on service members and logistics capabilities and confuse threat identification the nature of builtup areas them selves changes over time the effects of rubble popul ation movements and the psychological strain on service members that operate within an area dense with informa tion and decision points degrade situational awareness and affect morale and decisionmaking capabilities b urban populations are composed of many groups and subgroups each group has its own needs interests intentions and capabi lities relationships that exist among groups might play critical ro in operations cultural differences can strain relati ons between the friendly force and the resident populati on if not derstood and appreciated people going about their daily routines can unwittingly hamper friendly objectives c urban population groups and subgroups increase the number of elements to be i dentified and assessed as potential threats to th friendly force they also increase the number of potential groups able to assist the friendly force the presence of noncombatants can escalate tactical actions to episodes of strategic importance current doctrine often engenders an usversusthem mentality that might create gaps in intelligence and barriers to complete analysis c sociopolitical 1 the coalition provisional authority transferred sovereignty to the iraqi interim government iig in june 2004 the election of its president ghazi alujayl alyawr was held in january 2005 2 population demographics iraq has population of approx imately 25 million based on july 2003 estimates the majori ty 75 percent of iraqis are arabs though there is siza ble kurdish minority that comprises 20 percent of the population the remaining 5 percent is comprised of turkmen assyria n and others the arab population is split betw een the shia majority in the south and the sunni who live mostly in the central part jfob threat analysis for official use only 39of the country around baghdad arab shiites are currently the majority in iraq compri sing between 55 to 60 percent of the population sunni kurds are estimated to comprise 20 percent and arab sunnis 15 to 20 percent of the total population the shia have been traditionally persecuted by the sunni b the kurds form majority in the north and northwest of the country where they were forced to settle due to economic constraints and border crossing restrictions most are herdsmen and farmers though m any have moved to the cities particularly mosul kirkuk and sulaymaniyah the kurds are divided into three separate groups these groups inability to reconcile their differences prevented them from presenting unifi ed front to both saddam and the world c two arab groups have not been assimilated into the population the marsh arabs who inhabited the lower delta of the tigris and euph rates rivers until the iraqi government drained 90 percent of the marsh area have fled to iran the second group is small bedouin population who wander the des ert regions seventyfive percent of the population lives in the flood plains that make up only 25 percent of the total land area nearly 70 percent of the people live in urban c enters with baghdad being the largest city 3 religion islam is the state religion of iraq about 97 percent of the population belongs to either t he shia 60 percent or the sunni 37 percent sect the bettereducated sunni have traditionally dominated the gov ernment since 1958 most members of the government hav been sunni the kurds are also sunni but their religious practices differ from those of the arabs the islamic religion is based on the submission to the will of god allah and governs ev erything from politics to crime and punishment to morality in daily life the koran and sunnah are the two basic sources of islamic teachings although iraq is cular country the traditional islamic culture predominates wi th koranic law playing an active role in the daytoday life in the country b the islamic year is based on the lunar cycle consisting of twelve months of 29 or 30 days each totaling 353 or 354 days each new month begins at the sighting of new moon the islamic hijri calendar is usually abbreviated ah in western languages from t he latinized anno hegirae muharram 1 1 ah corresponds to 16 july 622 ce common era the hijrah which chronicles the migration of the prophet muhammad from mecca to jfob force protection handbook final draft 310 for official use onlymedina in 622 ad is early isla ms central historical event to muslims the hijri calendar is not just sentimental system of time reckoning for dating important religious events eg hajj pilgrimage to mecca it has profound religious and historical significance 3 evaluation of the adversaries composition forces in iraq face terrorist adversary using guerrilla style lowintensity tact ics the terrorist opposition is probably made up of the following types of individuals and groups or has attracted similar individuals 1 remnants of military forces still loyal to saddam hussein 2 remnants of the baath party 3 sunni muslims loyal to saddam hussein 4 disgruntled iraqi citizens who have lost patience with the usled coalition 5 qaeda and other voluntary rroristtype forces that have crossed over into iraq to liber ate the country from coalition forces b tactics the term jihad is often used in reference to osama bin laden and related followers they c onsider the terrorism that they perpetuate jihad the word jihad means struggle in arabic this means struggle between the forces of allah good and the forces of evil some examples not all inclusive 1 in august 2003 the jordanian embassy in baghdad was bombed with 11 people killed 2 terrorist bomb destroyed

use of explosives alone or in combination with chemic biological or radiological cbr materials ieds can ut ilize commercial military or homemade explosives or m ilitary ordnance and ordnance components ieds fall into three categories package ieds usually consist of mortar and artillery projectiles as the explosiv device the most common explosives used are military munitions usually 120mm or greater mortar tank or artillery munitions b vehicleborne ieds vbied s are devices that use vehicle as the device package or container and delivery mechanism vbieds use large amounts of explosives from 100 to over 1000 lb lim ited only by the size of the vehicle the explosive charge has included items like mortar rounds rocket motors and warheads artillery rounds and plastic explosives vbied suicide bombs employ the same methods and characteristics of other package or vehicle bombs that use command detonation firing system c suicide bomb ied presents difficult threat for service members the aim of the bomber is not to commit suicide but to kill or injure as many other service members and civilians as possible per sonborne suicide bomb usually employs highexplosive and uses switch or

adversary groups in iraq in all cases the objectives ar to retain control in iraq and to destroy damage or impede coalition forces attempts to enforce democratic processes in iraq 1 frls want to retain psychol ogical dominance over the iraqi populace attacks against coalition forces driven by sense of revenge against americans are s een as an arab victory the desired end state is retu rn to power and influence 2 religious fundamentalist cells foreign fighters and iranian insurgents initially looked to establish safe havens capable of survival their goals are to infl uence the frustrated populace kill americans fight the jihad hol war and kill americans the desired end state is expu lsion of infidels from middle eastholy land 3 ethnic infighting and viol ence are characterized by demonstrations protests tribal territorial and economic disputes and disputes over re ligious tolerance and minority rights groups typically suffer from real or perceived political power imbalance with feeling of disenfranchisement by their populations ethnic issues are hi storically embedded and very divisive desired end states are usually one group displacing the other 4 adversary terrorist tactics app ear to be shifting away from coalition forces and toward the iraqi populace some examples not all inclusive previously most of the targets had been us personnel and officials associated directly with us reconstruction efforts since late october 2003 more iraqi citizens appear to be targeted b the suicide bombing of an itali an police base in nasiriyah in november 2003 may also signal that terrorist forces jfob threat analysis for official use only 319have shifted their attacks to regions located outside the capital c the murder of japanese di plomats and spanish civilians working in iraq appears to in dicate that terrorists are targeting allied personnel in an effort to discourage coalition countries from sending support to us forces in iraq b courses of action 1 coa 1 improvised d estructive devices adversary forces gain residence on coalition base camps and facilities as employees of contractor company the adversary cell then obtains gasoline dies propane chlorine or other hazardous materials the materials are fashioned into weapons and transported to highvalue target hvt the device is then deployed or detonated against the population 2 coa 2 smuggled explosives adversary forces enter coalition base camps and facilities while employed as police service iraqi national guard or local nationals lns with an appropriate escort insurgents dr op explosive materials at predetermined location while c onducting business within the facility another adversary working or living on the base recovers the explosive material nd incorporates it into an ied the ied is then delivered to preselected hvt where it is detonated causing deat h andor damage to coalition forces or materiel 3 coa 3 stolen or salvaged explosives an adversary cell living or working on an installation steals or salvages explosives from poorly guarded facilities or agencies using their jobs to gain knowledge of hvts the adve rsaries select target an ied device is built in an object which is placed on the hvt the device is detonated either by timer or by radio 4 coa 4 most dangerous any of the above coas with an added indirect fire attack or condary device placed to target first responders and cause maximum casualties c proven adversary tactics tec hniques and procedures ttp to date 1 luring or distracting servi ce members to commit attacks any distraction for example pregnant woman attempting to detonate car bomb close to che ckpoint is possible in one instance civilian vehicle pulled up to traffic control point and one of the occupants got out and asked for medic when the service member turned to call fo r medic the ci vilian pulled pistol and shot the service memb er demonstrations can also be used to carry out attacks adversary groups may utilize demonstrators to get close to c oalition forces attack and then jfob force protection handbook final draft 320 for official use onlyuse the demonstrators as hu man shields to avoid being targeted 2 using motorcycles iraqi paramilitary forc are possibly using motorcycles for transport motorcycles are used to move throughout cities easier than cars or trucks 3 using flares and other devices as warning signal one observed system uses red fl are to mean softskinned vehicle is in motionleaving jfob red flare followed by green flare means soft skinned vehicle is approaching an ambush pointkill zone if green flare alone is used then an armored vehicle is in motion leaving jfob other warning techniques include honking horn to warn of approaching patrols flashing lights on and off in continuous manner and whistle blowing 4 attacking convoys with rpgs from trucks members of adversary groups in small panel or pickup trucks attempt to get in and amongst coaliti on convoys and fire rpgs into coalition vehicle from the r ear of the truck 5 using ieds to ambush u s patrols on roadways adversaries use 155 mm artillery shells along with c4 explosives along major supply routes vbied attacks are also used 6 using mosques as safe havens for meetings planning and storing weapons mosques are being used not only as cover but also to buy and sell various types of weapons and possibly to make explosives adversary groups are also using locations near mosques for nightly meetings to plan coalition attacks weapons including mortars rp gs and machine guns are being kept in houses collocated with the mosques 7 smuggling weapons adversary groups utilize trucks previously used to carry food or water to people in iraq once food is delivered the truck is loaded with weap ons and goes out the same way it entered the trucks can be utilized to bring weapons into the country as well almost any vehicle can be used for this purpose and adversa ries have resorted to hiding weapons on animals taxis are also suspected of smuggling concealed weapons and money insi car doors trunks or hidden compartments coffins have also been used to smuggle weapons between cities 8 conducting surveillance of us or coalition forces prior to an attack multiple intelligence reports indicate adversaries conduct surveillance of coaliti on forces prior to attacks 9 employing boobytrapped caches caches may be reported to lure coalition forces to cache site that has been booby trapped jfob threat analysis for official use only 32110 operating weapons markets merchants sell weapons out of cars or from crates that are set up on ground when they see coalition forces they move into the market and hide weapons in the vegetables animals automotiv parts and other sections of the market until coalition forces leave some weapons markets even operate out of public bathrooms black market weapon dealers have bribed local police they pay police officers to lie to coalition forces so they c an continue to sell the weapons 11 making bombs adversaries make bombs from soda and milk cans children may be paid up to 150 iraqi dinar to pick up empty soda cans and return them to the bomb maker 12 conducting ambushes coalition forces may be led on wild goose chase to look for attr active targets and then the unsuspecting coalition force may be ambushed by armed assailants or may be led into boobytrapped area adversaries may throw grenades at stationary ta rgets at checkpoints and at vehicles when they break down resources the following data bases and intelink site s contain information

handbook final draft 324 for official use onlychapter 4 risk assessment contents introduction 41 risk analysis approach alternatives42 risk analysis overview44 risk analysis process46 risk mitigation422 jfob handbook425 introduction jfob risk assessment is prioritized li st of risks with as sociated information such as vulnerabilities that are the basis of the risk the assessment is the result of risk analysis this chapter describe s the risk analysis concept for jfob and explains how this analysis is us ed to develop the risk assessment there are eight major components of risk analysis they are identify key assets including critical infrastructure determine th reat likelihood for threat asset pairs determine and assess vulne rabilities of assets assess incident response ir capabilities develop event likelihood rating data develop consequences data assign risk score and priority pr oduce risk analysis products see figure 41 the risk analysis process in this chapter is appropriate for jfob pre deployment deployment and redeployment operations phases in pre deployment risk analysis could invol ve anything from planning for new jfob with whatever level of information is available to planning for deployment to mature jfob that s performed risk analyses and has implemented risk mitigation courses of action coas risk analysis can be performed with partial information for exam ple the total list of units that will occupy the jfob may not be certain until deployment once deployed unit can improve the defensive situation by assessing and reducing risks based on real rather than projected interp reted or secondhand information performing risk analysis should be taskorganized team effort under the operations officers lead nd should involve the force protection officer fpo security legal f acilities engineering chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn representative and other bject matter experts as needed it is possible for one person or small group to work through the process and for official use only 41develop draft for review with team members having expert knowledge in selected areas figure 41 risk analys is process overview risk analysis approach alternatives this chapter provides information on two risk analysis approaches the expedient solution approach and the fo rmal solution approach the expedient solution approach is advocated when there is compressed schedule or information uncertainty an expedient so lution approach shortcuts the formal solution approach an expedient solu tion approach could be followed by formal solution approach when more information becomes available and there is sufficient time to use it the formal solution approach provides more complete answer expedient solution this can be used with or without comput er requires at least minimum tool set of maps and fi eld risk analysis forms see pp 4 20 22 and relies heavily on estimates fo r example based on your experience estimate the number of fatalities when the vehicleborne improvised explosive device vbied detonates at this location formal solution this requires the use of co mputer and relies more on computerized tools for example use the at planner tool to calculate the number of vbied fatalities jfob force protection handbook final draft 42 for official use onlytools performing risk analysis follows logi cal relatively simple process that is complicated by the number of assets thr eats and vulnerabilities that must be investigated with some combination of tools the following is basic list of tools that can be of assist ance in following the stepbystep process reducing the work effort developing an audit tr ail and simplifying communication common operating picture graphics this is required for expedient or formal solution use detailed maps of th jfob site provide way to visualize many information categories such as asset locations the maps can be any version of sketches overhead imagery or aerial photography they can be used for annotating such information as pe rimeter and entry control point ecp locations and layouts key assets locations highest risk assets vulnerable locations and notes and incident respons team routes maps of the surrounding region can be used to annotate information such as possible attacker approaches and potential indirect fire sites these maps are likely classified confidential or secret joint antiterrorism jat graphics personnel using computer to do risk analysis will find the jat guide pr ovides nocostever geographic information system tool called jat gra phics which can be used on practically any personal computer jat graphics can be used to produce common operating picture graphicsmaps with annotation nd map overlays to any level of detail unclassified overhead imagery at 1 m or 06 m resolution is helpful for detailed planning data with higher and lower resolution can also be used see chapter 15 for more information and refe rences training is required so the jat guide contains selftraining materiel engineer staff is possible location for personnel experienced with this type tool and other similar tools may be available at the jfob asset value rating threat likelihood rating and vulnerability rating these are formal solution tools the ja t guide contains these tools used in determining risk see risk equation on page 45 these tools require the use of computer each tool provides series of questions and the answers to the questions are used to calculate the asset value thre at likelihood and vulnerability ratings incident response ir capability rating this formal solution tool is included in the jat database and requires the use of computer jat database this is formal solution tool the jat guide contains jat database tool run with microsoft ex cel that requires computer the current condition workbook in the jat data base is synchronized with the risk analysis stepbystep process wh the current condition workbook is completed the result is prioritized risk list this tool also contains other workbooks used to develop and compare risk mitigation action sets training is required and the jat guide contains self training material further information is provided in chapter 15 field risk analysis tool this expedient solution t ool paperandpencil tool substitute for the jat database is provide d to assist personnel with performing risk assessment for official use only 43risk analysis when computer is not ava ilable this tool is located later on pp 4 2022 antiterrorism at planner this formal solution highquality engineering model can be used to calculate the blast effects of bombs external to facility the output includes projected fatalities nd serious injuries personnel inside and outside the facility and facility damage at planner can also be used to determine standoff distances required to reduce blast effects to designated level and to ascertain the benefits or lack of bene fits of facility upgrades in decreasing attack conseque nces the model is provide d in the jat guide it requires training so users manual is included personnel on the engineer staff are probably familiar with this model force protection fp plan template an fp annex to the operations order opord should contain risk analysis results an fp nnex template is provided in chapter 14 risk analysis overview risk analysis is systematic rational and defendable process for identifying quantifying and prioritizing risks the out come of risk analysis is list of risks and the vulnerabilities that are the re asons for the risks all or part of the prioritized risk list is recommende d to the commander for mitigation the outcome of the risk analysis is important variations in the prio ritized list that do not affect the outcome nor impact resour ces are not using the process in this handbook to perform risk analysis for jfob different teams with equivalent knowledge skills and capabilities will produce the same outcome normally the highest risks are recomme nded for mitigation although different strategy could be used for example the strategy could be to improve the defense at all mass gathering locations rega rdless of their rank on the prioritized risk list the jfob risk priority list and the quence in which actions to mitigate the risks on the list are implemented are two different topics resource requirements availability and implementation time for different type mitigation measures can determine the sequence in which problems are resolved the implementation schedule for sp ecific action may require interim protection measures for example it may be necessary to use an expedient entry control point ecp at some perimete r location while building up the required ecp with the required capabilities risk equation the risk equation is shown below figur 42 the expedient solution employs the event likelihood and cons equences while the formal solution uses threat likelihood vulnerability and ir details to develop the threat likelihood either solution will use whatever consequences estimates are provided although the formal solution strongly advocates the use of tools such as at planner jfob force protection handbook final draft 44 for official use only figure 42 risk equation risk event likelihood x consequences event likelihood likelihood of specific thre at activity involving specific asset threatasset pair threat likelihood x vulnerability x incident response ratings consequences projected event fatalities serious injuries property and equipment damage and mission degradation outcome for the attack note in figure 42 that neither even t likelihood nor risk is the same as vulnerability although vulnerab ility plays large role in determining risk every asset has vulnerabilities possibly even significant vulnerabilities however the risk can still be negligib since the threat likelihood might be low or the consequences of an attack may be rate d negligible conversel the highest risk situations could have low vulnerabilities but the projected consequences could drive the risk to the highpriority end of the scale risk analysis is performed at the level of threatasset pairs ie risk is assigned to each possible attack against each asset this pairing means the different type of attacks and possibly the different attack points at the same asset location must be considered ie suicide bomber at the entry or within the office space or vbied at the entrance or loading dock since it is too time consuming and difficult to consider all possible situati ons the process emph asizes reducing the work by concentrating on moreversusle ss likely events and making estimates to determine events with highversuslow consequences such as number of projected fatalities this process is called filtering when risks have been prio ritized it is possible to group them into categories such as baseline and threatasset pair specific by reviewing the vulnerabilities that cause the risk baseline refers to vulnerabilities that impact the entire jfob or sections of it examples of baseline vulnerabi lities include the following proximity of multiple assets sufficiently close to the perimeter to permit significant damage from vbi ed outside the perimeter lack of training for entry contro l facility guards on the rules of engagement for potential vbied attempting to run the gate the presence of conspicuous rocket or mortar aim points such as towers in close proximity to highpopulation areas that provide attackers with an increased likelihood of attack success threatasset specific refers to vulnera bilities that impact single asset an example is lack of dining facility dfac access control that could reduce the possibility of handcarried explosive s for that specific asset location risk assessment for official use only 45risk analysis process the risk analysis process quantifies assigns numerical value to the event likelihood of suffering damage or loss and to the consequen ces for specific critical asset and other assets affected in the attack if the attack occurs prioritizes the jfob risks includes the commanders guidance and intent in the risk determination and prioritization in conducting risk analysis you should perform the steps which are described in the following sections step formal solution expedient solution 1 identify key assets and select those to be included in the risk analysis same 2 link threats to the selected assets and develop threat likeli hood ratings for the threatasset pairs reduce to link threats to the selected assets 3 develop vulnerabil ity ratings for the threatasset pairs and identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the attackers reduce to identify vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit 4 develop incident response ir ratings for the threatasset pairs and identify irrelated vulnerabilities additional to those in step 3 reduce to identify ir related vulnerabilities 5 use the threat likelihood vulnerability and ir rating results to determine event likelihood reduce to estimate event likelihood 6 develop projected consequences data for the threatasset pairs and identify vulnerabilities additional to those in step 3 that enable the consequences same 7 develop risk scores and prioritized risk list same 8 develop risk analysis products that can be used to brief higher level personnel and that can be used in the fp plans see chapter 14 and in developing coas to mitigate the risks same jfob force protection handbook final draft 46 for official use onlyidentify key assets including critical infrastructure it is dod policy that commanders are responsible for protecting personnel and property subject to their control and maintaining their mission capability key assets are those personnel military and civilian and property equipment material infrastructure that are likely to have high priority for protection and have high risk key assets include peopl and property both inside and outside the perimeter under control of the comma nder and infrastructure inside and outside the perimeter like power and wa ter that may be needed for the mission the infrastructure may not be under the commanders control risk assessment will normally focus on list of key assets the identification and ranking of key assets is used to filte r the list of all key assets down to those to be considered in the risk analysis assets are not usually locations although every asset is found at some location the df ac is not the asset the asset is the personnel in it however locations are us ually used to identify assets it is generally the location of th asset and its characteristics that can affect the likelihood of and vulnerability to attack for example the location of bille ting near the base perimeter and in easy view from off base may make personnel located there more likely to be attacked with vbied the closer billeting is to the perimeter the higher the vulnerabili ty of the personnel to the blast and fragments at minimum key asset list will probably include mission essential personnel equipmen t material and infrastructure large concentrations of personnel the following nonprioritized checklist should be considered in developing the jfob key asset list the objective is to shorten the list of all assets to those worth

on the key asset list otherw ise filter the list the following is quick checklist if the answer is not yes to at least one of the following questions the asset should be candidate for filtering ż is it mission essential vulnerable area meva ż is it high risk personnel hrp ż is it high risk target hrt ż is it an asset that should receiv special consideration due to higher headquarters hq guidance or interest ż is it required for ir or c onsequence management operations ż is it critical infrastructure needed to maintain mission ż is there some other reason for including it on the list rank the remaining key assets in the list ż expedient solution examine the list and sort the assets from extreme tonegligible value ż formal solution use the computer sset value rating tool in the jat guide to determine an asset valu rating from 10 extreme to 00 negligible value rating at this point the list may still contain more assets than can be worked in risk analysis in the available time if so select shorter final list one strategy is to start with the assets on the top of the list and select any assets that receive protection by regulation during or at the conclusion of the risk analysis work additi onal assets can be added to and worked through the risk analysis process if there is sufficient time note that working restricted list through the process and then mitigating the risks often will impact assets that did not make the final cut for the risk analysis for example improving the jfob ecp against vbieds will reduce risk for such an attack for all asse ts inside the perimeter rega rdless of whether they made the final list determine threat likelihood for threatasset pairs chapter 3 provides information for veloping jfob threat assessment while this handbook is scoped to rocket

solution use the computer th reat likelihood rati ng tool in the jat guide to estimate threat like lihood rating any type of attacks that have occurred at the jfob or at other jfobs in the region should be on the high end of the threat likelihood rating scale determine and assess vulnerabilities of assets identifying and understanding the vulnerabil ities of an asset are important in determining how it could be protected from loss for each threatasset pair the vulnerabi lity assessment answers the questions how susceptible is the asset to this attack and why alth ough terrorist threats cannot be controlled by defensive acti ons they can be assessed and the vulnerability of assets to those threats can be mitigated vulnerabilities are the component of overall risk over which the commander has the most control and greatest influen ce teducing vulnerabilities normally results in reduced risk the overriding concept of antiterrorism vulnerability reduction is the focus in two broad areas 1 preventing terrorist incident from occurring ie prevent the vbied from reaching the asset and failing that 2 substantially mitigating the effects of rrorist act ie provide standoff so the attack effectiveness is greatly re duced and have ir and consequence management capabilities needed to save lives and recover rapidly determine vulnerabilities the jfob vulnerabilities can be determined by working the two following tasks these tasks can be worked simultaneously review available sources if there are available information sources containing previously recognized vulnerabilities re view the sources to become informed this task may apply more or less to the situation depend ing on availability quality and timeliness of sources deploymen t may be into bare base with prior history beyond knowledge of attack s occurring in the region reviewing sources assists in recovering previously developed information adding insights for new personnel and providing basis

start before the list of threatasset pairs is finalized the task involves determining the vulne rabilities for each th reatasset pair vulnerabilities normally have major impact on the risk analysis assessment results fixing the vulnerabilities is the approach to mitigating risk so it is important to collect this information in preparation for later developing defensive coas there are dodprovided tools to assist in assessing asset vulnerability to include the jat guide and core vulnerability assessment management program cvamp some jfobs also use one or both of the following tools that combine threat asset value and vulnerability these are msharp which combines mission symbolism history accessibility recognizability population and proximity and carver which co mbines criticality accessibility recoverability vulnerab ility effect and recognizability msharp and carver are discussed in detail in dod 200012h only the jat guide vulnerability assessmen t process is presented in this jfob handbook for each threatasset pair consid er the threat coa from startto finish considering the threat tactics and the vulnerabilities that would enable the attackers success consider an outsidei n approach from outside the perimeter through the jfob perimeter to the asset cation perimeter if there is separate asset perimeter such as an enclave or secondlayer fence and for cases where the asset is located inside structure consider the asset location exterior and asset location interior some attacks involve direct and indirect fire from outside the perimeter and part of the threat coa involves avoiding detection prior to attack and rapid escape without having to penetrate any of the defensive layers other attacks employ coas that include pe netrating the perime ter and getting as close as possible to the asset pla nned for attack yet others depend on penetrating all defensive layers to bri ng manpacked ied into populated area within structure for example vulnerabilities fo r mortar attackdfac could include lack of any or lack of full height sidewall protection lack jfob force protection handbook final draft 412 for official use onlyof dfac compartmentalization to limit casualties lack of ability to keep potential mortar launch areas under inspection vulnerability rating if the formal solution is used the task also involves determining the vulnerability rating for each threatasset pair using tool in the jat guide each threatasset pair can be assigned vulnerability rating number in the range 00 to 10 where the low end means negligible vulnerability and the high end means extreme vulnerability expedient solution na formal solution use the vulnerability assessment tool in the jat guide assess incident response capabilities fp incident response is s hortlived often confused cr eative fastpaced flow of events after an attack or other lifethr eatening or damage causing event the response is immediate action taken to save lives or prevent suffering or protect against further harm to forces faciliti equipment or supplies incident response is covered in chapter 9 if capability is not available c onsider placing the deficiency on the vulnerability list as contributing to the risk s if the jfob ir capability stops the attack or some part of it the capability can affect the risk the capability still saves lives mission capability and property even if it does not stop the attack terrorist ir can be accomplished simu ltaneously with terrorist consequence management tcm but tcm normally star ts after assessment of the incident conduct an incident response assessment concentrate on the threatasset pair masscasualty situations chemical biological radiological nuclear and explosive cbrne since these situati ons are the ones in which an ir capability will possibly reduce risk an ir capability may not provide any risk reduction in masscasualty situation in which single backpack ied detonates in gathering area but c ould reduce risk in an atta ck involving two backpack bombs with the second timed to explode to catch emergency responders it is very difficult to achieve an ir capability level that has major effect on the risk analysis results most attacks are detected as or after rather than before they occur when determining an ir capability consider the following ƒ how would you rate your in stallations ability to detect insert

only 413incident response rating if the formal solution is used the task also involves determining the ir rating for each threatass et pair using tool available in the jat guide each threatasset pair can be assigned an ir rating number in the range 00 to 10 where the low end means negligible vulnerability and the high end means extreme vulnerability expedient solution na formal solution use the jat guide an ir tool is embedded within the jat database consult the instru ctions for the jat database develop event likelihood rating data the event likelihood rating for each threatass et pair is the product of the threat likelihood vulnerability and ir ratings for that threat asset pair as shown in the figure 42 risk equation the event likelihood for each th reatasset pair is the rela tive likelihood of that event occurrence expedient solution select number in the range of 1 9 negligibleto extreme likelihood consider the th reat likelihood vulnerability and ir capability when making this determin ation if similar threatasset situations have occurred at the jfob or even in the region or threat assessment indicates that attack tactics are evolving in th is direction the event likelihood should be high to extreme formal solution the database tool in the jat guide is used to record the threat likelihood vulnerability and ir ratings and the event likelihood rating is automatically calculated in the database consult the instructions for the jat database develop consequences data each threatasset pair has projected conse quences and it is essential to estimate those consequences in determining risk series of five factors listed below is used in determining attack consequences data for the consequences are in different units fatalities number of people each person is counted as person regardless of rank income impor tance to the mission or other characteristics serious injuries number of people same as above property damage thousands of the replacement dollar value of real property the value is t function of property t ype use or importance to the mission equipment damage thousands of the replacement dollar value of equipment the value is not func tion of equipment type use or importance to the mission jfob force protection handbook final draft 414 for official use only mission degradation rating scale value the effect of the fatalities and serious injuries and pr operty and equipment damage on the installation mission the first step in consequence analysis is to interpret the attack scenario which includes an attack time line and situati on favorable for the attacker ie the dfac has its normal maximum population it is rush hour at the main gate examine the scenario ie the projected threat coa tactics and weapon for each threatasset pair and develop the projected consequences data include collateral effects of an intended target in the vicinity collateral effects can be greater than the effects on what you identify as the intended target ie vbied at the main gate could also heav ily damage nearby structures and cause other vehicle and pedestrian fa talities and serious injuries the consequences data estimate can be based on experience or you can use some estimator tool or computerbased engineering model the jat guide contains the at planner fo r blast effects requires computer see tools above determining consequences can lead to important additional insights into vulnerability an example is discoveri ng the minimum standoff from specific location like road determining the am ount and location of hardening required to reduce consequences of vbied to negligible level or identifying the construction reasons for the fatalities and injuries different consequence estimation procedures vary in the quality of the estimate error bars for the estimated values for the same scenario and input data and there is tendency to overestimate cons equences when the estimate is based on expert opinion rather than tool however expert opinion can be used in either the expedient or formal solution mission degradation consequences refer to the installations mission degradation and not to the targets mission gradation the mission degradation consequence of an attack is related to the number and type of fatalities and damage resulting from the terrorist even t and the psychological and emotional response to the attack in addition to its physical consequences fatalities and damage could be high yet mission degrad ation low and vice versa select number from table 42 that best describes the mission degradation consequences the fatalities serious injuries pr operty damage and equipment damage consequences data must be converted to the same units use the rating scale that involves the level of cern for the consequences as shown in table 42 rating scale value description of level of concern 1 negligible 2 negligible to low 3 low 4 low to moderate 5 moderate 6 moderate to high 7 high 8 high to extreme 9 extreme table 42 consequence data conversion risk assessment for official use only 415the mission degradation determination and rating scale c onversion for other factors such as projected fatalities is jfobspecific decision based on many important considerations such as the value of human life and health legal ramifications political sensitivity etc and the commanders guidance must be used it is helpful to set up conversion rule s such as if there are zero fatalities there is negligible concern and if there ar 10 or more fatalities there is extreme concern you do not have to convert the mission degradation data with table 42 since this is determined at the outset when you use the rating scale helpful hints when examining any consequence fact or there is some point at which there is negligible concern for the number of fatalities probably 0 fatalities serious injuries probably 0 serious injuries property damage can live with it with noneedtore pairreplace or minimum cost etc when examining any consequence fact or there is some point at which there is extreme concern for the number of fatalities x fatalities serious injuries x serious injuries etc if the consequences rise above those judged of extreme concern 50 or 100 or 200 fatalities the rating for projected fatalities is still 9extreme if you are using the expedient solution you must manually record the data ie projected fatalities and the rating scale value for each type consequence using the field risk analysis tool consult the instructi ons for the tool on pp 4 2021 formal solution use the jat database tool to record the consequences data you also must provide rules fo r converting consequences data to rating scale value the conversion is then automatically performed as you record the consequences data into th database consult the instructions for the jat database risk score and priority risk analysis results in risk score and risk priority for each threatasset pair the following describes these results risk score this is the commanders level of concern for the combination of event likelihood and consequences for the specific risk situation value that expresses the relative ri sk for the situation minimum score means there is negligible concern about the situat ion andor the threat event likelihood is nil or the project ed consequences are nil and mitigation is needed very high score means there is extreme concern for all risk factors and the threat ev ent likelihood is ve ry high situations with high risk scores are more important for mitigation than those with low scores comparison of the scores for 2 situations provides way to determine how different the situations are on the risk scale and provides more information than the risk prioriti see next bullet situations with similar scores really ve equivalent priorities even though the numbers differ by small amount jfob force protection handbook final draft 416 for official use only risk priority this is the relative ranking of the situation risks for the threatasset pairs 1 highest risk this is the ordering of the threatasset pairs from highesttolowest risk the same procedures should be used in calculating risk for all threatasset pairs since number of factors are considered in calculating the risk score the score value is not sensitive to minor changes in procedures andor rules for consequences conver sion to rating scale or changes in event likelihood values you can confirm this fact by varying decisions or data values and checking the impact on the threatasset pairs risk scores and the before and

or singlesolution coa for reducing risk s different working groups taking different approaches can develop coa variants to accomplish the same goal the reason is that the following tasks involve the imaginative use of engineering science and experience generating possible actions to reduce risk modifying actions to meet reso urce and operations constraints filtering coas to reject actions th at are losers and avoid unnecessary work coa actions that dont provi sufficient benefits require excessive resources such as funds or personnel or implementation time etc the commander has major influence on coa development that influence is exercised through guidance on the risks lected for mitigation the relative importance attached to risk factors lik fatalities and mission degradation and the acceptability of the risk reduction the benefit and the projected residual risk that will still be present after coa is implemented the commander also approves allocation of resources to fp versus other uses and unfunded requirements operations constraints such as those imposed by the state department local authorities hn or the commander also influence acceptability of mitigation actions some rules to use during the coa development process examine actions ie improve the ecp that will reduce many risks ie attackers running the gates with vbied search for actions to resolve the highest priority risks it is often necessary to crawlwalk run your way to the objective risk reduction level since most actions ie build the perimeter or emplace overhead cover on high occupancy areas cannot be accomplished overnight some procedural actions ie ensure the guards at the main gate have well defined and trained rules of engage ment roes for potential attacker engagement can be very effective and inexpensive jfob force protection handbook final draft 422 for official use only benefit and cost data estimations are probably best made by engineer personnel who have most experience in these specifics this will help avoid excessive work on ideas that finally get rejected avoid unnecessary work as you go through the coa development process using the process first make rough estimates funds required ability to support projected benef it in reducing casualties effect on mission degradation etc you might di scover some risk mitigation ideas are losers and any further effort to make the estimates more accurate or polish the actions into an acceptable form will not make them any more acceptable dont get distracted by easyaction solutions that dont provide much benefit dont overdesign unless doing so involve s little or increase in resource requirements greater benefits can be gained using the resources elsewhere be innovative in making the cost of an action bearable ie compare costs of relocate vs renovate vs new constr uction as different strategies for achieving the same result consider the risk mitigation procedures provided in successive chapters of this handbook some procedures such as good perimeter and entry control reduce the likelihood of attacks othe r procedures such as fullheight sidewall protection overhead cover compartmentalization and dispersion reduce the consequences when attacks occur the following are hypothetical examples of scenarios vulnerabilities and actions that could possibly mitigate the risks for the purpose of explaining the concepts note that it may not be possible to remove or reduce all vulnerabilities many vulnerabilities are too difficult to fully cure for any of several reasons includin g cost time mission impact and hn objection scenario 1 attack 2phase vbied attack on main gate first vbied to kill cause confusion and distract at the gate second vbied to run the gate and attack the dfac vulnerabilities confusion

reduce blast and shrapnel effects except the bodies of personnel who are casualties inadequate access control to the dfac actions to mitigate risk install blast and fragment protection materials in compartmentalization of the dfac special consideration should be given to not increasing the ri sk with an action intended to reduce risk some examples for purpose of illustration are as follows an incorrectly constructed bunkerobs ervation postguard toweretc can collapse and cause casualties or fail to provide direct fire protection an incorrectly designed standoff wall or blast wall can become fragments that dramatically increase fa talities in an ied attack window film on windows without catch device can cause fatalities when fatalities would have been low prob ability before the film was applied risks can be reduced often to the point they are negligible but there can be situations where risks are not signifi cantly reduced and the commander must accept the risk at least temporarily examples are the following the vulnerability is inherently too diffi cult to solve ie target is next to the road and standoff distance is not available and you cannot evacuate the building high elevation positions offer enemy mortar spotters good view inside the jfob and there is way to solve the problem except to move the jfob the resources are not available ie the solution is tenable but materials are not available you are not willing to accept the ssion degradation caused by the risk reduction measure eg dispersi ng the targeted assets jfob force protection handbook final draft 424

introduction the perimeter security system often forms the first line of defense for the jfob the goal of perimeter security is to safeguard the jfob mission by protecting personnel and property this goal is accomplished through the prevention detection and response to enemythreat tactics to include dedicated attack rocket artillery and mortar attacks r am vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbied acts of terrorism sabotage theft pilferage trespass espionage or other insurgent activity properly desi gned perimeter security system should perform in an integrate d layered defenseindepth manner so that jfob security forces can achieve the following detect attempts to reconnoiter or attack the jfob or interfere with the performance of jfob missionsfunctions warn the jfob that an attack is imminent or under way assess the size and intention of the enemy threat deny the enemy access to the jfob nd prevent it from degrading the jfobs primary missionfunction destroy if possible the

system include standoff physical barriers access control entry control points security lighting hardened fighting positi onstowersoverwatch intrusion detection nd surveillance systems security forces standoff the best technique to reduce the risks and effects of an enemy attack especially one involving explosives vbied rams is to keep the att ack as far away from the jfob and inhabited structures as possible see fi gure 61 ideally maximum standoff should be primary consideration when personnel are deciding where to locate jfob if distance is t possible the next best solution is to maximize standoff for indivi dual inhabited structures regardless even with adequate space standoff must be coupled with appr opriate operational security procedures in order to be ffective allowances for standoff distance should also provide opportunities to upgrad structures in the future to meet increased threats or to accommodate higher levels of protection standoff requirements for the central

other means of observation and assessment ƒ an unobstructed area or clear zone s hould be maintained on both sides of and between physical barriers ƒ barriers should be positioned far enough away from other structures trees telephone poles antenna masts or adjacent structures that may be used as aids to circumvent the barrier ƒ barriers should not be placed where ve hicles can park immediately adjacent to them thereby affording attackers platform from which to mount an attack ƒ additional toppings on barriers shoul d be considered these include concertina wire multiplestrand razor or barbed wire or other devices that inhibit enemy efforts to vault or go over the top of the barrier ƒ barriers should be considered as ex cellent platforms on which to mount surveillance systems and intr

sensors and final protec tive and overwatch fires should be integrated and should fully support each other in many instances when single barrier cannot stop vehicl combination of barriers can ƒ barriers can be compromised through breaching ie cutting hole through fence or by nature ie berms er oded by the wind and rain therefore barriers should be inspected and maintained at least weekly ƒ barriers at the perimeter can help c onceal and shield jfob activities from direct observation and surveillance manmade perimeter barriers can assume wide range of forms to include fences walls ditches berms barricades and vehicle barriers active and passive perimeter barriers are further di stinguished as eith er antipersonnel or antivehicular antipersonnel barriers antipersonnel barriers are designed to deter personnel on foot from entering jfob these barriers prot ect against infiltrators who may try to place small explosive charges tamper with supplie s and equipment or attack friendly personnel or critical assets once they are inside the jfob typical antipersonnel barriers include chain link fences with barbed wire outrigge rs triplestrand concertina fences wire obstacles concre walls and barbed wire fences in most instances antipersonnel barriers can be penetrated by the enemies climbing over them or using wire cutte rs consequently antipersonnel barriers must remain under constant observation chain link and metal mesh fences chain link fences provide moderate level of security for the jfob agains t infiltration by enemy personnel chain link fences are cost effective have low profile and are readily available these fences are particularly effective if coupled with other barriers either man made canal or natural lake or river however chain link fences can be effectively breached by the enemies cutting holes through the fence or tearing down the outriggers with grappling hook and climbing the fence fences offer delays of less than 1 min against lowlevel threats to as little as 3 to 8 sec against trained and dedicated highle vel intruder teams the he ight up to 8 ft 24 m of the fence or the degree of enhancements used has little effect on this time in general fence material can be easily cut or climbed over metal mesh fences are generally more difficult to climb th enemy can bypass improperly installed fencing by climbing the fence or burrowi ng under it these actions can be deterred if the security force tops the fence with outriggers and laces horizontal wire through the fence at the base see figure 62 perimeter security for official use

effective ƒ fence height including outriggers should be minimum of 8 ft ƒ horizontal wire should be laced along the bottom and top of the fence to keep the edges rigid ƒ the bottom edge of the fence should not rise more than 4 in above the ground the preferred installation method makes use of concrete footing that encases the bottom of the fence around the entire perimeter this method prevents an intruder from lifti ng the bottom of the fence delays him from burrowing under it and diminishes erosion ƒ synthetic screen can be woven into th fence to prevent observation of the jfob but care should be taken to ensure that the screen does not also block observation from within ƒ additional information and specific guidance can be found in milhdbk 101310 military handbook design guidelines

established for each jfob based on the jfob mission and opera tional constraints and manpower equipment and explosive detection asse ts available to conduct searches the following procedures are provided as general discussion of techniques for vehicle searches elements of detailed vehicle search visual searches visual searches are used to find hastily placed improvised explosive devices ieds and to identify indicators of deliberately placed ied such as extraneous wires or altered engine components the searcher is unlikely to find traces of deliberately placed ied when he is using search mirrors to conduct visual search underneath vehicle mirrors provide limited thoroughness because they only allow the searcher to see the outer two feet of vehicles underside mechanical searches mechanical searches involve looking for deliberately placed ieds during chanical search the searcher requires the driver and passengers to open all doors hoods and trunk the searcher then taps areas which s hould be hollow such as doors side panels and exhaust systems to ensure they do not have something inside the searcher also looks at the air filter engine reservoir fluids glove compartment spare tire gas tank and electrical system to include the horn lights windshield wiper and ignition wiring long pole or other dipstick should be used to probe the storage tank of tanker trucks to ensure nothing was submerged in the transported liquid mwd searches mwd searches rely on the dogs ability to detect the scent of certain explosives in order to maintain the mwds skills the dog needs to be tested regularly testing should incorporate explosive training aids and should be conducted wit hout prior notification to the dog handlers because heat and long hours will significantly degrade the effectiveness of mwds they need to be kept cool and well rested package searches package searches involve examining baggage for weapons and explosives searchers should make the owner open all baggage and mwds should so check the baggage individual searches individual search are used to check personnel for weapons explosives and triggering devices all driver s and passengers should be searched prior to entering the jfob the use of handheld metal detectors and physical searches f risking are effective means of conducting individual searches general guidance for conducting vehicle searches specific guidelines for conducting vehicle searches should be tablished for each jfob the following procedures can be used as general gui dance when establishing guidelines for conducting detailed vehicle searches ƒ driver brings vehicle into search area jfob force protection handbook final draft 628 for official use onlyƒ driver dismounts vehicle and opens all compartments doors the hood and trunk and bags in the vehicle ƒ driver and passengers are moved to th driver and passenger holding area where they are searched with portable tal detectors if there is reasonable cause to conduct physi cal search personnel are frisked throughout search procedures driver and passengers are kept under observation by an armed guard ƒ mwd team searches vehicle engine compartment trunk gas tank interior compartments walls doors upholst ery cargo areas and packages ƒ search team taps on doors and vehicle walls to ensure they are empty the team swings vehicle doors to ensure they are the appropriate weight ƒ search team examines engine compartm ent they look for extraneous wires improper fluids in reservoirs ie gas in washer fluid reservoir air filter replaced with wires or explosiv new components in engine and extraneous components ie an altern ator not connected to belt ƒ in the case of cargo vehicles an mw d thoroughly sweeps the truck search team randomly chooses cargo items and di rects driver to open them storage tank and side gas tanks are probed th mobile search advanced xray portable inspection system and the mobile vacis gamma ray imaging system can also be used to search commercial vehicles ƒ search team directs driver to bring vehi cle on top of ramp or over search pit ƒ search team examines vehicle undercarri age they look for extraneous wires and new components check wheel wells and ensure that the exhaust system is hollow ƒ driver and passengers reenter vehicle and proceed through ecp figure 624 general vehicle search areas during the search of vehicle if sear chers find anything suspicious they should follow local procedures for example evacuate the search area and notify perimeter security for official use only 629explosive ordnance disposal eod searchers shoul d look not only for the big bomb but also for any type of weapon ied or cache of explosives vehicle can be considered suspicious or believed to contain suspicious item if the driver refuses to open any comp artment eg hood trunk passenger doors glove box or even package searchers should complete one search technique before starting another one explosive detector dog edd searches the search techniques provided below were derived from the usaf fo rce protection battlelab vehicle bomb mitigation guide sept 2002 although specific edd search procedures will vary accordi ng to local jfob policy individual mwd handler prefer ence and the unique abilities of individual canines the typical approach follows five general steps ƒ the driver exits the vehicle and opens all doors the hood and trunk lids any other compartments and any packages and is then placed in holding area where he or she is not allowed to witness the vehicle search the driver should also be physically searched ƒ the edd team the handler and the dog proceeds directly to the downwind side of the vehicle figure 625 edd searches ƒ the edd team starts the search at specific point and searches in counterclockwise manner with the handler visually guiding the edd to search for scents along the fenders wheel wells hubcaps spare tire and bumpers ƒ the dog is directed to search all open ed compartments vehicle seats and floorboard ƒ the dog is directed to search any onboard packages and parcels search techniques for the external portion of vehicle ƒ search from the bottom of the vehicle working to the top ƒ search by braille if n ecessary feel in areas that cannot easily be seen if something is found do not pull it out jfob force protection handbook final draft 630 for official use onlyƒ look for body repairs freshly pain ted sections anything indicating tampering with the external surface of the vehicle ƒ use flashlight and mirror with creep er if possible to carefully inspect under the vehicle ƒ check the suspension drive train the wheel wells the bumpers under the engine and above the gas tank ƒ look for any unusual devices taped tied sc rewed etc to the undercarriage ƒ look for an unusually clean portion of the dercarriage the presence of new weld marks or new boltsscrews ƒ be sure all connections are properly made eg the gas tank filler tube runs from the fill port to the tank the exhaus t pipe runs from the manifold the entire length of the vehicle to the muffler inspect the exhaust pipe for inserted objects search techniques for the engine compartment of vehicle ƒ take minute to observe everything w ithin view and then start at the outermost edge the front or side the battery is on of the compartment and work towards the center of the vehicle ƒ look for additional wires running from the vehicles battery ƒ look for outofplace or unus ually clean components devices andor wiring and electrical tape ƒ check under larger components eg th air cleaner and fa n blade shrouds for packages or devices ƒ look for containers that may contai n fuel indicating the gas tank may contain an explosive charge ƒ inspect the insulation on the firewall hood etc for rips tears bulges etc and any subsequent repairs ƒ look for additional wires running from the hoodlight or the absence of bulb in the hoodlight socket search techniques for the trunk of vehicle ƒ take minute to observe everything w ithin view then begin at the edge and inspect inward ƒ pay attention to packages devices eg alarm clocks iron or pvc pipe that look out of place inspect items normally found in trunk eg tool box supplies blankets and water containers etc ƒ look for bits of electrical tape wire stripped wire insu lation string fine wire fishing line andor time fuse on the floor ƒ check for hidden compartments eg sp are tire well jacktool storage perimeter security for official use only 631ƒ check for any additional or improvised wi res attached to th brake lights or rear turn signals ƒ dont forget to look in the area behind the rear seat search techniques for the passenger compartment of vehicle ƒ take minute to observe everything w ithin view then start at the floor and work up pay close attention to packages devices eg alarm clocks iron or pvc pipe that look out of place ƒ look for bits of electrical tape wire stripped wire insu lation string fine wire fishing line andor time fuse on the floor dash or seats ƒ check under floor mats for wires or switches ƒ use flashlight to check under all seats for anything out of the ordinary ƒ check behind speaker grills and in ashtrays ƒ check the door panels for signs of tampering ƒ be sure the vehicle driver opens the glove box and inspect inside of it ƒ check under the dash for any loose or unusual wiring pay attention to any modifications done to the dash eg ex tra switches with label as to their function indicator lights that remain on although the vehicle is not running ƒ check the roof liner for bulges rips andor repairs indicating possible concealment of an explosive device common sense is an extremely valuable to ol if the vehicle is tractortrailer type treat the tractor like

for illustration purposes this example can be considered multipurpose ecp since several types of entry control operations are comb ined in one location approach zone the approach zone see figure 627 is the initial interface between the offsite road network pub lic highways and the jfob the length of the approach zone should be based on available land dist ance required for queuing and performing traffic sorting and the space required for additional lanes of traffic to prevent traffic fr om backing up excessively onto adjacent public highways space may also be required to support additional speed management techniques to mitigate high speed threats the approach zone should include design elements that accomplish the following functions and operations ƒ reduce the speed of incoming vehicles ƒ sort traffic by vehicle type ƒ allow for verification of authorized access of personnel and vehicles ƒ provide adequate stacking distan ce for vehicles waiting for entry ƒ provide the first

example allow access to truckcommercial delivery vehicles instead establish centralized offsite inspectiondelivery point that is separate from the primary ecp and allow access to passenger vehicles require an offsite parking area ƒ the ecp design should anticipate in creased traffic volume and should support the employment of require d fpcon measures and rams as outlined in the jfob force protection plan ƒ the number of ecps should be kept to minimum however large jfob should consider one ecp for truckco mmercial vehicle inspection and access only one ecp for pedestrian access one for military vehicle access etc limiting the number of functions to be conducted at each ecp and the amount of usage reduces the infrastr ucture and manpower requirements ƒ major factor in determining the type of ecp should be the size of vehicles requiring entry at least one ecp shoul d be designed to accommodate large andor oversized vehicles military vehicles and another for normal sized vehicle traffic where possible rtiary gate should be planned for contingencies and for emergency ve hicular and pedestrian egress ƒ when possible truckcommercial and passenger vehicle traffic should be segregated and compartmentalized nd separate search areas should be constructed for each the reasons for segr egating these vehicles if possible include the following the effectiveness of most speed management techniquesbarriers for passenger vehicles decreases if trucks commercial vehicles must use the same lanes distances between barri ers must be increased and lanes widened for larger vehicles search requirements for trucksc ommercial vehicles and passenger vehicles differ significantly jfob force protection handbook final draft 638 for official use onlyo separate search areas help avoid co ngestion and improve efficiency of searches during 100 inspections ƒ to accommodate oversized atypical vehicles such as military vehicles and equipment the ecp design may require m odifications to lane widths size of inspection areas spacing of barriers and other potential ob structions the minimum lane widths for an ecp should be 30 m 10 ft the preferred lane width is 36 m 12 ft lanes approaching the gate should be 36 m 12 ft wide plus another 061 m 2 ft on each side for the curb and gutter ƒ the ecp design should provide way for an unauthorized vehicle that enters the ecp to be rejected and for an authorized vehicl that enters the wrong ecp to be redirected with mini mal impact on traffic flow the roadway should be designed with the required turning radius to allow single movement for the vehicle to be rejected or redirected where possible the ecp should incorporate the turning radii outlined in the policy on geometric design of highways and st reets by the american association of state highway and transportati on officials aashto wb15m wb 50 the radius of corner or turn ing lane depends on the largest vehicle expected to use the lane and the average turning speeds which should be quite low for an ecp other factors to consider include the available right of way the angle of the intersection nd pedestrian activity the following minimum inside radii should be used locations serving only passenger vehicles 457 m 15 ft to 914 m 30 ft preferred is 61 m 20 ft corners where rvs suvs or sim ilar vehicles turn 1067 m 35 ft intersections where large trucks wb50 including semitrailers wb67 turn 1524 m 50 ft turnarounds for large trucks 1981 m 65 ft ƒ if space is available inspectionsearch areas should be exclusive separate and offset from traffic lanes this yout facilitates the bypass of vehicles if needed inspection and search areas s hould have sufficient area to safely move vehicles from the lanes of traffic to conduct thorough vehicle inspections the minimum width should be 55 m 18 ft to facilitate the safe inspection of vehicles the length of pulloff area or inspection area should be minimum of 122 m 40 ft or the length required to support the largest vehicle expected at the ecp whichever is larger as minimum the jfob should provide the following inspection areas for standard ve hicles 45 72 m 15 ft 25 ft inspection bays that can be enclosed if necessary to protect inspection equipment in the event of bad weather perimeter security for official use only 639 for commercial vehicles 55 244 m 18 ft 80 ft 54 m 17 ft 6 in high inspection bays that can be enclosed to protect inspection equipment in the event of bad weather access control section of chapter 6 provides personne l and vehicle inspection techniques ƒ ecps should have dedicated rightof way protected from encroachment by buildings trees and other objects th ecp should not be located near restrictedclear zones and identified cr itical or vulnerabl assets or near congested areas housing schools and co mmercial areas both on and off site to avoid interference with pede strians parked cars and driveways ƒ entry roads to jfobs and to individual buildings should be designed so that they do not provide direct or straight line vehicular access to highrisk assets ƒ parking areas should be located away from highrisk jfobs and critical assets to minimize blast effects from potential vbieds ƒ signs identifying highrisk jfobs and cri tical assets should be kept to minimum ƒ ecps should provide full containment and control of vehicles roadway containment is necessary to prevent unauthorized vehicle access and should extend from the approach zone to the re sponse zone or final denial barrier in order to be effective vehicle co ntainment can be achieved through combination of passive and active vehi cle barrier systems active barriers require some action either by personnel equipment or both to prevent entry of vehicle passive barriers require action once in place and are normally used to direct and ch annel the flow of traffic ƒ the selection of passive and active antivehicle ba rriers should be based on their capacity to stop threat vehicl other considerations include barriers should have limited profile in order to minimize cover and concealment positions for aggressors barriers should encompass contiguous perimeter around the ecp with the final denial barriers co mpleting the containment barriers should be arranged to ensure that vehicle does not circumvent the ecp once the vehicle has entered the approach zone barriers should complement the empl oyment of other physical and procedural security requirements ƒ containment may also be accomplished with natural or constructed barriers natural barriers may consist of dense tree stand berms or drainage ditches on either side of the roadway berms and ditches should have slopes that prevent vehicles from passing over the obstruction see figure 613 constructed barriers may include cab lereinforced fencing concrete walls etc consideration should be gi ven to the potential debris hazard jfob force protection handbook final draft 640 for official use onlyproduced by passive barrier systems exposed to blast during potential attack and the effect on nearby pe rsonnel buildings or assets barriers around the search area should force the driver to ram through gate or barrier clearly demonstra ting hostile intent to the overwatch antivehicular barriers must not obstruct fields of vision or fields of fire for the overwatch or backup security forces ƒ when pedestrian access control is required the ecp design should ensure that proper sidewalk and safety provis ions direct pedestrian traffic to the approach zone and separate it from ve hicular traffic and ensure pedestrian walkways are integrated into the existing site layout pedestrian access control consider ations include walkways should maintain minimum width of 4 ft 12 m pedestrian access control should be designed with limited obstructions to ensure that security personnel can maintain visual contact with the pedestrians as they approach the ecp breaks may be provided in the passive barriers surrounding the ecp to allow pedestrian access to the ecp any break in the passive barrier should not exceed 3 ft 1 m in width access control systems ie turnstiles should be considered and incorporated if possible if includ ed they should ensure control and prevention of possible tailgating ƒ if the ecp incorporates electronic barriers lighting or communication systems an electrical design must be prepared see security lighting section of this chapter factors that should be considered in this design include power requirements for future traffic control devices identification equipment and other devices associat ed with potential automation of the ecp an alternate electrical power source in the event of ss of the primary electrical source reliab alternate power source is necessary to ensure continuous operation of the ecp standby generator or other equivalent means should be used as th alternate electrical power source ƒ the ecp should be provided with multiple redundant lighting to ensure that the loss of single light does not riously degrade the total lighting available for security personnel gu idelines for ligh ting include the approach and response zones require typical roadway lighting roadway lighting should provide nough intensity so that vehicles pedestrians security personnel islands signage and other hazards are visible the lighting should not be directed in the drivers eyes and it should not backlight security personne l or important signage in the access control zone the lighti ng should illuminate the exterior and interior of vehicle to facilitate identification of the occupants and the vehicle contents perimeter security for official use only 641ƒ additional key concepts that should be incorporated into an ecp design include layered defense nonlinear design maximized protection for ecp personnel multiple guardhouses maximized standoff traffic and pedestrian segregation and channeling multiple vehicle turn aroundrejection areas vehicle speed managementreduction through the use of serpentines and vehicle barriers segregated search areas with lineof sight denial from possible external surveillance overwatch positions hardened fighting positions hardened perimeter gate acce ss final denial barrier ƒ concepts that should be incorporated into ecp exitpoint design include approaches to all vehicle exit points should be designed so that high speed approach from outside the perime ter is not possible the goal is to ensure to the maximum degree possible that attackers cannot simply enter the jfob by going against the flow of exiting vehicle traffic an active barrier should be used to maintain positive control over an exit lane and to prevent someone from entering the jfob through the exit the active barrier should be bounded by measures such as serpentines and speed bumpstables th at slow vehicle traffi c from both outside and inside the installation before it reaches the active barrier all entryexit points sh ould be constructed with protection against rammingvehicle attack pa ssive vehicle barriers can be incorporated to make ramming attacks difficult dditional vehicle barriers can be installed behind the gates to provid defense in depth against such attack designing the search areas ƒ parking area parking area should be established outside the ecp and search area this location will help to discourage and restri ct vehicles from requesting access into the jfob personnel who do not n eed to drive into the jfob should park in this area thus limiting traffic to mission essential vehicles the parking area should rema in under constant observation by security personnel and should be re gularly searched with mwds the parking area should at distance th at provides adequate standoff for inhabited areas ƒ staging area enough space distan ce from approach zone to access control zone should be available to stack and stage ve hicles awaiting jfob force protection handbook final draft 642 for official use onlysearch if possible pers onnel awaiting search should not be able to observe the search procedures ƒ blast mitigation berms tall concrete ba rriers texas alaska bitberg or earthfilled barriers hesco bastion and metal revetment should be placed around the search pit to protect near by personnel from fragmentation should bombladen vehicle explode while be ing searched soilbacked concrete barriers provide better protection against secondary debris hazards ƒ obscured search area berms camouflage netting or other types of screening should be used to obstruct observation of the search area from personnel outside the jfob ƒ driver and passenger holding and sear ch area the driver and passengers of vehicle should be st aged where they cannot obs erve search procedures this holding area should not protect the driver and passengers from an explosion drivers and pa ssengers should be searched while in this holding area and should be kept under constant observation by an armed guard not involved in searching th em or the vehicle ƒ shade in order to maximize the effectiveness of security personnel and mwds the search area should have overhead protection from the sun ƒ mwd rest area extreme heat and sun cause fatigue and reduce the effectiveness of the mwds those not actively engaged in searching vehicles should be kept in an airc onditioned tent or room to extend their effectiveness other measures to improve dog endurance include cold collars cooling fans and dog shoes ƒ rampssearch pit vehicle ramps and mechanics search pit should be provided to allow searchers the most ffective means to visually inspect the undercarriages of vehicles this method is the only way to thoroughly search the underside of vehicles however the use of automated under vehicle inspection systems rather than mirrors or search pits is recommended to remove security forces from danger ƒ mirrors though less thorough th an vehicle ramps or pi ts mirrors should be used to detect poorly or hastily cealed explosives placed near the outer edges of vehicle the mere act of s earching underneath vehicle can be psychological deterrent to terrorists ƒ floor if search pit is available the floors of s earch areas should be flat and hard to allow searchers to cr awl underneath vehicles on creeper flooring which would create suitable surface is asphalt concrete am2 matting or plywood astroturf or other similar matting placed over the floor helps protect mwds feet from the heat of the ground ƒ illumination search pits should be well illuminated to allow searchers to see all portions of the vehicl lighting mounted on ramps or in mechanics pit helps searchers conduct detailed unde rbody searches security personnel should have flashlights or extens ion lamps available for use ƒ closed circuit television cctv cctv can record vehicles entering an ecp for observation by another post and for later review cameras should perimeter security for official use only 643be positioned to prevent vehicle or perimeter lights from blinding the camera cameras placed outside should be protected from the environment ƒ electronic bomb detecti on devices there are many commercially available bomb detection devices available such as xrays that utilize backscatter or transmission imaging which can be used at ecps to augment bomb detection capabilities the mobile search advanced xray portable inspection system and the mobile vacis gamma ray imaging system can also be used to search commercial vehicles overwatch the overwatch for an ecp is manned position that provides observation and has the ability to employ deadly force agai nst vehicles and attackers that attempt to bypass ram or otherwise run through an ecp overwatch planning considerations include ƒ the overwatch should be equipped with weapon that can stop vehicle by disabling it or killing the driver this weapon should be smaller than an m60 m240g or other type of medi um machine gun other weapons likely to stop vehicle include the m2 5 0 caliber heavy machine gun the mk19 40 mm machine gun and the at4 ƒ the overwatch should be planned and desi gned with the same considerations as those used against an ambush fix the enemy in place so you can kill him first establish kill zone wher the overwatch can engage hostile vehicles second place barriers to slow down th hostile vehicle and keep it in the kill zone as long as possible third position the overwatch to provi effective engagement of the target in the kill zone ƒ once the kill zone is established the maximum range of the weapon systems field of fire should be evalua ted to determine the risk to friendly guard posts and hn buildings nd personnel possibly in the fan ƒ some weapon systems have required minimum range to activate the round the kill zone must be beyond that minimum range for all weapon systems designated for the overwatch position figure 628 m60 overwatch jfob force protection handbook final draft 644 for official use onlyƒ rules of engagement criteria should be defined and readily available for the overwatch position ƒ the overwatch weapon system should require minimal traversing and elevation adjustments to continually bring fire on the kill zone ƒ all overwatch positions s hould be equipped with range cards that denote the weapon systems principal di rection of fire pdf distances to key terrain features or landmarks and the final pr otective line fpl the use of range cards will enhance the gunners ability to quickly zero in on target determine ranges and estimate ranges to other targets ƒ large and strong firing stakes shoul d be used if device is not available to define the fields of fire for the gunner during darkness or periods of low observation ƒ in determining location for the overwat ch security forces should consider the following can the overwatch clearly observe the ecp and its barriers is the overwatch able to clearl determine the circumstances under which he is authorized to employ his weapon is the overwatch able to engage hostile vehicle while it is at least 100 m away what is the effective causality radius ecr of the ammunition used in the overwatch weapon system what are the maximum and minimum ranges of the ammunition are friendly troops to include hn troops and civilians located within the operational zone of the weapon sy stem will rounds ricochet or skip towards friendly troops can the overwatch employ his weapon in less time than it takes vehicle to drive through the kill zone will the overwatch be able to engage the target for 1015 sec how much distance does the overwatch have to engage the target vehicle can the weapon bring enfilade fire to bear on the hostile vehicle antivehicular barrier design antivehicular barrie rs can be used to accomplish many of the design concepts required for ecps in highthreat environments to include containment segregation and compartmentalization of vehicles rejection of unauthorized vehi cles and vehicle speed management in order to be effective antivehicular ba rriers at the ecp should be combination of active and passive barrier s that are integrated w ith the surrounding perimeter barrier system active barriers alone are less likely to stop moving vehicle than their passive static count erparts however when pr operly integrated with passive barriers they can effectively stop vehicles ac tive barriers that can be easily opened and closed can help maintain positive control of the traffic flow perimeter security for official use only 645through the ecp antivehicular barriers s hould be used to c ontrol traffic flow into the search area and through the entrance and exit lanes speed management techniques two elements affect vehicles ability to breach an obstacle speed and weight th speed of hostile vehicle can be managed by use of techniques in the desi gn that force the vehicle to slow down in order to enter or negotiate the tra

niques see figure 627 serpentine pattern for antivehicular barriers due to centrifugal force it is difficult for threat vehicle to drive fast on curve unless the road surface is banked when centrifugal force is great nough the tires of the threat vehicle will overcome the road friction and start to skid the threat vehicle may also overturn if its center of gravity is too hi gh therefore when constructing an anti vehicular barrier system for jfob ec p security forces should consider serpentine pattern the following ta ble and diagram depict recommended distances between barriers as

fragmentation ƒ can the barrier be easily moved to accommodate changes operational capacity fpcon to the ecp ƒ is materiel handling equipment mhe av ailable to place and move barriers ƒ can the barrier be anchored together ƒ can the barrier accommodate additiona l security measures concertina top guard intrusion detection system lighting etc ecp gates the ecp typically ends at the jfob perimeter the ecp should have gate or final denial barrier enabling the ecp to be closed at the jfob perimeter when not in use the gates at ecps should maintain level of security equivalent to that of the adjacent pe rimeter fencebarriers the most common active barriers are cab led crashbeam barriers also known as droparm barriers other active barriers include hydraulic rams and metal crash gates at minimum fence gates should be reinforced with cables to increase resistance to moving vehicle threat gates should be capable of denying access to both vehicles and personnel personnel gates personnel gates should be designed to permit only one person to approach security personnel at any time for pedestrian use single swing gates should be considered as the s econd alternative to turnstile gates perimeter security for official use only 649operational and security personnel re quirements should be considered to determine the best type of personnel gate for jfob examples of personnel gates include single swing gates double swing gate s and turnstile gates single swing gates swing gates should be signed with minimum 4ft 12m wide opening by 8ft 24m high pl us 1ft 305mm of

the jfob will require expedient and effective antivehicular ga tes the selection of antivehicular gates should be based on an analysis of daily peak vehicu lar traffic the operational access control requirements fo r the jfob operating cycle time and the estimated speed of vehicles as they approach the gate during operation antivehicular gates should limit openi ng sizes when possible to decrease openclose cycle time the ecp design di scussed earlier in this section if implemented should slow vehicles to less than 10 mph if this speed is accomplished then lower impact gates such as the droparm gates can be used cabled crash beam and droparm barriers this is the most commonly used active barrier at jfobs one end of the barrier is anchored to surrounding jersey barriers to add wei ght and strength to the barrier the crash beam is kept in the lowered position with the bolt enga ged in the cable loop on the free end of the crash beam and connected to another jersey barrier system the crash beam is raised only to allow authorized entry perimeter security for official use only 651 figure 635 droparm type barriers military vehicleheavy equipmenttrucks if conventional barriers are not available military vehicle truck or other heavy vehicle bulldozer dump truck can be used to block an entrance to increase its effectiveness cable should be run through the frame of the truck and be anchored to adjacent barriers tire shredderspuncture strips although tire shredderspuncture strips will not stop vehicle they may help cause vehicle to lose control when combined with other obstacles vehicle which speeds over shredderspuncture strips will identify itself to the overwatch as havi ng hostile intent tire shredderspuncture strips also prevent friendly vehicles from accidentally running through an ecp and receiving fire from the overwatch these systems should not be considered vehicle barriers and are included here only as an option for slowing vehicle either prior to its impact with barrier or in an area where two to three times the required standoff distance between the entr point and the protected structure is available these systems may not be effective against modern run flat tires heavyduty offroad truck tires or extra wide tires that can bridge over two or more spikes figure 636 tire shredder puncture strip jfob force protection handbook final draft 652 for official use onlycabledreinforced chain link fence gates if cablereinforced chain link fence gates are used to secure jfob then wheelsupported or cantilever sliding gates are the best selection for vehicle security swing gates are the least desirable because they require large arc of space for operation that large sweeping arc can cause the ecp to be more vulnerable the locking mechanism and the hinges on the chain link fence gate are the weakest components of the gate system these areas can be reinforced by combining chain and wire rope cable to form barrier across the opening once the chain and wire rope have been installed the energy of vehicle crash attempt is transferred from the gate through wire rope links to the side gate posts and further to the fence cable reinforcement system and deadman concrete anchors figure 637 locking mechanism for chain link fence gate there is generic or standard solution for hardening the various configurations of sliding gates however 34in 191mm wire rope cable can be attached along the length of sliding gate the cable ends are then looped securely around the gate frame uprights at each d and affixed to deadman concrete anchors the end of the fence reinforcement cable system should be looped around the terminal posts on each side of the gate opening all cable ends should be looped and terminated with either three wire rope clamps or hydraulically swaged wire rope fittings higher impact gate designs higher impact gate designs should be installed in the ecp if the speed of approaching ve hicles is expected to be greater the usaf

choose to enforce strict light discipline if so the type of lighting used on the perimeter and at the ecp may be limited regardless protective lighting should enable security force personnel to observe activities around or inside the jfob without disclosing their presence adequate lighting for all approaches to jfob not only discourages attempted unauthorized entry but also reveals persons within the area security lighting accomplishes the following aids threat detection asse ssment and interdiction serves as deterrent increases the effectiveness of the s ecurity force and electronic security systems by increasing visibility rang during periods of darkness or by illuminating an area where natural light is insufficient lighting should not be used alone ligh ting should supplement other measures such as fixed security posts or patrols fences and alarms requirements for protective lighting at jfob will be determined by assets and areas to be protected jfob layout terrain weather conditions security requirements the overall goal is to provide the prope r environment for pe rsonnel to perform duties such as identification of badge s and personnel at gates inspection of unusual or suspicious circumstances etc where lighting is impractical additional compensating measures must be instituted the remainder of this section discusses lighting concepts st andard types of lig hting and related lighting issues for guardhouses and ecps security lighting concepts security forces may need to see for long distances at differing lowlevel contrasts identify indistinct outlines of silhouettes and must be able to spot an intruder who may be exposed to view for only few seconds higher levels of bri ghtness improve all of these abilities when planning security lighting security forces should consider the following concepts ƒ security lighting is most effective when it adequately prov ides glaring light in the eyes of the intruder but does not illuminate security forces ƒ highbrightness contrast between in truder and background should be the first consideration ƒ the volume and intensity of lighting shoul d vary according to the surfaces to be illuminated jfob force protection handbook final draft 660 for official use onlyƒ dark dirty surfaces or surfaces painted with camouflage pa int require more illumination than surfaces with clean concrete light brick or glass ƒ rough uneven terrain with dense underb rush requires more illumination to achieve constant level of bright ness than do desert landscapes ƒ in cases where light discipline is stric tly enforced an alternative to bright illumination is the use of night vision devices and infrared detection systems security lighting best practices to be effective installed security lighting should accomplish the following ƒ provide adequate illumination or comp ensating measures to discourage or detect attempts to enter the jfob or restricted areas and to reveal the presence of unauthorized persons within such areas ƒ avoid glare that handicaps security force personnel or is objectionable to air rail highway or navigable water traffic ƒ direct illumination toward likely ave nues of approach and provide relative darkness for patrol roads paths and pos ts to minimize exposure of security force personnel lighting at entry points should be directed at the gate and the guard should be in the shadows this type of lighting technique is often called glare projection ƒ illuminate shadowed areas caused by structures within or adjacent to restricted areas ƒ provide overlapping light distribu tion equipment selection should be designed to resist the effects of environmental conditions and all components of the system should be cated to provide maximum protection against intentional damage ƒ avoid drawing unwanted atten tion to restricted areas ƒ be expandable so that future requirem ents of electronic security systems ie cctv and recognition factor s can be installed where color recognition will be factor fullspectrum high pressure sodium vapor etc lighting vice single co lor should be used ƒ use lights that illuminate the ground or water but not the air above these lights must penetrate fog and rain types of perimeter lighting ƒ continuous lighting continuous lighti ng is the most common protective lighting system it consists of seri of fixed lights arranged to flood given area continuously w ith overlapping cones of light during the hours of darkness two primary methods of c ontinuous lighting are glare projection and controlled lighting this type of lighting may not be desirable for jfobs where light discipline is must as continuous lighting could help attackers pinpoint the location of the jfob ƒ glare lighting glare lighting is installed slightly inside security perimeter and directed outward it is considered deterrent to potential intruder perimeter security for official use only 661because it makes it difficult for him to see inside the area being protected it also protects the guard by keeping hi m in comparative darkness and enabling him to observe intruders at consid erable distance beyond the perimeter ƒ standby lighting standby lighting is similar to continuous lighting however this lighting is not continuously lighted but is either automatically or manually turned on only when suspici ous activity is detected or suspected by the security force or intrusion dete ction systems this type of lighting may be very effective in highth reat environments like jfob ƒ emergency lighting emergency lighting may duplicate any or all of the above systems its use is limited to times of emergencies that render the normal system inoperative it depends on alternative power sources such as installed or portable ge nerators or batteries ƒ motionactivated lighting motionactivat ed lighting can be very effective in deterring intruders as it is turned on by the intruders movement into protected area lighting considerations for guardhouses exterior lighting for sentry booths and guardhouses should be designed to minimize exposure of security personnel glare protection lighting is directed at the gate while the guardhouse remains in the shadows the interior lighting in the guardhouse should be diffused lighting designed to aid night vision and provide additional security to the occupants night light units with red lens enhance the occupants night time vision guardhouses should have standby power source lighting considerations for ecps within the ecp the lighting requirements vary depending on the type of zone nd light discipline restrictions unified facilities criteria ufc 401201 s ecurity engineering entry control facilitiesaccess control points provi des specific details and requirements

should provide enough intensity so that pedestrians s ecurity personnel is lands signage and other hazards are visible the lighting should not be directed in the drivers eyes and should not backlight importa nt signage or s ecurity personnel transitional lighting is necessary on pproaches to the ecp so that drivers are not blinded during arrival and departure ƒ access control zone lighting in th access control zone area lighting provided in the vicinity of the search facilities shoul d be at higher level to facilitate identification and inspec tion procedures the lighting should illuminate the exterior and interior of vehicle in addition to good vertical illumination additional task lighting may be necessary for adequate identification of vehicle occupants nd contents such lighting should be directed across the roadway it will then illuminate the ro adway in front of the guardhouse the driver and the secu rity personnel lighting may also be mounted at or below pavement level to facilitate undervehic inspection ƒ restrike or restart capability anothe r important consider ation in the design of jfob ecp lighting is the restart or restrike time for the selected lamps restart occurs when lamp experiences loss of power and there is delay jfob force protection handbook final draft 662 for official use onlybefore backup power restores power to the lamp and trigge rs the subsequent restrike or restart of the lamp as an example high intensity discharge hid lamps are more energy conserving than incandescent lamps however they require several minutes to warm up nd restart after power is interrupted this warmup period could be 15 to 20 minutes an unsatisfactory delay for highthreat security operations the sele ction of light sources especially in the access control zone should include an evaluation of rest art or restrike time it may be necessary to provid lamps and auxiliary equipment with rapid startup and restrike to ensure nimal adequate lighting in the event of power interruption ƒ general requirements the ecp s hould be provided with multiple redundant lighting to ensure that the loss of single luminary does not seriously degrade the total lighting av ailable for security personnel the lighting at the ecp should be designed as controlled lighting to increase traffic safety glare proj ection or glare lighting should be avoided where safety hazard would be created hardened fighting position s towers overwatch hardened fighting positions chapter 8 provides designs and detailed instructions for using hesco bastion and metal

involves inherent risks in high threat environments like those for jf obs in iraq and afghanistan security personnel cannot rely solely on ids rather ids should be an essential part of an integrated and layered appro ach to jfob force protection objectives of ids and surveillance systems ids are used to accomplish the following permit more economical and efficien t use of security personnel provide additional controls at critical areas or points enhance the security force capability to detect and defeat intruders provide the earliest practical warning to security forces of any attempted penetration of protected areas ids and surveillance systems functional requirements regardless of the type of system us ed to perform intrusion detection or surveillance certain f unctions must be achieved by the systems threat detection the earlier that threats are detected and the greater the distance that they are detected the greater the opportunities to protect jfob personnel assets and materiel wide variety of systems can be used to detect the presence of ac tivity at distance from the jfob however several factors can influence system performance seasonal andor ambient weather conditions the type of background against which systems are attempting to operate for example motion detection systems work well in remote environments but can suffer data overload in an urban environment environmental andor geographical locations where the systems are placed for example key terrain hills ditches roads or on fixed man made barriers fences walls barriers the number and variety of systems used threat annunciation the threat detected by the security system must be reported to central information pro cessing center from which security forces can be dispatched this annunciation capability should have redundancy threat assessment and classification once data is received in the information processing center the detected data must be assessed and classified to determine whether the alarm is real or false and whether the intrusion is hostile or be nign cctv can assist in the assessment of ids jfob force protection handbook final draft 668 for official use

arriving ids selection considerations the requirement for an ids must be identified and determined during the site selecti on and jfob layout planning process see chapter 5 the ids required cannot be completely identified until the proposed jfob layout plan has been developed perimeter ids designed to provide detection along long perimeter may result in high system costs for installation operation and maintenance regardless th standard for selection of an ids should be optimal performance achievable in local environmental conditions such as soil topography w eather and other factors these factors can adversely affect performance or increase false alarm an alarm without known cause rates therefore to ensure an effective system is selected the performance parameters of the system should be primary concerns including completeness of coverage false and nuisance alarm rates probability of detection zone at which the alarm occurred delay time if the delay time is too low then the time available for effective security force response may not be adequate the re lationship between perimeter sensor location delay times and security for ce response times must be carefully examined the us

this handbook types of ids several types of sensors microwave passiveactive infrared seismic magnetic are used throughout the uscentcom aor while sensors are not by themselves layer of defe nse they can greatly improve the effectiveness of security personnel types of ids sens ors include the following passive infrared passive infrared pir also known as thermal infrared alarms are generated by change of thermal radiance within the detection zone daytime nuisance alarms can be activated by backgrounds having variety of materials that are alternately sunlit and shaded due to intermittent cloud cover the likelihood of daytime nuisance alarms is low on overcast days or when the ids s detection zone is shaded active infrared an active infrared id s detects target when the pulsed infrared beam that transmits across the detection zone is interrupted the beams are not visible to the eye multip beams are arrayed vertically to provide lineofsight detection to th height desired their vertical spacing defines the detection pattern the distance of the detection zone can vary from 300 to 1200 feet microwave radar there are two t ypes of microwave radar sensors bistatic systems that have separate transmitter and receiver units and monostatic systems that combine the tr ansmit and receive functions in one unit these sensors generate an alar m when the receiver detects change in the microwave field the change can be caused by microwaves scattering off an intruder nuisance alarms can be triggered by site conditions such as reflections from meta l objects or water or heavy rain or snow also vegetation and piled sand can shield crawling intruder from detection nearinfrared beambreak nearinfrared beambreak sensors are active systems that alarm when nearinfrared beam between transmitter and receiver units is inte rrupted for certain duration beambreak sensors located near the ground in order to detect crawling intruder can be vulnerable to nuisance alarms cause d by blowing drifts of sand or vegetation growing into the beam to ensure detecti on of crawling intruder the detection zone should be level with elevated areas to shield the intruder or hollows to conceal him fencemounted this is broad categor of sensors that are designed to alarm when the security fence to whic h they are attached is being cut or climbed they detect fence distur bance mechanically by the following means lost contact when mass is bounced off support electrically by frictiongenerated ch arge transfer between the inner and outer portions of cable attached to the fence triboelectric charge transfer generated in dielectric within sensor cable subjected to mechanical stress piezoelectric jfob force protection handbook final draft 670 for official use onlyo relative motion between conducto r and chargestoring dielectric electret optically by changes in the pattern of standing waves of light in optical fiber cables attached to the fence changes in fence motion depend on how well the fence posts are anchored in the soil and how stiff the fence pane ls are the stronger the fence the less likely the incidence nuisan ce alarms caused by wind loading taut wire taut wire sensors alarm at the displacement of strand of wire under tension this ids is installed as physical barrie r consisting of vertical array of wires parallel to the ground w ith additional wires on angled outriggers only few centimeters of vertical clearance separates two wires or separates the bottom wire and either the ground surface or the top of wall or fence an intrude r cannot pass his body through the gap without deflecting one or two adjacent wires ground motion buried ground motion sens ors consist primarily of fiber optic cable the cable sensor det ects ground motion optically by changes in the pattern of standing waves of li ght in optical fiber cables buried at shallow 5 to 9cm depth the cabl is generally laid in serpentine pattern to give dense coverage sa nd gravel and wet or loose soil are favorable burial mediums for ground motion ids windinduced motion of surface objects whose motion couples into the ground is the primary cause of weather related nuisance alarms ported coaxial cable buried electromagnetic sensors are commonly referred to as ported coaxial cable systems this type of ids is activated by disturbance in the electromagne tic field between two active cables one transmitter and the other recei ver of electromagnetic energy the two cables may be placed in separate trenches or they may be encased together and laid in single trench burial depth is typically shallow the electromagnetic field extends above the ground surface establishing volumetric detection zone wet soil in the detection zone may be persistent condition because of poor dr ainage or it may occur temporarily during after rainfall the correct location will eliminate this problem nuisance alarms can be caused by the motion of surface water or metallic objects seismic seismic sensors detect ground mo tion their detection range is greater for moving vehicle than fo r moving person seismic sensors are omnidirectional which generally renders them inappropriate for situations where legitimate activ ity is ongoing near the area being monitored for intruders in such situ ations the seismic sensor does not discriminate between ground motion ge nerated by the legitimate activity and ground motion generated by an appr oaching intruder seismic sensors are best used in remote areas where human or vehicle generated ground motion is the exception acoustic acoustic sensors are not used to detect personnel they detect vehicles on the basis of the noise ge nerated by the vehicle an acoustic perimeter security for official use only 671sensor microphone typically is used in conjunction with ground motion sensor geophone the sensor packag reacts first to the geophone signal as an indication of intruder activity and then if certain criteria are met it analyzes the acoustic signal to confir m that vehicle is operating nearby if the acoustic sensor activates only after ground motion criteria are met then weather conditions that impede ground motion can prevent or reduce the likelihood of ac oustic detections magnetic magnetic sensors detect movement of ferrous metal they have short detection range the actual detection range depends on how much ferrous metal is carried by person or vehicle moving past the sensor personnel lacking metal objects woul d not be expected to activate magnetic sensor consequently magnetic sensors are most effective when used in conjunction with another t ype of ids that has the potential of discriminating between alarms cause d by human activity and those caused by wildlife break wire breakwire sensor must be in contact with the intruder for an alarm to be generated the intr uder person or vehicle physically breaks the tripwire resulting in an arm the extent of the sensors detection zone is determined by the ngth of wire in use the ids must be manually reset after each break of the wire there is detection capability from the time the wire is broken by an intruder until the ids is reset electrostatic fieldcapacitance this sensor class includes electric field and capacitance systems these sensor s consist of vertical array of horizontal wires that are freestanding or mounted to chain link fence the wires detect an intruder as he pproaches the wire array or extends part of his body between pair of wire s by sensing his disturbance of the electrostatic field between the wire s and the ground the intruder does not have to contact the wires vegetation that extends into the electrostatic field moving water and wind induced motion of the wire arrays are potential causes of nuisance alarms cctv though not as effective as direct observation cctv is often used to augment security forces when manpower is limited cctv is most effective when it is linked to motion detectors and has dedicated operator monitoring the system cctv cameras should have pan tilt and zoom capability to allow the operator to track suspicious activities when encased in mirrored globes cameras can be moved to track personnel without their knowledge mirrored globes alone can be used to hide false cameras that give the perception that an area is being observed by cctv automated video surveillance systems avs avs

perimeter security discussion c hapter 6 was presented prior to discussion of internal security in order to indicate the focus of effort and priority of work for force protection operations whether establishing new jfob or falling in on an already existing jfob m ilitary leaders should focus initially on establishing or reassessing force protec tion measures at the perimeter of the base once these measures are adequate attention can be directed to internal security procedures internal security cons ists of those measures used to protect personnel or assets located on the interior of the base regardless of the type of measure implemented force protection team approach should be used to develop internal security procedures and manage the overall jfob force protection mission unity of command the jfob commander is responsible for base force protection and security operations in this capacity the jfob co mmander should use all available assets within the perimeter to create the requi red level of security accordingly the jfob commander may for purposes of base force protection and security exercise temporary operational control opcon or tactical control tacon over tenant and transient units from ot her services or functional components for official use only 71that are assigned or attach ed to the base commanders at all levels assigned attached opcon or tacon to the jfob commander have the responsibility to ensure that all base force protection security and defense procedures are executed accordingly unity of command is essential to this concept of jfob force protection unity of command will help to overcome the challenges created when different units from different commands with di fferent missions are assigned to support the jfobs force protection mission seni or commander in this case the jfob commander will provide the authority to bring the various units together to accomplish the mission jfob command relationships should be established early ideally prior to the units occ upying the jfob in addition the jfob commander should define areas of res ponsibility not only for units occupying the jfob but also for the surrounding area that has direct influence on the security of the jfob coordination and cooperation critical to the success of the jfob fo rce protection mission is the need for coordination and cooperation among the units tasked with supporting the jfob these units must build operational relati onships based on trust and confidence and mutual support to encourage this sense of cooperation and to further the building of unit interrelationships the jfob operations officer force protection officer and the force protection working group should take the lead in orchestrating the coordina tion and cooperation effort force protection team team approach should be implemented in order to have an effective jfob force protection program for the team to interact efficiently all participants should understand the concepts roles and capabilities of the other members jfob operations officer the jfob operations officer serves as th principal staff officer responsible for planning coordinating nd executing all aspects of jfob force protection operations the jfob operations officer appoints and should rely heavily on the jfob force protection officer to accomplish these tasks jfob force protection officer the jfob force protection officer functi ons as the principal advisor to the commander and operations officer on l force protection matters primary responsibilities should include coordinating the sharing of

curity equipment measuresbarriers availability of tenant it assigned attached or other supporting security forces installation population and composition of the jfob criticality of assets being protected in all instances the security force regardless of size should meet the requirement for reaction force capability since two jfobs have the same security requirements it is not feasible to establish theaterwide criteria for the required number of posts in all cases the number of posts should be based on an an alysis of security post requirements systems approach should be used to perform the analysis it should not be based upon convenience pertinent to this appro ach is consideration of the following security mission being performed available manpower existing security measures planned upgrades such as clos ing of nonessential posts and the employment of mechanical and elec tronic physical s ecurity technology barriers electronic security systems etc systems approach to determining secu rity force requirements should include consideration of the fact ors listed above and as minimum the following security force considerations ƒ what commander or staff has overall re sponsibility for the jfobs security force ƒ what is the commanders intent for the security force ƒ what security force strength and composition are needed to meet the commanders intent and

appropriate security post requirements and considerations the specific post requirements and operati ng procedures for the jfob should be established with the help of jfob operational and security force personnel jfob force protection handbook final draft 76 for official use onlysecurity force personnel are normally ployed throughout the jfob in various operating configurations that include the following entry control points ecpgates due to the heavy manpower requirement associated with ecpsgates see chapter 6 these posts should be limited to the minimum number required to permit expeditious flow of traffic in and out of the jfob operating hours for each ecpgate determine manning requirements accordingly jfobs with limited number of security personnel should consider limiting the operating hours of ecpsgates peakhour augmentation requirements should be included in postmanning calcu lations however using personnel obtained temporarily from mob ile posts to man fixed posts reduces emergency response capability perimeter observation posts ops the justification for perimeter posts is in direct proportion to the n ecessity for preventing unauthorized entry and the need to maintain continuous observation along the perimeter effective perimeter security requires combination of physic security measures such as physical barriers fencing protective lig hting and electronic security systems all of these measures should be observed and assesse d continuously by security personnel see chapter 6 the number of perime ter posts should be based on this observation and assessment requirement restricted area posts restricted areas are normally established to limit access to critical assets such as command headquarters or communications complex an interior guard force shoul d be assigned the responsibility of protecting restricted areas and critical assets the strength of the interior guard must be commensurate with the importan ce of the areaassets being protected and the threat mobileroving patrols twoperson patrols are normally adequate these patrols can be either vehicula r or foot patrols and should patrol specific area of the jfob responding as necessary for example roving patrol may be dispatched on an alarm to conduct preliminary assessment followed by full response from qrf if real threat pres ents itself roving patrols can make the defensive plan of jfob unpredictable while making it easier to maintain observation over large area however because of their continuous mobile nature roving patrols cannot provide tinuous observation of specific area consequently someone attempting to infi ltrate jfob can hide whenever he hears mobile patrol approaching or vehicle lights or has determined the patterns to the patrols roving patr ols can mitigate this weakness with unpredictable routes and patrol times or by stopping occasionally turning off the vehicle and observing an ar ea in the darkness for 15 to 20 min at night patrols can use night vision devices and blackout lights roving patrols are most effective when integrated with fixed ops on the jfob perimeter the roving patrols provide immediate investigation of any suspicious activities identified by fixed ops provide rapid response to any hostile activities an d can inspect dead zones or other areas which are not visi ble from the op any roving patrols outside the fence line must be coordina ted with the hn prior to the patrols commencing visitor escorts unless the jfob has the manpow er to do so fulltime posts for visitor escorts manned by security force personnel should not be established internal security for official use only 77rather the unit or facility sponsoring the visitor should be responsible for escorting the visitor the person receiving visitors should escort visitors in and out of the jfob as determined by th commanding officer and applicable orders securityforce orderschecklists also called special security instructions ssis security force instructions sfis and special security orders sso s security force orders or checklists describe responsibilities and authorize s ecurity force personnel to execute and enforce regulations therefore the commander of each jfob should publish sign and maintain security force orderschecklists security force checklists should be speci fically written for each post and should describe the guards

circumstances and limitati ons under which forces will initiate andor continue combat engagement with other forces encountered jfob force protection handbook final draft 710 for official use onlyroe are commanders rules for the use of force roe determine when where and how force shall be used such rule s can be both general and specific roe focus on four issues when force may be used where force may be used against whom force should be used in the circumstances described above how force should be used to achieve the desired ends as result roe take two forms actions soldier may take without consulting higher authority unless explicitly forbidden actions that may only be taken if exp licitly ordered by higher authority roe can be topdriven meaning that higher echelon commander for instance the us central command uscentcom commander establishes roe that must be disseminated verbatim to all lower echelons the preferred method because it encourages lower echelon in itiative is for roe to be topfed meaning that higherechelon commande r establishes rules for immediate subordinate echelons these s ubordinate echelons in turn disseminate roe that are consistent with those of higher hea dquarters but tailored to the particular units mission jfob roe considerations prior to drafting roe for jfob for ce protection commanders should first review uscentcom combined force land component commander cflcc and any other higher echelon roe and guidance in addition to the security force standi ng orders personnel involved in the jfob force protection mission should be provide d roe before performing any aspect of the mission the roe should cover circ umstances such as how to retaliate after an attack how to treat captured targets and how fo rce should be used during the operation roe considerations include the first rule of engagement is always the right to use force in selfdefense and the commanders right and obligation to selfdefense roe should evolve with force protec tion mission requirements should be tailored to mission realities and should be consistent with unit initiative roe should be flexible and designed to best support the mission through various operational phases and should reflect changes in the threat effective roe should be enforceable understandable ta ctically sound consistent and legally sufficient internal security for official use only 711 effective roe should not assign specific tasks or drive specific tactical solutions they should allow commander to quickly and clearly convey to subordinate units desired postu re regarding the use of force roe need to balance two competing goals the need to use force effectively to accomplish the mission objectives the need to avoid unnecessary force excessively tight roe can constrain commander from performing his mission effectively excessively loose roe can facilitate the escalation of conflict which while being tactically effective can negate the political objectives that the use of force was meant to achieve roe must strike balance between force protection and mission objectives roe should be permissive rather than restrictive roe planning should receive at least the same careful consideration as courses of action development this objective is best guaranteed by the commanders dedicating the right amount of time for insightful planning of the roe and on continuous basis roe should be fully understood by opera tional forces this goal can only be accomplished through training on the roe military units strive to train like we fight roe trai ning should be different understanding and appli cation of the roe could become critical element in the success or failu re of the mission therefore it is essential that roe training take on the same significance as any other combat skill roe never justify illegal actions in all situations soldiers and commanders use force that is necessary and proportional commanders at all levels should continually review the roe to ensure their effectiveness in light of current and projected conditions in their area of operations roe key points soldiers have an inherent right to selfdefense only the minimum essential force nece ssary to neutralize the threat should be used any use of force should be pr oportional with the threat the roe places very few limits on the use of force but security force personnel should only use force when absolutely necessary and should avoid collateral damage jfob force protection handbook final draft 712 for official use only when in doubt soldiers should remember ramp r return

the effect of terrorist and other security threats to dod units and activities complete discussion of the dod fpcon system can be found in dod o200012h dod antiterrorism handbook although not applicable in combat zone these measures can be used as template in the development of prudent force protection measures for jfob in the absence of any other force protect ion guidance the fpcon measures can serve as the principal means through which the prudent jfob commander can apply an operational decision on how to best guard against the threat random antiterrorism measures rams rams change the security atmosphere surrounding jfob when implemented in truly random fashion rams alter th external appearance or security signature of jfob so that insurgents c onducting surveillan ce cannot identify force protection patterns rams present the insurgents with an ambiguous security profile for the jfob the impact of rams is difficult to measure but internal security for official use only 713such programs introduce uncertainty for planners and organizers of insurgent attacks rams provide the jfob with the following advantages variation in security routines makes it harder for terrorists to identify important assets or build detailed desc riptions of signifi cant routines or predict movement within targ eted facility or installation rams increase awareness for jfob personnel and force protectionsecurity personnel rams reduce adverse operational imp acts and unplanned economic costs when enhanced force protection fp measures must be maintained for extended periods the basic approach to implementing ra ms is to identify force protection condition fpcon measures or other sitespecific measures that can be randomly employed to supplement the measures already in place purposes of rams rams can be used as tool to test which measures have higher costs to jfob in terms of productivity than others rams can help identify those measures that security personnel and the installation infrastructure are more capable of sustaining and thos that will be unduly stressful on human and materiel resources rams provide security for ces with training and simulation by keeping the guard force interested and alert ram programs appear to increase security even if they do so only by making the security forces more attentive to their regular assignments rams change the security atmosphere surrounding jfob and convey an external impression of greater vigi lance and awareness rams may force insurgents to ponder the question do they know we are here and have we been compromised and ask what is the impact of these new security practices on our ability to achieve our operational goals ram considerations rams are part of proactive and dyna mic force protection program jfob commanders should consider the follo wing factors when developing and implementing rams rams are not without cost impl ementation of rams will consume security force and other personnel time energy efforts and resources as with changes in the operational tempo of any organization there is likely to be slight increase in accidents minor mishaps wear and tear on materials and equipment rams should be visible to confuse surveillance attempts and should involve the command as whole not just the security forces jfob force protection handbook final draft 714 for official use only to be effective tenant and transient units must be fully integrated into and support the jfob ram program rams s hould not be limited to security force personnel only rams should be used thr oughout all threat levels and should include other measures not normally associated with fpcon measures such as commanddeveloped measures or locallydeveloped sitespecific measures to confuse insurgent surveillance attempts rams should be implemented in strictly irregular fashion never us ing set time frame or location for given measure prior to implementation local threat capabilities should be assessed and then effective ram countermeasures identified rams should help to mitigat jfob vulnerabilities rams should be conducted bo th internally to the jf ob and externally in coordination with

defenseindepth plan for the jfob is the use of structures that ar designed to protec t personnel and other assets from the effects of threat weapons in this case vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbieds and rockets artillery and mortars rams this chapter groups these structures as follows sidewall protection and revetments walls or barriers designed to stop fragments and reduce blast effects from nearmiss impacts of ram rounds revetments are used to provid fullheight sidewall protection and to form wall around open stores of cr itical equipment or material assets some revetment designs can also function as vehicle barriers see chapter 6 compartmentalization series of interconnected walls designed to divide large areas of high occupancy in to smaller protected areas so as to limit casualties from impacts of ram rounds overhead cover structure designed to provide protection from the direct impact of incoming rams the concept consists of predetonation layer that activates the incoming rounds fuse causi ng it to detonate and shielding layer that stops the fragme nts and reduces the blast effects personnel and equipment bunkers purposebuilt stru ctures designed to withstand both near miss and direct hits of rams for official use only 81 hardened fighting and observation positions similar to personnel and equipment bunkers except they have ap ertures for return ing or initiating fire use of existing structures depending on constructi on type and standoff existing structures can provide prot ection against vbieds and rams if required there are retrofit constr uction techniques for increasing protection protection from vbieds and rams shoul d be considered during the jfob planninglayout stage rather than trying to include it after the jfob is occupied however this may not be practical due to constraints on available resources lack of time manpower materi als equipment funds etc if the desired level of protection fr om vbieds and rams cannot be provided during the expeditionary and initial stage of the jfob at minimum plan should be established for implementing and increasing levels of protection as the jfob evolves to the extent plausible locations in which personnel routinely work eat or sleep should be hardened in addition hardened positions such as bunkers and foxholes with overhead cover should be provided in immediate proximity to all unprotected areas in which personnel must work or transit within the jfob the axiom continue to improve the position for as long as it is occupied remains valid the following prio rity of effort should be considered ƒ provide perimeter fighting positions provide personnel bunkers at various locations throughout the jfob for tem porary protection if given sufficient warning ƒ where available use existing buildings for protection from vbieds and nearmiss rams after ensuring sufficient standoff to perimeter is available windows are removed andor openings boarded over walls are minimum of 8inthick concrete masonry units providing low level of protec tion from fragments ƒ provide full height sidewall protecti on for all billeting high occupancy and other critical facilities such as the dining facility dfac and base defense operations center bdoc ƒ compartmentalize large area high occupancy facilities such as dfacs ƒ provide overhead cover in corporating predetonation and shielding layers for billeting areas highoccupancy and other critical facilities ƒ provide bunkers and revetments for protection of critical equipment sidewall protection and revetments revetments are simply walls designed to provide protection from the blast and fragment effects from nearmiss rams on of the most efficient materials for stopping fragments is dense granular so il such as sand thus most revetment designs are just variations of techniques to hold the soil in vertical position the primary uses of revetments on the jfob are as walls and vehicle barriers along the jfob perimeter and at entry control points ecps jfob force protection handbook final draft 82 for official use only as means of providing fullheight sidewall protection for softsided structures such as tents nd trailers

description sandbagging is traditional method to provide protection from fragmentation sandbag wall can be constructed to be either freestanding or supported on one side by the structure it is protecting for tents freestanding wall 6 to 7 ft high should be constructed for trailers the wall may need to be higher 8 to 9 ft to account for the dditional crawl space under the trailers pertinent

depending on climate and sandbag material sandbags may deteriorate rapidly in some cases in iraq sandbags have been known to fail after only two months the proximity of th fill sand area to the site will greatly affect the speed of construction and the final cost caution should be used when constructing walls over 4 ft high since they may become unstable construction procedure fill sandbags with clean dry sand or any granular material loose gravel or crushed rock is prohibited ce it can become secondary fragment source in the event of highexplosive threat stack filled sandbags in the manner

description hesco bastion concertainer is the brand name for commonly used revetment used in iraq and referred to as hesco the hesco wall sections consist of series of large linked lf supporting cells each cell consists of collapsible wire mesh lined with geotex tile fabric the cells are connected at the corners with spiral wire hinges that allow the wall sections to be expanded from compact folded storage confi guration the advantage of using this material is that during transport the ce lls are collapsed and upon arrival at the final destination expanded and filled this allows the walls to be transported at only 5 percent of the asconstructed volum to deploy the wall sections are expanded positioned and filled the wall sections can be connected to form longer walls separated to form shorte r sections or stacked to increase wall height pertinent data hescos come in nine si zes and two colors all of which have nsns see table 81 limitations the wall requires welldrained fl at level and stable site to prevent sagging and tipping if anticipated use is longer than 6 months use an improved foundation the proper placement of the sand infill is critical to the performance of the structure make sure it is compacted or the wall will sag and collapse in few months or have defo rmed appearance fabric material used as liner is uv sensitive and will grade over time also note that hesco

facilities etc from the threat of fragmenting weapons detonating within the facility the ultimate objective of compartmentalization is to divide rge area occupied by high numbers of soldiers into smaller compartments as shown in figure 822 constructing protective walls capable of providing ballistic protection creates the compartments and thus weapons fragme ntation effects are confined to an area smaller than that which would have b een affected if the walls were not in place since by definition the primary th reat of fragmenting weapon is its capability to generate fragmented projectiles the primary objective of compartmentalization is to contain these fragmentation effects for the weapons of concern in iraq 120 mm mortar and 122 mm rocket the fragmentation effects will pose far more significant th reat to compartment occupants than blast tests and analysis have shown that the limits of significant blast hazard will not generally extend beyond the compartment in which the weapon detonates in addition to compartm entalization the faci lity also needs fragmentation barriers around the outsid to mitigate blast and fragmentation from near misses minimum height for inte rior walls

from 60 mm mort ar through 122 mm rocket overhead cover providing overhead cover for areas with large concentration of personnel can help protect personnel from direct hits of indirect fire mortars the basic concept shown in figure 827 is to provide predetonati on layer and shielding layer over the personnel being protected the predetonation layer causes the fuse of the incoming mortar round to f unction and detonates the round before it can penetrate inside the facility assuming superquick fuse setting the shielding layer located approximately 5 ft below the predetonation layer mitigates the fragments resulting from round detonation overhead protection should always be used in conjunction with adequate side wall protection to protect from near misses matrix of material options for both the pre detonation and shielding layer is given in tables 86 and 87 figure 827 conceptual overhead cover protection based on recent assessments of critical f acilities throughout iraq that have been identified as primary candidates for ove rhead cover protection the approach for protective construction for official use only 827constructing overhead cover can largely be classified into two categories these categories include 1 internal protection and 2 external pr otection each of these categories is discussed below internal protection as shown in figures 828 through 830 the internal protection approach is generally utilized for large metal buildings that are used for dfacs pxs etc they are characterized by insulated foam panel walls and roofs and are typically surrounded by concrete barriers at some relatively large distance away the approach to constructing th overhead protection is to construct steel frame within the facility and pl ace ballistic grade eglass on top of the new frame to shield occupants from fragments the ove rhead cover structure is constructed in this manner because due to the size of the metal building the required size of structure to go over the top would be prohi bitive in terms of cost and effort the results of numerous experiments indi cate the existing roof material foam panel may act as predetonation laye r for the threat weapons however note that foam panel with different thickness will generate different degrees of reliability for 82 mm mortars and 120 mm mortars reference table 86 recommendations if the existing roof material on

tight sidewall protection although the above describes construc tion of overhead cover this cover does not fully provide protec tion from the overhead threat as shown in figure 829 with exterior barriers placed as much as 75 ft away from the facility there still exists very large area where mortars and rockets can detonate and pose significant hazard to facility occupants therefore it is recommended that in addition to the overhead cover cons truction you place barrier walls of sufficient height tightly against the side of the buildings by doing so as shown in figure 830 you significantly diminish the area over which the facility is vulnerable to attack external protection as shown in figures 831 through 833 the external protection approach is utilized for stru ctures

cover without tight sidewall protection figure 833 external protection over head cover and tight sidewall protection as shown in the above figures overall prot ection from the overhead threat is not solely based on the construction of an overhead structure but is also largely dependent upon the proper placement of sidewall protection although this is the case it should not be immediately assumed that existing barriers placed at distance from the struct ures should be relocated the reason for this is that the existing barriers may likely be servi ng to provide protec tion from threats such as vbieds and if moved would si mply expose the building to different protective construction for official use only 831threat therefore you must consider the array of viable threats posed to each facility and make determination whethe r existing barriers can be relocated or whether new barriers must be acquired when considering barrier locations you must also give thought to ingresseg ress and you must maintained viable accessibility for normal use and in the case of an emergency the previous discussions have focused on the protective measures geometrical layout and how they can be configured to most effectively intercept incoming munitions it is also critical to reite rate the expected performance of the protective system when it does intercept weapon which is largely spelled out in tables 86 and 87 based on guidance provided from multinational corps iraqmultinational forces mncimnf and others the research used to develop this information was targeted at protecting less than permanent facilities as result lightweight costeffective solutions that provide significant mitigation of weapons effect s but do not constitute fully hardened structures have been focus because of the lightweight nature of these protective structures they will not ve the capability to stop highmass projectiles such as dudded mortars rocket motors which continue to travel after detonation and delayfused weapons to pr ovide protective layer sufficient to stop these types of highen ergy projectiles would eas ily constitute fully hardened structure and thus falls beyond th is scope therefore

the existing ½ inch plywood roof is utilized as sacrificial predetonation layer limitations in tests using 120 mm mortars only one fragment penetrated the 3 layer eglass shielding layer but due to inadequate fasteners one eglass panel fell from the supporting beams if great er number of screws had been used to fasten the eglass to the beams it is be lieved that little to damage would have been

c4 systems focus on the networks that allow voice and data communicatio ns among command posts staffs and critical components of the fp activities c4 systems enable commanders and staffs to effectively manage ongoing ope rations without re liable redundant means of communicating threat status intelligence and operations the jfob commander and staff will not have viable common operating picture of the situation nor will they be able to direct actions in timely and proactive manner this chapter will focus on the c4 basic requirements characteristics and considerations required to ma intain minimum operations communications components are the hard ware radios tele phones computers and software operating systems servic specific operating systems associated data networks used to send and receive messages for variety of purposes to accomplish the mission for official use only 101purpose of force protec tion fp c4 systems the primary purpose of fp communications systems is to provide commanders and staffs as well as the resident organizations within the jfob the capability to communicate requirements intelligen ce and situational updates among their respective sites it must encompass or ganizational operations centers and those teams and posts essential to fp examples of fp activities that c4 supports include maintain vigilance against insurgent attack report status of teams and organizations sound alarms request assistance from fire medi cal or other emergency response resources call for rapid response forces quick reaction forces close air support or fire support direct counterstrikes coordinate incident response nd consequence management tasks characteristics of fp c4 systems jfob c4 system is composed of multiple systems and must be capable of simultaneous real time or near real time communications among defense units staff elements headquarters and opera tions centers it must allow for immediate and continuous access to the ba defense operations center bdoc by sector command posts mobile reserve patrols and critical defense positions additionally the c4 systems should llow continuous access by the bdoc to the base operations center rear area operations center rear tactical operations center coalition and host nation hn forces as well as access by supporting intelligencecounterintelligence fi re support and air defense units the jfob c4 system architecture mu st also possess the following minimum characteristics secure the system must be able to restrict unauthorized monitoring and access to prevent information from being provided to unauthorized personnel the jfob commander force protection officer and communicationsc4 officer must insure that all systems meet all guidance from higher headquarters commands re garding policies on encryption unauthorized personnel must not be allowed access to information over the systems robust the systems must be able to withstand both the natural and man made interference that may be in the ar ea weather heat cold rain etc can dramatically impact radio systems and this impact must be evaluated prior to establishing the systems man made factors such as interference created by urban areas high tension power line s commercial radio transmitters cell phone towers nd interference from radar and directional systems will impede communications and must be identified jfob force protection handbook final draft 102 for official use onlyand factored into the plan prior to sy stem establishment additionally the system must be developed to withstand single point of failure brought on by enemy attack redundant to be robust system must have duplicate and offer multiple links reliance on any single form of communications radio telephone data etc will not suppor t the commanders requirements every jfob should have minimu m of three alternate means of communications each should be properly identified as primary secondary and tertiary that work as failsafe systems in the event of major attack or loss due to weather or interference these three systems must be separate in type so as not to be impacted by the same event reliable systems must be dependabl use of both commercialoffthe shelf cots communications tech nology and dodprovided systems is the norm but each system and network must be researched as to its specific reliability systems with low mean time between failure or limited capabilities must not be relied on as key systems additionally periodic and thorough maintenance of all systems must be directed and properly conducted to ensure system stability jfob c4 considerations planning preexecution planning is essential to the successful installation operation and maintenance of jfob force protection c4 systems the force protection officer and the communicationsc4 officer shoul d be involved in the communication construction planning well in advance of execution their planning will drive numerous other aspects of the force protection plan as well as potentially identifying the joint agency selected to perform communication construction when planning for redundant and re liable jfob communications the communicationsc4 officer and the antiterr orismfp officer need to know how many systems are needed why they are need ed and the cost if they have to be acquired they must also identify t hose systems which meet the needs for security system capabilities range power requirements and battery life operator training requirements frequency requirements desired capabilities at the deployed location appropriate directives from theater and higher headquarters as well as hn support and re quirements for interoperability with their security forces civil engineering or department of public works dpw the communicationsc4 officer must velop signal operating instructions and communication plans and disseminate th em to tenant and supporting units jfob communications plans must be inte grated into the joint communications

and c4 effectiveness the following list of considerations shoul d be addressed in all c4 plans at minimum communications for official use only 103o requirements the actual c4 requirement must be understood and assessed for feasibility requirements must be based on need not want fiscal limitations will prevent the ac quisition of state of the art systems used by commercial and most stateside garrison organizations the jfob fp officer must work with the co mmunicationsc4 officer to clearly identify the requirements they mu st identify equipment and network capabilities that meet the requiremen t and the capabilit ies of the units users and services to employ those assets security as previously stated security of the systems must be paramount controlled access must be limited to those with need to know and all efforts must be taken to limit information from getting into the hands of unauthorized indivi duals access to siprnet and niprnet data systems must be controlled and users trained as to their responsibilities likewise access to communications systems such as radios and telephones must be for author ized use without this limitation the system will be over utilized and potentially not available for its primary purpose communica ting critical information at the critical moment power planners must consider po wer requirements when planning their various networks systems that require 110220 volt power may not be available at all times in the austere locations of jfob back up generators must be available emplaced and cut over procedures rehearsed for systems that can rely on battery power stock of the appropriate batteries capab of providing 2 5 days worth of power must be available and must be maintain ed so as to be operational maintenance the periodic and sche duled maintenance requirement for c4 systems must be reviewed prior to determining the best systems to meet the requirements if specific system requires c ontractor support that availability must be programmed and available in the area of operations additionally daily pr eventive maintenance must be maintained commanders and leaders at all levels of the fp team must insure this is done cons istently and reliably hardening systems are vulnerable to atta ck from indirect fire and acts of terrorism additionally they can be easily disrupted by construction vehicle traffic and other noncomb at related actions c4 system components such as cables wires antennas and generators are particularly susceptible c4 planners can minimize this vulnerability by planning for hardening andor providi ng alternate wirecable routes for key c4 assets flexibility as in any plan c4 syst em architecture must be flexible rigid reliance on single means cap ability or concept will be counter effective as previously stated minimum of three means should be developed for each requirement the systems identified may have multiple uses but must be both capable and available to meet their primary mission jfob force protection handbook final draft 104 for official use onlyo interoperability interoperability of c4 systems is currently one of the major ongoing programs within the dod jfob c4 system planners must include this capability as key point in their planning the capability for interoperability allo ws multfunctionality for single system which both decreases the overall equipment requirement and increases capabilities for users understanding the frequency spectrums utilized and computernetwork operating system capabilities and limitations can allow enhanced inter operability within the jfob c4 architecture full interoperability may not be achievable however full interoperability will remain goal w ithin the joint community until the services identify and procure c4 systems that provide the myriad of capabilities required by each specific service equipment cots land and seamobile radios and base stations serviceprovided tactical radios and telephone systems and com puter network systems are broad names for the communications equipment usually available for jfob communications each service tends to have its favorites although there is continuing effort to make communications systems interopera ble among the services the exact systems used are not as important as their ability to meet the minimum characteristics and capabilities and most importantly their ability to meet the mission radio systems are normally utilized for both point to point and larger networked means for communicating in formation via voice quickly and efficiently to larger quantities of organizations or individuals the systems available either meet all encryptionsecurity requirements or can be utilized due to their low outpu t power which limits intercept by unauthorized personnel units must make the best possible use of systems that provide secure voice capabilities or comply with data encryption standards des as ex isting nondes systems reach the end of

require more robust support maintenance and traini ng to install operate and maintain telephone systems are also normally us erto user devices that do not allow for larger broadcasts to mu ltiple components within the jfob additionally telephone systems are ex tremely vulnerable to maintenance malfunctions and disruption due to peri odic destruction of critical cable paths by vehicular traffic and dpw operat ions care must be taken to not utilize telephone systems for sensitive fp information that are used by hn or other noncoalition forces communications for official use only 105o computer networks allow for both nonsecure niprnet and secure siprnet data communications this communications can be either by email messaging or via web li ke telephone systems computer networks require more

security forces sf require radio systems that allow continuous secure communica tions with the bdoc at all times despite net saturation jamming or interference minimum of th ree frequencies should be available to the sf additional frequencies may be required depending on the specific mission and jfob sf radi systems include the following components base stations fixed twoway radios usually located in control centers base station remotes fixed twowa radios installed on fixed posts remotes are basically amplifiers connected to the base station with telephone lines they use the base st ation to send and receive calls mobile twoway radios these devi ces are usually installed in sf vehicles these radios transmit nd receive over great distances in dispersed situations some models can be easily removed from vehicles making them mobileportable radios portable radios twoway radios used on walking patrols special response teams srts or the quic k reaction force qrf security patrols and fixed posts these radi transmit over short distances and are used for most normal daytoday operations jfob tenant units the tactical command post for each tenant unitorganization within the jfob must have the capability to communicate with the bdoc at all times although tenant units may provide forces to or in support of the sf the c4 requirements are different separate radio net minimum of two secure frequencies to allow for potential disruption that uses base stations or other fixed station tw oway radios should be available as the bdoc command net additionally th use of both telephone systems and computer data systems should be used to maximize ordinary traffic allowing the radio net to be available for critic missions only units must devise manual systems at each installation with

forces aif critical infrastructure assurance measures are implemented to assure that the jfob will maintain operations during periods of heightened security and during attacks from rockets artillery mortar s rams improvised explosive devices ieds etc this chapter will define the most critical infrastructure and methods of protecting it objectives to protect people physica l entities and cyber syst ems that are survivable continuity of operations and mission success to deter or mitigate attacks on critical infrastructure by people terrorists hackers etc by nature hurricanes tornadoes etc or by hazardous materials hazmat accidents chemical spills etc infrastructure protection involves the pplication of syst ematic analytical process fully integrated into all infrastructure functions of the jfob infrastructure protection is securityrelated timeefficient and resource constrained practice intended to be re peatedly used by commanders this practice can only be effective if pplied by commanders and periodically for official use only 111upgraded in accordance with changes in physical entities cyber systems or the general environment it consists of the following tasks ƒ identifying critical infrastructures essential for the accomplishment of missions ie fire suppression haz mat containment sewer treatment water supply electrical systems and cyber systems ƒ determining the threat against jfob infrastructures ƒ analyzing the vulnerabilities of jf0b infrastructures ƒ assessing the risk of the degradation or loss of critical infrastructure ƒ applying countermeasures wh ere risk is unacceptable identify critical infrastructures sweat several of the most important infrastruct ure areas that must be addressed are covered in the acronym s weat the critical infrastructure areas are as follows sewer the sewer systems in jfobs can ra nge from burnout barrels in an initial construction to municipal sanita ry sewer and wastewater treatment plant like those found in small towns sometime s the sewer may be tied into local municipality sewer systems start with bur nout barrels then evolve to leech fieldslagoons and then to lagoonstreatment plants initial sewer treatment may involve hau ling liquid wastes off site in sewage disposal trucks these trucks become prime targets for use of vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbieds security should implement the following force protection fp measures to protect vulnerabilities of the sewer system ƒ obtain ownership of the sewage disposal truck ƒ always keep the truck on site when not in use ƒ provided security for the driver when the sewage disposal truck leaves the jfob ƒ search the truck thoroughly before allowing it back on the jfob after wastes are dumped ƒ upgrade the sewage system to prepackaged sewage plants that can process the majority of the liquid organic wa stes produced on the jfob as the jfob matures ƒ include fp measures and emergency backup plans when contracting with outside sources to include munici palities for disposal service water reliable water source is critical for the successful operation of jfob the initial standard is bottled water then bottlerowpu reverse jfob force protection handbook final draft 112 for official use onlyosmosis water purification unit and th well and treatment plants as the jfob matures options to consider include the following ƒ dig water wells if local aquifer can produce the volume and quality of water demanded ƒ tie into local communities if they have adequate potab water production capabilities in this case ensure that local water works or utilities maintain secure perimeter around the source and the treatment facility ƒ maintain security around critical node s such as pumping facilities storage facilities and the netw ork of water mains and subsidiary pipes figure 111 reverse osmosis water purification unit rowpu water supply threat involves the release of biological organisms or toxins into the reservoir or water tank in order for this contamination to cause illness or death the dilution provided by the larg volume of water would have to be overcome the contamination of water tower will require less agent than reservoir but will only impact small area to reduce this risk security should do the following ƒ enhance physical securi ty of critical nodes ƒ monitor chlorine levels to ensure they are adequate some of the potable water currently bei ng used is bottled wa ter that is being trucked in these trucks are target for contaminati on of water by bandits that attack the convoys to protect the truc ks security should do the following ƒ provide escorts for the trucks ƒ maintain positive control of these trucks while they are convoying entering the facility unloadi ng and exiting the facility ƒ protect rowpus and water bladders within the jfob against sabotage ƒ establish several sources and locations of water so that an attack does not disrupt the water supply principal critical infrastructure assurance measures for official use only 113in order to sabotage the jfobs water supply the enemy would have to have large amounts of an agent and knowledge of the water supply network important points to consider are the following the contamination of water supply with biological agent that causes illness or death of victims is possible but not probable successful attack will require knowl edge of and access to critical nodes of the water supply network successful attack will likely invol ve either disruption of the water treatment process ie destruction of plumbing or release of disinfectants or posttreatment contamination near the target there is great deal of interdependency between water and other infrastructures the most important being the electric power sector if th power source is interrupted or withdrawn it imp acts the entire water system electricity the initial electricity is produced wi th organic tactical generators of the unit establishing the jfob andor co mmercial generators as the jfob matures larger generator sets prime power see figure 112 with redundant capacity may be used in mature theater commercial power plants can be considered connecting to the local power grid is possibility if the situation permits and the local power supply is consistent and of high quality iraqi power grids remain unreliable and vulnerable to sabotage the local power grid should not be the only source of electricity backup gene rator capacity should be maintained on the jfob figure 112 prime power generator many jfobs currently have large capacity generator plants and mixture of overhead and buried power grids comm on failures are construction related damage surge during summer when units ope rate at lower efficiency unplanned ties to the grid and indire ct fire security measures to be taken include the following jfob force protection handbook final draft 114 for official use onlyƒ configure the electrical distributi on system so that generators are compartmentalized ƒ provide backup power for critical assets that can be brought online immediately if the primary sour ce of electricity goes down ƒ protect electric grids by continua l monitoring planned changes and routine maintenance ƒ develop priorities for the criti cal consumers medical command and control food service etc of electricity ƒ develop and exercise shutdown plan ƒ protect generators from small arms firing saf and rams with concrete t walls and overhead cover if possible ƒ protect fuel sources power genera tion plants and di stribution lines ƒ consider hardening for critical pow er nodes that drive command control communications computers and intellig ence c4i medical and food storage overall existing electrical system s have not been primary targets academics in regards to schools and religious facilities secu rity should do the following ƒ protect and monitor schools ƒ guard mosques as any other key terrain in order to main tain good relations with the host nation hn ƒ monitor minarets at local mosques fo r aif observers and as launch points for surfacetoair missiles sams ƒ closely monitor chapels morale we lfare and recreation mwr areas and any other areas where large cr owds gather for suicide bombers trash initially trash in jfobs is almost always burned and buried as the environment becomes more permissive tr ash may be disposed of off the jfob by other methods security measures that should implemented are the following ƒ monitor the burn site to ensure that xplosive devices are not placed in the burn pile to be detonated by the heat or by

security considerations throughout both phases these issues are addressed in chapter 7 critical infrastruct ure evaluation the following is checklist of cons iderations for evaluating critical infrastructures to determine their current status and required upgrades and modifications redundant design the design of critical infrast ructures should be such that components are similar and duplicated so that if one unit becomes unserviceable the two or three units next to it can continue to perform at an increased output until the damaged unit is repaired or replaced use redundancy jfob

unprotected critical infrastructure nodes can be very vulnerable to sabotage and attack evaluate critical nodes for their potential as targets the evaluation will determin the necessity of additional hardening add additional hardening such as overh ead and sidewall protection as necessary other possible hardening options include relocation of node earthen berms chain link fence electronic detec

overview as unit personnel make plans for an operation competing requirements make demands on resources examples of competing requirements are weapons systems command control communications and computers c4 force protection fp needs logistics support and other mission essential equipment resources are time funds personnel troop labor existing contractor support existing equipment and material and other items and assets used to accomplish the mission shortage of any of these resources generally results in n eed for some form of contracting to meet the mission and fulfill necessary requirements each requirement has cost associated with it either of money or other resources which may or may not be in the budget or operations plan if proper preplanning is performed the fp officer will have budget and can purchase necessary supplies or services through contracting to augment available resources and fulf ill these requirements keep in mind however that the needs dictated by requirement will be unique to each situation and will constantly change this chapter is intended to acquaint th fp officer with terms processes and personnel in the requirements generation funding and contracting processes this will enable the fp officer to identify justify fund and contract for necessary supplies and rvices to meet mission requirements in the uscentcom area of responsibility aor the army is in charge of contracting through the assistance secretary of the army for acquisition logistics and technology asaalt for official use only 121the normal steps in the acquisiti on process are the following ƒ requirements generated by unit ż statement of work sow independent government cost estimate igce ż da form 3953 purchase request and commitment prc ƒ requirements package validated by joint acquisition review board jarb and approved by task force commander comjtf or his appointee ƒ prc certified by resource manager for fundingcommitment ƒ prc and sow sent to contracting for executionobligation ƒ goodsservices delivered to customer ƒ vendor paid by finance the same acquisition process diagramed in figure 121 figure 121 sample acquisition process as the diagram shows the formal re quirements or hurdles to contracting relate primarily to the dollar threshold of the acquisition as the value goes up so do the formalities for example acquisitions under 2500 can generally be accomplished by unit field ordering officer foo but higher command approval of the requirement is required where the amount exceeds 200000 there are obvious and notsoobvious reasons for this the obvious reason is that m oney is always in short supply when placed against requirements the notso obvious reason is that fiscal laws that govern the disburse ment of money carry severe penalties for violations including criminal penalties or taking of pay consequently the requirements generation process s its own checks and balances that the fp officer must understand and follow jfob force protection handbook final draft 122 for official use onlysimilarly in higherlevel procedur typically ove r 200000 once the command has validated requirement there are generally three staff offices that work in tandem to assist the unit in fulfilling their contracting requirements such offices are referred to as the fiscal triad which is made up of the comptroller or c8 th finance unit nd the contracting officer comptrollers acquire control and certify funds in accordance with fiscal law finance units make the payment contracting officers receive unit requirements and complete the process of acquiring goods and services as shown in figure 122 figure 122 fiscal support staff the key steps in any contracting pro cess are to 1 identify and justify the requirements 2 identify approp riate funding sources and fiscal constraints and 3 use the proper c ontracting authority and methods at the end of this chapter we will also discuss some issues with which to be particularly concerned in tingency environment with this knowledge an fp officer should be equipped to participate in the contracting process and fill the gaps in resources that will ensure the security of the joint forward operati ons base jfob next well discuss each of the key steps in the process identify and justify requirements key task identify programmatic and procedural requirements to reduce the risk from the threat what needs ither to be done or acquired to make the jfob more secure that cannot be satisfied with existing resources key products commanders justification memorandum purchase request and commitment prc st atement of work sow and independent government cost estimate igce resourcingfunds and contracting for official use only 123key players fp officer unit comma nder installation property book officer ipbo joint acquisition re view board jarb and comjtf or hisher designee for approval of prcs requirements identify requirements through various planning processes the fp officer must identify areas where changes or improvements s hould be made to jfob layout equipment and procedures these changes or improvements should be required to reduce the risk to people mission and property to assist the fp officer in these planning processe s there are analytical tools or procedures for example the fp staff using at planner an army corps of engineers tool for estimating da mage may analyze an improvised explosive devices ieds projected effects on tents modular buildings and personnel from this analysis th staff may determine requirements to reduce risk these requirements can be categorized as either programmatic or procedural examples of programmatic requirements are need for funds for bombdetecti on equipment more security forces and more military working dogs examples of procedural requirements are more personnel assigned to foot patr ols variation by 10 minutes of the timing of spot checks around the area and leaving the jfob by different routes the key thing to remember is that less there is only one possible source to fulfill requireme nt fp officers should describe the requirement as generically as possible so that contracting has options when asked to fulfill it simply stated identify what is needed not how it is to be done to do this the fp officer will often need to conduct detailed analysis of the requirement and reduce it to its essence the fp officer should be able to defend requirements using experi ence proven operating procedures and results from analytical tools in concise and convincing manner most likely the fp officer will write the reasons for the requirements this justification information and submit them through the appropriate staff to the unit commander for approval this information is developed into joint acquisition review board jarb the main institutional tool for identifying requirements along with justification requested funding and ot her data is the core vulnerability assessment management program cvamp cvamp is webenabled application resident within the antite rrorism enterprise portal atep that captures results of vulnerability assessments prioritizes area of responsibility aor vuln erabilities identifies ficiencies and lists corrective actions needed or complete d cvamp resides on the atep at httpwwwatepsmilmil its characteristics are as follows resides on spirnet cvamp and can store classified data up to secret accessible over the spirnet via the atep accessible to commanders at ever level within chain of command jfob force protection handbook final draft 124 for official use only documents commanders risk assessment decision for each vulnerability tracks the status of known vul nerabilities until mitigated informs decision makers of given installations ability to counter the assessed terrorist threat provides commanders vehicle to identify requirements to the responsible chain of command prioritizes resource requiremen ts for request of combating terrorismreadiness initiatives f unds cbtrif andor unfunded requirements ufrs users guide to cvamp is available on the website for the purposes of requirements review and contracting however the key document for identifying approving funding and tracking requirement within the army is da form 3953 purchase request and commitment prc where manufactured supplies or services are to be acquired statement of work sow and an inde pendent government cost estimate igce will also be needed justify requirements jarb package with prc drafted the fp officer proceeds to preparing justification documentation or jarb package the two most important questions to answer in justifying requirements are why is this needed and why should this receive prio rity the requirement may reduce the risk of death and injury but it must be expl ained sufficiently to pass the scrutiny of an outsider to the unit intense analysis may or may not be required it depends on the threat the location expected incident response and consequence management actions with their results and expected losses of personnel and equipment and risk to the mission analysis is often needed to justif requirements this analysis may include results from antiterrorism at planner tool in the joint antiterrorism jat guideshowing predicted damage to structures and personnel or the analysis may include the blast ra dius from rocket or mortar with expected injuries multip tools are availa ble for predicting weapons effects on structures and pe rsonnel in any case defending the requirement using experience proven operating procedures and results from analytical tools in concise convincing manner will help most likely the fp officer will need to write and present the requirements with justification and submit for approval therefore good verbal and written communication skills ar tremendously helpfu l when justifying requirements and there will always be timeline for seeking funding for fairly recent example of how the process works we can draw on operation iraqi freedom oif in 2004 during oif the acquisition approval process generally followed monthly cycle joint task force jtf staff officers held weekly meetings to consider and recommend disposition on pending theater requ irements the framework for these meetings was called the joint acquisition review board jarb and the resourcingfunds and contracting for official use only 125facilities utilization and support bo ard fusb respectively the jarb and the fusb consisted generally of intermediate representatives from all jtflevel staff sections the jarb focused upon all requirements exceeding 200000 the fusb as an engi neercentric board considered and mandated uniform basing requireme nts across theater for the jarb to apply both of these boards were responsible for vetting requirements so the chief logistician and chief engi neer could appropriately prioritize and approve requirements the jarb and fusb were only the nd of the process in the iraq acquisition cycle staff officers from the jarb and the fusb would begin the month briefing the deputy comma nding generals for support at each division on their duties and current actions they would then receive feedback about pending requirements this meeting came to be known as the executive logistics review board elrb after appropriate staffing staff principles briefed senior leaders who would then issue strategic guidance providing priorities on theate rwide issues diagram of this process is shown in figure 123 figure 123 battle rhythm this process served to ensure that th eaterwide standards were set and that all requirements were appropriately vetted prior to going to the jarbfusb and ultimately comjtfs designee the c4 for approval generally acquisition exceeding 200000 could go to the comptroller or contracting without jarb reco mmendation and an approval signature on the prc by the c4 similar procedures have been used in every jfob force protection handbook final draft 126 for official use onlycontingency operation in the last decade therefore is cr itical for unit fp officers to have basic understandi ng of how to develop jarb package when justifying their requirements first and foremost in every jarb packag is the indication that it has been properly staffed up from the reque sting unit through the major subordinate commander msc before it comes to the jarb as for the specific documentation required it will vary from package to package depending on what is being requested but there are some basics that apply to all packages ƒ justification memo the request must have justification memo that clearly states what the requirement is and what is requested to meet the requirement obviously stating how the requirement was determined and what options were considered is important also be sure to consider completely the second and third order effects of what is requested for example the fp officer should not come in with request to buy trailers and then xpect to come back later for separate request to buy furniture fo r the trailer and then again for separate requests for power and computer hookups etc finally make sure the request is signed by the appropriate level commander ƒ analysis the analysis must support the re quirement for example if asking for nontactical vehicles ntv one would need to show what military table of equipment mtoe or other ntv vehicles are assigned to the unit how they ar being used and how they cannot meet the units mission requirement in addition the jus tification must show how the units mission require s the number and type being requested in other words treat this analysis like troop to task analysis ƒ staffing staffing staffing as one goes up the chain of command each level has bigger picture of available assets and capabilities somewhere between the fp officer and the highest level someone may be able to solve the problem without contracti ng for it in the manner requested solving the problem this way meets the requirement and the mission without needless pa perwork and expense so follow proper staffing procedures and give the staffs the chance to do their jobs ƒ funding documentation there are basically two types of funding documents that can be used to allo cate funds the re quester needs to include the proper document properly fi lled out and signed as part of the package sometimes there is fine line between which funding documents should be used the supporting resource management office and contracting folks can determine which one is appropriate and make sure it is filled out properly ż prc purchase request nd commitment da form 3953 as described above this is the form to use if buying something through local purchase or new contract for example if the fp officer wants to lease an ntv or bus he should use prc as resourcingfunds and contracting for official use only 127the obligation document because it is new purchase from commercial source the prc lists what one is trying to buy and the cost ż mipr military interdepartmental purchase requests dd form 448 this is the form to use if purchasing something from contract that already exists some where else in dod for example if an army agency already has contract in place for technical support and the fp officer wants to get some of the same type support for the unit funds go via mipr to the army contracting agency that owns the contract the contracting agency buys it under its contract ƒ statement of work sow and i ndependent government cost estimate igce these documents are critical when trying to hire contractor support or labor the sow specifies the tasks to be performed to what standard and wh at the unit as the government sponsor is going to provide them without this information contractors wont know how to prope rly bid for the contract writing sow is not normally part of milit ary training on the other hand one else can define the requirement s as well as the one who needs the service or product the most important thing to remember is that the supporting contracting folks can help the igce is what the requester thinks is fair and reasonable price for what is to be obtained the word independent is fairly selfexplanatory but also the most ignored it is not independent if one asks contractor what he would charge then puts that in the package as the government estimate there are some guidelines on how one can develop an ige and the local contracting folks ca n help one through it fiscal constraints and funding sources when seeking funding for particular project the fp officer should obtain advice and assistance from the rvicing command or staff judge advocate on appropriate funding sources for the current and coming year as well as any fiscal rest raints upon the proposed proj ect fiscal law as it is known is an everchanging body of law that defines how money can be spent more than perhaps any other area of the law commanders should expect and demand structure in the c ontext of fiscal law that guarantees independent legal advice such independence and access by judge advocates keeps commanders out of trouble and is also required by statute accord 10 usc 3037 5148 5046 and 8037 as amended by section 584 of the 2005 dod appropriations act fiscal constraints perhaps the greatest opportunity to end commanders or comptrollers career is in failure to comply with fiscal limitations given this it is important to understand the fact that fi scal law operates like other law the usual question by commanders to the staff judge advocate is well judge does anything prohibit from doi ng this in the context of fiscal jfob force protection handbook final draft 128 for official use onlylaw this is the wrong question rather the right question is well judge is there any law that authorizes to spend this money in this way at the time i want to do this project this question is always the most important one to ask and sets up the buzz phrase that is used to analyze fiscal problems purpose time and amount money appropriated by congress is never indefinite it is always appropri ate for certain purpose for limited time and in limited sum if one is asked why the simple answer is congress likes it that way because it serves as their check and balance on executive power it is also important to understand that there ar routinely two primary types of appropriated monies immediately available for comjtf during contingency operations th first is contingency operations or conops money and the other is humanitarian assistance money the bulk of which in iraq and afghanistan is currently found in the commanders emergency response program cerp conops money is generally form of operations and maintenance om money that is appropriated for missionessential operations in pa rticular contingenc theater proper mission relatedexpenses are any s upplies services or authorized construction projects in theater that are needed to perform the mission or to support personnel performing the mission proper services include cleaning services mess hall services latrine services utility services power generation services air conditi on services portajohn services tent services includes set up take down and maintenan ce and trash services supplies include barriers concertina wi re lumber concrete gravel when used for maintenance and repair ba tteries radios cell phones air time is service generators tents paint t ools spare parts cots furniture air conditioning units when installed as an integral part of real property medical supplies oil and computers just to name few cerp in contrast is money that can only be used by the comjtf in oif to fund certain highimpact highvisibility projects for the benefit of host nation people with respect to the jarb nd acquisition process it is normally conops money that funds most operati ons but also carries with it the greatest restraints and pitfalls an fp officers servicing judge advocat should be familiar with the types of money available and the purposes for which they can be used this is detailed further below and is the easy part the difficult part of meeting fiscal law requirements is asking the right questions to ensure that the project is appropria tely classified and that th proper rule is applied to help you do this below is f iscal law questionnaire this questionnaire highlights the common issues such as the 750000 limitation on use of om money for construction 15 million for requirement needed for life health or safety the 3 million limit on repair and the 250000 limit on the pur chase of individual items of supply it also asks other questions ch as whether an item is centrally managed eg the hummv or the kevlar helmet or whether project or system eg equipment necessary to th operation of computer network has been split apart to stay within applicable thresholds the answers to these questions determine whether oma or conops can be resourcingfunds and contracting for official use only 129used or whether other types of mone such as military construction milcon or other procurement army opa funds must be obtained it should come as surprise th at base camp preparation including relocatable buildings sprung structures and tents portable generators as well as the site preparation necessary for the installation were constant sources of fiscal scrutiny during oi f for an army example every engineer and judge advocate knows that ar 42010 defines funded and unfunded costs and that ar 41515 gove rns milcon however what is sometimes overlooked is that the assist ant chief of staff for installation management acsim and the army comptroller regularly issue policy guidance on how to interpret and apply the principles in these regulations as well as how to ask for availa ble funds for example on august 25 2004 the comptroller issued procedures for approval of om construction projects in support of gwot this document basically required centralized dd form 13 91 the form on which all milcon money is sought process managed by centcom and the acsim as practical matter it made it more di fficult to request milcon funds and heightened the importance of proper project classification for use of conops money consistent with this recurring fis cal issue during oif was not so much which color money to use as pr actical matter it became obvious that conops was the only real source available for missionessential construction needs rather the real issue and where judge advocates advice and assistance were best employed was in working with the engineers c7 to assist the command to properly classify projects within fiscal construction limitations as an example in the army the acsim sets policy in this area and curren t guidance should always be obtained when classifying project for fund ing purposes other services should have similar policies an ancillary question to the issue of project classification and fiscal constraints is what costs count agai nst fiscal limits generally use of conops om funds can be used fo r projects if the approved cost of the project is 750000 or less 15 million if the project is intended solely to correct deficiency that threatens life health or safety see 10 usc 2805 the amounts for these limitations do apply to funded costs for the project however unfunded costs do not apply toward these limitations funded costs which are costs that do apply toward fiscal limitationscount against the thresholds include but are not necessarily limited to materials supplies and services applicable to the project transportation costs for materials supplies and unit equipment installed capital equipment civilian labor costs overhead and support costs eg asing and storing equipment jfob force protection handbook final draft 1210 for official use only supervision inspection and overhea d costs charged when the corps of engineers the naval facilities engineering command or the air force serves as the design or construction agent travel and per diem costs fo r military and civilian personnel operation and maintenance costs for governmentowned equipment eg fuel and repair parts and demolition and site preparation costs unfunded costs which are costs that do not apply toward the fiscal limitationscount against thresholds include but are not necessarily limited to military and civilian prisoner labor depreciation of governmentowned equipment materials supplies and equipmen t obtained for the project on nonreimbursable basis as excess dist ributions from another military department or federal agency licenses permits and other fees chargeable under ż state or local statute or ż status of forces agreement sofa unfunded civilian fringe benefits contract or inhouse pl anning and design cost gifts from private parties donated labor and material contributed to the military construction project are chargeable to appropriations other than those available to fund the project and are not reimburse d by appropriations available to fund the project note that these fiscal limitations do not count against repair and maintenance work iaw classi fication per da pam 42011 the limitation for these projects is currently 3000000 projects which exceed this must be approved by hqda as stated above the primary thing to remember is to involve the judge advocate as early as possible in this process to obtain the best advice however the fp officer must provide the pertinent facts the foregoing provides summary of fiscal constrai nts now lets proceed to look at how to apply these rules and constraints fiscal law questionnaire during oif questionnaire has been used by the chief of procurement and fiscal law for multinational corp s iraq to

httpwwwdticmilcjcs_directivescjcsinstructionshtm contracting authority and methods the joint mission of resource manageme nt and contracting is to fairly allocate scarce resources across th eater of operations with command approval and as described above res ource management allocates funds to contracting enabling it to obtain those supplies services and construction that the unit must have to perform its mission and th at it does not currently possess consistent with this there we re fragmentary orders fragos in oif which defined what services c ould be purchased for base camps perhaps the largest continuing expense that differentiate between base camps with less than 600 personnel and those with more than 600 personnel this same frago also st ated preference for using the logistics civil augmentation program logcap contract only as last resort most discussion in iraq about contract type devolved in to discussion about whether or not to use logcap as the influence of the joint contracting command incr eases in iraq and afgha nistan and available funds decrease the discussion about whether to use cheaper method of contracting may resolve itself at present it remains an issue for every jarb and consideration for ever fp officer on which contracting method to use for major requirements contracting authority one can contract for the government without authority it is critical to remember that contracting authority is not derived from the same place or in the same manner as command au thority in the centcom aor for example the army is in charge of contracting through the assistant secretary of the army for acqui sition logistics and technology asaalt the bottom line is that before contract is signed the person signing it should ensure that he or sh has adequate auth ority in writing through warrant of writt appointment to sign contracts entered into without authority must be ratified by the contracting chain of command or the offending person may pay out of pocket so if authority is unclear contact contracting or the rvicing judge advocate for guidance these different lines of authority may be illustrated as shown in figure 12 4 jfob force protection handbook final draft 1218 for official use onlydifferent lines of authority command contracting figure 124 different lines of authority given proper authority contracts ar the legal

all contracts are to incorporate force protection and antiterrorism at considerations antiterrorism is subset of force protection to effectivel do this the jfob needs contracting team or needs to

methods in contingency environment there are generally two levels of individuals that possess authority to c ontract and their methods differ the first is the field ordering officer foo appointed by the unit the second is warranted contracting officer appointed by the principal assistant responsible for contracting parc in th eater both derive their authority from the contracting chain of command in theater however the primary difference is the amount of money for which each can contract resourcingfunds and contracting for official use only 1221and the formalities that must be followed for each the foo generally uses an sf 44 to contract and only s authority for contracts of 2500 or less depending upon the terms of hi s or her warrant ko may have unlimited authority but must generally follow strict procedures contained in the federal acquisition regulation f ar or other applicable guidance field ordering officer foo and the sf 44 method foo contracting with an sf 44 is the si mplest form of contracting for an foo to be able to contract for goods or services all of the following must be true about the goods or services to be acquired ƒ not immediately available thr ough military supply channels ƒ emergency or mission critical ƒ at or below 2500 split requirements ƒ sufficient funds are available from prc da form 3953 ƒ immediately available from local vendor onthespot purchase ƒ one delivery over the c ounter with one payment ƒ fair and reasonable price rotate vendors to properly contract and execute payment there are several procedures that foo and his or her accompanying pay agent must follow ƒ receive requirement from unit commander ƒ ensure funds are available on da 3953 ƒ locate vendor inspect item ƒ determine fair and reasonable price ƒ prepare sf 44 ƒ execute purchase class pay agent pays ƒ receive an itemized vendors receipt completing the sf 44 properly is key part of the process figure 125 shows sample sf 44 with instru ctions for completion figure 126 depicts the foo process from start to finish warranted contracting officer ko methods as noted above ko must generally follow the formalities and competition requirements contained in the far however during contingency operations with the approval of either the parc or head of contracting activity hca these requirements may be relaxed under certain specified circumstances these circumstances require written justification and approval describing unusual or compelling urgency and must be reviewed by judge advocate prior to approval by the appropriate level of the contracting chain of command in iraq for example the hca possessed the statutory authority to ma ke competition and far exceptions jfob force protection handbook final draft 1222 for official use onlyfor acquisitions up to 75 million however such exceptions by the hca are not the norm this is because th ere are host of other procurement flexibilities in contingency enviro nment designed to meet the needs of commanders whatever the method used the proce ss for the ko follows generally the same path this process can be depicted as shown in figure 127 during contingency operations there are several simplified acquisition methods in the kos arsenal these methods vary in complexity and approval requirements but fp officers should feel free to consult with their servicing judge advocate

force protection contents introduction141 fp plan development process142 jfob fp plan template143 incident response annex template1413 bdoc sop template1417 resources1419 references1421 introduction the force protection fp plan is necessary for the development and implementation of comprehensive integrated fp program the fp plan compiles specific measures taken to establish and maintain an fp program the joint forward operation base jfob fp plan should accomplish the following provide clear concise mission statement convey the jfob commanders intent provide tasks and activities c onstraints and coordinating instructions permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans focus on subordinates activities promote initiative or at least not inhibit it include annexesappendices if re quired in order to expand the information not readily incorporated elsewhere the templates presented in this chapter are samples of fp plans and standing operating procedures sops the fp plan itself should not be an end state instead the plan should focus efforts to adequately plan and resource all aspects of the jfob fp mission for official use only 141fp plan development process the jfob commander is responsible for the development of comprehensive integrated and executable fp plan the jfob operations staff should take the lead in the development of the fp plan one individual s hould have the sole responsibility for developing an fp pl an instead having crossfunctional working group such as the jfob fp working group to develop the plan ensures the participation input and buy in of necessary subjectmatter experts sme ƒ step 1 compile information the planning staff should use all information developed during the planning process for plan documentation the various sections of the plan should comprise related fp data that can be cut and pasted into the plan format releva nt information includes but is not limited to the following mission statement threat assessment vulnerabilityrisk analysis incident response measures and drills course of action coa development resource documentation ƒ step 2 select plan format the fp plan format follows the standard operation plan oplan and fivepar agraph operations order opord format however the format shoul d be tailored to meet the unique requirements of the jfob and s hould capture the elements of comprehensive fp program ƒ step 3 produce plan summary and basic plan the plan summary provides concise synopsis of the scope and purpos of the plan the basic plan provides the basis for all amp lifying sections annexesappendices and is produced prior to their documentation ƒ step 4 assign responsibility for annexappendix development annexesappendices provide the details not readily incorporated into the basic plan the number of annexes or appendices will vary according to the necessity to increase the clarity and usefulness of the basic plan each annex relates to specific aspect of the fp operation fp working group members with related expertise or area respon sibility should develop and document individual annexes or appendices for example the public affairs representative should supe rvise the development of the public affairs annex ƒ step 5 establish plan of action and suspense dates fp plan development and documentation require s comprehensive integrated approach and strong cl ear vision of fp program requirements realistic plan of action with suspense dates drives the efficient development and documentation of the fp plan jfob force protection handbook final draft 142 for official use onlyƒ step 6 coordinate staff development and review of the plan the operations officer coordina tes the staffs work in developing the fp plan and reviewing the drafts he should ensure that all parties have ample time to review drafts but should not let th process drag on indefinitely ƒ step 7 finalize the plan the finalized plan is submitted to the commander for review and approval upon executi on the fp plan becomes an opord the finalized plan should meet the following criteria be consistent with the jfobs mission and responsibilities be oriented to ta ctical perspective be adequately detailed to provide specific actions to be taken be easily understood be capable of quick and d ecisive execution if required ƒ step 8 publish the plan and develop supporting plans once the fp plan is published the next planning cycle begi ns the fp plan cannot remain static rather as the situation ch anges the plan must also change consequently the plan must remain under constant review living document so to speak each subordinate and supporting commander who is assigned task in the fp plan must also prepare supporti ng plan supporting plans should be consistent with the supporting comm anders mission and responsibilities jfob fp plan template the fp plan is usually included as part of comprehensive oplan this template is not intended to be ll
