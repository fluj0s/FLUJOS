foundations that could be used as models2 the final law the organic act of 1846 established the smithsonian institution it created the smithsonian board of regents which to this day appears to have

the institution the idea of 19 museums did not necessarily originate with the smithsonian in many instances the smithsonian was not the initiator of the concept of additional museums but rather these were placed under the juri sdiction of the smithsonian through acts of congress thus adding responsibility to the institution and with it the need for additional ppropriations statutory authority for the smithsonian institution has been amended and added to by numerous acts over time the range of legislation enacted shows the increasing control of the federal government over the shape of the

constitutional component to the determination that the smithsonian is federal entity si was created by congress to further the gove rnments objective of increasing and diffusing knowledge although not smithsonian case lebron v national r r passenger corporation 513 us 374 1995 provides precedent in parallel sense that the smithsonian is constitutionally regarded as government entity in 1997 the dc circuit court held that the smithsonian was not an executive branch agency dong v smithsonian institution for purposes of the privacy act10 the privacy act incorporated the definition of agency from the freedom of information act which defines agency as an executive department military department government corporation gove rnment controlled co rporation or other establishment in the executive branch of the government including the executive office of the president or any independent regulatory agency11 applying the freedom of information act definition to the smithsonian the court held that the smithsonian was not an establishment in the executive branch or government controlled corporation the smithsoni an characterized itself as trust instrumentality of the united states12 the unique character of the smithsonian has featured prominently in other court cases it would appear that the smithsonian is at minimum an establishment of the united states all moneys received by the smithsonian are held in the us treasury13 the smithsonian is required to s ubmit annual reports on its operations to congress and is further audited by the government accountability office14 if there is lawsuit against the smithsonian the si is generally represented by government attorneys from the department of justice the aforementioned factors imply fed eral status and under some federal statutes the smithsonian is considered federal agency for example in certain court cases under the federal tort cl aims act the federal employment compensation act and the inspector general act the smithsonian for these purposes is considered federal agency15 several other court cases have determined that the smithsonian is at its core federal entity in spite of the existence of private funding source16 however there is still some reluctance to declare the smithsonian federal agency or federal entity the decisions in numerous court cases are based on the precise language of the agency definition in the particular statute being cited in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33560crs11 17 12 op ag 122 12324 1988 18 copy of the letter from the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee on

department of justice s office of legal counsel confirms17 therefore declaring the smithsonian federal entity is determined on case by case basis but it appears that the majority of case findings tend to favor the characterization of federal entity the impact congress has on the si is greater if the si is considered federal entity particularly with regard to the next issue the showtime business

limit ccess to other producers and in fact will hi re independent film makers to help in production of the programs for the channel the si originally claimed that it did not need to divulge the terms of its contract with cbsshowtime because it was private business contract that did not involve federal funds some lawmakers asse rted that because of the substantial federal s upport of the si they
