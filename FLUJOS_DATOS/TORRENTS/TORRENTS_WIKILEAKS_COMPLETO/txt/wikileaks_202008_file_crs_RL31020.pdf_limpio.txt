pacific northwest in january 2001 president bush established the national energy policy development nepd group headed by vice president dick cheney and directed it to develop national energy policy1 on may 16 the nepd group submitted its report outlining policy changes that would affect energy supply demand and environmental quality the report provides extensive discussion of the current energy situation and makes 105 recommendations for actions2 it calls for increased energy production increased resource extraction and greater numbers of powerplants it recommends oil and gas exploration in the potentially oil and gas rich and environmentally sensitive arctic national wildlife refuge anwr as well as on other federal lands it recommends variety of incentives for increasing use of alternative renewable energy resources and encouraging energy efficiency and conservation it also recommends streamlining of environmental permitting and reducing constraints from certain environmental requirements for air quality in order to achieve the goals of the plan how the policy changes in the plan may affect the environment is indeterminate at this point the nepd report has few numeric goals and with some exceptions the fuel types numbers and locations of energy facilities are not specifically recommended thus specific environmental impacts connected with them or mitigated by use of various alternatives can only be identified in the broadest terms however some of the qualitative tradeoffs while not discussed explicitly in this report can be identified for example they include the facts that increased reliance on coal will adversely affect air quality as result of increased pollutant emissions and will add to greenhouse gas emissions while substitution of natural gas and nuclear power for coal and oil will have less of an impact on air emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs2 3 prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policydespite its benefits from the air quality perspective nuclear power has negative environmental impacts that other energy sources do not from the perspectives of waste disposal and potential impact from accidents development of environmentally sensitive areas such as anwr for oil and gas will have not only ecological implications from routine operations but also potential risks of increased pollution and oil spills to the extent energy efficiency gains and conservation efforts are accelerated nationally less energy will be used in the future with less negative effect on the environment with or without national energy policy if the gross domestic product gdp doubles over the next 25 years as has been predicted and energy consumption to support that economic growth increases by 32 as the nepd report predicts the nation will inevitably face some environmental tradeoffs in meeting future energy needs even if the cleanest newest and most environmentally benign energy technologies are utilized in all cases and even if conservation and use of more energy efficient technologies reduce the growth of energy demand some impacts on air and water quality and land resources appear inevitable under virtually any energy policy scenario there will be discharges to streams lakes and coastal waters there will be air pollutant emissions some of which could be transported to distant waterbodies and airsheds and there will be wastes produced during construction and operations that disturb the land at issue are what environmental risks these activities present and what energy and environmental protection strategies are likely to minimize those risks this crs report examines subset of the environmental issues associated with the administrations

climate change and water quality and pollution issues potentially connected with anwr it does not discuss the broad energy policy or the inevitable but currently unquantifiable environmental implications of an unspecified mix of energy activities environmental permit streamlining3 streamlining of environmental permits and reviews has been an issue in past energy policy debates and the nepd report raises the issue once again specific environmental requirements and complexities of obtaining permits have been cited as contributing to or fundamentally causing some energy project delays examination of actual cases however often identifies range of factors that can affect delay or even derail major projects including economic costs and uncertainties and lack of consensus on the need for project in addition to environmental rules and permits whether environmental rules are the central reason for delays in building energy facilities is often debated in addition to federal requirements many of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs3 4 national energy policy p 313relevant permits and regulations are state or local comprehensive streamlining would likely involve all levels of government attempts to simplify environmental review procedures in order to speed decisionmaking are rarely simple and often lead to controversies in response to the energy crisis of the late 1970s congress and the carter administration considered proposals to create an energy mobilization board new agency empowered to put priority energy projects on fast track to completion and to give the board authority to cut through red tape and delays affecting key energy projects the major controversy over this proposal debated throughout 1979 and 1980 was whether the board would have the power to waive or override substantial requirements of federal state and local law particula rly environmental laws ultimately congress rejected the conference report on an omnibus energy bill that would have created the board and given it such authority the nepd report does not propose anything on the order of the earlier proposed energy mobilization board with powers to override statutory requirements but one of its first recommendations concerns permitting of energyrelated facilities4 the theme of streamlinin g permits is the centerpiece of chapter 3 of the report protecting americas environment the nepd group recommends the president issue an executive order to rationalize permitting for energy production in an environmentally sound manner by directing federal agencies to expedite permits and other federal actions necessary for energyrelated project approvals on national basis this order would establish an interagency task force chaired by the council on environmental quality to ensure that federal agencies responsible for permitting energyrelated facilities are coordina ting their efforts the task force will ensure that federal agencies set up appropriate mechanisms to coordinate federal state tribal and local permitting activity in particular regions where increased activity is expected in response two days after release of the nepd report president bush issued executive order 13212 actions to expedite energyrelated projects the executive order states that it is the policy of this administration that executive departments and agencies shall take appropriate actions to the extent consistent with applicable law to expedite projects that will increase the production transmission or conservation of energy it establishes multiagency task force to assist agencies in expediting review of permits to accelerate completion of energyrelated projects increase energy production and conservation and improve transmission of energy indeed number of recommendations throughout the report address three aspects of energy project permitting and regulatory streamlining first the need for faster decisions second the need for more comprehensive regulations especially where multiple agencies are involved and third the need to provide industry with regulatory certainty for example the need for faster decisions is reflected in the recommendati on for task force to expedite permits and other necessary federal actions and for expedited renewal of the transalaska pipeline system lease andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs4 5 ibid p 710 6 ibid p 714 7 ibid p 515 8 ibid p 714rightsofway5 elsewhere the report recommends that the environmental protection agency epa and the department of energy streamline the permitting process for refineries where possible to ensure that regulatory overlap is limited it also recommends that these agencies adopt comprehensive regulations covering more than one pollutant and requirement affecting refinery operations and in doing so consider the rules cumulative impacts and benefits6 further several recommendations urge greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions7 and for refinery owners8 it is too early to know what actions the task force created by eo 13212 will take or precisely how the policy set forth in it will be implemented responses could range from organizing more coordinated consultation among agencies within existing administrative and legal regimes to promoting and facilitating nontraditional methods of meeting regulatory requirements including marketbased approaches to pollution control such as emissions trading to seeking statutory changes to waive modify or set stringent deadlines on regulatory or permit requirements for energy projects or even to proposing creation of an energy mobilization boardtype agency it is unknown whether the task force and agencies will propose streamlining for individual energy projects on an as needed basis or more broadly for all projects of certain types the simplest actions such as improved interagency coordination may raise few concerns among interested parties and likely could be done administratively but more extensive proposals when detailed are likely to be criticized at least by some stakeholder groups more farreaching actions if proposed are likely to require changes to legislation environmental advocates often view proposals for streamlining as being intended to reduce environmental protection by waiving requirements of federal laws or overriding reviews conducted by environmental and resource agencies further environmental and other groups have long raised concerns about proposals to speed up permitting processes by reducing public input on permit decisions public involvement is generally seen as beneficial to sound decisionmaking but at times it can be difficult to adequately allow for public input without introducing timeconsuming public comment processes environmental justice issues have been raised by some who are concerned that streamlining could result in increased siting of facilities in poorer minority more vulnerable areas epa requirements and permits often are blamed for project delays and red tape but in reality responsibility for evaluating and approving energyrelated projects is spread widely across the federal government in addition to state and local governments pursuant to number of statutory authorities among the many federal laws and regulations that can come into play when permits are issued for energy facilities proposals to streamline energy project decisions could involve some of the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs5 the national environmental policy act

federal agencies are responsible for reviewing and commenting on environmental impact statements based on the commenting agencys expertise in order to assess their adequacy and to coordinate interagency decisionm aking nepas eis requirements provide interested parties with much information while nepa does not provide direct authority to stop projects opponents of energy and nonenergy projects have on occasion found an opportunity to require agencies to conduct studies or otherwise use eiss so that decisions were delayed the clean air act caa requires that major stationary sources of air pollution primarily industrial facilities utilities and large commercial operations obtain permit from their respective state tribal or local permitting authority to operate as well as to undertake new construction or expansion of an existing facility see discussion of new source review below the clean water act cwa requires that prior to going into operation plants must obtain permits which authorize discharge of processed wastewater most of these are issued by states in addition to those standard requirements to control water pollution the act also contains separate permit system operated by the us army corps of engineers under which advance approval must be obtained for any project involving dredging or filling of wetlands the rivers and harbors act of 1899 requires permits from the corps of engineers for construction of any dam or dike in navigable waterway or any structure in or over any navigable waterway if the structure or work affects the course location or condition of the waterbody the construction of bridges and causeways over waterbody also requires permit which is issued by the us coast guard the fish and wildlife coordination act fwca requires preparation of mitigation plan for possible project impacts on fish and wildlife the endangered species act requires federal agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife service fws or the national marine fisheries service nmfs to determine if any listed species that might be affected by proposed project would be jeopardized by it or if their critical habitat would be adversely modified fws or nmfs depending on the affected species must give biological opinion on the risk of jeopardy or of adverse modification in the rare cases where jeopardy or adverse modification is found the agency must offer reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposal these alternatives usually involve timing scope or location of the project in very rare cases less than 1 alternatives consistent with the survival of the species can be found for the project the marine mammal protection act mmpa prohibits the taking eg to harass hunt capture or kill or attempt to harass hunt capture or kill of any

require preparation of archeological or historic surveys of the proposed project site projects involving transit or transmission across public lands may require obtaining rightsofway from relevant federal agencies including the bureau of land management bureau of reclama tion bureau of indian affairs national park service and forest service the coastal zone management act czma requires certification by states that projects to be located in states coastal zone are consistent with the states coastal zone management program the clean water act requires similar state certification concerning compliance with state water quality standards see discussion below in some cases energy projects also could trigger specific permit and regulatory requirements related to hazardous waste transportation and disposal underground injection of wastes reclamation of mined land or nuclear waste transportation and disposal several of these laws including nepa the clean air act the clean water act and the endangered species act explicitly allow citizens to bring legal actions against agency heads for failure to carry out nondiscretionary substantive and procedural duties under the laws and against regulated entities for violations of statutory and permit requirements citizen groups value the additional enforcement authority available in these laws as such citizen suits could be an important tool for those who might object to regulatory streamlining proposals that they view as compromising existing environmental safeguards air quality9 among all of the environmental issues discussed in the nepd report air quality is the most prominent it is in discussing clean air requirements that the report is most explicit both in describing regulatory constraints on energy projects and advocating specific legislation to achieve two significant policy goals of the plan reducing and capping air emissions from electric power generators and expediting regulatory and permitting processes for energy facilities including refineries and oil and natural gas pipelines the nepd report makes two recommendations regarding air quality first it recommends review of the air emission regulatory process known as new source review second it proposes to strengthen emission controls on powerplants through new legislation multipollutant legislation the net effect of these stepshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs7 10 national energy policy p 714 11 ibid 12 remarks of epa administrator carol m browner at clean air enforcement press conference washingto n dc nov 3 1999 as

until the plans general recommendations are embodied in specific regulatory actions and legislative language new source review in an apparent effort to ease regulatory burdens on powerplants and refineries and provide additional incentives to expand output at existing facilities the nepd report recommends review of the clean air acts new source review nsr requirements the nepd group recommends that the president direct the administrator of the environmental protection agency to review new source review regulations including administrative interpretation and implementation and report to the president within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity energy efficiency and environmental protection10 the policy also recommends that the president direct the attorney general to review existing nsr enforcement actions to ensure that they are consistent with the clean air act and its regulations11 the most controversial aspect of the current nsr process has been epas decision to apply new source performance standards to existing stationary sources of air pollution that have been modified in section 111 the clean air act clearly states that sources which are subject to nsr include modifications of existing sources as well as plants that are totally new but industry has generally avoided the nsr process by claiming that changes to existing sources were routine maintenance rather than modifications in the 1990s epa began reviewing records of electric utilities petroleum refineries and other industries to determine whether changes at their plants were routine or not as result of these reviews since late 1999 epa and the department of justice have filed suit against 10 electric utilities claiming that the utilities made major modifications to 38 coalfired electrical generating units in 12 states extending their lives and increasing their electric generating capacity without undergoing required new source reviews and without installing best available pollution controls as explained by thenepa administrator carol browner the companies were allowed to perform routine maintenance but they were not allowed to make significant changes to the plant such as increased generating capacity increased burning of coal or modifications that prolonged the life of the plant without seeking permits and adding the best available pollution control devices12 three of the 10 utilities charged with nsr violations tampa electric virginia power and cinergy subsequently settled with epa agreeing

30 of industry capacity the refiners agreed to settle potential charges of nsr violations by paying fines and installing equipment to eliminate 143000 tons of pollution13 companies that have not settled with epa and other critics of the agencys actions claim that epa is reinventing the rules as expressed in one legal analysis since 1974 when regulations implementing the nsr requirements were first promulgated companies and states have made numerous determinations regarding the applicability of the routine maintenance exclusion to certain industrial activities over this period there has been scarce if any guidance or input from epa on the exclusion epas inaction has led both industry and state regulators to conclude they have been applying the exclusion correctly now decades later epa has launched series of initiatives against different industries that call into question what ultimately could be thousands of complianc decisions made by hundreds of companies many of which were endorsed by authorized state agencies charged with implementing the clean air act14 in reinventing the rules the agency is providing disincentives for power producers and refineries to expand output according to critics these critics include the national coal council an advisory committee to the secretary of energy composed largely of industry executives that stated in may 3 report that existing coalfired power plants could make technical improvements to produce an additional 40000 megawatts of electricity if epa would loosen current nsr restrictions15 because the nepd report does not make specific recommendations but simply calls for review of current regulations and enforcement actions it is difficult to conclude what effect these reviews will have the vagueness of these recommendations hasnt prevented interest groups and analysts however from concluding that the administration intends to roll back nsr requirement s which these commenters argue could lead to substantial increases in emissions16 multipollutant legislation simultaneous with its proposal for review of the nsr requirements the nepd proposes to strengthen emission controls onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs9 17 national energy policy p 33powerpla nts through new legislation this proposal is more specific than the nsr recommendations the nepd group recommends that the president direct the epa administrator to work with congress to propose legislation that would establish flexible market based program to significant ly reduce and cap emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury from electric power generators17 since enactment of the clean air act amendments of 1990 epa has taken numerous regulatory actions to reduce emissions of these pollutants from coalfired electric powerplants the first of these the regulation of sulfur dioxide and some nitrogen oxide emissions to reduce acid precipitation which is required under title iv of the act had statutory deadlines in 1995 and 2000 other regulatory actions which have yet to be implemented include the ozone transport rule or nox sip call requiring powerplants in 21 eastern states and the district of columbia to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides during the summer ozone season beginning may 31 2004 various state actions to control emissions of nox sulfur dioxide mercury and in at least one case carbon dioxide and an epa decision announced in december 2000 to regulate mercury emissions from electric utilities the mercury regulations are expected to be proposed in 2003 with an effective date of 2007 or 2008 proposals to control carbon dioxide emissions from powerplants to address global climate change have also been advanced though not by epa the number and variety of prospective regulations on powerplant emissions has suggested to many in industry the congress and the administration that the time may be ripe for comprehensive multipollutant legislation to regulate powerplant emissions the key questions are how stringent the controls will be and whether carbon dioxide co 2 will be among the emissions subject to controls regarding the first of these issues five bills that have been introduced as of early june would require reduction of nox emissions to 15 or 16 million tons nearly 80 reduction from 1998 utility emission levels and reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions to 223 445 million tons reduction of roughly 65 80 versus 1998 regarding mercury two of the bills require epa to determine the level of reductions while the other three require about 90 reduction from current levels of utility emissions in general these reductions would take place by 2005 or 2007 depending on the bill for additional information see crs report rs20894 electricity and air quality comparison of proposed multipollutant legislation the administration has not taken position on either the timing or stringency of its proposed reductions the administration opposes controls on co2 the other critical issue in multi pollutant legislation its critics however and even some of its friends note that the goal of providing regulatory certainty as means of encouraging investment in new powerplants may not be met without its inclusion as one energy industry ceo noted at senate hearinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs10 18 statement of james rogers vice chairman

emissions controls is major source of uncertainty for the power generation sector if co2 requirements are imposed that compel massive expenditures by companies to switch coalfired power plants to natural gas or to purchase expensive allowances the sizable investments we will make to install pollution control equipment over the next 10 years could be wasted18 whatever the merits of co2 regulation some form of multipollutant legislation is expected to be relatively high priority as congress reacts to the recommendations of the nepd report for additional information see crs issue brief 10065 clean air act issues in the 107th congress climate change19 chapter 3 of the nepd report titled protecting americas environment acknowledges the connection between energy and greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide emitted in the combustion of fossil fuels that contribute to atmospheric change and possible global warming the report states energyrelated activities are the primary sources of us manmade greenhouse gas emissions representing about 85 percent of the us manmade total carbonequivalent emissions in 199820 it also notes the slowing of the rate of growth in us greenhouse gas emissions and the reduced carbonintensity of the us economy the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per each unit of gdp which it states declined by 15 during the 1990s the nepd group makes only one specific recommendation with respect to climate change federal agencies are directed to continue climate change research to continue identifying appropriate marketbased mechanisms and incentives for greenhouse gas reductions to continue developing new control technologies and to cooperate in these areas with allies21 as such there are new initiatives in the plan for addressing the climate change issue either domestically or internationally instead the group focuses on existing programs and voluntary actions to address the issue22 stating that the president is committed to addressing the issue the nepd report notes that risks to the global environment can be diminished through energy efficiency educational programs and technology transfer23 with respect to the energy plan per the potential for controls on carbon dioxide are seen primarily as barrier to construction and operation of coalfired electric generating facilities see air quality discussion above as stated in the planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs11 24 ibid pp 513 514 25 ibid p 815 26 prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy 27 national energy policy pp 37 38uncertainty about future environmental controls is of particular concern for companies that operate existing coal power plants regulations under development include variety of measures requiring reductions in emissionsin additionuncerta inty over global and domestic efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions also play role this regulatory uncertainty discourages power producers from building coal power plants and is one reason the united states is relying so heavily on natural gas power generation to meet growing electricity demand24 the nepd report is silent on ways to reduce or mitigate the regulatory uncertainty with respect to carbon dioxide control that it views as major constraint stating there is increasing awareness of global competition for fossil fuels and their potential threats to the global environment25 the plan does not indicate how that awareness might be addressed with respect to supplying the future energy needs of the nation it does note that electricity generated by nuclear power avoids carbon dioxide emissions and natural gas has half the emissions of coal but discussion of other sectors eg transportation effects on carbon dioxide emissions are not addressed the nepd report does point out that cabinetlevel review of climate change policy is underway which could clarify the situation water quality26 energy extraction and production can degrade water quality through discharges but the nepd report observes that federal and state regulators working with businesses and communities can minimize adverse impacts through decisions on siting technology and mitigation of environmental damage it also notes that programs to reduce air pollution such as reducing air emissions of nox and so2 can help clean up waterbodies by reducing deposition of harmful pollutants27 the reports recommendations have fewer implications for water quality than for other environmental issues some implications are unclear for now and could depend on outcomes of efforts to streamline environmental permits discussed above impacts on water quality protection could occur for example if the recommendations lead to modifying discharge permit requirem ents applicable to powerplants or to waiving water qualityrelated requirements for energy production facilities powerplants resource extraction projects etc the report does not directly propose such actions but they could be addressed through implementation of eo 13212 actions to expedite energyrelated projects number of clean water act cwa regulatory and permit requirements apply to energy facilities and as discussed in environmental permit streamlining above clearing the hurdle of such federal requirements can be complex and timeconsuming at the same time constraints may not be exclusively due to federal requirements since state and local governments have important roles as well these implications forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs12 28 report to congress prepared by the staff of the federal energy regulatory commission hydroelectric licensing policies procedures and regulations comprehensive review and recommendations may 2001 145 ppermitting and project approval become more clear in an example that arises from the nepd reports recommend ation for administrative and legislative reform of the licensing process for hydropower dams hydropower dams provide lowcost noemission source of electricity but the report acknowledges that unless properly designed and operated hydropower dams can injure or kill fish such as salmon by blocking their passage to upstream spawning pools operation of dams can impede downstream migration of young fish and can adversely affect stream temperature needed to sustain fish and wildlife according to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc over the next 15 years licenses for about 240 nonfederal dams representing about 2 of total us electric generating capacity will expire and must be reissued if the facilities are to continue operating the nepd report asserts that the most significant challenge confronting hydropower is regulatory uncertainty regarding the federal licensing process which can be lengthy in part because decisionmaking authority is spread across number of federal and state agencies having different public policy goals while not expressly discussed in the report the recommendation that the licensing process be reformed has implications for the clean water act which was in part the subject of recent ferc report28 section 401 of that act requires an applicant for federal license or permit that proposes to conduct any activity including dams that may result in discharge to navigable waters to provide the federal agency with certification from the state in which the discharge originates that the discharge will comply with the act including state water quality standards requirements for additional information see crs report 97488 clean water act section 401 background and issues the ferc report concludes that the most common cause of delayed hydropower licensing proceedings is untimely receipt of state section 401 certification under the clean water act section 401 provides states with two distinct powers one the power indirectly to deny federal permits or licenses by withholding certification and two the power to impose conditions upon federal permits by placing limitations on certification generally section 401 certification has been applied to hydroelectric projects seeking license from ferc and for dredgeandfill activities in wetlands and other waters that require permits from the army corps of engineers under section 404 of the cwa and sections 9 and 10 of the rivers and harbors act it also is applied to permit requirements for industrial and municipal point source dischargers under section 402 of the act in addition it has the potential to be applied to range of other activities that could affect water quality point that has increasingly become an issue in recent years some states have come to view section 401 as an important tool in their overall programs to protect the chemical as well as the physical and biological integrity of their waters some have begun using section 401 to address wide range of impacts to the quality of their waters including impacts to aquatic habitat such as wetlands where issues of nonchemical impacts arise through section 401 somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs13 29 ibid p 16 30 us general accounting office licensing hydropower projects better time and cost continuedstates have addressed such project impacts as inadequate river flow inundation of aquatic habitat dissolved oxygen levels and impacts on fish and other wildlife this expanded use of section 401 has in turn led to tensions between state and federal agencies over the scope of the states section 401 authority particularly the extent to which states can legally address water flow requirements in water quality standards two recent supreme court cases have held that states have broad authority to condition 401 certification on compliance with all applicable water qualityrelated laws as result states acting pursuant to the cwa can regulate not only water quality such as the physical and chemical composition of the water but also water quantity the amount of water released by project and statedesignated water uses such as protection of fish and recreation while ferc lacks authority to determine whether such conditions are beyond the scope of section 401 fercs view is that state water quality certifications impose requirements on projects without any obligation to take into account the benefits of hydropower or other competing interests most troublesome according to ferc are the conditions controlling minimum instream flows imposed especially to protect fish as these flows have direct impact on projects power generation and economic viability29 in order to reduce the time and cost of licensing ferc recommends that congress amend the cwa or the federal power act to clarify that water quality certification is limited to physical and chemical water quality parameters related to hydropower facility while the ferc report focuses on cwa state certification issues in particular the nepds broad recommendation for reform of hydropower licensing could affect implementation of other environmental laws number of statutes affect the licensing process including the endangered species act coastal zone management act national historic preservation act federal land policy and management act and the wild and scenic rivers act these laws allow other federal agencies to affect licensing actions through consultation project conditioning or limits on siting or operation ferc recommends that it be authorized to reject or modify such conditions if they are inconsistent with the commissions public interest determinations opponents of such recommendations believe that federal resource agencies must retain mandate to protect resources and environmental quality by being allowed to attach operating conditions to dam licenses several legislative proposals in the 107th congress hr 1832 s 71 and s 388 would impose time deadlines and decisionmaking standards on the department of the interior for imposing conditions under various laws on projects located on federal reservations and on the departments of interior and commerce for project conditions related to fishways these bills reflect concerns also discussed in the ferc report fercs conclusions and recommendations have been challenged for example in recent report the general accounting office stated that ferc lacks sufficient data to make reasonable conclusions about the causes behind costs and delays in the

for funding research on alternative and renewable energy p 67 it also proposes that royalties that would be paid on any oil that might be found should be used for land conservation programs and for maintenance and improvements on federal lands p 38process asserting that the hydroelectric industry seeks to limit environmental regulations and reduce necessary environmental protections past proposals to restrict states authority to implement cwa section 401 certification have been controversial both with environmental groups and with state officials state representatives argue that restricting the scope of their certification authority would deprive states of the ability to protect and maintain beneficial uses of water and would undermine states investments in pollution control efforts in their view states are best situated to determine whether federally permitted activity will protect the environmental values and uses of waterbody that are established by states the nepd recommendation for reform of hydropower licensing suggests that these issues will be topic of discussion in connection with energy policy debate the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr31 proposals to develop the potential oil and gas resources of the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refugeanwr have been considered for over 25 years during that time the discussion of impacts has centered especially on effects on wilderness values and wildlife for discussion of anwr development issues as whole see crs issue brief 10073 arctic national wildlife refuge the next chapter however opponents of energy development in the refuge also point to potential effects on air and water quality and to potential hazardous waste contamination32 supporters of development counter with the technological advances of the last 20 years that reduce the threat of such impacts the nepd group recommends that the president direct the secretary of the interior to work with congress to authorize exploration and if resources are discovered development of the 1002 area of anwr congress should require the use of the best available technology and should require that activities will result in significant adverse impact to the surrounding environment33 though background material is abundant in the plan further detail relating to the meaning of best available technology or significant adverse impact are given specific legislative proposals have not been included in the plan federal regulatory and permitting authority for pollution matters on anwr comes from number of statutes including the clean air act the clean water acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs15 34for example in the 107th congress in s 388 comprehensive energy bill introduced on feb 26 2001 provides for opening anwr section 505 states the final legislative environmental impact statement is hereby found by the congress to be adequate to satisfy the legal and procedural requirements of the national environmental policy act of 1969 with respect to actions authorized to be taken by the secretary to develop and promulgate the regulations for the establishment of the leasing program authorized by this title congress has also used this approach in past energy projects in authorizing the departm ent of the interior to grant rightofway for construction of the transalaska pipeline system pl 93 153 congress barred further judicial review of the adequacy of its eis which had been challengedthe coastal zone management act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the endangered species act the fish and wildlife coordination act the migratory bird treaty act the marine mammal protection act the national environmental policy act the resource conservation and recovery act the national wildlife refuge system improvement act the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act and others in some cases pollution control permits required by certain of these laws expressly call for best available control technology for example the new source review permits under the clean air act and discharge permits under the clean water act other permits may implicitly presume what might be called best available control technology federal agencies involved in enforcing these laws include the environmental protection agency the army corps of engineers the fish and wildlife service the national marine fisheries service the coast guard and others state regulation of pollution is carried out primarily through the alaska department of environmental conservation adec acting through various state laws as well as through delegated federal authorities overall the permitting processes would involve patchwork of agencies and levels of government and diverse criteria for issuance permitting and regulatory issues that could arise in an effort to open anwr include those discussed under environmental permit streamlining above in addition some of the following are likely to be particularly important nepa requires an environmental impact statement eis for major federal actions significantly affecting the human environment in 1987 the department of the interior released final legislative environmental impact statement fleis as part of the administrations proposal to open anwr is that fleis sufficient for compliance with nepa or should new eis be prepared knowledge of the biological and physical environment in the arctic has increased markedly and technology has made major advances since 1987 making it likely that new eis could differ significantly in assessing likely impacts of exploration and development preparation of new eis could be expected to take one or more years and probably delay exploration and development congress could require new eis deem the 1987 report adequate for compliance thereby foreclosing potential challenge s on those grounds34 or remain silent on the issue are water resources adequate to support exploration and development and to what extent should such matters be handled under existing state or federal authorities or in legislation or new regulations modern exploration techniqueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs16 35 for more information see crs report rl30853 clean air act summary of the act and its major requirementsrely heavily on ice roads and ice drill pads the refuge has substantially less water than prudhoe bay and other stateowned oil fields to the west average annual precipitation is less than 10 inches it might then be necessary to augment existing supplies one common augmentation technique the dredging of gravel holding ponds near rivers would require 404 permits under the clean water act state permits might also be necessary some fear that effects on streams and riparian habitats may be substantial either from the water use itself or from methods to increase the water supply to what extent can spills of crude drilling fluids human waste or produced water water extracted in the course of operations and then reinjected for disposal be reduced or eliminated normal industry practice in the arctic is zero discharge of such substances or of any other wastes at drill site and disposal usually occurs via reinjection deep underground however spills occur nonetheless reinjection of oil industry wastes are not subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rather the safe drinking water act sdwa regulates the underground injection of wastes for injection wells related to oil and gas operations the sdwa authorizes epa to delegate primary regulatory authority to states that have relevant programs provided the programs protect drinking water sources and meet certain other requirements alaska administers regulatory program for oil and gas production wells and requires permits for these wells several kinds of air pollution control permits would be required to explore and develop anwr including state air emissions permits issued by adec and new source review permits for prevention of significant deterioration of air quality also issued by adec perhaps the biggest permitting challenge in air emissions could involve prevention of significant deterioration35 of its air quality from emissions of nitrogen oxides which would be emitted by natural gas flares and by natural gasfired generators to power development if oil were found such requirements could be major regulatory hurdle for plans to develop the area unless congress enacted waivers of these provisions whether oil is found or not what provisions will be made for reclamation and rehabilit ation of the land following exploration or development under the national wildlife refuge system improvement act pl 10557 new activities are permitted on refuges to the extent that they are compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was designated bills supporting oil development have included provision defining oil development as compatible use for the purposes of this law fws might condition development permits on mitigation reclamation or rehabilitation of affected lands if commercial quantities of oil were found cleanup needs might be fairly minimal if oil is found and production and development occur industrial activity would last decades and rehabilitation would be difficult and expensive in either case rehabilitation is likely to be lengthy because the slow growth rate of vegetationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs17 36for example s 388 would require federal agencies to take such actions as are necessary to establish and implement competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for the exploration development and production of the oil and gas resources in anwr and to administer the provisions of this title through regulations lease terms conditions restrictions prohibitions stipulations and other provisions that ensure the oil and gas exploration develop ment and production activities in anwr will result in significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife their habitat subsistence resources and the environm ent and shall require the application of the best commercially available technology for oil and gas exploration development and production 305a emphasis added s 388 does not waive any existing statutory pollution control requirements another congressional approach to specifying environmental protection responsibilities for the transalaska pipeline system can be found at 30 usca 185h2in the arctic means that the most minimal disturbance can take decades to recover over all number of federal environmental laws could apply to oil or gas development projects in anwr those requirements and additional ones might also be imposed as conditions of leasing permits as noted in environmental permit streamlining above several current laws contain provisions that allow citizens to file lawsuits challenging project or activity for failure to comply with requirements of laws or permits thus while policy debate concerning the refuge has focused on effects on wilderness values and wildlife it is conceivable that opponents could use the environmental protection provisions discussed here as mechanism for challenging energy development in the area unless congress enacted waivers of these authorities whether the existing pollution control requirements would meet the best available technology and the significant adverse impact recommendati on of the nepd group would likely be debated by congress if it were to decide to open the refuge but it is unclear whether or how congress might modify their stringency or streamline the processes by which they are implemented36 bills have been introduced in the house and the senate to open the refuge to development other bills would designate the area at issue as wilderness thereby providing additional obstacles to development the high degree of controversy over opening the refuge for exploration and develop ment hinders prospects for development legislation legislative context the majority of the nepd reports 105 recommendations involve administrative actions while 21 involve recommendations to the congress for legislative action most of the latter are broad and general like the report as whole and the report has not yet been followed by specific legislative proposals debate over energy legislation has been underway in the congress for some time prior to the release of the nepd report and both republican and democratic members of the senate have introduced comprehensive proposals that differ significantly in their policy approaches neither deals with streamlinin g issues or regulatory changes in broad terms but as noted above the comprehensive republican proposal includes provisions related to anwr and to licensing of hydropower projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31020crs18 the republican proposal s 388 s 389 introduced february 26 sets as its goal reducing us dependence on oil imports to less than 50 by 2011 and emphasizes boosting production of conventional fuels it proposes to lease anwr with portion of bid bonuses earmarked toward funding research into renewable energy research and development and portion of royalties dedicated to land conservation the use of coal would be encouraged with credits available for emissions reductions and efficiency improvements the legislation would require an improvement of 3 mpg in the fuel efficiency of the federal motor vehicle fleet other provisions would provide support for renewable fuels alternative technologies residential energy efficiencies and new nuclear reactor designs the senate democratic legislation s 596 s 597 introduc ed march 22 proposes to integrate energy and environmental policy to identify energy policy options consistent with stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions the democratic proposal does not embrace opening up anwr but it would establish incentives that would hasten development of pipeline capacity to transport alaskan natural gas the democratic legislation also does not include an increase in automobile fuel economy standards but does propose to cap automobile and light truck fuel consumption in 2008 at more than 5 above consumption in 2000 for more information see crs issue brief ib10080 energy policy setting the stage for the current debate in addition to these comprehensive proposals bills dealing with number of individual energy policy and related environmental policy issues have been introduced in the senate and house some have been previously mentioned in this report bills addressing multipollutant air emissions and opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to development for example among other individual topics already addressed in legislation are developing clean coal technology domestic oil and gas production alternative energy sources electricity deregulation motor vehicle fuels and fuel economy standards and expanding use of nuclear energy it is unclear for now whether congress will choose to consider the range of energy policy issues individually or comprehensively the nepd report does not appear to express preference conclusion energy problems and related issues do not lend themselves to fast or easy fixes moreover the focus of the debate in congress is likely to be affected by recent leadership changes in the senate changes in committee leadership there are likely to result in new or changed priorities many observers suggest for example that the administrations proposals for oil and gas exploration in anwr seem less likely to be supported also administration support for multipollutant air quality legislation enhances the visibility of that topic but the issue of including carbon dioxide emissions in such bill as some propose is likely to be contentious with many participants and perspectives involved including multiple congressional committees lengthy and vigorous debate is expected over policies that will balance investment in energy production conservation energy efficiency environmental protectio n and research and development in alternative fuels and technologies
