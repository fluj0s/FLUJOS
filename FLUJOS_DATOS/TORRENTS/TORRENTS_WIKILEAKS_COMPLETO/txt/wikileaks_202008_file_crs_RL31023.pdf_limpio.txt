as goal the conversion of russia to functioning market system in this decade without successful reform to develop functioning market system with sustained growth the russian economy is likely to recede in performance toward the level of developing country putins strategy calls for rapid and comprehensive changes in the structure of the russian economy including radical changes in fiscal financial enterprise and administrative systems whether putin is able and willing to implement the difficult decisions to bring about successful market reform in russia may become evident in 2001 to 2002 several american and russian empirical studies support putins reform strategy putins reforms are designed to convert the russian economy from disinvestment and disincentive to functioning market system elements of successful reform center on changes deemed necessary to increase productivity and attract investors reform prospects have been improved by the action program in putins state of the nation address of april 2001 putin is building on the blueprints and programs established in the year 2000 to move toward rapid legislation and implementation of these structural reforms unparalleled current economic growth may if continued provide window of opportunity for gaining political support for reform and funding to facilitate reform implementation authoritarian trends in governance would tend to deter the development of rule of law regime central to successful market reform possible economic crises in debt management demographic and infrastructure problem areas may pose difficult budgetary choices and draw future political and economic support away from reform resistance to reform and increased defense spending which have been especially favored by some oligarchs may be tempered and reversed acceptance of international market rules and corporate governance would facilitate an increase in productivity and generate larger inflows of investment support in place of previous strong opposition by gazprom the worlds largest energy company may be the single most important factor in the success or failure in initiating putins comprehensive structural reforms functioning market system in russia might benefit us interests by providing profitable investment opportunities and less threatening and more cooperative russia successful reform could open opportunities for russia and its creditor nations to better manage official paris club debt and for russia to accede to the world trade organization wto the dangers of failed russian reform to us

also noted that russia had to apply hard lesson learned from its soviet communist past communism and the power of soviets did not make russia prosperous country with dynamically developing society of free people communism vividly demonstrated its ineptitude for sound self development dooming our country to steady lag behind economically advanced countries it was road to blind alley which is far away from the main stream of civilization6 this route leading down blind alley was set by josef stalin in 1931 when he called on the soviet union in its first fiveyear plan to overcome russias traditional security weaknesses by following an authoritarian economic development path to becoming the most militarized economy in modern history7 putin stated that strong state power in russia is democratic lawbased federative state putins political and economic supporters however interpreted this prescription differently in the year 2000 the economic reformers considered lawbased state necessary to provide the regulatory framework for economic decisions based on market forces8 putins democratic market reform requires rule of law in the economic realm to assure functioning market system some political supporters considered an economy directed by the political leadership as necessary and sufficient to attain putins goal of sustained growth putins kremlin staff security advisors

legislative agenda putin appears to have proceeded in 2000 as if each small reform step or stated commitment to reform would be incremental in its impact on the growth performance of russian economy rather than explicitly recognizing the need for comprehensive change half measures continued to be characteristic of reform in 2000 putin has moved to clarify and resolve what is necessary in state

his commitment to action in his recent state of the nation address13 he noted that attempts to carry out structural reform do not merely end with writing blueprints and programs14 clear theses on

reformers the die has not yet been cast for comprehensive structural reform and sustained growth it may prove impossible for necessary changes to be made in the near term eg to 2010 as set out in the gref reform plans prepared for putin james millar raises relevant questions on the viability of putins reform plans in the near term millar stresses the necessary comprehensiveness and simultaneity of structural changes if russian reform is to be successful partial measures would fail because the institutions of the old planned economy would resist change to return to kind of institutional equilibrium introduction of capitalis t institutions also apparently requires wholesale approach for the same reason prices need to be free to fluctuate in competitive markets to equilibrium levels and private decisions are to be made efficiently with respect to output and investment enterprises must be privately owned for these decisions to reflect resource scarcities competition in these markets is also necessary and so on thus it would appear that all prices need to be freed enterprises privatized competition established legal structure enforcing contracts created and so forth all

financing of residential housing was to address critical problem affecting the quality of russian life and would have promised reduction in the largest single subsidy in the budget however the lack of implementation of banking reform led to the failure to attract savings to russias banks where they might be used to generate investment funds an estimated 65 billion in dollarized savings still

claimant for sberbank losses was the state budget capital flight increased to an estimated 246 billion in 200023 new foreign direct investment was still small at about 5 billion going to capital

bureaucrats as his kremlin security advisors and many oligarchs would favor market friendly state would be expected to develop professional civil service and military funding military support or

empirical studies by american and russian research teams support putins strategic view that structural reforms are necessary to develop an efficient market economy and if comprehensively implemented would generate sufficient investment for ensuring sustainable growth29 according to these studies timely introduction of the structural reforms prepared by putins reformers would result in the development of functioning market economy these empirical studies add weight to putin reforms prospects because they are made by institutions that are prime consultants to potential investors in russia the major result from implementing putin reforms would be qualitative improvement in both the russian investment climate and its economic incentive system the disinvestment trend in the russian economy might be reversed by an investmentfriendly environment that would help revitalize the capital base its disincentive nature would give way to functioning market economy partial reform in russia initiated in 1992 led to some beneficial changes in economic stabilization price liberalization and privatization of enterprises but the russian economy under boris yeltsin lost economic ground as

output was reduced to as little as half the level of performance that russia had inherited from the soviet union according to official russian reports31 the mckinsey studies further noted that endowment of natural resources and quality of skilled labor were not likely constraints on increased growth the key constraints were systemic ie the lack of structural reform32 investment requirements revitalization of the capital assets substantial new investment would be needed to restore the diminished capital assets in russia the value of capital assets in russian enterprises fell in the 1990s assets inherited by the russian federation were estimated to be 30 as productive as assets in comparable sectors of the united states economy in 1991 by 1997 the average labor productivity of selected russian economic sectors had been cut to 19 of the us level33 the reasons for the fall in productivity during this period include lack of new investment deterioration of product ivity of old assets due to obsolescence lack of maintenance and change of demand leading to idling or negative value of output of many enterprises new domestic investment was not generated in the 1990s since politically controlled banks did not attract savings and failed to convert savings to capital investment even the profitable russian enterprises did not have the stimulus to invest monopolistic profits of

mechanism as projected by putin is the central requirement for improved productivity in the mckinsey studies the russian system largely lacks incentiv for enterprises to be efficient show profits pay wages and pensions and attract investment the nonpayment system led to development of barter economy with unpaid wages and pensions and non working loans world bank study concluded that the process of institutionalizing nonpayment was incentive driven central bankers could own stock in the banks they regulated oligarchs could own the banks from which they borrowed and loans from politically controlled banks were not required to be repaid nonpayment systematically prevented the resumption of growth41 the mckinsey study team noted that the disincentive system at the enterprise level was especially characterized by an uneven playing field eg cheap energy is provided to non viable steel plants and wholesale markets are subject to eight times fewer tax liabilities than some supermarkets furthermore tax rules meant little as taxes were effectively tailored for individual enterprises enterprise budget constraints were soft and profits were not required to avoid

russian economy were not reformed it would continue to regress this economy was likely without reform to fall further toward that of developing economy the mckinsey study also assessed the comparative productivity of the russian economy as whole this macroeconomic assessment drew on experience from studies of productivity of twentyfour sectors in eleven countries including brazil japan and poland the comprehensive studies of the mckinsey team concluded that with functioning market incentive system and adequate investment the russian economy could take advantage of the potential productivity in

system based on favorable investment environment the mckinsey study also argued that successful reform would lead to change in the structure of the russian economy making it similar after reform to developed economies with further liberalization of prices facilitated by effective reform of the natural monopolies and increasing demand from rising real income the relative rates of growth of each sector would reflect competitive market forces by responding to new incentive system with liberalization of prices new capital investment would be drawn to the sectors that had the greatest promise

might be fragile or short lived and that window of opportunity for initiating comprehensive structural reform might be closed the window of opportunity may be defined as period of good economic performance that might facilitate political support for adoption of reform legislation and an economic basis for funding of reform the adoption by the russian parliament of the legislative agenda arising out of putins april theses may facilitate favorable economic performance economic growth in 2000 permitted the elimination of arrears pensions wages and other overdue payments were brought up

implementation of reform authoritarian impediments to reform some aspects of authoritarian rule that ran counter to the development of the rule of law in russia were implemented in 2000 putin took steps to consolidate his political power in the center by appointing his own security and military officers as administrators in the consolidated regional governments strengthening the national security council headed by kgb general sergei ivanov served to recentralize security and foreign policy the media and religious organizations were more closely controlled with some consolidation of ownership of facilities and enhanced control by the state freedom of speech and religion were limited by greater state control through the reenforcement of the states right to intervene media unpopular with the state leadership such as the television network ntv were publicly attacked ownership changed and the freedom of the press constrained religiou s faiths expressed fear of state intervention in their right to worship as they chose55 this reserved right to intervene by the leadership is an essential feature of an authoritarian rule mentality that may also be applied in the economic arena even if economic reform leads to enactment of laws protecti ng property and shareholders rights the government may retain the right to intervene in order to favor some investors enterprises or regions in short putins choice between state favoring functioning market forces governed by rule of law and authoritarian rule may be influenced both by the spirit and the letter of the law in the year 2000 putin reinforced the authoritarian character of his governance both in substance and in spirit the case can be made that the authoritarian lobbies of the kremlin the security apparatus and the oligarchs have had more influence over the government and parliament than the lobbies for reform in the year 200056 putins stress on the need for normal judicial system in his april

assumed leadership in russia however if the window of opportunity is not used to implement comprehensive reform while it is available the russian economy may not be put on new trend line of sustained growth and balanced budgets economic growth and increased revenue do not assure adequate funding for reform military reform will require substantial increase in the budget for 2002 an increase of 15

potential of serious crises in any or all of the areas is clear and present possibility as they represent the negative fundamentals in the current russian economy general crisis in 2003 might further

expected to peak in 2003 russian leaders predict that making the required payments on all of the external debt may require either reduced funding for reform or lead to default on debt payment
