paperwork for variety of reasons not the least of which include direction accountability and service delivery the constitution mandates one of the largest paperwork requirementsthe decennial census1 the first congress set the initial paperwork obligation in the eleventh law it adopted an act of september 1 1789 concerning the documentation of marine vessels2 the burdensome nature of paperwork became much more acute with the rise of the federal administrative state in the early years of the 20th century the 16th amendment to the constitution adopted in february 1913 authorized congress to impose taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the states and without regard to any census or enumeration the war revenue act of october 1917 made the income tax the chief source of revenue during the participation of the united states in world war i and introduced the american citizenry to the travails of tax reporting 3 simultaneous with these developments was an increase in federal regulatory and compliance agencies with new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for financial health and safety and business activities an autonomous department of labor was established in 19134 along with the federal reserve system5 the federal trade commission was created the following year6 united states entry into world war i in 1917 prompted multiplicity of new regulatory entities to deal with transportation shipping trade manufacturing and food and fuel production in the years following the end of world war i the provision of new personal benefits to the public added to federal reporting and recordkeeping requirements first came veterans programs and the establishment of the veterans administration in 1930 next was the arrival of the new deal in 1933 with the subsequent provision of variety of old age security unemployment disability and welfare benefits the new deal also enge ndered variety of new financial banking industrial farming communications housing and public works regulatory programs finally the outbreak of war in europe in 1939 and the entry of the united states into world war ii in 1941 brought variety of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for virtually all sectors of the nation and its citizens g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g346g344g561 federal officials were not unaware of the gr owing reporting and recordkeeping burden being generated by new regulatory and personal benefits programs at the highest level president franklin d roosevelt indicated in may 16 1938 letter to the central statistical board his concern over the large number of statistical reports which federal agencies are requiring from business and industry informing the board of his desire to know the extent of such reports and how far there is duplication among them he tasked the panel to report to on the statistical 1 article i section 2 prescribes

consolidations and changes which are consistent with efficiency and economy both to the government and to private industry7 in response the board indicated that for the fiscal year ending june 30 1938 the executive agencies had collected over 135 million returns from individuals and businesses but concluded that most of this information was needed by the government and that while such reporting should be coordinated it should remain decentralized 8 while this reply apparently ended the matter for the president there were those in congress w ho remained sensitive to the paperwork issue among them was the senate special committee to study the problems of american small business which developed the draft federal reports act of 1941 empowering the bureau of the budget bob to 1 direct an agency to coll ect information on behalf of itself and other agencies and 2 direct an agency to provide to another agency data it had collected for itself later version of the proposal required bob clearance of any agencys plans or forms for the collection of information from 10 or more persons authorized bob to determine whether or not proposed agency collection of information was necessary for the performance of its functions barred any collection of information which bob deemed unnecessary for any reason and exempted the department of the treasury including the internal revenue service irs from the requirements of the measure in the house the legislation was stripped of the treasury department exemption was amended to except the general accounting office gao from its requirements and had provision appended to indicate that persons who failed to furnish information to an agency could only be subjected to the penalties provided by statutory law conference committee on the measure reinstated but narrowed the treasury exemption to exclude only the irs comptroller of the currency bureau of the public debt bureau of accounts division of foreign funds control and federal bank supervisory agencies sent to the president the bill was signed into law on december 24 1942 as the federal reports act of 1942 fra 9 implementing the fra bob required each agency seeking information from 10 or more persons to submit the proposed questionnaire along with an explanation of its administration and full justification for its use including an estimate of the time required for completion of the instrument while bob devoted almost 50 of its st aff to this area in the immediate postworld war ii years the number fell to some 25 personnel in the 1960s and 1970s in 1942 the bob director also inaugurated the advisory council on federal reports composed of representatives from leading national business organizations who met quarterly to consider broad questions concerning federal reporting requirements however when representatives from agencies seeking information subsequently began to meet with council members to discuss collections the situation came under criticism and congressional investigation and reform legislationthe federal advisory committee act of 1972 facawas enacted 10 the council was reconstituted as the business advisory council on federal reports an

process occasionally required before collections could be undertaken regulatory agencies complained that office of management and budget omb refusals to allo w them to collect information from regulated industries infringed upon their statutory duties11 in 1973 congress responded by exempting the independent regulatory agencies from omb review12 congressional unhappiness with omb had also be prompted by 1972 report by the senate select committee on small business which concluded that there was an indifference of omb officials towards their basic responsibilities since only relative handful between one and five percent of forms were disapproved the committee could only conclude that hundreds of unnecessary or duplicative forms were being imposed on the public13 the committee also believed that omb not knowing the problems of small business respondents could not effectively adapt data requests to respondents records 14 had shown consistent lack of initiative in rigorously pursuing the directives of the federal reports act15 and had refused to adequately staff or properly equip with data pr ocessing tools its statistical policy division the office that was responsible for administering the fra16 ultimately the committee recommended that gao be given the fra responsibilities presently vested in omb17 the congressional response to this and similar criticism of omb regarding reporting and recordkeeping burdens was the creation of the commission on federal paperwork in 1974

had issued 36 reports and had offered 770 recommendations19 among its findings the commission proffered that structural and procedural flaws in the federal reports acts clearance process preclude it from ever being fully successful in controlling the total paperwork burden on the american public20 among these flaws were the exemption of irs nd the bank supervisory agencies from the fras requirements and the shared jurisdiction of omb and gao over the reports clearance process the commission determined that insufficient resources had been allocated to the fra clearance process which was seen as being ineffective in the case of new programs because it occurred too late in the development process 21 the commission also concluded that information is valuable resource which government should manage with the same care and responsibility that apply to its management of its financial material physical and human resources22 among its recommendations the commission called for new legislation replacing the fra to regulate the collection management and use of governmentheld information as well as its disclosure it also urged the establishment of an executive office to among other functions coordinate information management responsibilities and to monitor agency compliance with information laws23 the commissions organic statute specified that upon the submission of the panels final report omb was to coordinate and formulate executive branch views concerning the commissions recommendations begin implementing those recommendations in which the executive concurred and propose legislation needed to carry out those recommendations in which the executive concurred 24 september 1979 omb progress report the third such required semiannual report indicated that more than 50 of the commissions recommendations pertaining to the executive branch 269 of 520 had been implemented25 six months later however gao assessment criticized omb for overstating the progress that had been made in implementing the commissions recommendations gao urged congress to enact legislation requiring omb to establish legislative program for those recommendations still pending and create an office of federal information policy within omb26 g22g145g142g561g18g138g153g142g155g160g152g155g148g561g20g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g350g342g561 neither

the carter administration the paperwork reduction act pra made omb the principal policymaker and overseer of government paperwork activities the statute established new office of information and regulatory affairs oira within omb to which the director of omb was to delegate his paperwork functions 36 these functions included reviewing and approving information collection requests proposed by agencies determining whether the collection of information by an agency is necessary for the proper performance of its functions ensuring that all procedural requirements for collecting information were fulfilled designating collection agency to obtain information for two or more agencies setting goals for reduction of the burdens of federal information collection requests overseeing action on the recommendations of the commission on federal paperwork and designing and operating the federal information locator system37 the pra also assigned information management resp onsibilities to the director of omb indeed the statutes title was somewhat misleading th director was broadly mandated to develop and implement federal information policies principles standards and guidelines and to provide direction and oversee the review and approval of information collection requests the reduction of the paperwork burden and federal statistical activities records management activities privacy of records interagency sharing of information and acquisition and use of automatic data processing telecommunications and other technology for managing information resources38 among the general information policy functions enumerated for the director were developing and implementing uniform and consistent information resources management policies and overseeing the development of information

the first year of pra implementation omb reported that oira had been established prior to the statutory deadline regulations had been issued to guide the agencies and effective progress had been made in realizing compliance with the acts procedures and requirements53 gao however offered contrary view assessing the fi rst six months of omb efforts at implementing the pra comptroller general charles bowsher told house oversight subcommittee that omb had denied gao access to documents and information essential to reaching full understanding of its processes and an assessment of its efforts nonetheless the comptroller proffered ombs efforts to implement the paperwork reduction act can be characterized as lacking the visible and forceful leadership necessary to achieve the acts objectives sufficiently high priority has not been given to implementing the act little or effort has been directed to key requirements of the act as recently as october 16 1981 omb had approved formal plans for implementing the act resources have been allocated to other functions and growing workload of paperwork clearances is resulting in little or effort being devoted to other key requirements of the act 54 the comptroller noted that substantial portion of oira resources have been devoted to regulatory review activities which are outside the scope of the act he reported that over 2000 reviews of regulations pursuant to eo 12291 had been conducted while only 23 such reviews pursuant to the pra had occurred conseque ntly pra work was backlogged growing workload of individual paperwork review cases s resulted in delays in completing reviews of agencies pra implementation plans 55 two years later gao found that omb had been successful in meeting its requirements to reduce paperwork in terms of total percentages but had made limited progress in information resources management areas other than paperwork reduction such as developing uniform information policies promoting more effective use of advanced information technology and overseeing the federal statistical system 56 oiras regulatory review activity remained problem for pra administration the act gao pointed out provides oira neither authority nor resource authorization for performing reviews of regulations except for assessing compliance with the acts objectives for reducing paperwork congressiona l leaders were reminded

action is needed to require omb to increase the pace of progress toward achieving the paperwork reduction acts objectives require omb to identify the resources needed for fully implementing the pra and report annually on the resources expended for that purpose provide separate appropriation for implementing the pra provide separate appropriation for implementing the act and amend it to prohibit oira from performing any duties other than those required by the act 58 an april 1983 gao report acknowledged that omb has taken several preliminary steps to implement its responsibilities for controlling fe deral recordkeeping requirements imposed on the public but concluded that these steps have not produced meaningful retention standards consequently individuals and businesses often retained records longer than required resulting in an increased paperwork burden the report indica ted that omb should address this issue now and take the action necessary to meet its statutory responsibility for developing standards to control the length of time records must be retained for the federal government 59 gao recommended that omb work with the general services administration gsa which was responsible for various records management matters at that time60 to reestablish the previous records retention guide produced by that agency and modify its information collection request review process to facilitate the compiling of the guide61 omb evidenced little interest in these suggestions62 amidst these gao criticisms of its implementation of the pra omb engendered the enmity of the internal revenue service irs and the treasury department which objected to ombs attempts to review irs regulations containing reporting or recordkeeping requirements to settle the dispute omb sought an interpretive opini on from the office of legal counsel olc department of justice that would be bindin g on the agencies rendered on june 22 1982 the olc opinion concluded that reporting or recordkeeping requirements set out in prior existing regulations were not subject to omb review under the pra 63 the opinion was largely viewed as substantial defeat for omb for various reasons not the least of which was the fact that irs regulations accounted for almost half of the federal governments paperwork burden64 58 ibid p v 59 us general accounting office more guidance and controls

congress left oira dependent upon ombs annual general authorization until its own spending authority could be restored however there was considerable amount of concern in congress among members of

reauthorizing th pra while limiting oiras control over the regulatory review process initially in march 1990 house managers negotiated with omb to legislate simple threeyear reauthorization for oira

managers thought they had administration consent to this arrangement the wh ite house withdrew its support in early april just as the reauthorization measure was about to be taken to the house floor70 the senate bill unlike its house counterpart contained many restrictions on oira and when it was scheduled for consideration by the committee on governmental affairs in early april republican members of the panel who opposed the oira limitations boycotted the meeting later in early june after some accommodations had been reached the committee approved the bill on 140 vote71 further negotiation with the bush administration produced another compromise during the last week of the 101st congress administration officials agreed to restrain ombs exercise of its regulatory power if congress would forego writing limits on oiras review of agency regulatory actions into law72 senate committee leaders indicated they would bring strippeddown version of their bill to the floor73 in light of this deal house managers brought their bill to the floor74 and on october 23 after about 15 minutes of debate it was adopted on voice vote75 the next day omb released statement indicating the bush
