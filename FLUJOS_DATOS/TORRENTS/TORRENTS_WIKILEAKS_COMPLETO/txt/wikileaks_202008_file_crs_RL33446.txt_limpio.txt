military manpower policy foreign affairs defense and trade division military pay and benefits key questions and answers summary in the late 1990s the military services were facing considerable recruiting and career retention problems in responding congress was mindful of how inadequate pay had contributed to decreased recruit quality in the late 1970s it authorized larger pay raises increased special pays and bonuses provided more recruiting resources and repealed planned military retired pay reductions for future retirees in the spirit of national unity following the attacks of september 11 2001 recruitment improved the programmatic changes noted above also helped recruiting substantially however the grueling pace of deployments to and from iraq and afghanistan combined with the dangers of combat began to cause longanticipated recruiting problems for the allvolunteer force in 2005 the army army national guard and army reserve all fell short of their recruiting goals an infusion of additional recruiters and congressional increase in the maximum enlistment bonus from 20000 to 40000 contributed to the active army meeting its 2006 2007 and 2008 recruiting targets career retention of servicemembers beyond their initial period of obligated service is difficult to measure due to the suspended separation and retirement of many personnel since september 11 2001 but so far retention is reported to be more than satisfactory however the services anticipate challenging recruiting year in fy2009 debate continues over what kinds of pay and benefit increases are best for improving recruiting and retention of particular interest is the balance between acrosstheboard pay raises on the one hand and ones targeted by grade years of service and occupational skill on the other and between cash compensation on the one hand and improvements in benefits such as housing health care and installation services on the other the issue of pay comparability between military and civilian pay commonly referred to as the pay gap continues to receive emphasis while many analysts believe the gap has been reduced to less than three percent by the fy2009 pay raise others argue that pay and benefit increases since 911 have eliminated the gap the issue persists in part because the numerous different elements of military pay make it difficult to compare to civilian salaries and other benefits since the early 1990s numerous changes in benefits have greatly favored individual members these include changes in the cash allowance received by personnel not living in military

and associated benefits continue to receive significant congressional interest as concerns continue over military recruiting and retention this interest in military pay bonuses and benefits will probably continue the army missed its fy2005 recruiting goal of 80000 by 6627 soldiers this was the first time in 26 years that the active army had failed to meet or exceed the annual recruiting mission with the help of approximately 1100 additional recruiters and an increase in the maximum enlistment bonus from 20000 to 400001 the army met its fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 recruiting mission of 80000 each year even though there was decline in the number of high school diploma graduates and an increase in the number of waivers required the services anticipate another challenging recruiting year in fy2009 key questions and answers 1 why did the adequacy of active duty military pay become major issue beginning in the late 1990s since the end of the draft in 19721973 the adequacy of military pay has tended to become an issue for congress for one or both of two reasons if it appears that the military services are having trouble recruiting enough new personnel or keeping sufficient career personnel of requisite quality or the standard of living of career personnel is perceived to be less fair or equitable than that which demographically comparable civilians in terms of age education skills responsibilities and similar criteria can maintain the first issue is an economic inevitability on at least some occasions in the absence of draft the services must compete in the labor market for new enlistees and fact often overlooked have always had to compete in the labor market for 1 section 635 pl 109163 january 6 2006 crs2 more mature individuals to staff the career force there are always occasions when unemployment is low and hence recruiting is more difficult and others when unemployment is high and military service more attractive alternative the second situation while often triggered by the first is frequently stated in moral or ethical terms proponents of this viewpoint argue that even if quantitative indexes of recruiting and retention appear to be satisfactory the crucial character of the militarys mission of national defense and its acceptance of the professional ethic that places survival below mission accomplishment demands certain levels of compensation beginning in the mid1990s several new factors caused recruiting and retention problems severe enough to move congress once again to deal with this issue among the factors cited by analysts were 1 public impression that the end of the cold war meant that military service was longer interesting relevant or even available as career option 2 the postcold war drawdown in active duty military manpower by 40 which greatly reduced real and perceived enlistment and career retention opportunities 3 the 1990s economic expansion which led to the explosive growth of actual and perceived civilian career options 4 rise in civilian consumer living standards against which military families measure their own economic success or failure 5 concerns over increased family separation due to more operations and training away from home whether home was in the united states or in foreign countries and 6 decreased propensity for military service among young people for other reasons such as antimilitary parents and educators 7 skepticism about new missions such as operations other than war peacekeeping or peace enforcement and 8 the availability of government educational assistance from other sources the gi bill without the gi 2 what kinds of increases in military pay and benefits have been considered or used in the past many military compensation analysts have strongly criticized acrosstheboard rather than selective pay raises they argue that acrosstheboard increases fail to bring resources to bear where they are most needed percentage increases targeted on particular pay grades and number of years of service and special pays and bonuses targeted on particular occupational skills they suggest would maximize the recruiting and retention gains for the compensation dollars spent acrosstheboard increases also affect variety of other costs retired pay for instance is computed as percentage of basic pay however there have been proposals to include special pays and bonuses in retired pay calculations precisely to provide an additional incentive for the recipients to stay in service the services already do great deal of such targeting having maintained large system of special pays and bonuses since the end of conscription over 30 years ago personnel managers report indication that such targeted compensation has had the deleterious effects on morale and cohesion that some had feared acrosstheboard pay increases however are believed by many to have the advantages of simplicity visibility and equity if everyone gets similar percentage increase nobody can feel or can claim that he or she has been left out it also shows up immediately in the persons next paycheck rather than months or years later when particular individual crs3 is next eligible for lump sum special pay or bonus some special pays and bonuses are paid monthly or biweekly as part of regular pay it is likely that as in the past overall increases in military cash compensation over the next several years will combine both acrosstheboard and targeted increases both of these increases because of their broad appeal may well be sound approaches to improving recruiting and retention as much as possible in addition many observers believe that the recent enactment of the new post 911 gi bill benefit with its generous benefits and transferability options will have an overall beneficial impact on both recruiting and retention recruiting and retention problems are not necessarily solved by increasing military pay many components of the military compensation system that are important to recruiting and retention efforts especially the latter do not involve cash pay these include retirement benefits health care housing permanent change of station pcs moving costs and policies exchanges commissaries and other retail facilities and recreational facilities wide range of views about existing military personnel management practices suggests that the services requirements for both new enlistees and career people could be significantly reduced by changing often longstanding and interrelated assignment promotion career development or retirement policies survey research also reveals that the sense of patriotism public service and esprit corps found in capable and combatready armed forces is extremely significant to both new enlistees and career members furthermore there are always limits to what increased compensation whether cash or inkind can do to help any organization cope with personnel difficulties job and career satisfaction public and elite views of the importance and legitimacy of the military as an institution unit morale success in operational deployments and especially in combat may well be independent of compensation variables high scoring in these intangibles especially for unique organization and culture like the armed forces can and frequently does balance perceived issues in compensation however few analysts believe that recruiting and retention rates can be brought up to service target levels without continuing to maintain the momentum of recent pay raises many longtime observers seem to feel that money alone cannot keep person in the military for full career if the person does not like the military culture they assert that the lifestyle is too demanding and too arduous for most at the same time it is argued that people can be driven out of the military if their compensation and living standards are not at least somewhat close to those of their demographic and educational counterparts in civilian life 3 what is pay table reform the current military pay table displays the amount of monthly basic pay2 which servicemember is entitled to based on the members pay grade3 and length of 2 basic pay is monthly compensation that all military personnel in the same pay grade and with the same number of years of service receive 3 as defined by section 101 of title 10 usc the term grade refers to step or degree within military rank while rank means an order of precedence among members of the continued crs4 service the length of service component of the table ranges from under 2 to over 26 years of service and provides an incremental longevity pay raise every two years4 as result servicemembers receive their final longevity raise at 26 years of service even though their rank may provide for service to or beyond 30 years the current pay table has changed very little since it was introduced in 19585 some analysts have advocated longer military careers rather than the current emphasis on youth and vigor and have argued that the pay tables should be extended or reformed to allow for service beyond 30 years with continuing longevity increases others have described this as the 40year pay table the fy2007 national defense authorization act ndaa included several significant changes to the pay table first effective april 1 2007 the pay table has been extended from over 26 to over 40 years of service6 second and also effective april 1 2007 the ndaa provided additional longevity increases at 30 34 and 38 years of service for the most senior enlisted warrant officer and officer pay grades7 for example the final longevity raise for e8 w4 06 and 07 will occur at over 30 years at over 34 for pay grades e8 w5 and 08 and at over 38 for pay grades 09 and 010 third effective january 1 2007 the ndaa provides additional retirement credit for service beyond 30 years continuing to accrue at the rate of 25 percent per year8 as result servicemember who retires with 40 years of service will qualify for 100 percent of basic pay in their retirement the cumulative effect of these changes seems to suggest congressional support for longer military careers however the ndaa did not address other cited constraints to facilitating longer careers specifically there were changes to mandatory retirement based on years of service or age and increase in the percentage of e8 e9 and w5 who may be on active duty at given time 3 continued armed forces commissioned officers have been assigned pay grades 01 through 010 warrant officers have been assigned w1 through w5 and enlisted personnel have been designated as e1 through e9 4 some pay grades especially those of lower ranking personnel are capped at designated points generally because they should have been promoted to the next higher grade for example the last longevity increase for e5 sergeant in the army and marine corps staff sergeant in the air force and petty officer second class in the navy occurs at over 12 while the final increase of 05 lieutenant colonel in the army air force and marine corps occurs at over 22 5 military compensation background papers compensation elements and related manpower cost items their purposes and legislative backgrounds sixth edition april 2005 6 section 601 pl 109364 7 section 601 pl 109364 8 section 642 pl 109364 crs5 4 how are each years increases in military pay computed definitions the acrosstheboard increases in military pay discussed each year relate to military basic pay basic pay is the one element of military compensation that all military personnel in the same pay grade and with the same number of years of service receive basic allowance for housing or bah is received by military personnel not living in military housing either family housing or barracks basic allowance for subsistence or bas is the cost of meals all servicemembers receive bas but at different rates based on officer or enlisted status federal income tax advantage accrues because the bah and bas are not subject to federal income tax basic pay bah bas and the federal income tax advantage all comprise what is known as regular military compensation rmc rmc is that index of military pay which tends to be used most often in comparing military with civilian compensation analyzing the standards of living of military personnel and studying military compensation trends over time or by service geographical area or skill area basic pay is between 65 and 75 of rmc depending on individual circumstances rmc specifically excludes all special pays and bonuses reimbursements educational assistance deferred compensation ie an economic valuation of future retired pay or any estimate of the cash value of nonmonetary benefits such as health care or military retail stores9 annual percentage increases in military basic pay military basic pay raises linked to employment cost index eci percentage increases permanent law 37 usc 1009 provides that monthly basic pay is to be increased by the annual percentage increase in the employment cost index eci for fiscal years 2004 2005 and 2006 the military raise is to be the eci increase plus an additional one half percentage point ie if the eci annual increase were to be 30 the military raise would be 35 the eci calculated by the department of labors bureau of labor statistics measures annual percentage increases in wages salaries and employer costs for employee benefits on all private sector employees although it can be subdivided to measure increases in specific categories of such employees indexing the annual military pay raise to the annual increase in the eci was established by sec 602 of the fy2004 ndaa pl 108136 november 24 2003 117 stat 1498 amending 37 usc 1009 previously the annual military pay raise was linked to the annual percentage increases in the general schedule gs federal civil service pay scale congress usually sets the amount of the military pay raise despite the statutory formula which could operate each year without any further action congress has legislated particular percentage increase in military pay every year since 1980 with the exception of 1982 the percentage increase in military pay was usually identical to that granted gs civilians during the period 19821999 the 9 for detailed discussion of the costs and value of monetary and nonmonetary benefits see military compensation balancing cash and noncash benefits economic and budget issue brief congressional budget office january 16 2004 crs6 exceptions were in 1985 and 1994 when congress provided larger increases in military pay however beginning in 2000 congress has provided larger increases in military pay each year even when the percentage increase has been identical for both military and civilian pay in most cases congress has explicitly reiterated the increase in law rather than deferring to the permanent statutory provision therefore although congress may legislate the military pay raise percentage until recently it was pro forma matter and the operation of the permanent formula remains important in determining what the percentage will actually be annual increases in basic allowances for housing bah and subsistence bas housing 37 usc 403 and subsistence 37 usc 402 allowances are paid to all personnel not living in military housing or eating in military facilities or using field rations monthly bah varies by rank by whether the person has dependents and most importantly by location bas is paid at uniform rate to all officers and at uniform but slightly higher rate for all enlisted personnel annual increases in bah and bas are both based on surveys of local housing and national food costs respectively and thus are not affected by the annual percentage increase in the eci for many years bah and its predecessors and bas were subject to the annual percentage increase this was not changed until the late 1990s there have been occasional proposals to survey the housing costs on which bah is based more frequently than once year due to rapidly rising housing costs in many areas of the united states particular emphasis is placed by supporters of more frequent surveys on fastrising electricity costs notably for heating and cooling in addition there have been calls to merge bas with basic pay to reduce the complexity of military compensation and the need for bas computations each year 5 what have been the annual percentage increases in active duty military basic pay since 1993 fy1994 what were each years major executive and legislative branch proposals and actions on the annual percentage increase in military basic pay the following subsections itemize action on the active duty military basic pay increase going back to 1993 the fy1994 budget unless otherwise noted all increases were proposed to be effective on january 1 of the fiscal year indicated the same is true of discussions of future pay raises 2008 fy2009

would be equal to the annual percentage rise in the employment cost index see above 3 for description of the eci thus repealing previous law that had the effect of mandating pay raise equal to the eci minus 05 existing temporary law enacted in 1999 in the fy2000 ndaa which required an increase equal to the eci plus 05 during fy2001 fy2006 was not changed see below under suspension of statutory

in the pay raise debate depending on when and which agency produced the figures in general however they all proposed increases of at least 5 and more than 15 the latter applying only to very few individuals depending on pay grade and years of service the average increase for fy2002 was 69 final increase eventually the fy2002 national defense authorization act section 601 pl 107107 december 28 2001 endorsed an administration request of between 5 and 10 depending on pay grade and years of service these increases remain the largest acrosstheboard percentage raises since that of fy1982 which took effect on october 1 1981 the latter was 143 acrosstheboard raise which followed an 117 raise the 10 maze rick dod seeks targeted raises of up to 83 percent army times march 20 2005 crs8 previous

none of these proposals was adopted final increase the fy1994 national defense authorization act section 601 pl 103160 november 30 1993 107 stat 1547 at 1677 authorized 22 6 is there pay gap between military and civilian pay so that generally military pay is less than that of comparable civilians if so what is the extent of the gap the issue of militarycivilian pay gap raises several questions how can the existence of gap be determined and the gap be measured is there gap with civilians or the military being paid more if so how much of gap if there is gap does that in itself require action what are the effects of any such gaps wide range of studies over the past several decades has compared military and civilian both federal civil service and private sector compensation in general the markedly different ways in which civilian public and private sector compensation and benefit systems are structured compared to that of the armed forces make it difficult to validate any generalizations about whether there is gap between military and civilian pay some advocates for federal civil servants argue that federal civilian pay lags behind private sector pay which in turn leads some people given the past linkage between civil service and military pay percentage increases to infer that military pay lags behind private sector pay however because the current statistic used to measure private sector pay the eci measures annual percentage increases and not dollar amounts such inference is really possible as noted above the debate in recent years over pay parity between the military and federal civil service pay increases involves the percentage amount of the civilian pay raise it has not so far involved the military pay raise proposal at all the issue has been whether the civil service should get percentage raise identical to that of the military or whether the military should get higher raise because of 1 the much greater degree of danger and hardship military service entails compared to most civilian employment especially in time of war and 2 the need to cope with actual or forestall potential military recruiting and retention problems measuring and confirming gap it is extremely difficult to find common index or indicator to compare the dollar values of military and civilian compensation first military compensation includes numerous separate components whose receiving population and taxability vary widely which of these if any should be included in militarycivilian pay comparison furthermore total military compensation includes wide range of nonmonetary benefits retirement annuity after vesting at 20 years of service health care retail stores and recreational facilities few civilians work in organizations where analogous benefits are provided attempts to facilitate comparison by assigning cash value to noncash crs10 benefits almost always founder on the large number of debatable assumptions that must be made to generate such an estimate second it is also extremely difficult to establish comparison between military ranks and pay grades on the one hand and civilian jobs on the other the range of knowledge supervision and professional judgment required of military personnel and civilians performing similar duties in standard peacetime industrial or office milieu may well be similar when the same military members likely job in the field possibly in combat is concerned comparisons become difficult third generally speaking with some exceptions the conditions of military service are frequently much more arduous than those of civilian employment even in peacetime for families as well as military personnel themselves this aspect of military service is sometimes cited as rationale for military compensation being at higher level than it otherwise might be on the other hand the military services all mention travel and adventure in exotic places as positive reason for enlistment andor military career so it may be misleading to automatically assume this is always liability fourth comparisons between different sets of compensation statistics and the use of these comparisons to determine what military pay should be can yield very different results comparing dollar amounts may lead to different conclusions than comparing the annual increases in pay for each position the percentage increase in pay over different time periods is more often than not very different different indexes with different components can be used to determine compensation changes finally the level of specificity used in pay comparison can lead to sharply differing results especially when the comparison is between private sector and federal pay as whole both civil service and military for instance all army colonels may according to some indexes be paid roughly as much as federal civil service gs15s or as much as private sector managers with certain responsibilities thus those occupational specialties that are highly paid in the private sector health care information technology some other scientific and engineering skills are examples are frequently paid considerably less in the military or in the civil service other common subcategories for comparison in addition to occupational skill include age gender years in the labor force and educational levels estimates of militarycivilian pay gap numerous comparisons of military and civilian compensation in recent years have been cited either to illustrate gap that favors civilian pay levels or to refute the existence of such gap many of these reports lack precision in identifying what aspects of military pay were compared with civilian pay what indexes were used to make the comparison or the length of time covered by the comparison although it is difficult to generalize it would appear that most of those estimates which assert that there is pay gap in favor of higher civilian pay find percentage difference of between 3 and 13 in recent years with the fy2009 pay raise the pay gap is estimated at 3 estimates have been made that question the existence of gap favoring civilians these tend to compare specific populations of military personnel with equally specific subcategories of civilians analyses of this nature appear to be less crs11 common than the acrosstheboard comparisons almost certainly because they are much more difficult to do11 in 2002 general accounting office gao analysts itemized the components of the military benefit package such as military retirement health care servicemembers group life insurance base recreational facilities and the like and compared them with the private sector it found that the range of benefits available to military personnel was generally comparable to and in some cases superior to benefits available in the private sector the gao study did not appear to have made dollarfigure comparisons or compared in military noncash benefits such as health care commissaries or exchanges or annual leave with benefits in the private sector either by figuring out their dollar worth or by itemizing their exact provisions in great detail12 this gao report was followed in 2008 by the 10th quadrennial review of military compensation qrmc13 which also addressed the pay gap issue and recommended that new comparative model could be better suited to measuring the difference between military pay and comparable civilian occupations the commission recommended replacing regular military compensation rmc with new measure called military annual compensation mac while rmc includes base pay bah bas and the federal tax advantage from the two allowances mac would also factor in the health care benefit the value of the military retirement annuity and state and social security tax advantages based on the qrmc analysis and using mac as the comparative tool enlisted and officer personnel fare better than their civilian counterparts in cash compensation according to the economic modeling done by the qrmc this represents the first time that qrmc has recommended inclusion of benefits when comparing military and civilian compensation levels while estimating the pay gap continues to be challenge it appears that the substantial increases in military pay and benefits since the late 1990s whatever the existing relative relationship of military to civilian compensation as of that time have probably had the effect of favoring the military 11 see for example office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness report of the ninth quadrennial review of military compensation vol i washington march 2002 passim but especially 2974 13782 18889 and asch beth j and james r hosek military compensation trends and policy options documented briefing santa monica ca rand corporation 1999 12 us general accounting office now government accountability office military personnel active duty benefits reflect changing demographics but opportunities exist to improve gao02935 september 18 2002 13 the quadrennial review of military compensation or qrmc is required every four years by 37 usc 1008b the 10th qrmc was convened in august 2005 and submitted the final portion of its report in july 2008 volume 1 which included the recommendations concerning the pay gap can be viewed at httpwwwdefenselinkmilprhomedocs tenth_qrmc_feb2008_vol20ipdf crs12 if there is pay gap does it necessarily matter some have suggested that the emphasis on pay gap whether real or not or if real how much is unwarranted and not good guide to arriving at sound policy they argue that the key issue is or should be not comparability of military and civilian compensation but the competitiveness of the former absent draft the armed forces must compete in the labor market for new enlisted and officer personnel the career force by definition has always been volunteer force and thus has always had to compete with civilian opportunities real or perceived given these facts some ask what difference it makes whether military pay is much lower the same or higher than that of civilians if the services are having recruiting difficulties then pay increases might be appropriate even if the existing gap favors the military conversely if military compensation is lower than equivalent civilian pay and if the services are doing well in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel then there might be reason to raise military pay however some believe that explicitly basing military compensation on purely economic competitiveness with civilian pay could have undesirable consequences for instance in time of economic difficulty the military might be receiving lower pay than most civilians but still recruiting satisfactorily due to high unemployment for further discussion of the pay gap issue see congressional budget office what does the military pay gap mean june 1999 and association of the us army nonprofit group that works to advance the interests of military members closing the pay gap arlington va october 2000 7 what benefits are specifically available for military personnel participating in operation iraqi freedom oif and operation enduring

for this pay in given month servicemember must have served some time in one of the designated zones even if only day or less the authorizing statute for hfidp sets the rate at 150 per month however the fy2004 national defense authorization act ndaa pl 108136 section 619 temporarily increased this rate to 225 through december 31 2004 the fy2005 ndaa made this increase permanent for some detailed background on hfidp see crs report rs21632 14 much of this material is taken from crs report rl31334 operations noble eagle enduring freedom and iraqi freedom questions and answers about us military personnel compensation and force structure by lawrence kapp and charles henning crs13 military pay controversy over hostile fireimminent danger pay and family separation allowance rates by lawrence kapp hardship duty pay military personnel serving in iraq afghanistan parts of the persian gulf region and certain nearby areas are also eligible for hardship duty pay hdp authorized by 37 usc 305 it

partially reimburse on average members of the uniformed services involuntarily separated from their dependents for the reasonable amount of extra expenses that result from such separation to be eligible for this allowance us military personnel must be separated from their dependents for 30 continuous days or more but once the 30day threshold has been reached the allowance is applied retroactively to the first day of separation the authorizing statute for fsa sets the rate at 250 per month per diem military personnel serving in oifoef are also entitled to per diem payments of 105 per month the rate is the same for all personnel savings deposit program another benefit available to those deployed to afghanistan iraq and other designated areas nearby is eligibility for the

normally returned to the servicemember with interest within 90 days after he or she leaves the eligible region although earlier withdrawals can sometimes be made for emergency reasons combat zone tax exclusion one of the more generous benefits for many of those serving overseas in oef or oif is the combat zone tax exclusion afghanistan and the airspace above it have been designated combat zone since september 19 2001 military personnel serving in direct support of the operations in this combat zone are also eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion additionally certain areas in the persian gulf region including iraq have been designated combat zones since the 19901991 persian gulf war military personnel serving in direct support of operations in this combat zone are also eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion for enlisted personnel and warrant officers this means that all compensation for active military service in combat zone is free of federal income tax for commissioned officers their compensation is free of federal income tax up to the maximum amount of enlisted basic pay plus any imminent danger pay received while this benefit applies only to federal income tax almost all states have provisions extending the benefit to their state income tax as well crs14 in addition military personnel who receive reenlistment bonus while stationed in combat zone do not have to pay federal income tax on any of the bonus the amounts involved can be substantial for example the army recently increased reenlistment bonuses for special forces ncos to lump sum of 150000 for six year reenlistment 75000 for five years 50000 for four years and 30000 18000 and 8000 for three two and one year respectively other reenlistment bonuses for wider range of military occupational specialties have been increased to up to 50000 for fiveyear commitment15 the 2006 ndaa boosted the maximum reenlistment bonus to 90000 rest and recreation rr for personnel in oifoef as has been widely reported military personnel serving 12month tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan are entitled to one 15day period of rr or home leave in the united states during their tour initially the program was designed to fund the travel of personnel from either theater of operations to whichever airport in the united states they landed in and any further travel within the united states had to be funded by the individual however congress has since authorized funding of internal travel within the united states reimbursement will be for the military members travel there is funding for dependent travel to meet military personnel on rr there has been some funding of such dependent travel by private charitable organizations 8 what cash lumpsum death benefits are available to the survivors of military

gratuity to all activeduty deaths not just those that were combatrelated and made the payments retroactive to october 7 2001 in addition survivors of service members who died of noncombat causes on active duty between october 7 2001 and the date of enactment of the 2006 ndaa will receive retroactive payments of 150000 this latter payment closed an sgli loophole the fy2007 john warner national
