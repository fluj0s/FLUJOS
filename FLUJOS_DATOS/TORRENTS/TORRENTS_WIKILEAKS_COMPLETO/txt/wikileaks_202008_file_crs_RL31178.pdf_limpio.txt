disposal to ensure th at taa and fast track are joined3 this report will be update d as events warrant key questions for congress within the labortpa issue in fastt rack reauthorization two key questions seem to be getting the most attention as congress focuses in on the reported hr 3005 and compares its provisions w ith those of the expired tpa 1 what should be the goal of trade ag reements in promoting labor provisions worker rights provisions defined in table 1 should they be subject to the same enforcement procedures as other provisions if the answer is yes th ey would typically be included in the body of the agreement rather than in side agreement b how with what provisions should laborworker rights be promoted 2 should the tpa authority promote working party in the wto to discuss the link between worker rights and trade comparison of how the expired tpa authority and hr 3005 address these questions follows together with some re sponses to these differences lengthy discussion of provisions in hr 3005 and table comparing the provisions of hr 3005 and hr 3019 are included towa rd the back of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs3 table 1 worker rights defined while there is single official list of worker rights agreed upon by interested parties all over the world there are two similar lists that are most commonly used one is internationally recognized worker rights which is defined in us trade law the other is core labor standards which is slightly different list identified by the international labor organization ilo united nations organization founded more than 80 years ago to promote and protect the rights of workers around the world key elements of both worker rights lis ts are the right of association b the right to organize into unions and bargain collectively c prohibition of forced labor and d minimum age fo r the employment of children ie prohibition of child labor the two lists differ in their 5th item the us list includes as acceptable working conditions regarding minimum wages maximum hours and occupati onal safety and health protection the ilo list includes as freedom from all types of employment discrimination ie on the basis of sex race age religious preference etc the worker rights goal of trade agr eements under the old tpa was to promote respect for worker rights without sp ecifying details about how through what provisions worker rights should be promot ed or whether worker rights provisions should be subject to the same enforcemen t dispute resolution procedures as other provisions hr 3005 includes specifics in each of these areas under hr 3005 one principal negotiating objective is promo tion of worker rights through self enforcement to ensure that parties do not fail to enforce their own labor laws however hr 3005 also includes caveats to this requirement which would also be objectives for inclusion in trade agreement the caveats would be for parties to retain discretion in the reallocation of re sources in enforcement and for protection of us exports from labor policies that discriminate against them under hr 3005 one principa l negotiating objective for enforcement is to seek provisions that treat us primary ne gotiating objectives equally with other negotiating objectives the seeking of working party on the re lationship between worker rights and trade within the world trade organization wto was listed as principalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs4 4 technically the principal negotiating objective in pl 100418 sec 1101 was to secure review of the relationship of worker rights to gatt articles objectives and related instruments with s view to ensuring that the benefits of the trading system are available to all workers the gatt was superseded by the world trade organization wto through the uruguay round of agreements in 1994 th act that implemented the uruguay round of agreements pl 103465 sec 131 requires th president to

questions between the time that the old fasttr ack authority expired in 1994 and the time hr 3005 was reported congress voted to implement three trade agreements the north american free trade agreement nafta implemented in 1994 by pl 10382 the uruguay round of ageem ents and the usjordan free trade agreement pl 10743 on september 28 2001 relating to th key congressional questions identified above th provisions included in th agreements are viewed as precedents by some in congress and as unique occurrences by others nafta promotes worker rights by providi ng that each country abide by its own labor laws and that each country strive to ward 12 labor standards the usjordan free trade agreement provides that each count ry enforce its own laws and strive to ensure that ilo labor principles and internationally recognized worker rights see table 1 above for definition are recogn ized and protected by domestic law some democrats in congress particularly representatives charles b rangel ranking democrat on the house ways and means committee representative sander m levin and representative robert t matsui members of the committee and all cosponsors of hr 3019 have argued that the provisions in the usjordan fta should be floor or lower limit for th kind of labor provisions that should be included in new trade agreements they also argue that this floor is not being honored by hr 3005 which specifies as goal that parties to trade agreement should not fail to enforce their own labor ws rather than requiring parties to trade agreement slated for fasttrack consideration by congress to strive toward adopting either ilo core labor standards or internationally recognized worker rights these democrats argue hr 3005 merely includes the more vague goal to strengthen the capacity of us trading partners to promote respect for core labor standards5 the democrats have also expressed c oncern that hr 3005 unlike the expired tpa does not include the goal of

list of provisions of most of these laws see worker rights provisions and trade policy should they be linked by mary jane bolle continuedtrade in the wto6 this is goal that has so far been difficult to achieve because developing countries are typically strongly opposed to the idea lest discussion of the relationship between worker rights and trade ultimately lead to the imposition of labor requirements on these countries some republicans on the other hand s enators phil gramm jon kyl and mitch mcconnell have ex pressed concern with hr 3005 for not including protections on the sovereignty of us ws they argue that if worker rights provisions in trade agreement are subject to the same dispute resolution procedures as other provisions in the agreement the united states could be in position to be judged on whether it does or does not fail to enforce its own labor standards if the us is found to fail to enforce its own labor standards us goods and services could be subject to sanctions they recommend two amendments to remedy the potential situation7 organizations that have come out ag ainst tpa legislation especially hr 3005 include the aflcio public citizen the united

shifts in congressional attitude toward including worker rights provisions in trade agreements shifts affected in part by experience under nafta and the wto north american fr ee trade agreement the north american free trade agreement nafta which went into effect january 1 1994 ushered in new level of controversy over pres idential authority to include worker rights provi sions in trade

benefits to th amount of the monetary penalty which may be greater than benefits from tariff reductions for one year in reacting to nafta many us multinational corporations were concerned that naftas labor side agreement coul d usher in new era of attaching more stringent worker rights provisions to trade agreements their concern was that this could lead to increased labor costs par ticularly in developing countries where multinational corporations had begun to greatly expa nd production operations and possibly to restrictions on trade if the provisions were not enforced organized workers on the other hand especially in laborintensive industries feared that nafta with its strong inve stment provisions could lead to major increases in us foreign direct investment to mexico with potentially adverse effects on us jobs and wages12 organized workers were also disappoint ed in naftas labor side agreement because it did not authorize fines and sancti ons for failure to enforce several other major protections including d the right to organize and bargain collectively the right to strike and f prohibition of fo rced labor over time most of the cases arising under naalc have b een about mexicos failure to enforce its laws permitting workers to organize and bargain collectively violations not enforceable by fines or sanctions under naftas labor side agreement as result of its concerns and disappointments since nafta we nt into effect the aflcio has taken the position that new trade promotion authority must require enforceable worker rights in the core of all new trade agreem ents and that moneta ry fines based on the nafta labor side agreement model are inad equate and have pr oven an ineffective means of enforcement13 worker rights and the wto us efforts to promote worker

fact his efforts and those of other devel oped countries met with great resistance by developing countries developing countries which make up ma jority in the wto have expressed fear that even wto study group on the relationship between worker rights and trade can lead to the imposition on developing countries of labor standards these are standards which could raise wage cost s and thereby threaten the economic growth of developing countries wh ich depend heavily on their bundance of lowcost labor as result of this concern the 1996 wto conference of trade ministers in singapore voted to shift the focus of worker rights promotion from the wto to the international labor organization ilo it did this by designating the ilo as the competent body to set and deal w ith international labor standards14 the issue of worker rights has not been addressed in wto ministerial conference since 1996 19971998 house and senaterepor ted legislati on to renew trade promotion authority the wto experience may not have directly affected an attitude in congress toward renewal of trade prom otion authority however the fact that us businesses have increasingly establishe d business operations in deve loping countries especially during the 1990smay have had an impact as has experience under nafta nevertheless so great was the controve rsy over the linkage of worker rights provisions as well as environm ental provisions to trade agreements in the aftermath of nafta that by 1997 legislation to reauthorize tpa had been reported out of committee in either house of congress in 1997 seeming consensus was reached when the house ways and means and senate finance committees reported out bills to reauthorize trade promotion authority in s 1269 srept 105 102 and hr 2621 hrept 105341 both house and senate bills aimed to limit presidential fasttrack authority to include worker rights provisions in trade agreements slated for fasttrack consideration specifically both house and senate tpa bills would have allowed the inclusion of labor provisions in trade agreements negotiated under new fasttrack procedures only to prevent foreign governments from derogating from lowering existing labor standards in order to attract investment or gain competitive trade advantage the house bill would also have 1 permitted labor provisions to ensure that foreign labor practices do not arbitrarily

usjordan free trade agreement without fasttrack authority the clin ton administration in an effort to strengthen economic ties with jordan negotiated the usjordan free trade agreement fta the fta was adopted into law on september 28 2001 pl 10743 this was the first us trade ag reement ever to include set of labor provisions directly in the body of the ag reement where all provisions would be subject to dispute resolution procedures like the nafta labor side agreement the usjordan fta required each country to enforce its own labor standards and authorized sanctions for patterns of non enforcement however unlike the nafta side agreement the usjordan fta did not identify any standards as unenforceable by sanctions in congress the usjordan agreement was controversial because of its labor provisions the possibility of using sanctions to require country to enforce its own labor standards was major issue po ssible action by congress to reject the agreement or change the language in the implementing legislation was diverted at the last minute by an exchange of letters between the united states and jordan agreeing to make every effort to reso lve the disputes without rec ourse to the formal dispute resolution procedures16 key tpa legislation in 2001 consideration of the usjordan fta occurred on track parallel to the continuing debate over pres idential trade promotion authority the push to resolve the tpa stalemate was given an extr boost early in 2001 when the business roundtable brt made up of chief executive officers from roughly 200 major companies released report calling anew for fasttrack reauthorization and suggesting compromise solution the br t argued that the united states was falling behind other countries in trade lead ership because the united states did not have fasttrack authority17 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs10 17 continued falling behind february 9 2001specifically in contrast to the traditional attitude of the business community against the inclusion of worker rights provisions in trade agreements the brt in its report took stand that in pursuing bor and environmental objectives in trade and investment negotiations the unite d states should adopt one size does not fit all approach rather we must grant our trade negotiators the flexibility to negotiate instead of placing limitations on the president to include worker rights provisions in trade agreements economic arguments concerning new tpa the brt argued that new trade promotion authority resulting new trade agreements and the trade expansion that could ensue would be good for the united states traditional economic argument s primarily support the brt position and point out how further reduction in inte rnational trade barriers could benefit businesses workers consum ers and investors alike for some businesses an increase in tr ade from new agreements could help 1 expand us exports to new foreign markets and 2 expand investment abroad other businesses that compete domestically with imports could suffer difficult adjustments or go out of business for workers new trade authority could lead to longterm gains if they can shift to higher paying higher productivity industries from those being phased out by increased imports andor us plant reloca tions abroad particul arly to developing countries however what is unclear is the longterm wage impact of increased international trade partic ularly on lowerskilled us workers who with the exodus of much low and midlevel manufacturing from the united states and increased automation of many remaining jobs must essentially move up to higher skill level jobs or down to lowerskill service jobs for consumers new trade agreements c ould further lower prices on imported goods and help raise overa ll us productivity levels which can lead to increases in the standard of living for investors new trade agreements c ould give boost to stocks benefitting from greater profitability of us businesses other arguments in favor of including worker rights provisions in trade agreements are that 1 worker rights provisions can discourage multinational corporations from engaging in exploitative labor practices in veloping countries 2 worker rights protections can lessen bor cost differences between countries and thereby make plant relocation runaway plants to developing countries less attractive and 3 worker rights protec tions can help discourage downward pressure on us wages from cheaper importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs11 18 sources bush labor and

arguments against including worker rights provisions in trade agreements are that 1 labor provisions addressing social i ssues do not belong in an economic vehicle designed to promote trad 2 labor provisions are protectionist in that to the extent that they impose labor requirements they may raise the production costs of the trading partners and thereby amount to substituting nontariff barriers

house and senate versions relates to reports on labor conditions both the house and senate versions of hr 3005 require the president to submit reports to congress cerning labor laws of c ountry seeking an agreement with the united states the house bill requires that the president submit to congress in general for any trade agreement report showing the extent to which countries which are party to the agreement have in effect laws governing exploitative child labor the senate bill requires that the president submit to the house ways and means and senate finance committee for any trade negotiati ons entered into under this act meaningful labor rights report on the country with which the president is negotiating on time frame determined by the us trade representative in consultation with the chairmen and ranking minority members of both committees hr 3019 was offered as democra ticsponsored bill and includes two different approaches contained in two different sets of principal

negotiating objectives summarizing the conceptual approach of the bills to promote worker rights however hr 3005 aims to promote respect for worker rights and hr 3019 aims to promote enforcement of worker rights see discussi on on the definition of worker rights below the overall negotiating objectives of both bills are detailed below table 2 hr 3005 and hr 3019 overall negotiating objectives hr

h r 3005 and hr 3019 the definitions of worker rights used by each bill cannot be determined by comparing the terms used in the overall negotiating objectives in italics with the terms and definitions mentioned earlier in this report and repeated below as items listed under internationally recognized worker rights and core labor standards thus one must look elsewhere in each bill to determine which definition of worker rights each bill uses it should be reemphasized that there is official definition of worker rights in international parlance hr 3005 in principal negotiating objectives uses the term core labor standards in sec 2b11c and in sec11 2 defines it by listing the items which are identified below as internationally recognized worker rights hr 3019 includes two sets of principa l negotiating objectives each of which contains different defin ition of worker rights for principal negotiating objectives for trade agreements in the wto hr 3019 uses several terms core internationally recognized labor standards core labor standards and internationally recognized worker rights which it defines as indicated below for principal negotiating objectives for bilateral trade agreements and trade agreements in the free trade area of the americas ftaa hr 3019 refers to core labor standards and defines them as indicated belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs14 table 3 worker rights defined in terms of hr 3005 and hr 3019 worker rights are typically defined in one of two ways internationally recognized worker rights or core labor standards internationally recognized worker rights typically referenced in us trade laws and trade agreements are defined in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 as 1 the right of association 2 the right to organize and bargain collectively 3 prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor 4 minimum age for the employment of children and 5 acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages hours of work and occupational safety and health core labor standards are defined slightly differently by the international labor organization ilo they substitute for 5 above freedom from employment discrimination confusing terms for worker rights in hr 3005 and hr 3019 hr 3005 and hr 3019 do not adhere strictly to the above definitions of worker rights which leads to some confusion hr 3005 refers to its standards as core labor standards but defines them with the list of internationally recognized worker rights above hr 3019 on the other hand calls wo rker rights by four different names for multilateral trade agreements negotiated within the world trade organization wto uses three terms to describe worker rights core internationally recognized labor standa rds internationally recognized worker rights and internationally recognized core labor standards and defines only internationally recognized worker rights w ith correct reference to the trade act of 1974 for bilateral agreements and free trade area of the americas agreement it uses the term core labor standards and the definition listed above principal negotiating objectives as mentioned hr 3005 includes one set of principal negotiating objectives items targeted for inclusion in trade agr eements applicable to all trade agreements and hr 3019 includes two distinct sets of principal negotiatin g objectives one set for multilateral trade agreements under the wto and the other set for bilateral agreements and an agreement establishing free trade area of the americas ftaa hr 3005 for all trade

principal negotiating objectives relating to labor are listed in table 4 the key principal negotiating objectives in hr 3005 relating to labor see below are similar to provisions that have already

standardsand hr 2621 c rane defeated by the house in the 105th congress which includes prot ections for businesses the principal negotiating objectives relating to dispute settlement procedures in h r 3005 reflect the flexibility advocated by the brt see under the dispute settlement procedure scription above which calls fo r penalties appropr iate to the parties nature subject matte r and scope of the violation the principal negotiating objectives also reflect calls by organized labor to have labor provisions in trade agreements treated as equal in importance to traditional subjects covered in

ilo assembly tightens pressure on myanmar ilo news august 8 2000 httpusiloorgnews focus0008focus1htmlpermit great negotiating flexibility the reason for the strength of hr 3019 provisions proponents of this position argue is that the wto has in place specific dispute settlement procedures proponents of this idea also argue that the ilo is already set to be partner with the wto in promoting and enforcing worker rights because the ilo is the international orga nization with the major responsibility for promoting and enforcing worker rights around the world the other interpretation suggests that th framework described on page 13 for the adoption and enforcement of core labor standards in the wto and the ilo could represent longterm approach propone nts argue this position based on efforts stemming from the uruguay round agreemen ts implementing act sec 131 of pl 103465 which required that the president seek working party in the wto to examine the relationship between internationally recognized worker rights and trade as mentioned earlier in this report president clinton did seek such working party in the wto but he was unsuccessful because his efforts met with great resistance by developing countries which ma ke up majority in the wto proponents of the idea that promotion and enforcement of worker rights through the wto and the ilo could be longterm approach also argue that the ilo an organization with roughly 175 members has limited range of enforcement tools19 the ilos primary tools for promoting nd enforcing worker rights throughout the world are technical ssistance consultation recordk eeping ie maintaining lists showing which countries have formally adopted which labor standards and persuasion the ilo is dependent on sel fenforcement by member countries with little chance of penalty for noncompliance the ilos strongest enforcement tool article 33 of the ilo cons titution relies on voluntary trad discrimination against countries that do not meet ilo guidelines article 33 has been used only once on myanmar in 2000 in an effort to try to put group pressure on that country to end its widespread use of forced labor20 hr 3019 for freetrade area of the americas ftaa and bilateral agreements hr 3019s principal negotiating objectives for an ftaa agreement differ considerably from its objec tives for wto trade agreements instead

whether or not to include provisions of s 1209 in hr 3009 in the senate many senate democrats argued that tp would not get to the floor without an expansion of the taa program this program provides fina ncial and technical assistance to workers and firms to help them adjust to import competition the white house proposal offered to the senate finance committee on march 19 2002 differed on two key issues from s 1209 whos provisions are detailed below first it excluded taa benefits for secondary workers and farmers although the administration more recently has indicated it will support this proposal second disagreement remained over the democrats proposal to provide health insurance benefits to taa beneficiar ies republican opponents argued that this would amount to creating massive new federal titlement program according to the washington trade daily april 10 2002 s 1209 was reported by the senate finance committee on february 4 2002 s report 107134 on march 19 2002 the admin istration delivered its proposal in bill form the trade adjustment assistance taa reform act of 2002 to the senate finance committee one of two elements of s 1209 attracting the most discussion was that s 1209 would have combined the old taa and naftataa programs and expand both to reach three new groups these groups are all workers who lose their jobs because thei r plants relocate to foreign countries both the taa and naftataa programs have traditionally covered workers who lose their jobs because of increased imports but only the naftataa program has also covered workers who lose their jobs because of shift in production abroad b secondary workers whose job loss is dependent on the job loss of workers directly affected by trade and c several groups of workers not previously covered by taa legislation this third group includes farmers fisherme n taconite workers and those engaged in exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas the congressional budget office cbo estimates that these changes woul d nearly double the taa caseload the provision covering secondary workers woul d make up about thr eefourths of the increase in caseload covering shifts in production would ma ke up about onefifth of the increase8 the second controversial element of s 1209 was the inclusion of premium assistance for health care coverage for t aa recipients the proposed subsidy would have paid 70 of health insurance premiums for eligible workers and temporary medicaid insurance for certain uninsured individuals adjusting downward from cbos earlier estimates for high er coverage this could result in an estimated budget outlay in 2003 of 244 million the adminis trations proposal would not have include health insurance benefits9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31178crs33 10 baucus stresses taas

senate majo rity leader supporting the retention in tpa legislation of health care provisions incl uded in s 1209 as reported11 the expansion of the taa program has b een long called for by labor proponents who have argued that all workers who their jobs for traderelated reasons whether from increased imports or from plan t relocations should be eligible for the same benefits bene fits that will offer financial s upport retraining and relocation benefits as they work to upgrade their skills and transition into more complex jobs that offer them the best opportunity of reclaiming old

996 million taa health care and other compromises compromises within the senate on number of issues including the taa health care issue allowed fast tracktpa to move forward the compromise translates into an estimated threefold increase in the cost of the taa program to total an estimated 12 billion over 10 years some details of the final agreement include the following12 70 tax credit for health
