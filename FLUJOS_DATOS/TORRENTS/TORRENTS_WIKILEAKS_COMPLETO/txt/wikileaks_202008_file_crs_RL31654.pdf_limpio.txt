attention the associated power and reach of its comprehensive protection for species identified as endangered or threatened with extinction has ignited concern that there be greater bounds on this power and fanned the flames over assertions of lax implementation of its power the following discussion provides an overview nd background on the various features of the that contribute to its stature and yet spark an ongoing debate over its implementation g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g157g145g142g561g7g21g3g501g561 the is comprehensive attempt to provide legal protection to identified species and to consider habitat protection as an integral part of that effort it is administered primarily by the fish and wildlife service fws2 but also by the national marine fisheries service nmfs3 for certain marine species under the species of plants and animals both vertebrate and invertebrate are listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction once species is listed powerful legal tools are available to aid the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat as of april 16 2008 total of 1925 species of animals and plants had been listed as either endangered or threatened 1351 of these occur in the united states and its territories and the remainder only in other countries 4 of the us species 1156 are covered by recovery plans5 the authorization for funding under expired on october 1 1992 although congress has appropriated funds in each succeeding fiscal year

battleground in quarrels whose primary focus is the allocation of scarce or diminishing lands or resources indeed stated purpose of the is to provide means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved 6 the surrogate role is especially likely because other laws often lack the strict substantive provisions that congress included in the see major provisions sections below there can be economic interests on all sides of some vanishing species issues like the miners canaries signaling scarce resource safe air supply declining species are often symptoms of resource scarcities and altered ecosystems examples of such resource controversies include the tellico dam hydropower development and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves as well as the endangered snail darter northwest timber harvest protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing recreation and ecosystem protection 1 act

energyrich plain around the northern mountain states coal bed methane deve lopment grazing rights ground water protection traditional ranching and proposal for sage grouse listing in complex and varying stew of interests7 and the worldwide debate over global warming has found its avatar in the polar bear in recent years tensions over the have increased as species have been added to the protected list and as the greater demands of growing economy and human population have affected species habitats both congress and the executive branch have sought to lessen these tensions by among other things tailoring application of the for particular circumstances the s critics contend that neither the nor administrative efforts go far enough in accommodating needs other than species conservation while the defenders counter that it merely balances an inherent bias toward development in other governmental laws and policies debate pro and on the splits largely along demographic lines while most demographic groups support species conservation to some degr ee that support is stronger among urban and suburban populations and less so in rural areas and is stronger among those in the east and along the coasts and less so in central and mountain st ates sport hunters and anglers seem divided on the issue native americans as group often dependent on natural resources eg fish are frequently involved in issues most commonly siding with survival of listed species groups opposing strong protections for listed species usua lly make claims that jobs will be lost if conservation measures are stringent but those eking strong protections often claim that jobs will be lost if they are not it is also noteworthy that while the debate often centers on jobs and biology people on both sides claim ethical support for their positions and many religious groups now participate in the debate in addition some industries eg logging and land development generally see the as serious problem while others eg some commercial fishing and many recreation interests see it as generally supporting their interests

species to the point at which the protection of the is longer necessary if this is the standard the might be considered failure since only 22 species have been delisted due to recovery as of april 16 2008 8 nine species have become extinct since their listing and 17 have been delisted due to improved data or scientific understanding9 in the former case some of the nine species now believed extinct were originally listed to protect any last remaining few that might have been alive at the time of listing it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or in fact are already extinct for example rare shorebird thought by many to be extinct was rediscovered in remote area of canada few years ago it might just as easily have quietly gone extinct without being rediscovered rare species are by definition hard to find 7 ultimately petition to list this species was judged not to be warranted the interests mentioned here and many others had variety of goals in supp orting or opposing the lis ting proposal for details see httpwwwr6fwsgov speciesbirdssagegrouse 8 see httpecosfwsgovtess_publicdelistingreportdo to obtain updated information the recovered species include the bald eagle in the lower 48 states and the yellowstone area population of grizzly bears 9 ibid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31654g22g145g142g561g7g151g141g138

are listed only once they are very depleted eg median population of 407 animals for endangered vertebrates according to one study another measure of effectiveness might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations even if the species is not actually delisted if this is the standard the could be considered success since large number 41 of listed species according to one study have improved or stabilized their population levels10 other species eg red wolves and california condors might not exist at all without protection and this too might be considered measure of success even though the species are still rare one could also ask what species might have become extinct if there were the authors are unaware of comprehensive studies regarding the likely status of rare species were there but for species such as spotted owls salmon florida panthers and plants of very narrow ranges it seems likely that their numbers would be at best far fewer if did not exist

overexploitation generally through hunting trapping or fishing the poster species of the debate were passenger pigeons tigers wolves and other wellknown animals but during the 20th century shift of focus and probably of fact occurred the vast majority of species including those for which direct taking was probably an early factor in their decline are generally also at risk due to habitat loss habitats reduced now to small fraction of their former extent include tallgrass prairie fresh and salt water wetlands old growth forests of most types freeflowing rivers coral reefs undisturbed sandy beaches and others another highranking factor in the demise of many species is the introduction of nonnative species the nonnative invasive species can be disease vectors or parasites eg avian malaria in hawaii or asian longhorned beetles in north america predators brown tree snakes in guam and hawaii or competitors eg barred owls in the pacific northwest the gradual homogenization of the worlds flora and fauna has led to demise of many species 11 g11g156g561g7g161g157g146g151g140g157g146g152g151g561g16g152g155g150g138g149g501g561 if extinction is normal some argue that there is need for the government to intervene to halt this natural process but is it normal geological evidence shows that the vast majority of species that have ever lived on earth are now extinctan observation uncontested by paleontologists however many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time12 but calculating current rates of extinction much less making comparisons with the geologic past is extremely difficult current estimates of total species range from 35 million to 100 million with 1030 million being commonly accepted numbers if

congress by m lynne corn et 12 over the billions of years of life on earth extinction rates have varied with five periods of exceptionally high rates the most famous periods are the mass extinctions at the end of the age of dinosaurs cretaceous period about 65 million years ago and the even more massive dieoffs at the end of the permian period about 250 million years ago when about 52 of the groups of marine species became extinct between each of these five events extinctions continued at more moderate background levels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31654g22g145g142g561g7g151g141g138

difficult to estimate how fast they are going extinct and whether current extinction rates exceed background extinction rates consequently scientists use very conservative assumptions to make these estimates the resulting extinction rates 17000 species per year being typical estimate still seem astonishingly large in part because the public is generally unaware of the huge number of species in groups to which many people pay little or attention eg beetles marine invertebrates fish and the large number of species estimated on earth how do these compare to background rates widely diverse methods all suggest that current rates of extinction exceed background rates normal rates are thought to be from 1 to 10 species per every 10 million species per year that is if there are 20 million species now background levels would be about 2 to 20 species extinctions per year common estimates of current extinction rates range from 100 to 10000 times such background ratesroughly comparable to the five great episodes of extinction in the geologic past critics most frequently question these calculations by stressing uncertainties rather than citing specific factual errors this criticism is not surprising since each step in these calculations contains uncertainties eg estimating the number of existing species most biologists counter by noting that similar numbers are generated in studies of widely different groups by variety of scientists using different methods robust results ie similar results from the testing of hypothesis in variety of ways are usually considered scientifically sound once extinct species can never be revived but faced with high rates of extinction some might take comfort in return to an equal number of species even if those species are different evolution continues even in the face of high extinction rates so perhaps new species will evolve that are better adapted to new conditions if so how long would such recovery take examining the geologic record after major extinction episodes some scientists estimate that recovery to approximately equal numbers of different species took up to 25 million years for the most severe extinction events thus if the current extinction rate and recovery rate are comparable to past rates the return to species numbers of the prehistoric era would take several million years

fundamentally scientific question is the continued existence of the species threatened or endangered through the 1982 amendments particularly congress clearly intended to separate this scientific

in the interval between proposal and listing decision the secretary must monitor the status of these candidate species and if any emergency poses significant risk to the wellbeing of the species promptly list them18 some steps in the normal listing process may be skipped for emergency listings federal agencies must confer with the appropriate secretary on actions likely to jeopardize the continued existence of candidate species but agencies need not limit commitments of resources 19 as of april 16 2008 there were 282 candidate species20

wildlife and plants are the same as the processes for listing21 delisting is removing species from the lists downlisting is reclassifying spec ies from endangered to threatened and uplisting is the reverse the secretary of the interior may in itiate change in the status of listed species alternatively after receiving substantive petiti on for any change in listing status the secretary is to review the species status the determinati on to delist downlist or uplist species must be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available22 and without reference to possible economic or other impacts23 the statute and regulations also mandate that at least once every five years there be review of each listed species to determine whether it should be removed from the list changed from endangered to threatened or changed from threatened to endangered 24 g5g155g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g10g138g139g146g157g138g157g561 when species is listed the secretary must also designate critical habitat either where the species is found or if it is not found there where there are features essential to its conservation25 if the publication of this information is not prudent because it would harm the species eg by encouraging vandals or collectors the secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat the secretary may also postpone designation for as long as one year if the information is not determinable as of april 16 2008 critical habitat had been designated for 509 listed species 26 any area whether or not federally owned may be designated as critical

of endangered or threatened status was intended to be made without reference to its potential economic impacts observers have compared the decision of whether to list species to diagnosing whether patient has cancer the diagnosis should be strictly scientific decision but other factors can be considered later in deciding how to treat the cancer in discussing the addition of the word solely committee report stated the principal purpose of the amendments to section 4 is to ensure that decisions pertaining to the listing and delisting of speci are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological considerations from affecting such decisions to accomplish this and other purposes section 4a is amended in several instances section 4b of the act is amended in several instances by section 1a2 of hr 6133 first the legislation requires that the secretary base his determinations regarding the listing or delisting of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him the addition of the word solely is intended to remove from the process of the listing or delisting of species any factor not re lated to the biological status of the species the committee strongly believes that economi c considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and intends that the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and such statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act not apply the committee notes and specifically rejects the characterization of this language by the department of the interior as maintaining the status quo and continuing to allow the secretary to apply executive order 12291 and other statutes in evaluating alternatives to listing the only alternatives involved in the listing of species are whether the species should be listed as endangered or threatened or not listed at all applying economic criteria to the analysis of these alternatives and to any phase of the species listing process is applying economics to the determinations made under section 4 of the act and is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the word solely in this legislation section 4b of the act as amended provides that listings shall be based solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available the committee did not change this information standard because of its interpretatio n of the word commercial to allow the use of trade data retention of the word commercial is not intended in any way to authorize the use of economic considerations in the process of listing species 65 the conference report confirms that it was the intent of both chambers that economic factors not play role in the designation and listing of species for protection continued commercial recreational scientific or educational purposes c disease or predation d the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms or other natural or ma nmade

in several ways the principal purpose of these amendments is to ensure that decisions in every phase of the process pertaining to the listing or delisting of species are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological cons iderations from affecting such decisions 66 the committee of conference hereinafter the committee adopted the house language which requires the secretary to base determinations regarding the listing or delisting of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial date available to him as noted in the house report economic considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and such statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act will not apply to any phase of the listing process the standards in the act relating to the designation of critical habitat remain unchanged the requirement that the secretary consider for listing those species that states or foreign nations have designated or identified as in need of protection also remains unchanged the committee adopted with modifications the senate amendments which combined and rewrote section 4b and f of the act to streamline the listing process by reducing the time periods for rulemaking consolidating public meeting and hearing requirements and establishing virtually identical procedures for the listing and delisting of species and for the designation of critical habitat 67 in summary the makes clear that whether species is endangered or threatened is scientific question in which economic factors must not play part once this determination is made economics then may be considered in analyzing and taking other actions such as designating critical habitat or developing recovery plans nothing in the prevents choosing conservation methods that will lower costs to society industry or landowners as long as the chosen methods still achieve conservation goals g18g155g142g556g14g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 the question may arise as to the responsibilities of the federal government toward species that is proposed for listing but has not yet been listed this question could be important because there may be significant time between the proposal for listing and the actual listing during which time federal agency could be faced with decisions on contracts and management actions of various types under current law an agency must confer with the appropriate secretary on any agency action that is likely to jeopardize the c ontinued existence of any species proposed to be listed or to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat proposed to be designated for such species68 the implementing regulations state that the conference is designed to assist the federal agency and an applicant in identifying and resolving potential conflicts at an early stage in the planning process69 the conference process that applies to species proposed for listing is distinct from the consultation process that applies to listed species the conference is intended to be less formal and to permit fws or nmfs to advise an agency on ways to minimize or avoid adverse effects 66 hrept 97835 at 19 67 ibid at 20 68 16 usc 1536a4 69 50 cfr 40210

more complete documentation once species is listed the agency may choose to follow the more complete and formal process even at the proposed listing stage to avoid duplication of effort later70 the states that the conference stage does not require limitation on the irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources by agency action which would foreclose reasonable and prudent alternative measures71 once species is listed an agency will have definite responsibilities and an agency might consider it prudent at the proposed listing stage both to avoid harm to precarious species and to avoid possible liability for compensation arising from agency actions creating private rights that later cannot be exercised for example an agency might choose to avoid holding timber sales in an area containing proposed species the relevant secretary must monitor candidate species and prevent significant risk to the wellbeing of any such species

reintroducing species without risking severe restrictions on the use of private and public land in the area77 the practice allows reintroducing species to its historic range two criteria must be met first the service must have authorized the release of the population second the population must be wholly separate geographically from other animals of that species congress required the separation so that the introduced population could be clearly distinguished an experimental populations protection status is determined differently from dps or other species if the experimental population is in imminent danger of extinction it is deemed essential currently there are essential experimental populations otherwise it is treated as nonessential and is considered threatened special regulations under section 4 of are made regarding these populations and can include rules for taking the species unless the experimental population is in national wildlife refuge or national park section 7

position see below the importance that the environmental community attach to critical habitat especially in some specific cases and the distress its designation causes among many landowners concurrently with determining species to be endangered or threatened the secretary to the maximum extent prudent and determinable 78 is to designate the critical habitat of the species the reference to the designation of critical habitat being prudent reflects the need to consider whether designating habitat would harm the species for example by identifying areas that could be damaged by specimen collecting if the facts relevant to the designation of critical habitat are not yet determinable the secretary may postpone habitat designation for an additional year eventually habitat is to be designated to the maximum extent it is prudent to do so79 if the secretary designates critical habitat the secretary must do so on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat the secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat unless he determines based on the best scientific and commercial data available that 77 pl

in the extinction of the species concerned80 therefore although economic factors are not to be considered in the listing of species as endangered or threatened economic factors must be considered in the designation of critical habitat and some habitat areas may be excluded from designation based on such concerns unless the failure to designate habitat would result in the extinction of the species although avoiding adverse modification of critical habitat is an express obligation only for federal agencies and actions it is frequently misunderstood by the public as the major restriction on private landowners authority to manage land however restrictions on use of private land come primarily from the prohibition on taking as defined of listed species only occasionallywhen some federal nexus is presentare they due to any additional strictures resulting from designated critical habitat 81 moreover provides significantly fewer restrictions on the nonfederal taking of listed plants than listed animals82 both the clinton and george w bush administrations have supported restrictions on their own ability to designate critical habitat under the eg proposed restrictions under the appropriations process83 in an announcement on october 22 1999 fws placed designation of critical habitat at the lowest priority in its list ing budget and stated that it could not comply with all of the demands of the under current budget constraints conservation groups saw contradiction between that claim and the agencys repeated failure to request increased funds for listing together with requests that congress place special cap on funding for designation of critical habitat84 fws has designated critical habitat for 509 of the 1351 listed domestic species the agency has been sued frequently for its failure to designate critical habitat and consistently loses such suits in the agencys view critical habitat offers little protection for species beyond that already available under the listing process and thus the expense of designation combined with its perception of small margin of additional conservation benefit make critical habitat requirements poor use of scarce budgetary resources especially if the public views critical habitat as the major regulatory impact of the rather than as supplement to the prohibition on taking listed species 85 according to fws critical habitat designation shows its greatest conservation benefit when it includes areas not currently occupied by the species these areas may be important as connecting corridors between populations or as areas in which new populations may be reintroduced fws 80 16 usc 1533b2 81 see crs report rs20263 designation of critical habitat under the endangered species act by pamela baldwin 82 compare 16 usc

necessary to clarify the role of habitat in endangered species conservation86 the notice reflected the agencys longstanding disaffection for this provision of the law and its view that its conservation benefit is low compared to its cost however while workshops we re held on the topic ultimately action was taken on the proposal these agency assertions and conclusions rest on an agency regulation in 2000 that fails to consider the role of critical habitat in the recovery of species rather than its mere survival87 in 2001 federal court of appeals rejected that regulatory interpretation88 in 2004 second federal court of appeals found the regulation contradicted the statute89 if the agency interpretation is changed to more closely reflect the statute the role of

consult with the secretary about proposed actions that might affect listed species to use their authorities in furtherance of the and to insure that any action authorized fund ed or carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat unless the agency has been granted an exemption under the esa91 consultation is usually begun at the request of the action agency but may be initiated at the request of an fws regional director or nmfss assistant administrator for fisheries92 science plays an important role in the consultation process because the secretary is to use the best scientific and commercial data available to ascertain if listed species might be present in the area of proposed agency action93 if so the action agency is to prepare biological assessment to explore whether proposed action might jeopardize listed species or its critical habitat this assessment also is to be based on the best scientific and commercial data available 94 consultation must also be initiated in connection with private lands if an applicant for or recipient of federal funding permit or license has reason to believe that listed species may be present in the area affected by project and implementation of the action will likely affect the species95 the relevant secretary

receipt of the application in the federal register and notifies the governor of each affected state as determined by the secretary so that state members can be appointed to the esc the secretary
