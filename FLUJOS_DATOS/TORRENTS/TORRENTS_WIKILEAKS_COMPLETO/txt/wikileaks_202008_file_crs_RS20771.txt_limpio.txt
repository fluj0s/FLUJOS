background process and issues jeffrey d brake national defense fellow foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review qdr directs dod to undertake wideranging review of strategy programs and resources specifically the qdr is expected to delineate national defense strategy consistent with the most recent national security strategy by defining force structure modernization plans and budget plan allowing the military to successfully execute the full range of missions within that strategy the report will include an evaluation by the secretary of defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the militarys ability to successfully execute its missions at lowtomoderate level of risk within the forecast budget plan the results of the 2001 qdr could well shape us strategy and force structure in coming years this report will be updated as future events warrant background the quadrennial defense review for 2001 is congressionally mandated review of national defense strategy the secretary of defense is required to analyze among other things force structure modernization plans military infrastructure and the defense budget with view towards establishing roadmap for defense programs for the next 20 years this comprehensive assessment could profoundly effect the nations ability to carry out its national security strategy in the new millennium genesis of qdr 2001 the1990s produced number of defense related studies meant to reshape american military strategy in light of the downfall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war these studies included the base force structure the bottom up review the commission on roles and missions the quadrennial defense review of 1997 and the 1997 national defense panel in the early 1990s the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general colin powell coined the term base force it was used to designate proposed structure representing the minimum armed forces necessary for the united states to meet the national security objectives defined by policy makers congressional research service the library of congress crs2 notably the capability to conduct two major theater wars simultaneously1 in 1993 the bottom up review bur acknowledged the significant changes in the global security environment by articulating strategy where the department of defense sought to prevent conflict by promoting democracy and peaceful resolution of conflict while connecting the us military to the militaries of other countries especially those of the former soviet union2 the bur addressed the need for peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations but used the two major theater war mtw scenario as the main force shaping construct3 iraq and north korea were seen as regional powers able to initiate simultaneous conflicts requiring us military response their capabilities in turn drove force planning structure and capabilities of the american military forces the bur was criticized on various grounds some thought the resultant construct was merely budget driven review and failed to adequately address the challenges of the new international security environment as result in the 1994 national defense authorization act congress mandated the commission on roles and missions corm the corm was later criticized for failing to depart from the twomtw scenario its most significant contributions included suggestions that dod undertake major quadrennial strategy review and that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff develop clear vision for future joint operations4 reacting to one of the corm recommendations congress directed the 1997 quadrennial defense review as method to conduct fundamental and comprehensive examination of americas defense needs5 the first qdr qdr 97 described strategy of shape respond prepare in which the military must shape the environment through deterrence and engagement remain prepared to engage in spectrum of conflicts ranging from small scale contingencies to major theater war and prepare for an uncertain future in addition the report acknowledged the military must contend with additional threats including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction advanced technologies the drug trade organized crime uncontrolled immigration and threats to the us homeland6 as with the bur and corm the qdr retained the twomtw construct as its force shaping tool as result the1997 qdr was again criticized by many as budget driven assessment of what military force structure would be like if funded at present budget levels the military force structure review act of 1996 established the independent national defense panel ndp as forum to review the results of the 1997 qdr the ndp report took exception to what it termed broadly as the qdrs less than ambitious 1 lorna s jaffe the development of the base force 19891992 washington dc joint history office ocjcs july 1993 p 21 2 aspin report on the bottom up review

that our current security arrangementswill not be adequate to meeting the challenges of the future7 it also recommended comprehensive look at scaling back or cancelling legacy systems8 most significantly the ndp report challenged the requirement to fight two major theater wars simultaneously as simply force sizing tool and not viable strategy the twomtw construct was criticized as means to justify cold war based force structure and as roadblock to implementing transformation strategies enabling the military to prepare for future threats9 the second quadrennial defense review is now fully under way the 2001 qdr presents an opportunity to assess future us security challenges and link them to an overarching military strategy designed to protect the interests of the us as whole its results however are not binding and may be significantly altered by the administration qdr process the 106th congress created permanent requirement for quadrennial defense review by inserting section 118 into chapter 2 of title 10 united states code which states that every four years the secretary of defense will conduct comprehensive examination of the national defense strategy force structure force modernization plans infrastructure budget plan and other elements of the defense program and policies of the united states with view towards determining and expressing the defense strategy of the united states and establishing defense program for the next 20 years10 the purpose of the 2001 qdr as stated in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 is to 1 delineate military strategy consistent with the most recent national security strategy11 2 define the defense programs to successfully execute the full range of missions assigned the military by that strategy and 3 identify the budget plan necessary to successfully execute those missions at lowtomoderate level of risk the questions listed below are intended to assist dod in formulating comprehensive military strategy in light of the evolving international security environment and rapidly emerging technologies congress specifically requires the secretary of defense to consider precision guided munitions stealth night vision digitization and communications as he formulates his preferred force structure options for the next 20 years12 7 transforming defense national security in the 21st century report of the national defense panel december 1997 p 21 8 the report cited the armys m1a1 abrams tank upgrades the crusader artillery vehicle the comanche helicopter the navys last nimitzclass carrier and the defensewide tactical aircraft programs fa18ef f22 and joint strike fighter as likely candidates for cancelling or scaling back to make room in the budget for new systems focused on future challenges 9 report of the national defense panel p 23 10 congressional record august 5 1999 p h7527 11 national security strategy for new century was published in december 1999 and is

submit report to congress by september 30 2001 which will include an assessment by the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff defining the magnitude of the political strategic and military risks associated with carrying out the missions as expressed in the qdr strategy congress has specifically requested the report include answers to the following questions 1 the results of the review including comprehensive discussion of the national defense strategy of the united states and the force structure best suited to implement that strategy at lowtomoderate level of risk 2 the assumed or defined national security interests of the united states that inform the national defense strategy defined in the review 3 the threats to the assumed or defined national security interests of the united states that were examined for the purposes of the review and the scenarios developed in the examination of those threats 4 the assumptions used in the review including assumptions relating to readiness b the cooperation of allies missionsharing and benefits and burdens resulting from coalition operations c warning times d levels of engagement in operations other than war and smallerscale contingencies and the intensity duration and military and political endstates of conflicts and smallerscale contingencies 5 the effect on the force structure and on readiness for highintensity combat of preparations for and participating in operations other than war and smallerscale contingencies 6 the manpower and sustainment policies required under the national defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts lasting longer than 120 days 7 the anticipated roles and missions of the reserve components in the national defense strategy and the strength capabilities and equipment necessary to assure that the reserve components can capably discharge those roles and missions 8 the appropriate ratio of combat forces to support forces commonly referred to as the toothtotail ratio under the national defense strategy including in particular the appropriate number and size of headquarters units and defense agencies for that purpose 9 the strategic and tactical airlift sealift and ground transportation capabilities required to support the national defense strategy 10 the forward presence prepositioning and other anticipatory deployments necessary under the national defense strategy for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to anticipated conflicts 11 the extent to which resources must be shifted among two or more theaters under the national defense strategy in the event of conflict in such theaters 12 the advisability of revisions to the unified command plan as result of the national defense strategy 13 the effect on force structure of the use of the armed forces of technologies anticipated to be available for the ensuing 20 years 14 any other matter the secretary considers appropriate qdr input while osd is responsible for the integration of the qdr effort it is the joint staff that will gather the data and formulate the inputs from the individual services the combatant commands and defense agencies into the end result the joint staff qdr organization is led by general officer steering committee that will receive input from eight different panels those panels are strategy and risk assessment force generation capability and structure modernization sustainment strategic mobility and infrastructure readiness transformation innovation and joint experimentation information superiority and human resources each panels input will go to preparation group which is assisted by an integration group providing budget analysis and administrative support the joint requirements oversight council the service operational deputies and the joint chiefs of staff will provide guidance and help resolve panel issues as needed recent information suggests that osd will form six major issue panels to develop options and make recommendations for the qdr report those panels are tentatively strategy force structure capabilities and investment information warfare intelligence and space personnel and readiness support infrastructure and joint organizations13 13 elaine m grossman pentagon to perform quadrennial defense review at lightning pace inside the pentagon may 31 2001 p 1 crs5 qdr process issues several process issues will garner attention as the qdr is undertaken first the timing of the qdr itself may be called into question numerous major policy actions by the bush administration must be considered prior to delineating the national security strategy second determining the appropriate military strategy with which to frame the review will be crucial step last prior studies were criticized by some as being budget driven process as opposed to strategy driven although the military strategy ultimately defined by the qdr will most likely have budgetary limitations it is deemed essential to provide clear picture of how that strategy effectively defends us national interests timing of the qdr as discussed earlier the qdr process was established as title 10 requirement for the secretary of defense to conduct qdr every four years during year evenly divisible by four and to submit the report to congress not later than september 30 of the year in which the review is conducted14 the national security strategy is due in june of 2001 with the qdr report to follow by september 30 2001 if the administration substantially changes previous security strategy dod will most likely require more time to formulate its strategy and concepts based on the new national security strategy and delineate coherent military strategy within which to frame the qdr it has been suggested by some that the administration take different approach to the review conducting broad strategic review and using it to establish priorities with more extensive study to follow might allow both the administration and dod to take more measured view15 this method could affect the administrations first budget submission in 2002 using results of qdr97 to shape the defense budget until the comprehensive study is complete might allow the administration to more coherently translate its national security strategy into different or revamped defense strategy this approach would require congress to amend the qdr legislation now in law appropriate strategy structuring our military forces on the premise the us military will need to fight two simultaneous regional conflicts provided logical yardstick during the cold war and time frame immediately afterward some see it as less likely occurrence in todays environment given the lack of eligible adversaries that could muster the necessary forces and resources to create that scenario since that time it has been criticized as being more an argument to retain the current force structure at the expense of restructuring opponents of the twomtw construct contend it is difficult to substantiate the necessity of countering major crossborder conventional conflicts in the current international security environment the emerging asymmetric threats of terrorism narcotrafficking weapons of mass destruction information warfare environmental sabotage antiaccess operations and other low intensity operations may dictate different approach to force sizing16 conversely modifying or completely changing the current 14 congressional record august 5 1999 p h7527 15 quadrennial defense review 2001 working group report of the national defense university

states commission on national security21st century april 1 2000 pp 1415 there is continued crs6 strategy may have an impact on our allies around the world changing the twomtw construct could be perceived by some allies as lack of resolve and backing away from current security commitments strategybudget mismatch the cost of most strategies considered will probably exceed current budget levels estimates range from over 20 billion to 100 billion per year shortfall to fund the 1997 qdr force17 the iraqi nofly zone enforcement the balkans peacekeeping force and numerous other small scale commitments continue to place strain on the current budget budget estimates for transforming the military to meet future threats while maintaining credible force to deter current threats or win possible conflicts far outreach the proposed defense budgets in the current future years defense program18 the overall goal of the qdr process is to create defense strategy complementing the national security strategy bounded by budget that ensures low tomoderate level of risk when executed in order to do this most defense specialists see likely necessity to either increase the defense budget restructure and reduce current costs or reduce the demands of the current defense strategy they have urged that the qdr approach as monitored by congress address those hard choices conclusion besides the process issues mentioned above congress may be interested in other aspects of the qdr it will be important to ensure the dod qdr organization is an effective analytic structure that emphasizes jointness and total force thinking versus protection of individual service equities or service budget shares the roles of the regional commanderinchiefs should be analyzed as they compete for limited service resources during growing commitments the transformation strategies of each service could require reassessment of procurement decisions of systems designed for conventional battle as the united states moves further into the information age the methods of estimating the risks involved in changing the strategy the construct the strategy is based upon and the transformation philosophies of the services could well affect the outcome of the qdr translating the qdr into coherent and useful defense strategy to guide the united states into an uncertain future will require challenging choices by the congress and bush administration 16 continued indication what impact if any these reports will have on the pentagons qdr strategy 17 daniel goure and jeffrey ranney of the center for strategic and international studies in their 1999 book averting the defense train wreck in the new millennium espouse 100 billion per year shortfall whereas analysts at the center for strategic budgetary assessments believe the shortfall will exceed 20 billion per year 18 the army alone is estimating 70 billion price tag for its transformation process between 2000 and 2014 see ron laurenzos article in defense week february 14 2000 army vision to cost 70 billion through 2014 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20771
