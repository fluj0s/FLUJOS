been prohibited by federal statute from paying interest on checking account balances the main rationale was to promote bank safety and soundness unpredictable movements of deposits among banking institutions in response to interest rate competition were thought to make some banks vulnerable to failure another but related reason was that big money center banks were able to pay higher interest rates for deposits than smaller banks and thus could bid deposits away from smaller country banks to make more speculative loans such as for buying shares in the stock market it was believed that the bidding away of deposits had the effect of misallocating financial resources away from productive to speculative uses to get around the prohibition banks established inefficient implicit interest payment mechanisms to compete for deposits these implicit mechanisms ranged from free or discounted banking services to gifts regulatory changes over time have also reduced the effectiveness of the prohibition for example the establishment of negotiable orders of withdrawal now accounts and automatic transfers between savings and checking accounts called sweeps in effect allow depositors to earn interest on their checking balances on january 4 2007 the business checking fairness act of 2007 hr 41 was introduced in 110 th congress by representative nydia velazquez this bill would repeal the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on any checking accounts and require bank regulators to conduct surveys of bank fees and services including automated teller machines atms and credit card transactions hr 41 was referred to the house committee on financial services should the prohibition on paying interest be rescinded it would be expected to improve the efficiency of financial markets even though paying interest would raise the costs of providing checking account services for some depository institutions institutions that would have higher costs are those currently paying little or implicit or explicit interest on checking accounts those institutions already paying some implicit interest on checking accounts may experience reduction in cost because these implicit interest rate mechanisms are inefficient and tend to misallocate financial resources most analysts believe that the transparency of explicit interest rate payments would lead to better decision making on the part of depository institutions and their depositors repeal of the prohibition on paying interest could also have beneficial effect on the conduct of monetary policy by the federal reserve longterm relative decline in demand deposits has been accompanied by decline in reserve balances at the fed to the extent that paying interest on demand deposits increased reserve balances the fed would have more funds to invest in government securities to the ultimate benefit of the treasury this report will be updated as legislative developments warrant

depository institutions have been prohibited by federal statute from paying interest on checking account or demand deposit balances depository institutions are banks savings associations and credit unions to get around the prohibition depositories have over the years established number of implicit interest arrangements on january 4 2007 the business checking fairness act of 2007 hr 41 was

checking account balances 1 checking accounts term used interchangeably in this report with demand deposits are distinguished from time deposits or savings deposits by being immediately available to the depositor without re strictions on or penalty for early withdrawal congress imposed the restriction because of concerns about the destabilizing effects on the banking system of deposit competition among banks unpredictable movements of deposits between banking institutions in response to interest rate competition it was thought could potentially cause some banks to fail another but related reason was that big money center banks were able to pay higher interest rates for deposits than smaller banks and could thus bid deposits away from smaller country banks it was believed that this would encourage more speculative loans such as for buying shares in the stock market thus the bidding away of deposits from small banks to large ones could have the effect of misallocating financial resources away from productive to speculative uses g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g22g145g142g561g18g155g152g145g146g139g146g157g146g152g151g561

checking accounts would distort the price of deposits and related bank services the interest rate ceiling of zero would not prevent banks from competing for checking deposits bank profits depend on attracting deposits in order to acquire incomeearning assets such as commercial loans and mortgages to compete for deposits banks and other depository institutions began to pay 1 the banking act of 1933 actually placed ceilings on the intere st that banks could pay on different kinds of deposits checking deposits have ceiling of zero which is effectively prohibition of paying interest on these acc ounts

formal interest payments2 for business deposits the implicit interest payments took the form of bundling banking products and services and offering them to business customers at discount as compensation for maintaining their checking deposits with bank items in these bundles included discounted interest rates on loans and negotiated minimum balances that must be maintained to receive certain banking services free or at significant discounts similar offers were made to nonbusiness depositors for personal checking accounts the implicit interest payments took the form of giving some customers free checking accounts andor other discounted banking services such as discounted interest rates on loans in the 1970s it was not uncommon for banks to give away toaster ovens and other gadgets as inducements to depositors these implicit interest rate mechanisms however are inefficient because they tended to misallocate financial resources without an explicit price the supply of these services and the demand for them are unlikely to reach equilibrium depository institutions often developed servicing capacities that turned out either to over supply or under supply the needs of their customers if the services are under supplied customers are likely to seek those services elsewhere if the services are over supplied the depository institutions have lost profits by supplying unneeded services in either case financial resources are not deployed optimally the prohibition on paying interest for demand deposits creates lack of price transparency in garnering deposits which leads to inappropriate decision making on the part of business customers as well as the depository institutions

compete aggressively for deposits depository institutions found themselves with an increasing mismatch between the interest they earned on assets and interest paid to acquire new assets and deposits money market accounts offered by nonbanking institutions provided strong competition the interest rate payment prohibition frustrated depository institutions competition for deposits in response to these pressures banks began to seek ways to offer customers the opportunity to earn interest on funds that could be used to transfer money to third parties but which also evaded the restrictions applying to demand deposits in 1972 number of statechartered mutual savings banks in new england began offering accounts that were technically not demand deposits but upon which negotiable orders of withdrawal now could be used to transfer funds to third parties these now accounts were not subject to the prohibition of interest payments commercial banks in new england were permitted to offer now accounts in order to compete 3 the now account innovation spread to other parts of the country and by 1980 congress enacted the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980 pl 96 221 this law deregulated interest rates paid on savings deposits but not checking accounts even though the zerointerest ceiling on demand deposits remained depository institutions everywhere were now allowed to offer interestbearing checking accounts as now accounts 2 credit unions which are depository in stitutions but relatively small ones were able to pay dividends indistinguishable from interest on their checking account balances 3 see crs report 98474 payment of interest on demand deposits an economic analysis by g thomas woodward

zerointerest rate ceiling was the innovation of regularly sweeping the balances in demand or transaction accounts sweeps are arrangements between depository institutions and business cust omers that allow the institutions to sweep the businesses checking account balances out of those accounts each evening and put them into interest earning accounts the next day the balances are transferred back into the businesses checking accounts to meet the businesses daily transactions sweeps thus give the businesses the advantage of gaining interest on their transaction balances when they are not in immediate use because of the high cost to depository institutions of setting up and operating sweep accounts they are established almost exclusively for business accounts sweep accounts existed in practice before 1994 when the federal reserve officially allowed depository institutions to sweep checking deposits sweep accounts are more beneficial to larger depository institutions than to small ones large institutions are required to keep reserves on their checking accounts smaller institutions often are not these required reserves earn interest and consequently are costly to large depository institutions which could invest these reserves if they werent required the benefit to sweep accounts is that even though checks are drawn on them reserves are required to be set aside for these accounts thus institutions escape the cost of maintaining noninterestearning required reserves 4 furthermore larger banks are able to attract more deposits by offering higher interest rates than smaller institutions because large banks are able to make arrangements with securities dealers to offer rates based on the much higher rates of returns available on shortterm nonbank investments the major disadvantage to sweep accounts for so banks is their cost according to testimony of americas community bankers the problem is that sweep accounts are expensive and can be very labor intensive especially for smaller institutions though there are software programs that handle sweeps automatically these programs are typically t oo expensive for smaller community banks and savings institutions to acquire and operate5 g22g145g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g561 on january 4 2007 hr 41 was introduced in the 110th congress and referred to

quarterly on balances maintained there on behalf of depository institution amend the federal reserve act to require the board to survey biennially and report biennially to congress on bank fees and certain services amend the financial institution reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 and the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 to repeal certain reporting requirements in short hr 41 would repeal the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits effective at the end of twoyear period beginning on the date of enactment of the act in the interim to enable depository institutions and bus inesses to ease into market environment where interest is paid on checking accounts the provisions would provide statutory authority for sweeps this would have the effect of giving statutory weight to the 1994 federal reserve regulation that allowed depository institutions to make sweeps sweeps are also referred to as transfers and would be allowed as many as 24 times per month the congressional budget office cbo has not yet done cost estimate for hr 41 however cbo completed an estimate for the business checking freedom act of 2005 hr 1224 in the 109 th congress cbo estimated that hr 1224 woul d not have any net effect on annual federal revenues over the 20062009 period but would decrease revenues after 2009 that revenue loss would total

on their deposits for these institutions there could be some reduction in costs by being able to offer an explicit interest rate on demand deposits institutions with implicit interest rates that exceed the interest rate after repeal could experience significant savings that could have an impact on their profitability smaller depository institutions may also augment their bottom line by being able to compete more easily in attracting demand deposits without investing in expensive complicated implicitinterestpaying mechanisms not all depository institutions however would benefit from repeal of the prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits since costs would rise for some most analysts expect costs to increase for depositories with the largest amount of demand deposits on which they are not now paying any interestexplicitly or implicitly these depository institutions would face pressures to begin paying interest in order to keep their depositors after repeal consequently they would be expected to experience decline in profits in providing demand deposit services

in the 1970s checking deposits declined to little more than 50 of all deposits in commercial banks table 1 shows that demand deposits at commercial banks have continued to decline falling from 21 in 1984 to about 10 as of december 2004 this means that demand deposits are not growing part of depository institutions business in relation to time deposits 7 the trend also means that depositories are already paying interest on most of their deposits and repealing the prohibition would have less impact on profits than in the 1970s furthermore even though table 1 shows huge change in demand deposits at savings banks due mainly to the growth of savings banks doing more commercial lending demand deposits are still small portion of savings banks total deposits in december 2006 956 of savings banks deposits are time deposits on which they pay explicit interest in short even though some depositories are expected to benefit and others are expected to experience losses the declining trend in demand

increase demand deposits relative to time deposits if the prohibition were repealed checking deposits would pay interest and would be more liquid than most time deposits however there are forces at work against such reversal of the declining trend in demand deposits according to the federal deposit insurance corporations statistics as of december 31 2006 there were 7402 commercial banks in the united states the top 88 banks held 74 of total deposits as mentioned above large banks are required to keep reserves against demand deposits which earn interest since reserves are mandated on time deposits the incentive is to increase time deposits relative to demand deposits paying interest on an already costly liability is contrary to profitmaximizing behavior as result the impact of repeal would likely fall short of leveling the playing field between demand deposits and time deposits g22g145g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g151g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g142g156g561 repealing the prohibition on paying interest on checking accounts would be likely to have greater impact on small businesses than larger firms to remain competitive depository institutions have been offering larger business customers cash management services which make best use of their cash on hand before they pay their bills the bigger companies longer let their cash sit idly in checking accounts giving depository institutions interest free loans until it is used to pay bills large business customers have been demanding and receiving interest on their checking account balances mostly through complic ated implicit interest mechanisms such as sweeps in contrast many smaller business customers have been unable to earn interest on their deposits for the main reason that small business customers balances are too small to make it worthwhile for depository institutions to pay them implicit interest small businesses are at disadvantage even when they are offered some implicit interest according to testimony of the national federation of independent business we found that the sweep account resulted in flood of paper from the bank each day reconciliation statement letting us know how the money had been shifted around and because this is done via the mail there is always twotothree day delay in information flow so we never have an accurate uptothe minute view of the flow of funds among our banking accounts sweep accounts are bookkeeping nightmare for small business 8 while sweep accounts and other implicit payments to garner demand deposits have become more customer friendly than in 1998 small businesses are likely to gain more than large ones if explicit interest payment were allowed

deposit accounts were introduced in 1982 to make banks competitiv with security firms money market mutual funds which pay higher interest rate than now accounts they are liquid but not as liquid as checking accounts or now accounts for example an mmda depositor must maintain minimum balance and may make maximum of six preauthorized transfers of which more than three can be checks of 500 or more each even though mmdas are checkable accounts the wording of the repeal legislation does not indicate how mmdas would be affected if mmdas continue to offer significantly higher interest than ordinary checking accounts depositors may continue to tolerate their lower liquidity g22g145g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g151g561g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 the repeal of the prohibition could have an impact on the federal reserve the fed and monetary policy to the extent that repeal would cause demand deposits at depository institutions to increasea reversal of the three decades of relative decline in demand depositsthere could be benefits to the fed the decline in demand deposits was accompanied by decline in required reserve balances at the fed the fed has argued that the continued negative trend could potentially impair its ability to conduct monetary policy 9 as mentioned above depository institutions are required to maintain reserves against demand deposits growth in required reserve balances at federal reserve banks could enhance the feds ability to conduct monetary policy increasing and decreasing the money supply and thus interest rates these increased reserve balances at the fed would also provide the federal reserve with more funds that it would invest in government securities the overwhelming part of returns from these investments would be remitted to the treasury as government receipts the congressional budget office estimates that these effects however would not be significant 10
