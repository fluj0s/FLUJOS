bridge publications inc newsletter date one should keep going despite heavy weather so my own philosophy is that one should share what wisdom he has one should help others to help themselves and one should keep going despite heavy weather for there is always calm ahead one should also ignore the catcalls from the selfish intellectual who cries dont expose the mystery keep it all for ourselves the people cannot understand but as i have never seen wisdom do any good kept to oneself and as i like to see others happy and as i find the vast majority of the people can and do understand i will keep on writing and working and teaching so long as i exist for i know man who has any monopoly upon the wisdom of this universe it belongs to those who can use it to help themselves and others if things
