6810c02 class viii tape 9 the laws of listing and nulling well this is lecture number what nine lecture number 9 and this is 2 october 1968 ad were concerned this evening with some very precise actions and so we will get straight along with it the laws of listing and nulling are common and ordinary garden variety subject of attack there are more cooks have more cockeyed variations and more advice on this subject than any other single thing because of course it is the one subject that can ruin pc bongo now the laws of listing and nulling are not something that you wonder about you know them you know them or you dont know them and you know them now and you can do them now i call to your attention that reading to you the laws of listing and nulling is something like reading to you the directions on how to play piano do i make my point you can all know where middle c is now auditing is relatively simple piano but nevertheless it is something to be played it is not something to know about the maker of the piano never crosses the mind of concert pianist where middle c is is not something he looks down the keyboard he isnt wondering what those black things are now somebody can play piano with one finger ta ta ta ta to ta and somebody can play chopin and the difference between these two fellows is is one knows his business and the other maybe in his elementary school read paper that said piano is an instrument which has black and white keys you get the difference now it isnt that people cant read directions and then apply them its that they misestimate the amount of expertise required to actually apply them so we get some student some place and he reads bulletin and he knows all of these things it is just exactly as he said where is the loud pedal the loud pedal is on the right where is the soft pedal the soft pedal is on the left in the middle of playing the overture of 1812 he thinks now i want to make it go loud the loud pedal is on the right left which was it its on the maybe its the lever over to the side oh i havent put the top up so then he has stageassistant who comes in and when he wants it to go loud he has him put the top up and when he wants it soft he puts the top down you get the general idea in playing the piano you want it to go loud you stamp on the loud pedal without wondering where the loud pedal is so it is one thing to know it in theory and it is another thing to apply it but there is peculiarity in something on somebody who can know it in theory and then cant apply it this isnt strange being it is simply lazy being who has never mocked it up in his skull as to what was where you understand so he knows the words the laws of listing and nilling not nulling nilling what he doesnt know about that one line is that these are all the laws there are there arent any others there arent bunch of hidden data that havent been included in this bulletin these are it this is all there is so there is something to know about the title so he isnt reading at all wondering what laws of listing and nulling have been left out he knows thats all there is now the rest of it is drill drill you are making list of who have you shot of course that would be very long list and wouldnt go to one item but laughing who do you feel most bad about shooting would go to one item and oddly enough the unmock and stop and withdraw list do go to one item there are certain things that are lists that go to one item and those are the standard listing questions now you start wandering off you can list anything but you start wandering off the standard listing questions that are the standard line questions and you are liable to have question which doesnt just go to one item now there is such such thing that it is processing question and actually the only reason you are listing it down is so you can clean it up you get the idea now it looks like list but its not list because its not standard question you got the idea ill give you an idea of what this is you can say what is wrong with my case actually you could list this what is wrong with my case that is it looks like list it looks like listing question and you think you could list it down to one reading item brother ive got news for you it isnt proper listing question the laws of listing and nulling apply to proper listing questions if you were to say what is wrong with my case and then make list and you said bongobingo and togobak and ragbags are unflat and auditors missed on the floggodick it could go something like this bongobingo long fall ragbags unflat small fall ah ah ruggerbo long fall bd and you all of sudden say well what is wrong with my case is ruggerbo bd well maybe maybe not but all of sudden it wouldnt work out why wouldnt it work out well its not proper listing question in the first place and you have already bypassed the bypasted charge you have restimulated on the first two or three that read so this is list quote unquote it is simply an auditing question is all it is its an auditing question which is written down so you can ask any auditing question you can get certain number of answers factually if you ask an auditing question and then you make writedown of the answers and then you took up everyone of the answers as you wrote it down you get one of these what is wrong with my case what is wrong with my case you see tingerwaps fall okay tingerwaps lets see when did i run into tingerwaps see oh yeah that was bluggulogs good ah and then you get down to ragbags wow see oh yeah wow uhum 1960 woff woff waggle waggle waffle waffle waffle and yeah what the hell do you know about that theres whole chain of these ragbags now the earliest ragbag was in oh lets see 2000 numbers tough here lets get date order of magnitude tens of years hundreds of years thousands of years tens of thousands of years hundreds of thousands of years millions of years tens of millions of years hundreds of millions of years billions of years tens of billions of years hundreds of billions of years trillions of years fall more than 5 trillion fall more than ten trillion read less than ten trillion fall ah 5 trillion 6 trillion 7 trillion 7 trillion 7 trillion long fall all right were in the order of magnitude of 7 trillion 954 million 762 thousand 727 good and 2 months bd well so that was the first ragbag now lets see what the hell was that all about and so forth what the hell mate peter had an arc break in it they sent the laundry ashore and didnt get it back yeah we landed in this space right here and i lost all of my clothes and the uniform was so bad you know after that they couldnt believe i was the first mate oh yeah i got that em poh what the hell do you know ragbags clean laugh good now wait minute fn thats an auditing process by which you take up everything in the book its you wrote the thing down with question mark but then it was sort of process and then you got some items which followed the process do you follow and then you handled each item and so on now you dont do that process that way for some peculiar reason not because i said so you see its an illegal listing question its its not listing question its its its process an offbeat process not because i said so but because it just works this way now we get question who or what is trying to unmock you laugh ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba long fall bd poom okay ba bow bow ba bow bow ba bow bow ba bow bow ba bow bow ba bow bow long fall bd long fall bd bd very good your item is ba bow bow and that is because it is question which makes real list and it goes to one item but there are tons of questions which dont go to one item and you can dream up all kinds of them and i see them in all folders from way back when ah where are the roofs you see or something ill give you one that sounds exactly like it would be listing question this will guarantee to wrap some pc around the telegraph pole what environment was dangerous so help pete it doesnt go to one item now youve got to worry that it is an offbeat question and it didnt list to one item and you cant get it down to one item and the pc starts wrapping around the telegraph pole thats because its actually just process its sort of an outofarcprocess so it is extremely limited what environment was dangerous and every read you got on the list you should have taken up laugh if you ever if you ever ran it as process see so there is way of running process to write it down now theoretically theoretically because you often see an fn occur and big bd on any of the process questions theoretically they should be list right well im clearing this up with you because somebody is sooner or later going to come along and hes going to say wait minute all processes are really lists the fellow who is answering question on level 0 is really making list so therefore the right way to run level 0 is to go down the line to level 0 and find the reading item an give it to the pc now he finds the one pc in thousand on whom this actually worked and he has had it you understand it is process it is not listing question and the funny part of it is the processes that come up the line dont work now arcquestion the level 3 question the big change you know the big change its just borderline to being an item its oneitemlist funny thing about it is because the unlimited nature of arc you can actually occasionally run it again youd better not but you can actually occasionally run it again not the arcprocess with all the change but you can find an earlier big change on the whole track so you can run it sort of this lifetime and you can sort of run it on the whole track this is not advised im just telling you the behavior of things see but you find the real change that is listed on on the list the pc makes and you run the process just exactly the way it says in r3h anybody is liable to call anything r3h these days it was an exact process i had somebody not too long ago actually rewrite an hcob and send it to on r3h boy i said now i have seen it all and i find out that he was advising people to bypass fns doing this oh my god the arcbreak registrars proper action is green form thats all an arcbreak registrar should ever do green form he should do green form itsa similar itsa earlier its all he ever ought to do it doesnt mess up anything you can run almost an unlimited number of them because it is sort of pt proposition because youre just handling it with itsa and earlier similar itsa and you clean up more cases than you can shake stick at the arcbreak registrar however thinks he can only run arcbreaks well he misses the guy with the ptps he misses the guy with the mwh and why do most people blow orgs because they had missed withholds so thats idiocy ive never gotten hold of the arcbreak registrars and told them this up to this time directly to their faces so i am trusting you to do so green form green form never do anything but green form and because you probably cant trust their listing and so forth say dont list anything list list just green form yeah he says what if he strikes hes connected to suppressive group good itsa similar incident earlier itsa laugh oddly enough youll find out it works dont you see it worked like bomb now if his trs are fairly smooth he wont kick in bpc you actually can kick in bypassed charge of the pc if the if if the trs are out fumble bumble stumble bumah flumble flumble lets see the laws of listing and nulling i know i know i know this dont tell dont dont tell pc ah dont tell ah i should lets see ive got three listing dont tell pc three reading items on the list and so on i should that means its the first item that isnt right ah its dead horse laughter youre liable to kick in some other time when the pc has been stalled on the track in some fashion or another which he is in most accidents and things you know waiting for the doctor or something of the sort and here comes in some bpc and this hidden factor flies in sideways because of the slowness and allthumbsness of the auditor see do you get it it doesnt show up in the auditing report always very mysterious this fellow for some reason or other he the thing didnt clear up now you know it didnt clear up because the session went on and on and its four hour and 95 minutes session see laugh and all he had to straighten out was did he have ptp not even of long duration see its what you really wanted him to do so you said check arcbreaks and see if this pc has ptp of long duration youve noticed youve noticed that every time every time he comes into session he tells the examiner the same thing its all through the folder which of course if you know your business the unchanging case has ptp of long duration the cases which dont change have ptp of long duration i mean the one side of the coin is the other side of the coin you understand well heres heres heres mr blitz in here again with his lumbosis he says it hasnt been helped now you can say oh lets see whats the matter is he an arcbreak or is it woff woff is it some peculiar kind of case maybe he was an eskimo in former life and these engrams got frozen laughterthe datum which springs to view at this particular moment is he still got his lumbosis it is still worrying him and hes got pts of long duration and the other datum you know it isnt the lumbosis for the excellent reason that he knows that and it hasnt resolved so he hasnt asised it there could be another reason he hasnt asised it he is out of valence and cant asis anything but then he would have to be out of valence with the present time problem but it isnt really present time problem its problem that has been every present time for the last few thousand years laughter so the problem of long duration thats what is wrong with this guy and he is always audited over top of it unchanging case its actually ptp every time hes audited he has ptp ah you can actually fix up case so its unchanging by some auditor finding ptp that didnt exist existing with the fellow has ptp because it always reads on ptp and the fellow goes around wondering what his ptp is and his his problem is whether or not he has problem you see thats false read that can be introduced on the case so you always say check for false reads check for suppressed reads now getting down to cases here then there is thing which is called list and that proceeds from thing which is called standard listing question and there are very few of these theres the remedy the remedy b the three suppressive question ones and there is another one what are you trying to prevent now there are several more that do end up in one item and the arc level 3 grade ends up in one time not just one arc break but it ends up for sure in one time do you understand now you can fool with this arc break all you want to and run it all over the track but the fact of it is youre looking for the major change in the persons life you ask for the major change in the persons life dont you see whatever the question says what you want as an auditor you want that one change now you list for that you find that thing accurately you find the arc break in it and the guy goes release poom very magical very magical now service facsimile every now and then you come across the line and you cant rehab the service facsimile youd never relist the service facsimile for the excellent reason that the pc cant remember it dont be an idiot youve cared for this already laughter its erased why are you bugging him about it but the funny part of it is you actual could list for another service facsimile not that he has another service facsimile but you can always get one out of body thetan so actually if the fellow had 500 body thetans youd get 500 service facsimiles laughter you could probably do it 500 times before the pc kicked the bucket laughter most body thetans are above service fac below service facsimiles so you the majority of them are so you would have ball trying to get it but the point i am making is is youve listed for this service facsimile that is the principal one and so on and you let it go at that well now if you cant rehab it somebody didnt get the right one once in while you are out of luck you cant get the original list now what do you do they didnt get the guys service facsimile and so forth well you could do this is very stunty stuff and isnt advised at all but its perfectly valid to ask the guy what is his service facsimile what the one found was and youll find out he usually remembers it now you ask him what the one found was that you dont have the original list you can list in this peculiar fashion once in blue moon and get away with it what what were the items on the list you made laughter but in order to do that youd have to get in suppress on the list because his right item was missed what did you tell the auditor you thought it was on whatever the question is with the service facsimile has anything been suppressed has anythiing been challenged you know invalidated we dont care what as long as you clean up that question i dont know what service facsimile i remember i got awfully nervous at that particular time iim not sure about that i did yeah well we they found it alright the service facsimile i think was to jump off tall i dont know if it was tall blondes or tall buildings laughter it was something like that didnt sound like it he isnt sure but already it wont rehab and you say did ah you know to find your service facsimile and so forth and etc ah you know to go release at that point normal pattern nothing happens on that time was anything suppressed anything invalidated invalidation reads ahoh it did yeah his service facsimile hasnt been found it wont rehab so now you can become the hassles do you recall what somebody said it was yeah ah so and so so and so unclear mumbling you say well all right you could prepcheck the question and ask him if he remembers any of the items he thought it was at the time the oddity is you may be able to get it its very risky handling list where you havent got the list that was listed better approach entirely is to say mr jinx we have arrived at that point where youre going to be laid off auditing until we can recover your earlier folder which as i understand is in australia we will tell you when we get it and then make somebody in australia send him the earlier auditing folder or make joe blitz who is in alaska mail in that damned service facsimile you dont necessarily want the whole folder but you for sure want that list it might have been some other squirrely things if you think it was very squirrely why you want it all sent in and you want it now in view of the fact that you are normally operating in an organization those that im talking to at the moment are certainly working at an organization you have communication lines where this can occur its the safer thing to try to obtain the list get the actual list and null it now whats suppressed on ba bow bow has anything been suppressed on ba ba bow bow has anything been suppressed that reads on ba ba bow has anything been suppressed that one reads you know on catawumbs has anything been suppressed see pow on doggerbo has anything been suppressed read on rupptittle has any thing been suppressed long fall on the listing question has anything been suppressed long fall what was it oh yeah well the guy didnt run any list on it unclear speech as matter of fact at that particular time and so forth ah waggle waggle waggle waggle okay now youve unsuppressed these items call them again bluey and blah there are two reading items on the list ah but everything on the list isnt live so therefore you havent bypassed the item now you get down here and you put bar over to the left side of the list and you say list extended date and you put the additional items on the list and one of them blows down you renull the list to make sure the whole list to make sure you havent got anything reading and that is it sometimes pc even gets restive and unhappy because you list the whole list ah there is degree at which he is saying wow wee that is it wow wee when you dont null but youre taking chance youre taking chance you actually are so youve got the fellows service facsimile from the original list that is the correct action now once in blue moon you have to do this other action which im talking to you about you get everything unsuppressed now you could even ask was there anything you hadnt told this auditor you see the missed withhold ah at that time were you arc broken about anything and so on you can pick it up see pick it up pick it up and any every one few of these you find out it suddenly rehabs it was the right service facsimile and it did rehab but it was listed over out ruds and the fn declared on it war false report but it was the correct service facsimile do you get the complications that can occur here very complicated it all comes from this now on one of the questions i just asked on an examination i better repeat this the way standard tech ceases to be standard tech is somebody has already done something nonstandard the way to get standard tech back in hes missed some piece of standard tech the way to get it in is you find out what piece of standard tech was missed and you remedy this you got it and the case will then fly because there are only so many pieces to standard tech see wild things could have occurred he could have been listed standing on his head any damned thing could have occurred there thousands of outnesses that could have occurred in the session this is the one thing ive got to push home to you there are thousands and millions an infinity of possible errors in session do you follow the only error you are interested in are those errors which violate standard tech you got it youve got to get this point or you wont actually be able to repair anybody you look for the points of standard tech that have been violated the session run over pts the session run with missed withhold do you get it thethe bird that walked in to the org and they started to do engrams on him and he couldnt run anything and unclear speech and so on his ta was up and so on and they went ahead and ran grades and all this sort of thing with the guy flubbed up madly way back down the track on points of release there werent any points of release ever rehabed on this case they were running arc sw without rehab the guy came in ran arc sw you see and got some results for gods sake the ta never really came down but he got results and he had cognition and he and so forth and that was pretty good and actually they marked it that they had an fn but for some reason the next time he came into session the ta was at 6 or something and then theyre going to run secondaries and in some peculiar way secondaries are run and this case is just doing weird one well actually he walked in with high ta what the hell is somebody off the street doing with high ta well obviously hes been overrun laugh i know but he never had any auditing he never even read book but hes been overrun what overran him well i want to call to your attention that there it lot of livingness going on and also here and there on the whole track here and there on the whole track they knew something dim about running engrams they didnt know it well and they didnt know enough not to overrun it every point of these you find overruns associated with them there are various methods of getting rid of engrams in space opera society they had sort of chopstick that came together with an awful crash while showing the guy photograph of the area he was injured in and this was signal to the thetan that he was supposed to chop it up and wad it up into ball and throw it away if you worked this area over and run that off you find the original incident sitting there thats quite fascinating but there was some effort from time to time to handle thetans pictured here and there on the track its been known that thetan had pictures they didnt have any other technology to back it up but they had that and where these were run you get an overrun so this can happen the pc comes in and arc sw is great secondaries seem to be alright and then engrams the ta went whistles is it getting more solid are we on the wrong chain what the hell is this its an overrun on engrams you wont find it an overrun on any other part of scientology but youll find occasionally an overrun on engrams but most frequently its an overrun on drugs and i would adventure to say that you occasionally have an overrun on life just the subject of living and you occasionally have the subjects of an overrun of dying hes died too many times laughter well his death is release what the hell but youd have to figure out what it is what is it what is it thats been overrun well it could be lot of things been overrun so youd better find out whats been overrun now what has been overrun or what has been going on too long or what have you done too often any version of the question that would communicate is handled and it is not list it is process but you get read on this item and then you do standard rehab and then you ask it didnt fn so you ask for another one and you ask for the release on that and its little bit better and the ta comes down and then you ask for the next question and it didnt read and then you ask for the next question and it read so you rehab that and you keep this process up and if you do it well you all of sudden will have this sitting there looking at an fn go ahead dead simple now the fellow lives 50 or 100 years later and hes got high ta see you could ask him again what has been overrun if the question reads there will be one two three items that have been overrun and you rehab each one and youve got it made in other words all that is is method of finding areas to rehab and its process not list get the difference alright now in sequence there are two key processes 1 valence shifter the valence shifter what valence or identity would be safe all right list to one item bong because you want to list it down to the bottom of the pile and bongo which is followed by question what can you confront which is process now you can actually write down these whatcanyouconfronts and sooner or later the guys going to bd on something and sooner or later some wiseacre is going to tell us that all processes should be listed now hear hear good and clean hear very straight if you list question which is not one item question and bypass the reads on the items without handling them you pack the case up youll pack the case up as neat as anything you ever packed up so if you ever see on an auditing report form if you ever see on worksheet what has been overrun with item item blank blank item you know reading item reading item reading bd and you just see it there and you look back on the worksheet and you find none of them have been handled the weird part of it is the case will have tendency then to be packed up it is not something you do and correct because youre trying to be pedantic trying to be the villain of the piece who says all the commas must be in the right place youll find that the case is now packed up so somebody has got to go back over it again thats why you must always teach your auditors always to mark the falls and bds dont let them make bunch of stuff without and you know i see most of the worksheets i see these days have falls or bds marked on them there is sf for small fall f for fall ah lf for long fall you cant distinguish and doing cs work is very difficult its trick to writing these things down now you would just see horror of horrors what has been overrun some type of process of that particular character which is really just process and if you were to see that listed with falls after it and the thing wasnt even nulled youre not really in trouble you would actually put in on the listing question on what has been overrun has anything been suppressed anything been invalidated put them in very lightly youre going to get lot of read out of it ah very good read the first question on this has anything been suppressed woof fall good rehab it in other words you have to unsuppress the list and get each one of them rehabbed get what the proper repair action is this is one of the vicious ones that can come your way it already happened couple of times you say use what has been overrun list what has been overrun and handle each reading item as it reads and the auditor comes along and he runs little list it is list being well trained its list and he doesnt even mark the reads and hes listed it he didnt do anything with it now what im warning you of is liable to have packed up the case at that exact instant youre going to have trouble with the case now wasnt rehabbed because every single one of those is restimulated bypassed charge it was listed wasnt handled now on sooner or later some auditor is going to make this list hes going to find an item it is going to blow down it is going to go fn and hes got it made and from that hes going to move over into the thing that every process should be listed so i make it loud and clear to you that there are two types of questions one is simply process and you write down the answers and it does look like list but its not list under the heading of listing and nulling its not legitimate question and under that heading can come any question that reads an absolute infinity of questions you can actually as cs dream them up if they read great but thats how youd have to do it each one of them has to be handled because they are not legitimate questions not legitimate lists an infinity of it now you sometimes do this very lightly to find information from the case lets give you an example where where you are trying actually you are actually trying to find out why this fellow has an invisible field he somehow or another by some mystery has wound up at about 5 or 6 ot and hes got an invisible field well he cant see anything youve got blind thetan or something now you can actually undertake this as an as an action its merely an exploratory action you can ask the auditor to list what it is regarding this invisible field what is it laughter now you hold pistol at the auditors head on this you say falls small falls long falls bds for gods sake mark them down boy mark them down its an illegitimate list dont you see but its still alright its handled like what has been overrun it isnt one thing and it never will be one thing its always composite now you get into trouble this way by thinking in this framework the magic button ive lived in the atmosphere of this god damned nonexistent magic button since 1950 there is one thing wrong with the org there is one thing wrong with the case now what would you do as to all other considerations look for this one magic thing in 1950 it was the fellow who was supposed to be shot in the gluttonous maximus by biochemical thing which made him at once clear and which we would by now be rehabbing like crazy so we could get on with it laughter i dont know if anybody here remembers those days but there was great deal of discussion in those days concerning the fact that there ought to be some chemical which one would load up into syringe and the word one shot clear became current but it was actually sarcastic word but people listened for this button and for quite while i researched on this basis so actually ive given time to this idea and i can absolutely assure you completely and 100 that there is magic single button for instance the lrh comm ww was looking through policy letters the other day he said something is wrong something is wrong and therefore it must be contained in policy well alright undoubtedly true within limit and so therefore im going to read all of these policy letters and applying it out and all of sudden he found out that it says that an organization which has undergone period of interiorization heavy traffic internal heavy traffic internal will shortly after that go into slump heavy internal traffic is followed by slump naturally its interiorized and isnt handling outside so it goes into slump you probably remember the policy letter anyway he found this policy letter and he promptly started applying it and got people to promote and just dropped the idea of internal this and that and the other thing and he said lets just have at it and lets do this exteriorization action and im sure theyll make it 4 or 5 weeks from now well have them coming up the line but he should he was looking for magic button magic single button well the reason he came down to looking for the magic single button which would resolve the case at that particular instance is because great many buttons had been very neglected for very long time now at any given whatwhat deludes you in this is at any given instant there is magic button see at any given instant there is magic button which when handled changes to another magic button laugh you do that in putting in the rudiments when youre putting in the rudiments the single magic button on the case arc break the single magic button now is ptp the single magic button would be missed withhold do you get the idea and actually going up the grades each grade is the next magic button they are magic buttons alright but they are not just one button there is button there will never be button i can assure you there will never be button which pressed with great expertise will suddenly blow person to ot 8 from insane asylum or wog there is such thing and the reason there isnt such thing is because awareness is gradient its what he becomes aware of now maybe you can shorten this gradient down to an hour but it would still be not one button it would have to be whole series of buttons in this hour ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba do you get it and youd have to know what button to push at any given instant in that hour in order to clean that thing up do you see so the one button to hell with it you can say well i know the button yes yes i know of button the guy is just mocking up his bank and if you could get that and work on that he could be convinced of that why naturally then the whole bank would blow and he would be clear obvious so there is one button well in the first place right above that there are whole lot of body thetans who also have the same consideration only unfortunately they have the consideration they are him when they are not and unfortunately above that at 7 he will discover that there is another whole row of aberration as matter of fact there are about 6 of them quite in addition to pictures laugh so you see even that doesnt turn out to be one button hes clear alright great great hasnt got any pictures fine now he goes up to iii and he gets rid of all his body thetans so he hasnt got any body thetans and so on he can mock up pictures and not mock up pictures hes in beautiful condition iv is all straightened out res all rehabbed and so forth and he suddenly begins to ask the question why am i not 9 feet tall yet i was 9 feet tall on thursday and i as only 2 inches tall on fridaylaughter why is that well there are 6 or 7 more things that are wrong with him and theyre contained in the upper line of 7 and 8 im not trying to make mystery out of these things and say oh well you find these things when you get to 7 and 8 there are things like postulates and theres things like interpersonal relationships theres things like the interrelationship with life itself theres on 8 there is who made this damned stuff laughter who made it and also who didnt want him to laughter do you see there are things like this is somebody standing around holding it there and mocking keeping it mocked up laughter you can get lot of questions come up the resolutions of these questions and so on are all thats wrong with thetan now lets get back to where we started here do you have some idea now that the listing and nulling laws apply to legitimate listing questions now there possibly could be more legitimate listing questions than the 7 or 8 which are already there i dont say that some of these would not list to one item but if they list to one item its because youre asking for the mostest or the bestest or the biggestest do you get it who is the biggest watermelon laughter what is the biggest planet you have ever been on one item question obviously because you asked for it and that would determine it to that degree but there are little row of them which dont have the biggest and mostest they just come out to one item and unless they come out to one item cut the pc throat itd be kinder now the questions of va oddly enough are so centrally located with regard to the pcs mind and beingness what have you got youve got persons places and subjects wow and the funny part of it is that you could probably carry them on and on you could probably get some other reads you could probably do this and that and they are so centralized in the field of aberration that they actually you could count on the first bd being the item on the list so that you can cut it short but do you realize that that doesnt disobey the laws of listing and nulling on centralized question like that the first bd is it on the list take it the weird point about it is when you go back to rehab va the minute you go back to rehab va providing the auditor marked the bd which bdd you know he didnt do which bdd really but then wrote down b and put the bd after b he could make some goofy error like this but you go back and repair these va and its very very peculiar youll find out its the first blowing down item now you say well that therefore must be law of all listing it doesnt have to be list of sds it doesnt have to apply to sds so its still the one reading item on the list so please differentiate that in va you are just being given fast route which still follows the laws of listing it isnt special case it just happens that va follows the rules of listing all the rules of listing occur on the first bd bong thats all its peculiar and youll find on some sds that its not true so what ive given you youll see in va its this peculiarity its the first bd now you can look on va list and you can see that he took the second bd and it inevitably will be wrong item so its not correct its the second bd you look on an sd list and youll find the third bd reading is the correct item insufficiently central to the intelligence of the being you see unclear youve listed here over on the fringes and he blew some charge here and he blew some charge there and he blew if you say persons places what the hell man youre going right up against the substance of 7 and 8 bongo bongo dead on and the person says oh yeah because hes sitting right there its just peculiarity so that is simply given to you in an effort to let you get it done in hurry and other significance than that so dont lean on it all over the place and run up big ridge now where an individual is rehabbed on va you always carefully do the whole job you null the whole list to see if it has to be extended in any way why the pc thought of something else when he was listing he didnt have the listing question this that there is goofy outness here see the pc was still thinking about something all of sudden something else distracted his attention and he thought oh well what the hell i mean weve got to get this session through with here ive got to meet my wife or something you know attention came off the session he got bd something goofy like this there is way you can prevent this except by being an auditor what the hell are you doing auditing so up to well what were you doing auditing pc who had to meet his wife ive never audited pc who had to go out and meet his wife at 4 oclock oh not now i want to put in realityfactor here we gonna run waffle waffle waffle waffle im going to run resistive case list on you thats hell of gag boy thats real scum didnt this auditor ever hear about the fact that he had to be in arc with the pc one of the reasons the fellow runs the resistive case list he can run resistive case list on somebody who is just momentarily hung up and find out what it is he still falls in these categories the guy was sick on thursday must do an assessment on the thing it says he is physically ill thats it so the net result the net result when guy gets the rfactor hes liable to tell you something like ja ja ja ja ja ja you know funny attitude this guy must be in hell of rush ask the guy you were rushed on anything oh yes yes i have to meet my wife at 4 oclock good before we start this session actually i want you to get out on the telephone and call her oh im sorry you cant shes driving around in the car now good alright ill tell you what at the risk of upsetting you and so forth ah were going to have this session this evening be back here this evening why why its perfectly alright with i can suppress this while youre auditing laughter this is all part of making the pc fly you see you actually could have spent time have you had food have you had sleep do you have to go any place and so forth except this is so god damned pianola and play it by dropping the penny in the machine and so forth that it is damned bore as they are currently saying and theyll be saying something else in the future sometime it is drag laughter its waste of time ah therefore therefore you immediately assume that your pc is in one of two conditions to be audited which is he set up to be audited or he aint laughter and of the he aint there are two categories the ones the auditor can repair and the ones he cant well im very sorry im in an awful rush i have an appointment with physician to have my leg sawed off at 4 oclock laughter actually there is something an auditor can do about that you can say go and call him up and cancel it huh why should i do that well one of the reasons is im auditing you mixed practices laughter so therefore process can be written down and look like list and there is thing called list which you then list now as we look into this with more intimacy we find that the definition of complete list is list which hag only one reading item on the list oh yes you know all about that of course the other items that just tick they wouldnt do many exceptions to this rule ah the ah the list which we null with out ruds has long falls on various items there arent any exceptions to it none none none that is list and this is brought forward for this remarkable reason that the auditors in 1962 in 63 used to come around and ask all the time how many items should be on the list how many items should be on the list should list be four items what is full list should it be two items three items four items twenty items you have to give it some sort of figure youre asking some balderdash question like how long is rope and its as long as there is complete item on it now i have seen some pretty damned long lists i have seen list go two or three pages before the item fell out of the hamper that sounds incredible and it is almost incredible it happens damned rarely but it does happen so you see some auditor he says well lets see ive gotten down to the bottom of the first page and somebody is liable to be very upset indeed if i go on listing page after page ive been shot for it in the past and i dont have any item yet so it must be dead horse listen did the question read the list wont deadhorse listing question which read will ever deadhorse because the only reason dead horse deadhorses is the listing question did not read laughter if the question read you get an item and ive actually seen very recently folder in which there was reading listing question and then after listing half page the auditor decided it must be dead horse because all the items up to that point did not now read two or three of them had read so what was he doing he was auditing one of these wide things do you know that the pcs attention goes way out and comes way in and goes way out and comes way in cyclically theres certain test research processes you can run and he starts talking about this see hell say the table the chair the clock there the bureau the glass of water the room wall that duck over there america that star the sea in the galaxy yes yes yes the galaxy the star that other star of the planet of the moon that range of hills the the tongue there the floor you can watch his answers they go out and they go in hes buttered around the place do you follow and if he is really dead in and he wasnt really right to recognize there was anything like this and the list is being listed just little bit soon on his case should we say ah it read its going to be long list and you read it and you null it and if the question read then one of two things is true the items are suppressed which is easy to do because you null it with suppress or the list is incomplete and i actually have four little questions that you can ask and you have them on bulletin writeup it most usually the first item on the list on long list thats always the figure the candidate that has been bypassed is the first item that most frequent the second item comes in little bit behind the first item and the list is incomplete or the list is suppressed theres certain various positive things that are wrong with lists you can take these laws of listing and make list of the laws of listing for assessment and go down the case with each one and you would eventually find every damned reason one assumes that standard is in before he does the laws of listing so you would have to put on that something like was it listed with out ruds to make it complete assessment form i would just check on that to make an assessment form on this you would have to put was it listed over out ruds and for the uninitiated you would have to list the ruds that could have been out while the listing was going on or which were now out and then you would have total which was more or less known anyhow but these laws of listing could be added up do you see how you could do that you can take any of the materials of standard tech and list them out and ask questions of it and work them this way and work them that way because what you are doing its the difference between mechanic using screw driver and pair of pliers you know he uses screw driver and he uses pair of pliers well he sure can use them in numerous ways got the laws of listing there are probably dozen ways you could use these lists all right complete list theres all there is about complete list because thats what it is but remember by the word list here we mean from an authentic reading listing question two the ta rising means the list is being overlisted its too long inevitable and invariable rising ta inevitably means that something has been done too long and so on sometimes with suppressive and so on you will see ta rise youll see suppressive ta rise and you say aha thats variation from the laws of listing because look at that its been stuck high ta and it has come down like mad when we all of sudden got this suppressive oh oh oh oh im not trying to make myself right it was simply an overrun he was an overrun was around far too long laughter one of the reactions of suppressing are incomplete cycles of action and overrun on cycle of action to handle the handled is also very suppressive you got floor all clean somebody comes along tells you to clean up the floor suppressive cleans cleans its one of the characteristics it doesnt make somebody who cleans clean suppressive but he invariably does this hes got the house is all painted its all finished just getting ready to put away the paint brushes the suppressive comes along and says look at that youd better get to work on that hasnt been painted well enough go on and paint the house hell also come along with only one wall half painted and say you will have to rake the garden now but different suppressives they are in the overrun or in the incomplete so youve found suppressive is overrunning something also you will find that the subject of this suppression is an overrun it is not violation of this but once in while youll find an sd is the reason of high ta once in while and then you sit very mysterious but of course its quite obvious that the person needs an sd hes sick pts and so forth you just happen to give him an sd and you happen to see the ta go down you wouldnt necessarily always order an sd because some bodys ta was high do you follow it doesnt work now ta rising while youre doing list it means its overlisted and boy you can catch that right now right now right now right now it was the second item it starts to rise on the third item you can catch it right now just like that pow pow because you see rising ta is first signaled by needle going from right to left instead of left to right now its true that there is little bump that person can go across little bump he can go across and you said jinx and you had surge and then you said brown and it sort of rises little bit you know the needle return to position and then it says balderdash and goes bbblumsp you got it so it isnt the first tiny little bit of motion of the needle and when that thing is going up the pc starts to think there are other things that go along with it he starts to comm lag the needle starts going over to the left and youve already you have forecast of the fact that you are just about to overlist this is forecasted now if you did this if you did this if you nulled the first three items and it was starting to apparently rise on the fourth and it did the first three items and then having done the first three items it looked like it was rising you went back and nulled the first three items you got in suppress on the first item and on the second item and you still didnt have an item you go on listing do you understand and if the ta now really started up like surge you would go back and examine that first item again do you see hes done something we had an example we had person of another nationality and he was given an sd and he put the item on the list which by the way some sessions later came up but he put the item on the list and then he thought oh my god thats not socially acceptable and he bang and boy nobody could persuade him to let that item read again in america such an item would be mother do you see you wouldnt dare put lot lot of areas wouldnt dare put the word mother on the list in italy it would be priest you know father giuseppee laughter has anything been unmocked yes who or what has tried to unmock you see youre asking anything tried to unmock you right away this is what communicates you know hes asking himself has anything been unmocked anything uncocked father giuseppe aha oh laughter cant give it to him now you do give it to him he is now all in the middle of guilt hell give the manifestation of you having found the wrong item but only visually the way to really get him in trouble is to continue with little bit further and really give him wrong item you let him struggle with that one very often you give the pc wrong item he struggles with it but you can give him right item which he struggles with its whether or not it obeys the rules of listing it obeys the rules of listing thats his item father guiseppi thats it pooh oh oh oh yes yes i guess thats it laughter hell come right straight through it you see alright number three list can be underlisted in which case nothing can be found on nulling the question read the question read you listed list nothing is suppressed two or three items read as you listed it incomplete list nothing read so extend it you put little bar over here and mark extended dont ever you or let your auditors get into position or habit of extending list without marking bar over to the left of the list saying ext and if you ever extend later list later extend an early list is what i mean why say ext with the current date so somebody knows its been repaired now if after session the ta is still high or goes up wrong item has been found and that can happen between the session and the environ and the examiner he left the session having done remedy b he left the session and his ta was at 2 and he arrives at the examiner with his ta at 475 to give you an extreme example you dont have to ask any questions about it whatsoever you just say wrong item back to session or you say examine the list now remember that it was always wisest when you have direct evidence of an incorrect list to get the list corrected before you binglebungle around with ruds because it is the out rud so this can happen couple of days later only it doesnt show up as high ta it shows up as his face went solid yeah i have some pressure on my face or something of this character unclear i was all right after the session i was sure it was and your correct action is then go back and have the list corrected its wrong item wrong item wrong item another evidence particularly on va he got in ethics trouble within very short time afterwards 48 hours something like that he finds himself in ethics ah the he finds himself in the hands of the medical officer now you might run into some firefight like i ran into one time whereby the galley was busy feeding badly in an unsanitary area and whole bunch of crew members came down epidemically at the same time i was getting some auditing accomplished with those guys and laughter and now we had to disentangle what this was all about were they being super suppressed all of sudden had mad team walked in on the scene what had happened what had happened well all that had happened was somebody had fed them rotten meat laugh but it sure made one wonder now the funny part of it is the guy who had fed them the rotten meat had had three wrong items on power just 48 hours before he knowingly fed them rotten meat laughter now you say i was looking all over the place to find the wrong items well i found the wrong items i found the guylaughter thats how far it can go now if the pc says it is wrong item it is wrong item now the trouble with that is is this father guiseppi thing that i just said so the pc is saying ah i dont think that is my item i dont think that is my item i dont think that is my item all the rules of listing say it is his item what are you going to do interesting question what are you going to do alright we leave it at that laughter im not going to solve all your problems laughter but this is true if he says it is wrong item it is wrong item in the first place he is going to go around worrying about the catholic church to such degree that hes going to spin in if you give him father giuseppi i will solve it for you there is nothing to it actually ah you ask him just discuss this item with i m not trying to force it on you you dont have to have this item you just dont have to have this item anything been suppressed and so forth on it invalidated and so forth oh i sure invalidated it oh wow laughter now where do you put those auditing reports normally laughter hes landed up with problem hasnt he well if you force the item on him against that sort of thing and so forth as far as he is concerned its wrong item hell come around to it being right item if you just acknowledge it you say it says here that father giuseppe is your item it couldnt possibly be all right thank you very much now do you say it is too your item laughter on six the question must be checked and must read as question before it is listed an item listed from an unreading question would give you deadhorse and thats all you always listed but let tell you something it could be false read or suppressed read now person who is being suppressed suppresses the suppressed do you see he is suppressing suppressed because he is dramatizing being suppressed and suppressed reads when you say lightly with gay heart ah is it withdrawn from is it stop or is it unmocked most of the time youll get away with it but the reason this guy is pts he is upset he is sick ah he is this he is that there is every reason in the world but boy this guy is pts and remember that the whole subject can be this wsu will normally shine outside of the question and you normally can get your read on it and it says u unmock so you say who or what and you can check it is trying to unmock you some guys who are bit blue only react to who is trying to unmock you its current situation who or what has tried to unmock you if it attempted to unmock you that sense of the question does not reach them so you have to test the question get suppress in on it and you suddenly see it reading make sure it isnt false read in other words you handle this its got to be handlable thing but if even after you handle it still doesnt read and then you knuckelheadedly go list it boy you want to have your own head examined because itll give you deadhorse every tome deadhorse proceeds from nonreading question and that is the reason for dead horse and an auditor who does not check the listing question before he lists it is knucklehead now if the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling the item is suppressed or invalidated yes so true so true now one that cures that comes in number eight on suppressed list it must be nulled with suppressed on balderdash has anything been suppressed and then you dont say the item because of course the read on suppression transfers to suppress so if the item is going to read itll read on suppress anyhow and now youve cleaned up suppress so you know the thing is going to read now an invalidated item reads on invalidate suppressed item reads on suppressed and the odd part of it is that it reads the exact amount on suppress or invalidated that it reads itself on the item the reads transfers as to the exact right item its going to read on the list on ragbags has anything been suppressed boom you should try it out few times just to see what the hell happened and all of sudden youre totally relaxed you say ragbags itll read the same read exactly that you just got on suppressed exactly same length same everything its one of the miraculous little things its the wildest thing i ever saw in my life when i saw it the exact read with the same hitch the same level the same unclear its exact and you can transfer it off to suppress transfer suppress it and now suppress will read you can clean it up suppress it again read it under the suppress once more the suppress now reads you clean it up bring it back make the item read again its the wildest thing you ever saw in your life so it is one of the methods of identifying the item is it the item that was suppressed does it read like the suppressed read so then youd say on balderdash has anything been suppressed well you know its going to be it so you do it but to hell with it supposing you wanted to check this thing out you say balderdash did it read the same as suppressed one of the ways of checking it very cute its identical identical read now on an item that is suppressed or invalidated the read will transfer exactly from the item to the button and when the button is gotten in the item will again read just as i told you every once in while you see some auditor say on balderdash has anything been suppressed all right thank you very much thats your item when you are nulling you just say on balderdash has anything been suppressed read when youve got the item say the item and then the its read will come off otherwise its read will stay on it youve got to say the item again on balderdash has anything been suppressed on ragbags has anything been suppressed on bong balderdash is the only reading item on the list you say good balderdash there is your read all right you say your item is balderdash now an item from an overlisted list is often suppressed the damnedest thing you ever saw in your life if you see an 89 page list some knucklehead has done in kyokak for christs sake know that the item is probably the first or second item on the list laughter on occasion when you pass the item in nulling all subsequent items will read to point where everything on the list will then read in this case take the first read take the first which read on the first nulling so so this idea of slant slant slant slant or x x x x come off of it dont do that dont do that its sf f lfbd say what the read was so as youre coming down you read the first item on the list unclear ah balderdash topsat oh wait minute what the hell is this catterwamps that was lf balderdash sf chipmunks f catnip f unclear f what the hell is going on here well whats going on here is youre carrying the read of the first item right on down in the list if you keep doing this youre going to be in hell of mess in fact i dont know of good method of separating out this awful mess now an underlisted and overlisted list will arc break the pc and he may refuse to be audited until the list is corrected and may become furious with the auditor and will remain so until it is corrected hell also become sad hell also get other manifestations of arc break overlisted and underlisted an incorrect list is something is the first thing you correct for straightening up the case listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an arc break without handling the arc break such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put the pc into sad effect and that is so true just what it says because it is the same as an arc break longduration arc break that is audited over top of will bring about sad effect fourteen pc whose attention is on something else wont list easily you list and null only with the rudiments in on the pc thats where you would put it doing list you would have to expand that question as i was inferring you would have to say you know while you were being listed you know did you have pts mwh ah an auditor whose trs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items oh so true now if you wanted to send every item to the examiner to be checked to make sure it was the right item it would simply be stating this every auditor i have has outtrs we are not sure that the person went release on the process he was run on the analogous statement is none of our auditors have their trs in when trs are out things go release and do various weird cooky things that they shouldnt but when we say trs are out god its got to be awfully damned bad its something that you would break down and cry over the auditor is sitting there eating candy and the pc is looking out the window more or less self auditing and the auditor is reading newspaper between questions itd really be corny see for this to happen listing and nulling errors in presence of auditors code violations can unstabilize pc believe you take pc who is not been fed or something like this or has not had enough sleep etc and you insist on listing and you carry the list over and its already difficult to audit and you shouldnt be listing at that time anyhow can unstabilize guy he he can feel like he is absolutely spinning for day two days three days four days woof now the lack of specific listing question or an incorrect nonstandard listing question which doesnt really call for an item would give you more than one item reading on list sometimes you see list which has lots of items reading on it for christs sake go back and look at the listing question and it could say are tractors necessary laughter dont get so obsessed that you think only one thing will read on that list everything under gods green earth will read on it you cease listing and nulling actions when floating needle appears and this is perfectly true you cease listing and nulling actions when floating needle appears you dont cease auditing do you get the nuance of that laughter it means what it says now always give the pc hit item and circle it plainly on the list wait wait wait minute thats auditing past listing and boy youd better his fn will pack right up pc go around what was my item what was my item what was my item see the bank freezes before the pc speaks so it probably went fn before he gave you the item you see he thought ragbags fn and then he says ragbags and you write it down see there it is sometimes when you are nulling snaps fingers you get your fn now if you just sit there blankly the pc is going to go into mystery so you always give the pc his item and twenty listing and nulling are highly precise auditing actions and if not done exactly by the laws may bring about down tone and slow gain case but if done correctly exactly by the laws and with good auditing in general will produce the highest gains attainable note there are variations or exceptions to the above it does not alter va power procedure people think sometimes this alters it or theyre different im just i already told you why and ethics should be put in where these laws are violated an auditor who isnt convinced of something you should list him on some question insists it goes to one item particularly if the question doesnt read what tractors are sick laughter went into 89 pages and insist there is an item thats too gruesome i know you cant confront it i wouldnt be able to confront it either im sure youll all do these laws correctly and im sure use blackjack on those people regard these laws of listing and nulling far too lightly far far far too lightly they are very important and with the auditors code are the most important errors that can be made as far as case effects are concerned so they are not to be regarded lightly you dont list list and then dont null it you dont muck about with listing and nulling you dont let an auditor list and null for you as case supervisor that you are very doubtful of you got it you make him itsa or something got it yes help you out little bit yes all right thank you very much applause
