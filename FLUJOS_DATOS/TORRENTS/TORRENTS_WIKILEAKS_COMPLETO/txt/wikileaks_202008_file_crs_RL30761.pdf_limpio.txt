divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761hiv1aids and military manpower policy summary in octob er 1985 the department of defense dod began screening all applicants for military service for human immunodeficiency virus1 or hiv1 such screening was controversial since then dod has taken other actions and issued guidlelines on various aspects of its aids policy which have been carefully watched and scrutinized by congress and other federal and state agencies because of their groundbreaking nature this report examines aspects of dod policy on hiv1aids and legislation introduced to modify this policy under current dod policy applicants who test positive for hiv1 infection are not eligible for enlistment or appointment to the military this policy also sets guidelines on the assignment of military personnel with hiv1 infection disease surveillance and health education retention separation safety of the blood supply and limitations on the use of information in recent years legislation has been introduced calling for the military separation of hiv1positive personnel however these efforts have not been successful the most recent developm ent is that legislation in the fy2001 defense appropriations act earmarks 10 million in defense funding to help address the problem of hiv 1aids in africa the ongoing debate on hiv1aids and military manpower policy includes the following issues first although hiv1 testing procedures have remained largely the same opponents have suggested that the president should terminate testing second concerns exist over the career implications for personnel who test positive for hiv1 these include providing information concerning the source of the infection assignment limitations and the separation or retention of service members who test positive for hiv1 third aids could be expected to strain the military health care system only if the rate of infection significantly increases aids is an expensive illness to treat however so far the services have not incurred major economic impacts from the disease fourth although dod took an early lead in medical research on aids this role has been questioned proponents of continued dod role cite dods ability to cond uct extensive and controlled tests but opponents argue that dod clinical studies are redundant and wasteful fifth dod works to protect military personnel and dependents from hiv 1 infection through testing screening blood supplies and developing educational initiatives if in the future dod approaches this issue from simply readiness perspective protection of personnel might include the separation of infected service members such separations may have an effect on the members access to health care and future income sixth current policy states that hiv1positive service members are not deployable overseas were proposed legislation enacted to separate hiv1positive personnel it would only marginally affect the number available for

looks at the issues raised concerning this policy finally this report considers the legislative efforts to modify this policy included in this consideration is the recent decision to utilize dod funds to address the issue of hiv1aids in countries in africa background in october 1985 dod began testing all recruits entering the armed services for evidence of infection with hiv1 human immunodeficiency virus1 although the term hiv is also used hiv1 will be used for purposes of clarity in addition to testing all recruits the services began testing those personnel already serving dod has established other policies regarding hiv1 and military personnel these include restricting the deployment of infected personnel overseas cushioning the effects of such an infection may have on the careers of military personnel and providing adequate care for personnel suffering from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome more commonly known as aids in these efforts dod has created one of the most extensive and comprehensive policies dealing with aids infection early congressional interest on the subject of hiv1aids in the military concentrated on the need for effective preventative measures and was characterized by an approach seeking to balance the needs of the individual and the needs of the service when individuals became hiv1positive while on active duty this included allowing them to remain on active duty with restrictions on their deployabi lity that some have characterized as detrimental to readiness httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs2 2 centers for disease control prevention

sexually or through the exposur to blood or blood products eg transfusions or sharing syringes and is generally fatal aids in the united states has been found to be concentrated in certain groups particularly male homosexuals and intravenous drug users approximately 86 of all aids cases reported through 1999 male homosexuals andor iv drug users account for 78 of the cumulative total of all aids cases as of 19992 concern exists however that the incidence of aids spreading through heterosexual contact may rise dramatically although aids is increasing among women the greatest increase in the incidence of aids is among the minority population in general hiv1aids and the military in 1995 the department of defense reported to counter the threat of hiv to our military forces in fiscal year fy 1986 dod initiated research program to prevent infection eg vaccine development and monitor the spread of hiv infection in military forces the impact of mandatory testing has resulted in progressive reduction in the rate of hiv infection in applicants to military service as can be seen in tables 1 and 2 this rate reduction is most likely due to the growing knowledge among the applicant pool about the testing policy and the exclusion criteria for illicit drug use as well as hiv positive status since 1986 there have been 9473 positive hiv infected persons across all dod categories of personnel active duty reserve etc of those 804 are deceased over 35 millio n civilian applicants for military service have been screened and over 3860 infected applicants have been excluded from military service as of june 15 1995 1128 active duty members were infected with hiv the rate per 1000 has steadily decreased from 283 19851987 to 07 1995 this drastic reduction in hiv

department of defense the ability to apply largerscale medical surveillance and treatment has made the military an institution within which larger health and social policies are often developed and tested the most recent department of defense policy on hiv 1aids is embodied in directive of march 19 1991 as modified 4 the following represents summary of its provisions the language in italics is quoted from the 1991 dod directive 1 deny eligib ility for appointment or enlistment for military service to individuals with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection under this policy all personnel entering the military are screened for evidence of the presence of the aids virus that is for serological evidence of hiv1 infection using the comme rcial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa serological test if the elisa outcome is positive the elisa is repeated and second more precise immunoelectrophoresis test known as western blot is conducted if found to have tested positive on two elisa tests and the western blot test the individual is not eligible for appointment or enlistment for military service under testing conditions an individual is tested using the elisa if the first elisa is positive and the second is negative third elisa is conducted the outcome of the third elisa will be used to determine if the western blot test is indicated personnel may enter the military through variety of channels including enlistment and various officer training programs reserve officer training corps rotc the armed forces health professions scholarship program the service academies and direct appointment of various specialists such as judge advocate general legal officer programs in each of these individuals undergo screening process if positive hiv1 serologic test is in evidence the individual is simply released or separated from the program 2 screen active duty ad and reserve component military personnel periodically for serologic evidence of hiv1 infection with approximately 137 million personnel on active duty deployed worldwide and 135 million selected reservists and standby reservists in the united states5 it is virtually impossible to test all military personnel at particular time or in particular location after initial testing the services retest each active duty member at least once every 2 years certain individuals those subject to overseas deployment or working in certain medical specialties may be tested more frequently on july 8 1996 army officials reported that army reserve and army national guard membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs5 6 patterson kristin soldiers now to be screened for hiv once every five years army times july 8 1996 24 7 according to 10 united states code 10151 the standby reserve consists of those units or members or both of the reserve components other than those in the ready reserve or retired continuednot serving on extended active duty will be retested every 5 years6 this change in policy was implemented on july 1 1996 individuals who are eligible to receive military health care spouses and dependents of activeduty personnel for example and who are at risk through sexual contact with infected persons hiv1exposed women with newborn children users of contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia and so on are to be notified of their potential exposure in addition to notifying the potentially exposed beneficiaries of the military health care system the spouses of infected reserve component personnel are notified either through military health care providers or through local public health authorities the names of those not eligible for military health care services will be provided to the appropriate civilian health authorities unless such notification is prohibited by civilian ordinance 3 refer ad personnel with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection for medical evaluation of fitness for continued service in the same manner as personnel with other progressive illnesses medical evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the standard clinical protocol individuals with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection who are fit for duty shall not be retired or separated solely on the basis of serologic evidence of hiv1 infection ad personnel with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection or who are elisa repeatedly reactive but wb western blot negative or indeterminate shall be advised to refrain from donating blood under this policy activeduty personnel with evidence of hiv1 infection who are found otherwise fit for duty in accordance with military medical standards are eligible for continued service in the armed forces in this respect such individuals are treated the same as others with evidence of other progressive illnesses such as cancer that is in remission and does not inhibit or restrict the service member from performing his or her normal military duties under this policy personnel with evidence of hiv1 infection without evidence of physical or neurological impairment will not be separated from the service solely on the basis of such evidence of hiv1 infection 4 deny eligibility for extended ad duty for period of more than 30 days to those reserve component members with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection except under conditions of mobilization and on the decision of the secretary of the military department concerned reserve component members who are not on extended ad or who are not on extended fulltime national guard duty and who show serologic evidence of hiv1 infection shall be transferred involuntarily to the standby reserve only if they cannot be utilized in the selected reserve reserve component personnel including members of the national guard who evidence hiv1 infection are not eligible for extended active duty ie periods greater than 30 days with limited exceptions reserve component personnel not serving on extended duty will be involuntarily transferred to the standby reserve7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs6 7 continued reserve who are liable for active duty only as provided for in sections 12301 and 12306 of this title in practice the standby reserve contains those reservists who have temporary disability or hardship and those who hold key defense related positions in their civilian jobs which limit their mobilization potential in the standby reserves reservists are not required to participate in training and are subjection to involuntary activation mobilization only in case of full mobilization under current conditions full mobilization can only occur when congress declares war or national emergency due to restrictions on the mobilization of reserve manpower in the absence of such declaration 8 medical evaluation under standard protocol needs to be conducted annually with tcell evaluations every six months for those infected the medical assessment must include an epidemiological assessment history of physical neurological and neuropsy chological exams relevant blood and lymphocyte counts including t lymphocyte cell count and absolute cd4 an cd8 levels intradermal skin tests hiv 1 elisa confi rmation and chest xray in addition the medical workup shall include evaluations for other sexually transmitted diseas blood samples shall be maintained for at least 3 years at minus seventy 70 degrees celsius finally mental health assessment must be conducted as specified for illness or behavioral indications associated with hiv1 infection the infected individual must be classified according to the stage of the infection as defined in the armed forces hiv1 disease classification and the information must be recorded according to codes used in the international classification of disease 9th revision clinical modification

with hiv1 at the time of enlistment are subject to discharge for erroneous enlistmentonly if they canno t be assigned to the selected reserve in accordance with current regulations 5 retire or separate ad or reserve service members infected with hiv1 who are determined to be unfit for further duty the 1991 dod directive covers several situations first those hiv1infected activeduty personnel who are determined to be unfit for duty will be separated or retired second certain infected personnel who are found not to have complied with lawfully ordered preventive medicine procedur such as refraining from certain highrisk behavior may be subjected to disciplinary action including separation if appropriate third the secretary of the military department concerned under plenary authority may separate an infected member at the members request fourth reserve members with serologic evidence of hiv1 infection may be transferred to the standby reserve or separated when they fail to provide from their civilian physician an evaluation conforming to standard clinical protocol as directed by dod8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs7 6 ensure the safety of the blood supply through policies of the armed services blood program office the fda guidelines and the accreditation requirements of the american association of blood banks protecting the blood supply or health of potential donors and recipients ie service members is of critical importance to dod and therefore central issue combat or combatrelated injuries espec ially during major battles require large supplies of blood for transfusions the need for screening the blood supply is therefore critical in certain cases battlefield transfusions may be required protecting this blood supply is an important rationale behind dod policy one result of this policy is that hiv1 infected servi ce personnel will not be assigned to units subject to deployments outside the united states 7 comply with applicable statutory limitations on the use of information obtained from service member during or as result of an epidemiologic assessment interview and the results obtained from laboratory tests for hiv1 information gained as result of testing may not be used as the sole basis for an adverse administrative action however these results may be used for other purposes consistent with dod regulations or directives that pertain to separation for disability reasons for example control of the blood supply or under federal or military rules of evidence or the rules of evidence of state under specific circumstances these circumstances include the failure to follow preventive medical procedures or orders as part of criminal prosecution in which evidence of hiv1 infection is an element of proof of an offense charged or proper ancillary matter in relevant legal procee ding eg member convicted of rape after being informed of an hiv1 infection 8 control transmission of hiv1 through an aggressive disease surveillance and health education program aggressive disease surveillance includes the perio dic retesting of all military personnel active duty personnel who show evidence of serologic infection receive medical evaluation under established protocol to determine the status of the infection and duty fitness reserve component personnel who are ineligible for military medical care are counseled on the significance of positive test result and referred to their private physician for further care and counseling in terms of health education reduction of the rates of occurrence of hiv1 in military personnel and other health care beneficiaries is the goal to this end dod provides testing information education and behavior modification programs to limit or prevent the spread of hiv1 these programs are explicitly targeted to those who are infected or who are at high risk for infection 9 provide education and voluntary hiv1 serologic screening for dod health care beneficiaries other than service members education and voluntary testing are carried out in those instances where information is received by an appropriate authority that military health care beneficiary such as spouse may be at risk individuals with serologic evidence ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs8 9 us department of defense directive march 19 1991 35hiv1 infection receive appropriate testing counseling and education particularly with regard to minimizing the potential for spreading the infection an epidemiol ogical investigation is conducted to determine the source of the infection as well as the potential for exposure to others via blood banks sexual relations and drug paraphernalia for example as appropriate information obtained as result of an epidemiologic assessment will be provided to local health care authorities in compliance with the provisio ns of the privacy act of 1974 which regulates government recordkeeping and disclosure practices finally disease reporting is conducted consistent with the provision of the directive through liaison between the military public health authorities and the appropriate local state territorial federal or hostnation health jurisdiction 10 comply with hostnation requirements for hiv1 screening of dod civilian employees under this directive requests for hiv1 screening of dod civilians employed overseas based on and only on hostnation screening requirements are made to the assistant secretary of defense such requests concerning prospective employees are considered to be imposed by the host nation with official commitment on the part of dod for those who refuse or are diagnosed as hiv1 seropositive those employees who test positive with confirmatory western blot following two positive elisa tests at dod expense will not be assigned to host nations that require seronegativity such employees will be retained in their positions without prejudice provided appropriate counseling and education as well as retain all rights and benefits that accrue from such employment efforts will be made to protect employee confidentiality consistent with other dod directives some host nations may not bar entry to hiv1 seropositive dod civilian employees but may require reporting of such individuals to hostnation authorities in such cases dod civilian employees who are evaluated as hiv1 seropositive shall be informed of reporting requirements counseled and given the option of declining the assignment without prejudice or reporting to the hostnation if assignmen t is accepted the requesting authority shall release the hiv1 seropositive result as required9 those employees currently assigned overseas in such cases may request and receive early return at government expense or other appropriate action such as transfer to another host nation without prejudice as result of this policy dod had instituted several procedures which limit the deployment of hiv1 infected military personnel service members with serologic

hiv1 infection and of other service members and for other reason the secretaries of the military departments may on casebycase basis limit assignment of hiv1 infected individuals on the nature and location of the duties performed in accordance with operational requirements thus hiv1 infected personnel are not assigned to duty outside the united states this policy is designed to protect the health and safety of infected personnel non infected personnel and citizens of the host country issues dod policy has raised questions about the appropriate balance between the health needs of affected people here and abroad on the one hand and the requisite level of military readiness on the other hand those who stress the importance of disease management view medical and patient considerations as paramount those who stress the importance of military readiness view deployability and mission accomplishment as paramount defenders contend the 1991 dod policy pursued workable balance between the two approaches opponents contend that the policy needs to give additional emphasis to readiness testing the original controversy that arose when dod implemented testing in 1985 has subsided somewhat early reporting on the results of testing were confusing10 nevertheless following the election of the clinton administration in 1992 homosexual rights activists requested that testing by the military and other governmental organizations be brought to an end11 many of the arguments for and against testing continue to be debated those who oppose testing have cited the following arguments testing may label identify persecute and stigmatize homosexuals in the military testing is not without errors and such errors may cause irreparable damage to person testing positive for exposure to the aids virus arguably does not provide defin itive evidence that person will ultimately contract aids during military career there exists great disparity in estimates on the rate of those who test positive for aids antibodies who ultimately develop the disease according to the centers forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs10 12 according to discussions with staff at the centers for disease control prevent ion october 5 2000diseas control earlier studies showed that on average within 5 years of infection with hiv1 12 of homosexualbisexual men and 15 of transfusion recipients developed aids on average within 3 ½ to 4 years 18 of intravenous drug users developed aids however with recent advances in treatment these estimates are much more problematic this time may vary greatly from person to person depending on many factors including persons health status their access and adherence to treatment and their other health related behaviors scientists estimate that without treatment half of hivinfected people would develop an aidsrelated illness within 1012 years12 testing negative does not guarantee infected applic ants will be prevented from entering the service an individual may become infected and test negative due to the fact that the hiv1 infection has not been present for sufficient period of time to be detected by the testing procedure according to the centers for disease control prevention the tests commonly used to detect hiv infection actually look for antibodies produced by the body to fight hiv most people will develop detectable antibodies within 3 months after infection the average being 22 days in rare cases it can take up to 6 months for this reason the centers for disease control prevention currently recommends testing 6 months after the last possible expos ure unprotected vaginal anal or oral sex or sharing needles it would be extremely rare to take longer than 6 months to develop detectable antibodies given the inaccuracies of testing lack of assurance that positive result will lead to aids the absence of medical cure and the relative infrequency of the illness it can be argued that costs of servicewide testing are unjustified positive test results may be used unfairly against the service members allowing the military to test could be used to justify largescale testing in the public and private sectors that may not be subjec t to controls that will protect the rights and civil liberties of the individual those who favor testing have cited the following points the issue of homosexuality in the military is not significant in this context because when testing began in 1985 homosexuals were barred from the service under the statutory policy implemented in fy1994 homosexual behavior continue s to be prohibited an individuals sexuality under this policy is irrelevant the two tests used by the services the elisa and the western blot together are statistically accurate indicator of

from 4 million to 5 million the lifetime costs of caring for each hiv1aids patient are estimated to be between 75000 and 260000 the journal of the american medical association estimated in 1993 that the average is approximately 119 00013 based on this average the cost of providing lifetime care for the 1128 active duty personnel who were hiv1 infected as of 1995 would be 134232000 in addition recent advances in treating aids have led to increases in the cost of treating aids patients these new treatments have allowed aids patients to live longer thus requiring an increase in costs purely on the bases of the amount of care that may be providedrequired according to an analysis by holtgrave and pinkerton more recent cost estimates indicate the lifetime cost of hiv medical care is about 155000195000 depending on the rate of discounting used discoun ting process to convert future costs to their present values is commonly accepted practice in economic evaluations14 if the services do not test for hiv1 infection those who believe that they are infected or at risk for infection and lack insurance or other medical protection may enter the service as the only viable alternative to acquire medical care the services and congress have taken steps to insure that positive test results do not lead to unwarranted adverse personnel actions and to educate personnel concerning hiv1aids to deal both realistically and compassiona tely with the illness and eliminate unwarranted prejudice although precedents regarding hiv1 testing may be lacking the services do screen for other communicable and arguably less dangerous illnesses and conditions including drug abuse maintainin g the health of military personnel is essential for force readiness this is the primary objective of military health care provision of healthy force to accommodate the defense needs of the coun try decisions on testing for hiv1 or any other contagious disease must be justified in terms of readiness of the force screening military personnel for hiv1 infection acts as safeguard against infection via blood transfusions and therefore protects the blood supply failing to test could lead to the

highperformance aircraft decoding sensitive messages for the president or driving tanks said col dr edmund c tramont physician at walter reed army medical center the ability of health care professionals to measure track and thereby understand the illness and its mode and rate of transmission is crucial in preventing further spread of the illness and to finding cure dod provides one central source of data on the infection rate in the united states through the screening of applicants in addition those in the service as well as those who leave and receive care from dod and the department of veterans affairs provide valuable information from which to monitor the progress of the illness while continuing to ensure that those who are infected continue to receive appropriate and available health care career implications under the 1991 dod policy procedures for military personnel infected with hiv1 sought to balance the needs of the individual with the mission requirements of the military by allowing hiv1infected personnel to remain in uniform until unable to perform their duties nonetheless some argue that testing hiv1positive does expose person to prejudicial attitudes and actions positive test may well result in restricted assignment limiting service members opportunities for advancement the careers of certain personn may also be adversely affected if and when they reveal information regarding the source of exposure to the virus and are subsequently removed from their position as result of such disclosures such policy it is argued tends to discourage personnel from being frank regarding exposure to the illness they may cite exposure via means that will not be threatening to career advancement hiv1 infection without the presence of an opportunistic secondary illness can result in impaired coordination cognitive difficulties or other neurologic dysfunctions15 this may lead to reassignment from hazardous duty for example limiting the career opportunities of infected personnel who do not otherwise exhibit secondary illness indicative of aids if sufficiently severe such impairment may lead to discharge the legislation section of this report discusses efforts to mandate the removal of hiv positive personnel health care concerns specific structures within dod have been created to deal with aids dod has designated particular medical facilities as treatment centers for certain aids patients this concentr ation of aidsrelated care in few facilities allows the services to maximize the amount of care available and minimize costs nevertheless the costs of caring for aids patients including military personnel as well as their dependents can be extremely high if in spite of testing and educational efforts the spread of aids in the military were to rise substantially medical costs could in effect competehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs13 16 such spending has been contentious for example in fy1995 dod obligations for aids research were 41 million representing approximately onethird of defense obligations for aids the remaining twothirds or approximately 86 million going to preventative measures these amounts do not include funds spent for health care of infected personnel some activists have been lobbying congress to write legislatio n that would require the department of defense to spend onethird of any aids research money on experimental treatment it should be noted that in fy1995 the president requested 32 million for militaryrelated aids research house and senate appropriations committees voted for 232 million and 334

proponents of military aids research note that should dod terminat these programs major source of clinical research would be lost such research they argue is nearly impossible to conduct in the civilian community18 also they argue that dod would be turning its back on infected personnel and thereby denying them the hope of possible cure proponents note that dod personnel may have more limited health care options outside of the military establishment if they do not live near dod or va facility opponents to this use of funds including then assistant secretary of defense health

judge new york times army appeals court allows aids test result in prosecution october 19 1987 35 that congress is being forced by political pressure to use scarce and declining dod resources for hiv1 research that has direct beneficial effect on defense needs indeed it has been argued that dod resources could be better spent preventing the spread of the illness among military personnel via testing and education thereby protecting the uninfected and maintaining the readiness of the force it was reported in 1995 that dod officials were proposing that funds used for research on combating hiv1aids be shifted to preventing the spread of the illness in memo released by the army surgeon general assistant surgeon general for research and development brig gen russ zajtchuk stated if soldier is already infected that soldier is casualty and is of limited use to the force19 such proposed shift would some argue leave those infected in uniform feeling abandoned conversely some have argued that such shift is more cost effective humane and prudent given the military mission protecting military personnel and dependents the major strategy for protecting military personnel from aids has involved testing applicants and current personnel screening blood supplies and developing educational and medical surveillance initiatives although testing procedures are means of protecting personnel from hiv1 infection educational initiatives represent an indirect means of protection by educating personnel about the illness and its means of transmission it is expected that military personnel will modify their behavior to minimize the possibility of exposure beyond educating service members military officials notify the respective spouses of service members who test positive on the grounds that the spouse is military dependent and eligible for care provided by the military more aggressive programs that might help prevent the spread of the illness are viewed as unduly intrusive and threatening to individual civil liberties coupled with other programs such as antidrug abuse and antiprostitution programs it is argued that educational programs can be an effective means of deterring the spread of aids and respecting individual rights in number of instances military personnel who have tested positive have been convicted by courtsmartial of continuing to engage in sexual relations without informing their partners of the their infection in one particular instance an infected airman was charged and ultimately convicted of aggravated assault with the means likely to cause death or bodily harm for engaging in sexual relations20 although information acquired as result of an epidemiological assessment may not be used against service member who tests positive for an hiv1 infection

aids present special concern to dod officials compulsory testing of dependents is not authorized nevertheless dependents could be source of infection for service members likewise dependent who is known by dod health care officials to have an hiv1 infection is beyond the immediate control of the services what authority or responsibility the services have to protect civilians from sexually transmitted hiv1 infection via an infected military member is not clear nor is the associated legal responsibility for failure to do so22 in 1994 it was reported that an infected and married navy petty officer had sexual relations with an offduty navy reservist without informing her that he was hivpositive the reservist became infected with hiv the reservist sued the navy on the grounds that navy officials failed to order the petty officer to refrain from behavior that could lead to the transmission of the illness or at least to disclose that he had the infection the reservist claimed that military officials were warned of the petty officers illicit sexual activities by his wife but failed to act23 military attorneys argued that the reservist had standing to sue based on the feres doctrine doctrine which prohibits military personnel from suing the government for injuries sustained incident to military service the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled against the reservist stating that the case would represent an impermissible intrusion into military affairs24 the petty officer was convicted in courtmartial of assault with dangerous weapon and sentenced to dishonorable discharge 30 months confinement in the brig and reduction to e1 the lowest enlisted grade the reservist received care at va hospital although the va does not consider her case servicerelated since she

personnel strengths by regional area and by country september 30 1990 and 1999 foreign policy questions current dod policy views questions of foreign policy in relationship to aids as medical issue it states that military personnel with serologic evidence of hiv1 will not be posted abroad and that service members stationed overseas who test positive are returne d to the united states however some foreign critics have charged that personnel stationed abroad are responsible for spreading the aids virus among foreign nationals and argue the removal of us forces from host country the us has attempted to safeguard the host countries through perio dic testing of both service personnel and civilian employees once the virus is contracted military personnel who are unaware they have the disease or who are infected and fail to refrain from disease transmitting activities can be responsible for the continued spread of the disease overseas likewise personnel who contract the disease while overseas are rotated to the united states bringing the disease home with them military personnel and dependents returning home under normal rotation policy are not routinely tested for hiv1 current policy seeks to restrict the spread of aids overseas through routine testing and to care for those individuals infected by returning them to the us where they may be monitored and provided with care and needed counseling more aggressive policies such as limiting offbase or liberty activities in areas that have high endemic rates for hiv1 infection may be considered as has been the case for areas harboring prostitution near bases in the us such efforts may prove difficult to enforce and are for the present longer as vital due to shift in areas of deployment in part as result of the drawdown the united states has reduced the number of troops deployed to aids highrisk areas such as the philippines and to lesser extent in parts of africa and thailand in 1990 the us had 13863 military personnel in the philippines 213 in thailand and 338 in subsaharan africa by 1999 these numbers had fallen to 84 120 and 301 respectively25 by limiting the number of personnel who may be stationed overseas or aboard ship the services would arguably limit the defense capabilities of the united states because the number of aids cases or those with hiv1 infection is small this represents rather insignificant effect on military manpower policies however in the unlikely event that the number of cases expands the options concerning overseas deployments could become increasingly limited legislation during the mid1990s number of legislative initiatives were proposed to require the discharge of hivpositive service members ultimately these initiatives failed in addition as part of the fy2001 defense appropriations act provisions were included that would use defense funds to address the issue of hivaids in countries in africa the legislative histories of these initiatives are examined belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs17 26 us congress conference committee national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 conference report hr 1530 104th congress 1st session december 13 1995 810dod discharge policy as already noted the fy1996 house national defens authorization act modified the discharge policy according to the conference report on the bill the house bill contained provision sec 561 that would require the secretary of defense to separate or retire service members who are identified as hivpositive the senate amendment contained similar provision the senate recedes with an amendment that would provide the discharged member with an entitlement to medical and dental care within the military health care system to the same extent and under the same conditions as military retiree26 this provision would change parts of the existing policyany member of the armed forces except those within 2 years of retirement would be discharged specifically items 3 and 5 in the section description of department of defense policies on hiv1aids above would be stricken or modified to conform to the new law item 3 states that individuals with serologic evidence of hiv1 shall not be retired or separated solely on the basis of serologic evidence of hiv1 infection likewise item 5 directs the secretary of defense to retire or separate ad or reserve service members infected with hiv1 who are determined to be unfit for further duty dod had until august 1996 to separate hivinfected personnel currently serving the legislation arguably shifted the balance of the existing medical readiness compromise to more deployment oriented policy but would leave in place many of the privacy and civil rights protections in proposing this language representative dornan argued that since hiv1infected personnel cannot be deployed they represented drain on readiness and adversely affected the morale of those who have to take their place critics contended that the language would do little to affect readiness since so few individuals in uniform are infected and that it raises legal questions of equal protection since other medically nondeployable personnel would not be involuntarily discharged dod opposed the bill calling it inhumane and thus adversely affecting morale in addition dod said it was contrary to the notion that the services take care of their own proponents of mandatory discharge noted that hiv1 was the only illness that results in permanent assignment of members within the continent united states conus each service based upon specific requirements may limit the assignment of members with certain other illness thus they argued hiv1 infected personnel receive special treatment not available to other individuals as group with illnesses on december 19 1995 president clinton vetoed the first version of the fy1996 national defense authorization act citing among other things his concern that this language would unfairly affect

stated that it would try to repeal the provision possibly via legal challenge hr 2959 was introduced to specifically repeal this provision this bill had been referred to the same committee that drafted the mandatory separation language on march 19 1996 the senate amended the balanced budget downpayment act ii hr 3019 with language that overturned the authorization provision requiring the discharge of hiv1 infected personnel29 thus one was discharged for being infected with hiv under the fy1996 language as part of its markup for the fy1997 defense authorization bill the house military personnel subcommittee included language that once again called for the mandatory discharge of certain hiv1 infected personnel30 under this new language the services were required to discharge hiv1 infected personnel within two months of confirmation of hiv1 infection unlike the provisions signed into law by the president this new provision would have provided medical retirement of hiv positive service members as well as an income this legislation would also have provided the service secretaries the discretion to retain service personnel with 15 or more years of service if the service secretary deemed their retention as necessary for service31 this bill was passed by the house on may 15 1996 the senate language required the secretary of defense to establish regulations setting forth uniform policies and procedures regarding the retention of members of the armed services who are nonworldwide deployable for medical reasons ultimately the conferees dropped both of these provisions32 the language adopted by both the house and the senate in 1996 attempted to reorient policy to give greater weight to the needs of the military rather the needs of the individual under the house provision personnel who have tested positive for hiv1 would be separated from the military because they are longer fully capablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30761crs19 33 according to patricia

military service ie they are not deployable such an outcome based solely on hiv1 infection would end the careers of infected personnel who did not otherwise exhibit secondary illness indicative of aids thus concerns bearing on further military career implications as described above would have become moot for personnel who had been discharged the only situation in which these issues would continue to be relevant would have been in the case of personnel who are within 5 years of retirement because they are within sanctuary period and consequently would be protected from separation except for cause such as violations of the uniform code of military justice these issues would continue to face hiv1 positive personnel until they retire from military service under the senate language hiv1 infected personnel would be treated as are others and viceversa since both of these provisions were dropped from the conference report only hiv1infected personnel as group are protected from worldwide deployment33 other diseases are treated on casebycase basis evolution of defense department involvement in us hiv initiatives in africa as the dimensions of the aids epidemic especially in the developing world are being understood new global efforts including those by the united states to combat the hivaids epidemic have become more prominent and multifaceted estimates from the unaids joint united nations program on hivaids indicate that globally 16000 new hivinfections take place every day and that 343 million people are currently living with hivaids worldwide projected 245 million of these live in subsaharan africa34 so far an estimated 188 million people have died of the epidemic worldwide of which 115 million of these deaths have occurred in sub saharan africa35 the overall rate of infection among adults in subsaharan africa is approximately 86 compared to 11 worldwide and the number of hivaids cases in southern africa continues to grow at an alarming rate further the infection rate of several southern african countries is believed to have reached 20 or higher botswana for example has reported an infection rate of 35836 series of events began in 1999 which would result in greater involvement of the us and dod in combating the hivaids epidemic in africa in march 1999 the united states hosted us africa ministerial conference in washington later that

interdependence between domestic and international consequences of the epidemic by linking aids to us national security interests in april 2000 the clinton administration officially designated hivaids as threat to us national security this conclusion appeared to be based on the anticipation that the aids epidemic can lead to regional instability and slowing of democratic development and economic growth this new push is among other things reflected in the doubling of fy2001 budget requests in which the clinton administration is asking congress for an increase of 100 million to 342 million for international aids prevention and care these funds will primarily be targeted in the worst hit hivaids areas predominantly in southern africa39 critics contend that although the southern africa

explained the importance of taking the aids epidemic seriously stating that of all the problems what we face in the world today and there are many the conflicts we are here to try to preven t or contain nuclear proliferation population issues environmental issues and social and economic issues i think that this the aids epidemic is the most serious problem we face because of the damage that it can do to everything else44 those who favor earmarking dod funds to aids activities in africa appear to believe that in world defined by interdependence domestic and foreign issues are not easily separated since aids knows national boundaries helping to contain aids in africa is in the interest of the us aids may destabilize regions causing social economic and political unrest which may have direct effect on us national security afric is strategically important to the us in terms of transport lanes and oil supplies and the aids epidemic may threaten the establishment of stable consumer market which could benefit americas trade for dod 10 million dollars is small allocation of its total budget furthermore the department should invest in conflict prevention and share the responsibility towards the containment of the aids epidemic according to holbrooke it is natural that dod plays its part in preventing the spread of the aids epidemic arguing that the spread of the disease by peacekeepers has become major problem45 those who oppose the use of dod funds for such purposes appear to believe that the aids problems faced by the african military is of or limited

contribution httpwwwwashingtonpostcsrvworlddailyjuly00aidsgraphic2htmtherefore be handled by the respective countries themselves or other appropriate international organizations supported by the us an already strained defense budget should not be used as tool to provide social welfare in other countries other agencies or departments such as usaid or the world health organization would be more appropriate to handle this issue 10 million in funding for aids activities in the african military is far from sufficient to have any realistic effect on the disease furthermore containing aids in africa should not be responsibility disproportionately tackled by the us alone it is worldwide problem that calls for international solutions and burden sharing46 the labeling of aids as national security threat is done to assign more significance to the aids pandemic in hope that skeptical congress and public could be induced to approve more spending such proposals it is argued are more political gesture that aims at appealing to certain interest groups rather than serious effort at addressing the problem of aids
