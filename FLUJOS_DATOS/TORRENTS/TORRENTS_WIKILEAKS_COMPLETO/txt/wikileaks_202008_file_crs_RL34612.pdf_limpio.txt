the same unusual strain of bacteria salmonella saintpaul in apriljuly 2008 officials first suspected fresh tomatoes as the vehicle and later expanded their concerns to fresh jalapeño and serrano peppers by late july genetic tests confirmed the pathogen on samples of serrano pepper and irrigation water from farm in tamaulipas mexico agricultural operations in the united states have been implicated in several past outbreaks of foodborne illness food safety experts agree that an effective comprehensive food safety system should include consideration of potential hazards at the farm level however opinions differ on the need if any for more stringent governmentenforced safety standards for farms as exist for processors and others in the food chain this question and others such as the potential cost of new interventions to producers taxpayers and consumers are likely to arise as congress debates new food safety bills the lead federal food safety agencies are the food safety and inspection service fsis within the us department of agriculture usda which regulates major species of meat and poultry and some egg products and the food and drug administration fda within the us department of health and human services hhs which regulates virtually all other foods generally these agencies regulatory oversight of foods begins after the farm gate at slaughter establishments and food handling and manufacturing facilities however various activities of these and other federal agencies involved in assuring the safety of the food supply can and do have an impact on how farms and ranches raise food commodities number of the several dozen food safety bills introduced into the 110 th congress could have affected farmers and ranchers either directly or indirectly several of these

major outbreaks of foodborne illnesses product recalls and reports about unsafe food imports have caused some to question the adequacy of the us food safety system stakeholders appear to agree that an optimal system should encompass comprehensive preventive approach to food safety focusing on those foods and points in the food system that pose the greatest public health risks starting at the point of productionthat is on farms and ranches here viewpoints diverge should farmers and ranchers be subject to mandatory safety standards enforced through certification of their practices periodic inspections and penalties for noncompliance or should public policy continue to encourage voluntary strategies for producing safe foods on farms and ranches through education cooperation and marketbased incentives historically the federal and state governments have relied on the latter carrot approach that in the view of some critics is longer effective further complicating matters is that consumers increasingly rely on distant often foreign sources of production for significant portion of their food it also could be argued that numerous laws and regulations already impose restrictions both direct and indirect on producers of food commodities which effectively meet food safety objectivesand also involve significant compliance costs these restrictions include requirements on the use of animal drugs feed additives and pesticides v oluntary and market based incentives also effectively regulate safety it could be argued for example major food marketing chains and food service providers generally set quality and safety standards that suppliers must meet which often extend back to the farm number of major illness outbreaks recently have placed onfarm practices under the policy microscope examples include the following after more than 1300 persons in 43 states the district of columbia and canada were found to be infected with the same unusual strain of bacteria salmonella saintpaul in apriljuly 2008 officials first suspected fresh tomatoes as the vehicle and later expanded their concerns to fresh jalapeño and serrano peppers by late july genetic tests confirmed the pathogen on samples of serrano pepper and irrigation water from farm in tamaulipas mexico the same strain found on pepper provided by one of the ill persons in the fall of 2006 more than 200 confirmed illnesses and three deaths were linked to the consumption of packaged spinach that apparently had been contaminated by coli o157h7 in california fields possibly due to the presence of wild pigs the proximity of irrigation wells used to grow the produce or surface waterways exposed to feces from cattle and wildlife numerous recent recalls and illness outbreaks have been linked to coli o157h7 in raw or undercooked beef products the bacteria is endemic in the live us cattle population and can become greater hazard if measures are not taken to control its spread on ranches and feedlots and in processing plants proper cooking kills coli o157h7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34612g8g152g152g141g561 g21g138g143g142g157g162g561g152

cause of foodborne illnesses pathogens are found in foods of all kinds although those of animal origin including raw meat and poultry eggs unpasteurized milk and seafood are most likely to be contaminated fruits and vegetables also are of growing concern particularly because considerable portion is consumed raw often these pathogens are first acquired at the farm or harvest level processing and cooking does not always kill them 1 also complicating an understanding of onfarm food safety is the range of pathogens on the farm and the range of organisms associated with each food product the american society for microbiology report notes foodborne pathogens include the following viruses such as hepatitis often originate from human feces which can contaminate produce either when handled by infected humans or exposed to unsafe irrigation or washing water parasites such as cryptosporidium cyclospora and giardia can be acquired from human and other animal fecal material directly or through water or soil such waste can be generated by both domesticated and wild animals bacteria including salmonella enteritidis coli o157 campylobacter vibrio and yersinia are ubiquitous and can proliferate on the farm the degree to which they are problem depends on such variables as animal density and housing feeding practices water and wastewater treatment and disposal methods human handling practices interactions between animals and the proximity of animals to cropproducing fields and orchards some hazards are naturally occurring such as aflatoxin fungus that can infect crops including peanuts and grains preharvest controls are only effective if additional safety problems are avoided further down the food production and marketing chain there is not always clear relationship between food safety measures takenor not takenprior to harvest and their impacts on the incidence of foodborne illnesses also of potential risk to the food supply ar numerous nonbiological contaminants fruits vegetables and other crops can contain higher than acceptable levels of pesticides if they are improperly applied prior to harvest to control weeds and kill insect pests or after harvest to control fungus insects or rodents during food storage foods of animal origin potentially can contain excess residues of drugs administered to control or eliminate diseases or promote more efficient growth g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g8g152g152g141g561g21g138g143g142g157g162g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561

201 et seq fda divides responsibilities for the safety of eggs with the us department of agriculture usda under the egg products inspection act as amended 21 usc 1031 et seq fda appears to have the authority to regulate at least some onfarm activities although it rarely does so2 fda has focused its oversight and enforcement activities on periodic inspections of food processing and handling facilities on sampling and testing foods for the presence of adulterants and on cooperation with firms seeking approval of specific food or feed additives or packages fda has promulgated current good manufacturi ng practice cgmp requirements 21 cfr part 110 failure to comply with these requirements which apply to manufacturing packing or holding human food can result in enforcement actions and penalties including an fda declaration that food is adulterated excluded from these requirements are establishments engaged solely in harvesting storing or distributing raw agricultural commodities fda rules do state that the agency will issue special regulations if it is necessary to cover these excluded operations3 the ffdca specifically exempts farms and restaurants from requirements to maintain records for up to two years for purposes of identifying immediate previous sources and the immediate subsequent recipients of food including its packaging in order to address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals and to permit officials access to these records if food is suspected of being adulterated and presenting serious health threat4 such requirements pertain to anyone who manufactures processes packs distributes receives holds or imports furthermore farms are among those exempted from requirement that food facilities be registered with fda pursuant to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 20025 fdas general approach has been not to impose mandatory onfarm safety standards or inspections of agricultural facilities6 rather the agency relies on farmers adoption of socalled good agricultural practices to reduce hazards prior to harvest such practices are issued as fda guidance not regulations they are advisory and not legally enforceable responsibilities7 the 2 more detailed legal analysis appears in crs report rs22939 fda authority to regulate onfarm activity by vanessa k burrows fdas own arguments in support of its onfarm authority can be found in proposed rule to regulate egg production to control salmonella enteritidis at 69 federal register pp 5684245 see

fresh fruit and vegetables in recent years which are more likely to be consumed in uncooked forms than are other regulated foods cooking can kill many pathogens fdas recommendations cover for example the use and testing of water that will come in contact with crops proper application of animal manure and sanitation for field workers fda launched in 2006 leafy greens initiative to address recurring outbreaks of coli o157h7 associated with fresh and freshcut lettuce the majority of which had been traced to california among the key features of this cooperative and voluntary initiative are visits in cooperation with state agricultural officials to farms as well as produce packers and processors to assess industry efforts to improve lettuce safety and if appropriate stimulate further needed efforts the initiative is to support 2004 produce safety action plan9 in 2007 fda issued tomato safety initiative modeled after the lettuce initiative and operated in cooperation with florida officials fda stated at the time that 12 different outbreaks of foodborne illness including from salmonella had been linked to fresh tomatoes majority of which were grown in florida10 in rare instance of proposed onfarm regulatory activity fda had proposed rules to require shell egg producers to implement specific safety measures to prevent onfarm contamination of eggs by salmonella enteritidis however final rule although reportedly completed by fda was postponed in late 2008 due to concerns raised during the office of management and budgets ombs prepublication review egg produc ers reportedly criticized the rule as too restrictive and lacking incentives for them to vaccinate their flocks against se11 the preamble to the proposed rule had observed that secontaminated eggs have been major source of foodborne illness and that onfarm pr evention measures could be very important in reducing infections from eggs12 the proposal would require testing in poultry houses with followup tests on eggs if environmental tes ting is positive for the bacteria other proposed measures in the rule address the procurement of chicks and pullets biosecurity program disinfection of

adulterated meat and poultry from entering commerce by examining all animals just before slaughter antemortem with additional provisions requiring postmortem inspections of all carcasses and of food products made from these carcasses 21 usc 455 and 603606 farmers and ranchers do not appear to be among the persons establishments and other firms subject to the provisions of these acts including recordkeeping requirements and penalties for noncompliance neither act speaks to how livestock are produced maintained or managed according to 1998 report issued by the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences 15 fsis and livestock industry officials have asserted that agricultural producers are indirectly regulated under these laws for example slaughter establishments are not to accept unhealthy or mistreated animals that may harbor diseases and pathogens dangerous to humans such animals can spread contamination in plants as well as result in rejection or other enforcement actions by inspectors andor costly if ostensibly voluntary product recalls it is argued moreover fsis has worked with animal industry organizations to encourage producers to adopt voluntarily best practices aimed at reducing the spread of pathogens like coli o157h7 among live animals

antibiotics if unapproved or used improperly they can compromise human food safety another regulatory example affecting producers is fdas rule prohibiting the use in animal feeds of materials of ruminant origin this rule is aimed at preventing the spread of bov ine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease though rare human form of bse can be contracted if infected tissues are consumed16 in addition to drug approvals and oversight of feed manufacturers fda also works with fsis which tests for violative residues of antibiotics and other drugs in meat and poultry and reports them to fda fda can conduct followup inspec tions often done through state agencies of livestock producers and others another cooperative effort between fda and state milk control officials is the national drug residue milk monitoring program which routinely tests raw milk for certain drug residues

to control insects weeds mold and other pests affecting food crops under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fif ra pl 92516 it is violation of fifra to use pesticide that is inconsistent with its approved label instructions under the ffdca epa sets allowable residue levels called tolerances for pesticides used in food production tolerances are set to ensure that harm to health is prevented with reasonable certainty foods with residues that exceed tolerances or that contain residue that lacks an established tolerance are considered adulterated under the ffdca generally the fda monitors and enforces residue limits while epa and the states enforce fifras provisions 17 the fda science board in its november 2007 report argued that these programs have their limitations these fda and epa conditions are meant to prevent the presence of dangerous amounts of those chemicals in food however monitoring of compliance with approved usage is poorly funded and episodic state and local authorities have more to say about onfarm practices but their monitoring capabilities are severely limited18

agricultural marketing service ams oversees number of programs intended to assure that various agricultural products meet specified quality and grade standards sometimes involving safety attributes for example under the agricultural marketing agreement act of 1937 7 usc 601 et seq producers and handlers can organize themselves under legally binding marketing orders that can include quality and possibly safety standards ams in october 2007 invited comments on whether to create such federal marketing program that specifically would require handlers packers processors shippers of leafy greens including lettuce and spinach to meet prescribed safety standards 19 similar state order was adopted by california growers in 2006 further action on federal order had not occurred as of december 2008 under the agricultural marketing act of 1946 7 usc 1621 note ams has implemented wide range of voluntary testing and process verification programs funded by industry user fees these ams services use independent thirdparty audits and other standardized procedures to help producers certify that their products meet buyer specifications20 although some of these programs can be and are designed to ensure the safety of certain food commodities from public health standpoint they are not regulatory by nature rather they are intended to facilitate commercial agreements in the trade or to provide consumers with more information about their prospective purchases g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561g146g151g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 in 2007 and 2008 series of widely quoted reports by congressional agencies and committees the administration and outside advocacy groups raised questions about shortcomings in the federal food safety system several dozen bills addressed one or more aspects of the issue and numerous hearings were held number of propos als could have influenced onfarm practices these proposals could possibly reemerge in the 111 th congress given the interest in considering new food safety legislation bill numbers are those from the 110th congress 19 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking appeared in 72 federal register pp 5667880 provision in the house passed farm bill in 2007 hr 2419 would have expressly authorized the implementation of qualityrelated food safety programs under marketing orders for

producers directly hr 1148 and s 654 companion measures to combine all federal food safety responsibilities under single new food safety administration contained language 206 specifically to require the new agency to set good practice standards require recordkeeping and authorize inspections of food production facilities defined as any farm ranch orchard vineyard aquaculture facility or confined feeding operation hr 5620 and s 2077 were companion bills addressing the safety of fresh and minimally processed fruits and vegetables 121 of the bills would have required hhs ie fda to issue regulations on good agricultural practices to include management of manure water and other environmental conditions would have required produce growers to develop on farm safety plans and to maintain written records and would have authorized onfarm inspections in hr 5904 9 would have required hhs to cooperate with usda on regulations for the safe production harvesting and packaging of those types of fruits and vegetables for which the secretary of hhs has determined that such regu lations are necessary to minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences similar produce safety standards were in 106 of s 3385 wideranging food safety bill s 3385 also would have required final implementation of fdas september 2004 proposed rule see previous discussion among other provisions hr 3624 primarily addressed the regulation and inspection of postharvest food facilities but it also would have directed hhs to encourage states to continue strengthen or establish state food safety programs especially with respect to the regulation of retail commercial food establishments transportation harvesting and fresh markets also the bill defined process to mean the commercial harvesting preparation manufacture or transportation of food products which presumably would have brought onfarm practices within the measures regulatory scope

pending food safety bills likely might have had at least an indirect impact on agricultural food production methods number of them including hr 3484 hr 3485 and hr 5069 variously provided for new authorities for product traceability programs mandatory recall or requirements that officials be notified if food might pose safety threat food facilities including manufacturers warehouses and other handlers appeared to be the primary regulatory targets of these bills but such entities might have been expected to demand in turn more accountability from their original suppliers that is farmers and ranchers s 1292 proposal to require farmtotable traceability for meat and poultry products also required the establishment of live animal id program to keep track of animals before they reach the slaughterhouse hr 661 hr 2678 s 394 and provision in h r 5762 all sought to prevent nonambulatory downer animals from entering the food supply such animals are believed to be more likely to harbor diseases of potential danger to humans who consume their meat proponents believe that prohibiting downers to be used for food would encourage livestock producers to deliver healthier animals to markets other bills with potential impact on producers included hr 992 to require the labeling of foods from cloned animals or their offspring producers likely would have to segregate and keep track of such animals under this type of proposal and hr 962s 549 to phase out the nontherapeutic use of certain antimicrobial animal drugs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34612g8g152g152g141g561

sought public compensation for losses they said they unfairly shouldered as result of the governments food safety response hr 6581 introduced july 23 2008 would have required usda to make available 100 million for payments to growers and handlers of fresh tomato that experienced crop or market losses or both as result of the fda public health advi sory issued in early june 2008 and long since lifted to avoid certain types of raw tomatoes hr 912 introduced february 8 2007 would have authorized usda payments to growers and handlers unable to market spinach crops as result of an fda public health advisory in september 2006 not to eat bagged spinach also long since lifted the spinach was in fact contaminated and believed to have been the vehicle of interest while the relationship between some tomatoes and the outbreak was not clarified the concept of indemnity payments is not new for example in 1960 and 1961 usda using its standing section 32 authority made more than 9 million in direct payments to cranberry producers after federal officials recommendedjust before thanksgiving 1959a halt in all cranberry product sales due to possible pesticide contamination21 under the dairy indemnity program 7 usc 4501 usda makes paymen ts to dairy producers whenever public regulatory agency directs them to remove their raw milk from the commercial market because it has been contaminated by pesticides nuclear radiation or fallout or toxic substances and chemical residues other than pesticides since the programs inception in 1965 through fy2007 total of approximately 20 million in payments were made 22 however this dairy program compensates farmers for milk they are required to remove from the market not for imputed market losses in considering compensation bills numerous policy questions likely arise such as the need if any for such indemnities and whether market losses can be calculated with some accuracy and equity what might be the cost of payments to taxpayers and what types of food safety incentives or disincentives do they telegraph to producers should payments only be provided in the event of agency errorfor example misidentification of the food vehicle if so how might that be determined g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 geoffrey s becker specialist in agricultural policy
