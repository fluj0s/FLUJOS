government offers many opportunities for internships fellowships and work experiences however there is single centralized source for finding information on every opportunity this report describes the major and most popular internet resources for such opportunities and gives applicants place to begin their search the internet resources provided are not exhaustive applying for an internship or fellowship is similar to applying for admission to college or university the application process takes time and effort often requiring essays and interviews applicants should begin their search early and explore what best suits their interests and career goals application deadlines and program durations vary from agency to agency because competition is stiff in many internship and fellowship programs with applicants often far exceeding the number of positions available one should apply to more than one program opportunities are generally available in the spring summer and fall with summer positions being the most popular and the most competitive the terms fellowship and internship are sometimes used interchangeably in the names of specific programs fellowships are generally in tended for persons with advanced degrees or substantial professional experience and are usually salaried positions lasting nine months to year or more internships which are either salaried or volunteer shortterm arrangements usually require relatively little experience and are often filled by students although they are sometimes confused with interns congressional pages are high school students who serve the congress as messengers for more information on the cong ressional page system see crs report 98758 pages of the united states congress selection duties and program administration the duties responsibilities and salaries if any of interns and fellows vary from program to program most program responsibilities are substantive in nature and often involve challenging projects they may range from conducting legislative research for congressional office to biomedical research at the national institutes of health some programs or universities that offer academic credit may require the internfellow to produce report on the work experience and obtain evaluations from program supervisors in addition some programs lead to federal job placement recruitment programs like presidential management fellows and the student educational employment program may offer permanent employment after the successful completion of program requirements because program details vary from agency to agency it is best to consult the appropriate website or to contact the program office directly
