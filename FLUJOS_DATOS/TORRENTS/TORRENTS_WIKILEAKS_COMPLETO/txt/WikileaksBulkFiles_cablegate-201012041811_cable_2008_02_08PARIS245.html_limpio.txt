nonproliferation and disarmament issues classified by dcm mark pekala for reasons 14b and d 1 s summary on february 7 acting us john rood and his delegation met his french and british p3 counterparts philippe carre and mariot leslie respectively to discuss broad range of nonproliferation arms control and disarmament issues unusually the french were closer to the us than were the british on most issues the greatest area of divergence involved strong uk push for complete nuclear disarmament as long term goal including using verification measures in p5 countries rood and carre expressed skepticism that this would have significant impact either on aspiring proliferators or ngo disarmament advocates they urged the british to join instead in p3 strategy publicizing our strong nuclear disarmament records promoting fmct and start followon and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism on missile defense the british and french both praised our efforts with russia as forwardleaning supported our poststart approach and expressed concern about russias moves to globalize the inf treaty the british strongly supported the us in seeking nato endorsement in the bucharest communique of our md efforts in europe the french while remaining reluctant agreed to support language in the communique recognizing the threat and the utility of md as one element of response and positively recognizing us interceptors and radars as the core of nato capability the p3 also discussed enforcement of the npt visavis iran civil nuclear energy cooperation with india cluster munitions proposed uk arms trade treaty and difficulties with egypt and china the p3 plan to meet again in april end summary modest british proposal 2 s the meeting began with general agreement that in the last 10 to 15 years proliferation concerns have grown and that the nuclear proliferation treaty npt regime is under stress while aspiring proliferators such as iran constitute the primary threat the issue of energy security and the acquisition of nuclear energy by nonnuclear states has raised new npt dimension as well us rood stated that the usg was interested in creating rules of the road to allow for the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the npt leslie agreed adding that uk fm david miliband was focusing on using the new demand for nuclear energy to look at safety issues as well as building capacity some of which can be addressed through psi 3 s participants agreed that iran is the primary problem facing the states in the npt regime carre stated that if the international community is unable to prevent iran from becoming nuclear state the npt will lose credibility us rood agreed adding that enforcement of the npt regime must be the first priority followed by addressing structural defects in the regime that allow nations to acquire enrichment technologies without any justification leslie said that while one was on irans side some in the nam such as brazil and egypt pay lip service to iranian arguments for their own political reasons all agreed that the p3 should do more to mobilize the various constituencies to promote better understanding of the threat and show that the stakes of withdrawing from the npt are high 4 s there was extensive discussion about uk proposal to push for complete nuclear disarmament as longterm goal to include confidencebuilding measures by the p5 as gesture of good will towards nonnuclear states suspicious of our nuclear reduction efforts leslie argued that there is political danger within the uk and in nato if the member states dont live up to the commitments in the npt including the final goal of world without nuclear weapons leslie conceded us roods point that p5 effort of this kind would not persuade iran or other nuclear weapons aspirants to give up their nuclear ambitions but she asserted that it would help bring countries such as brazil egypt and south africa to greater trust and support for the p5 in this area the uk is planning to circulate draft paper with proposals in four areas to help demonstrate the p5 commitment to reducing nuclear arsenals these areas would concentrate on 1 work on definitions of nuclear terms and forces 2 greater transparency on warhead production and storage facilities that would not need to include information on current location of warheads but more general sharing of information about historic storage facilities 3 nuclear accident response and 4 verification of disarmament through peer review of technology including demonstrating the practice of dismantling nuclear warhead if initiated these proposals might build support for additional p5 initiatives like the paris 00000245 002 of 004 nuclear fuel cycle program leslie said 5 s us rood and carre expressed strong disagreement with the uk proposal with us rood emphasizing that it was far better for the p3 to adopt positive agenda by emphasizing our strong nuclear disarmament record pursuing fmct and start followon and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism us rood questioned whether the uk proposal would be counterproductive one had challenged p5 nuclear disarmament announcements but focusing on verification of p5 steps could cast doubt on those achievements and raise questions about aspects of the dismantling such as the retention of the plutonium pits at the center of the warhead which actually renders it less susceptible to therft or diversion than would grinding down the material verification is means of checking compliance it is not relevant in the context of npt article vi which sets specific milestones to be checked and leaves it to the p5 to determine their own progress us rood asked about the demonstration effect on other countries it could actually be destabilitizing for pakistan india and israel to increase transparency through verification and steps advocated by the uk such as publishing locations of nuclear weapons production and deployment carre agreed firmly and added that the uk proposal went far beyond acceptable parameters chinese and russian p5 partners 6 s us rood observed that p3 nuclear weapons arsenals had been reduced since signing the npt in 1968 with the us now at onefourth of its stockpile at the peak of the cold war but meanwhile china is building up its nuclear arsenal and russia is placing increasing emphasis on nuclear weapons in its doctrine unfortunately the chinese oppose fissile material cutoff treaty fmct because they wanted to preserve their freedom of action and ability to make more nuclear weapons leslie said that the uk is less concerned about the chinese nuclear and conventional arms buildup than is the us particularly with respect to taiwan but that london wants china involved in the fmct process even at the cost of long transition period and agreement on what type of chinese arms buildup would ultimately be acceptable carre advocated strengthened p5 cooperation and said that the chinese want to be seen as equals with the other p5 members in ensuring world stability and security and suggested this motivation could be played on to move chinas behavior closer into alignment with its own more positive rhetoric egypt and multilateral fora 7 s leslie proposed having the p5 meet with egypt before the next prepcom to allow the goe to vent its grievances and then perhaps engage more productively in the future the uk fears that the egyptians are gearing up for fight if they dont believe their concerns are being properly addressed us rood observed that egyptian tactics were backfiring they received fewer votes at the september 2007 iaea general conference than the year before and seemed genuinely surprised furthermore it is not in their interest to remove the ambiguity of israels nuclear status which was stabilizing to the region carre agreed and said that there was benefit to weakening the israeli pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons in the middle east india 8 s carre opened the subject of civil nuclear energy cooperation by noting that france had recently initialed an agreement on this subject with the government of india the provisions of the frenchindian agreement were similar to those in the usindia agreement and the process had presented fewer problems than expected the gof had repeatedly emphasized to the goi that india must obtain the approval of the iaea and there would be shortcuts or special exceptions us rood said that the usg strongly believes that language on safeguards in perpetuity should not be made conditional on fuel supply and we had informed the iaea of our position the goi was still testing the will of the international community to find flexibility on this leslie affirmed that the uk was in agreement with both the us and france on this issue and the british would be concerned if india obtained an agreement in which safeguards could lapse if fuel supplies were disrupted she doubted that the goi would complete the necessary steps this year paris 00000245 003 of 004 furthermore china was not blocking progress on indian civil nuclear cooperation but the uk fully expects that they will raise the case of pakistan as soon as the indian situation is resolved poststart and missile defense 9 s us rood noted that the us is continuing discussions with russia on poststart regime both russia and us did not want to simply extend the current agreement which is both cumbersome and expensive the us wanted to draft new agreement based on the moscow treaty unfortunately russia wanted conventional weapons to be limited under the agreement as well the us does not agree as compromise in october we proposed legally binding treaty with transparency and confidencebuilding measures however in the run up to the russian presidential election the russians are in mood to compromise we do not support further efforts on global inf 10 s on missile defense carre observed that the russians realized the issue was more complicated than they initially believed the us offer not to activate the system until the threat matured showed that the md system in europe was not oriented towards russia unfortunately in the russian government the more moderate diplomatic voices were marginalized by the power of the russian military carre said that france had recognized the missile threat and agreed that missile defense was one element of broad response to this threat the french regard the us interceptors and radars as the logical core of nato capability however an endorsement at nato raises consequences that the french believe need to be carefully considered for example bulgaria and turkey were already raising the need for collective financing of an additional natolinked system saying that it was required under natos treaty ensuring collective defense 11 s in response us rood said that there are many examples where individual states have different capabilities that they bring to the alliance that do not require common funding nato endorsement of md at bucharest would simply note that the us system in europe exists and forms the core of future alliance capability it does not commit the alliance to any programmatic costs or common funding mechanism it is fully in keeping with other weapons programs developed by the allies and would ensure that there is divisability of security leslie agreed saying that if the threat is recognized and missile defense is effective in combating such threat then the alliance should not hesitate to endorse missile defense the uk does not see the nato endorsement as any commitment to actual expenditure but merely commitment to the principle cluster munitions 12 s us rood emphasized that the international community was making progress in addressing cluster munitions concerns in the unauthorized convention on conventional weaposn ccw process the usg was concerned about norways efforts to go outside this multilateral track via the oslo process we believe this is both impractical and unconstructive and would prefer that other countries not participate in this outside mechanism leslie responded that the uk was participating in both the ccw and the oslo process as tactical maneuver designed to keep activity within the bounds of their redlines and at the same time keep the ccw alive the uk wants to keep the smart type of cluster munitions and would not agree to phase out anything without transitional period at the same time the uk is concerned about the impact of the oslo process on the aftermath of conflict foreseeing astronomical bills handed out to those who used cluster munitions in the past carre said that france could not afford to ignore the oslo process given the political power of the ngos on this issue but like the uk they hope to affect the debate as participant cluster munitions have also attracted the attention of fm kouchner and the french government is under heavy domestic pressure to take action unfortunately once cluster munitions are declared to be unacceptable it is hard to argue that we still need to use them for awhile arms trade treaty 13 s finally leslie raised the issue of the proposed paris 00000245 004 of 004 arms trade treaty saying their motives for support for this agreement were clear and they hoped it could be used to raise the standards of other states and create more responsible arms trade as the treaty would deal with export of arms it should not run afoul of us constitutional concerns as it would not limit the us citizen constitutional right to bear arms carre agreed that there was scope for something to be done to further regulate arms transfers us rood observed that while encouraging responsible behavior in arms transfers in general was good the risk with treaty was than an unacceptably low standard for arms transfers would result rood also said that the us had concerns about any potential impact on second amendment rights 14 u this cable has been reviewed and cleared
