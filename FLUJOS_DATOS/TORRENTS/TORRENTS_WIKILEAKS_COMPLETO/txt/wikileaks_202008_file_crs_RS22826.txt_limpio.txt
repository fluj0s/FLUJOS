social policy division march 4 2008 abstract older americans are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs as share of income households headed by person age 65 or older spend more on energyrelated expenditures than their younger counterparts in addition lowincome households those with less than 15000 in household income spent nearly 20 of their household income on energyrelated expenditures in 2006 the latest year for which data are available this compares to 73 spent by older households with incomes above 15000 these estimates are for 2006 and do not reflect the additional 17 increase in energy prices that occurred in 2007 order code rs22826 march 4 2008 impact of rising energy costs on older americans janemarie mulvey specialist on aging policy domestic social policy division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22826 energyrelated expenditures include spending for utilities and fuel to operate heat and cool homes and spending for gasoline and motor oil for private transportation energy prices to consumers have increased 70 between 2000 and 2007 driven largely by growth in prices for energy commodities such as petroleum petroleumbased products such as fuel oil propane and gasoline comprise about 50 of household energy expenditures older americans are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs as share of income households headed by person age 65 or older spend more on energyrelated expenditures than their younger counterparts in addition lowincome households those with less than 15000 in household income spent nearly 20 of their household income on energyrelated expenditures in 2006 the latest year for which data are available this compares to 73 spent by older households with incomes above 15000 these estimates are for 2006 and do not reflect the additional 17 increase in energy prices that occurred in 2007 the key public program that provides energy assistance to lowincome households is the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap approximately 40 of lowincome households that were eligible for liheap have household member aged 60 or older funding for the liheap program has not kept pace with recent increases in energy costs of older americans this report will explore the burden of rising energy costs on older americans and discuss implications for public policies this report will be updated when new data is released crs2 background in 2006 expenditures on energyrelated goods and services represented nearly 10 of total expenditures for older households1 there are two main components of energy expenditures over half 57 are for utilities and fuel to operate heat and cool homes the remaining 43 are for gasoline and motor oil2 within the category of utilities and fuel electricity comprises the largest share of spending representing nearly twothirds 628 of this category second is natural gas 276 and the remaining 96 are petroleumbased fuels like fuel oil and propane however the reliance on certain fuels varies widely by geographic region natural gas is the most commonly used source in the northeast 55 midwest 79 and west 66 while electricity is the most commonly used source in the south 52 in the northeast heating oil is also significant fuel source where it is reported second to natural gas as primary fuel source see table 1 table 1 percent of households using indicated fuel as primary source by region httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22826 northeast midwest south west us natural gas 55 79 41 66 58 heating oil 32 3 2 1 7 propane 2 7 5 4 5 electricity 11 11 52 30 30 source shortterm energy outlook october 2007 energy information administration petroleumbased products like fuel oil propane and gasoline comprise about 50 of household energy expenditures3 increases in costs in this category reflect the significant increases in the price of crude oil over the past five years over the past five years the price per barrel of crude oil has risen nearly 2004 over the same period prices charged to consumers for petroleumbased energy costs energy commodities increased 117 while prices charged for energy services increased 38 see table 2 effect of rising energy costs on consumer prices growth in overall energy spending is driven by two key factors the price charged to the consumer and the quantity demanded energy prices to consumers have increased 70 between 2000 and 2007 as compared to 20 rise in overall prices over the same time period more recently in 2007 overall energy prices rose 174 as compared to 1 older households are defined as household headed by person age 65

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22826 energy commodity prices reflect petroleumbased energy costs b energy service prices reflect charges for energy services such as natural gas and electricity beyond the direct effect of rising energy prices on household spending there are also indirect effects on overall consumer prices that must be taken into account all of the non energy goods and services consumed by households rely to some degree on energy for their production it takes energy to run plant and gasoline to fuel trucks and other forms of transport to take goods to the store to sell higher energy prices to manufacturers may be passed through to the consumer and thus increase overall inflation rates of goods and services the consumer price index excluding energy has been rising in recent years increasing from 15 in 2003 to 28 in 2007 suggesting that higher energy prices are affecting other areas of consumption as well impact of higher energy costs on older americans older households account for approximately 20 of our nations total consumption on energyrelated products yet they are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs although in actual dollar terms older households spend slightly less on energy related consumption than households headed by person under age 65 they spend higher share of their income on energyrelated expenditures as shown in table 3 in 2006 older households spent 95 of their income on energyrelated services compared to 74 for younger households in 2006 among older households lowerincome elderly spend significantly more as share of income for energyrelated services compared to those with higher incomes older households with less than 15000 in household income spent approximately 20 of their income for energyrelated expenditures as compared to 73 for elderly households with incomes over 15000 in 2006 for utilities and fuel these same households spent 13 of their income to heat and operate their homes compared to only 47 for older households with 15000 or more in income see table 4 the 15000 threshold for household income in table 4 is close approximation to older households that have incomes below crs4 or near 150 of poverty5 the 150 of poverty threshold is used by current public programs that provide lowincome energy assistance to households see discussion below in 2006 about 22 of older americans had family incomes below 150 of the poverty thresholds6 these estimates are for 2006 and do not reflect the additional 17 increase in energy prices that occurred in 2007 table 3 average annual household energy expenditures by

calculations from 2006 bls consumer expenditures survey data over time growth in energy expenditures has increased faster than income of older households see figure 1 however among older households the data indicate that energyrelated spending for lowincome households is not increasing as fast as overall energy prices or energyrelated spending for higherincome households average annual energyrelated spending for lowincome households after adjusting for inflation has increased only 59 since 2000 compared to 20 for higherincome households see table 4 this difference may reflect lowerincome households changing their behavior in response to rising energy costs according to an aarp survey older americans with household incomes below 25000 are significantly more likely to reduce their savings and other spending to offset higher gasoline prices7 other alternatives that households explore in response to rising energy costs have included replacing heating and cooling systems with more energyefficient units installing energyefficient windows and purchasing more fuelefficient cars although these alternatives may save costs in the longerrun many lowerincome households do not have sufficient funds to purchase them 5 the average size of households with less than 15000 in income is 12 for example if 80 are living alone and 20 are married and the poverty thresholds of 9669 for single and 12201 for married are weighted 809669201220110175 then 150 of the weighted poverty threshold 10175 would equal 15263 or approximately 15000 6 see crs report rl32697 income and poverty

survey and us bureau of census select years implications for public programs the key public program that provides energy assistance to lowincome households is the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap liheap was established in 1981 pl 9735 and is block grant program under which the federal government makes annual grants to states territories and tribes to operate home energy assistance programs for lowincome households the liheap statute authorizes two types of funds block grant funds which are allocated to all states using statutory formula and contingency funds which are allocated to one or more states at the discretion of the administration crs6 federal law limits liheap eligibility to households with incomes up to 150 of the federal poverty guidelines or if greater 60 of the state median income states may adopt lower income limits but household with income below 110 of the poverty guidelines may be considered ineligible8 in fy2004 the most recent year for which data are available 40 of lowincome households eligible for liheap had member aged 60 or older9 over time while energy costs have risen as share of income public programs like liheap have faced declining funding while utility and fuel expenditures have increased 346 from 2000 to 2005 the average benefit for liheap has increased 126 over the same time period10 these estimates do not include growth rates between 2005 and 2007 during which time energy prices increased another 208 in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 congress appropriated 198 billion in liheap funds and an additional 590 million in contingency funds in the 110th congress two bills have been introduced that would appropriate an additional 1 billion in liheap contingency funds both bills hr 4275 and s 2405 are entitled the keeping americans warm act in addition number of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22826 bills have been introduced that would provide additional funds for liheap through various means including penalties collected from energy suppliers and profits from carbon allowance trading11 s 1238 the energy security and corporate accountability act of 2007 has also been introduced in the 110th congress and would allow lowincome households eligible under the liheap program to be eligible for state funds to assist them in paying transportation expenses associated with gasoline and motor oil purchases as well as public transportation 8 for more detail on liheap and spending by state see crs report rl31865 the low income home energy assistance program liheap program
