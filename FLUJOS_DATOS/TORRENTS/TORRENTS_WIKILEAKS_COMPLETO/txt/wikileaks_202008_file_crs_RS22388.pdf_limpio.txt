record shows that congress at the time the 96th congress clearly concurred with the strategic imperative of normalizing relations with th prc many members were unhappy with what they saw as the carter administrati ons minimal proposals for conti nued dealings with the roc government on taiwan in particular some were concerned that the package of legislation the white house submitted to cong ress to govern future unofficial relations with taiwan the taiwan enabling act did not go far enough in protecting either taiwan or us interests congressional debate on the gislation in 1979 was extensive and complicated the end result was passa ge of much amended version of the administrations proposal the taiwan re lations act tra pl 968 which remains the domestic legal authority for conduc ting unofficial us relations with taiwan today8 much of the tra deals with the logistics of ustaiwan relations the establishment of the american institute in taiwan ait as the unofficial us representative for diplomatic interactions with taiwan including details about its staffing functions and funding and the continued application of exis ting us laws and treaties affecting taiwan after the severing of ties9 of particular relevance for longterm us policy are section 2 b and section 3 of the tra dealing with us strategic interests in and arms sales commitments to taiwan10

communique was being negotiated the taiwan government presented the united states with six points it proposed be us ed as guidelines in conducting ustaiwan relations according to former ambassador john holdridge the united states agreed to these points the socalled six assurances the six points included assurances that the united states would not set date for termination of ar ms sales to taiwan would not alter the terms of the taiwan relations act and would not pressu re taiwan to negotiate with china or act as mediator between taiwan and china see crs report 96246 for text of the six assurancesus arms sales commitments to taiwan although it is common american misperception that the tra mandates the united states to defend taiwan in case of attack nothing in the tra specifically obligates the united states to come to the defense of taiwan or to resort to military conflict on taiwans behalf section 2 of the tra speaks in broad terms about us interests for p eaceful resolution to the taiwan question saying that any forceful resolution would be of grave concern to the united states and further states that us policy is to maintain the capacity of the united states to resistcoercion in addressing the taiwan issue section 3 provides for the sale of us defense articles and serv ices to taiwan but it is non specific about the nature of these articles it merely calls for such fense articles and servi cesas may be necessary to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense capability and gives congress role in determining what needs taiwan may have much of the us debate on taiwan arms sales since the tra was enacted has involved differing judg ments often between congress and the white house about what should be the capabilities and quantities of the necessary articles and services pr ovided for in section 3 of the tra11 strategic ambiguity after normalization of sinous relations and the severing of the usroc military alliance the prc was largely satisfied with us onechina formulations alluding to taiwans political status but upon congress passage of the tra prc leaders objected strenuously to th acts provision for continued us arms sales to taiwan after two years of bilateral tensions usprc joint communique the third and final sinous communique since nixons opening to china in 1972 addressed this point on augu st 17 1 982 in that co mmunique the prc cited it had fundamental policy of striving for p eaceful solution to the taiwan question while washington stated that the us did not seek to carry out longterm policy of arms sales to taiwan that its arms sales to taiwan will not exceed either in qualitative or quantitative terms the level of those supplied in recent years since the establis hment of diplomatic relations between the united states and china and that it intends to reduce gradually its sales of arms to taiwan12 the three usprc communiques and the 1979 taiwan relations act for decades served as the framework by which us officials balanced two competing policy objectives widely referred to as us str ategic ambiguity about taiwan on the one hand were three communiques in which us policymakers recognized the legitimacy of the prc government appeared to acknow ledge there was only one china and suggested an eventual ending point to us weapons sales to taiwa n on the other washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22388crs5 13 in his three noes statement of june 30 1998 pr esident clinton said we dont believe that taiwan should be member of any organizati on for which statehood is requirement others have challenged this as misinterpretation of ction 4d of the tra nothing in this act may be construed as basis for supporting the excl usion or expulsion of taiwan from continued membership in any international financial ins titution or any other international organization 14 section 2b3 of the tra states that it is us policy to make clear that the united states decision to establish diplomatic relations with the prc rests upon the expectation that the continuedthe tra in which the united states established statutory framework for maintaining extensive unofficial contacts with taiwan and which committed the united states to providing weapons for taiwans defense ag ainst what most saw as taiwans only potential enemy the prc strategic ambiguity remained the basis of us taiwan policy throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s and many observers give it much of the credit for helping to facilitate uschina relations preserve ustaiwan contacts and protect taiwans own politi cal and economic interests policy implications and issues for congress despite the policy framework of the tra and the three communiques taiwan continues to be particularly complex issue for us policy and recurring issue for congress some of these complicating factors are old problems arising from the political compromises that the 1979 normalization pro cess demanded notably the onechina formulation us security interests in and arms sales to taiwan and the us position on taiwans status in key international organizations other complications are the result of changing political trends particularly in ta iwan that have placed increasing strains on the policy framework these issues crop up periodically in congre ssional debate today in ways that send policymakers back to the basic tenets of ustaiwanchina relations one such recurring issue concerns the us position on taiwans membership in international organizations such as the world health organization and the united nations many claim that the william clint on administrations statement on this issue in 1998 is significant misinterpretation of the relevant provision in the tra13 another such issue concerns the us one china policy formulation although the united states has never repudiated and in f act has continued to restate that commitment purists can argue that the us iterations of the one china policy over the years have departed from the original formulation in s ubtle but significant ways despite the 1982 communique in which the united states expressed intent to reduce and eventually end annual arms sales to ta iwan such sales not only have c ontinued but in some years have increased substantially notably with the george w bush administrations april 2001 weapons sale package to taiwan that included among other systems four decommissioned kiddclass destroyers 12 antis ubmarine warfare p3 aircraft and eight diesel submarines this sale was surpassed in size and value only by the 1992 sale of 150 f16 aircraft to taiwan by the ge orge h w bush administration debate also regularly recurs over what the united states should do if the prc uses force against taiwan some focus on the lack of any mandate in the tra for us military intervention while others state that the tra bases the entire foundation of us prc official relations on the premise that taiwans future will be resolved peacefully14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22388crs6 14 continued future of taiwan will be determined by peaceful means 15 see crs issue brief ib98034 taiwan recent developments and us policy choices by kerry dumbaugh 16 in september 2005 for example at the u staiwan business councildefense industry conference 2005 edward ross dire ctor of the us defense partments defense security cooperation agency strongly criticized the politicization of security issues in taiwan saying it was reasonable to question why the united states should invest in taiwans selfdefense if taiwan itself were not willing to invest in itmany believe that the potential for us military conflict with china over taiwan has grown in recent years given the prcs military buildup opposite taiwan beijings refusal to renounce using force against th island and us defense commitments but the biggest complicating factor for us policymakers today may come from taiwans own political circumstances which have changed dramatically since congress passed the 1979 tra15 under the authoritarian rule of chiang kaisheks nationalist party also known as the kmt taiwans politi cal decisions were pr edictable closely aligned with us interests and dependent largely on us support but several decades of political reforms have made taiwan politics today both more democratic and more nationalistic taiwans current elected president chen shuibian is member of the democratic progressi ve party dpp protaiwan independence opposition party that did not legally exist until 1986 political diffe rences between president chen and the legislature in taiwan still unde r the control of kmtdomin ated coalition have resulted in political polarization that among other thin gs has blocked funds for the purchase of the us military weapons package approved for sale under the tra in 2001 administration officials have expressed growing concerns ove r taiwans political polarization the effects of president chens more assertive policies and the complications these present for us policy16 faced with the historical record and with continuing transformations in both the prc and taiwan political systems us officials may be facing new and more difficult policy choices concerning taiwan in the coming years in addition to raising the risks of political and economic instability some suggest that political polarization in taiwan could erode the quality of ustaiwan contacts and create fractures within the sizeable us chineseamerican community pressure from multiple sources could continue to build for us officials to take any number of actions to reassess all the fundamentals of us chinataiwan policy in light of changing circumstances to reinforce american democratic values by providing greater support for taiwan and possibly support for taiwan independence to significantly reduce us defense ties to taiwan in response to taipeis continued rejection of the 2001 arms package or to abandon taiwan in favor of the geopolitical demands and benefits of close uschina relations us officials could face increasing pressure to abandon the trad itional noninvolvement us approach and instead adopt mediating role in the cr ossstrait relationship finally any policy developments that affect taiw an have direct consequences for uschina relations and could involve crucial decisions among us fficials about the extent of us support for taiwans security
