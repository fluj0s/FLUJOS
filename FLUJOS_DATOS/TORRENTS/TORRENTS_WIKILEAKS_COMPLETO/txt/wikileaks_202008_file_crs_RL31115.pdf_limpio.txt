controversies for the 109th congress by m lynne corn bernard gelb and pamela baldwinlegal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr introduction congress is currently considering whether to permit drilling for oil and gas in the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to designate the area as wilderness or to retain the st atus quo of ma intaining the refuge without drilling1 current law prohibits the production of oil and gas in the refuge but high prices for oil and natural gas have renewed bate over whether to open the refuge to development on april 21 2005 the house passed hr 6 comprehensive energy bill that includes title xxii arctic coastal plain domestic energy opening the refuge to oil and gas development on april 28 2005 both the house and senate agreed to hconres 95 budget re solution that may necessitate oil and gas drilling in the refuge to meet the budget reconciliation target s and could permit legislation on such drilling to be enacted on simple majority vote without the possibility of filibuster2 the land ownerships and ws relevant to possible development in the refuge are complex and the polic choices controversial3 the environmental protections provided in hr 6 and the effects on the refuge and its wildlife that might result from oil and gas development are central to the debate on whether to open the refuge to drilling attention has focused on 2207a3 of hr 6 that would impose 2000 acre limit on the surface of the coastal pl ain that can be covered with support structures associated with oil and gas development however this limit may not apply to some or all of the more than 100000 acres of native lands in the refuge legal issues that relate to possible development of the refuge and the recent proposals regarding possible leasing in anwr are discussed in this report this report will be updated as circumstances warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs2 4 8 fed reg

19 million acres located at the northeast corner of alaska directly adjacent to canada the coastal plain of the refuge on the beaufort sea is approximate ly 15 million acres and is the part of the refuge that is richest in wildlife and migratory birds including the porcupine caribou herd polar bears musk oxen eagles snow geese and many others the coastal plain is directly east of prudhoe bay state owned oil field that has provided large volume of oil and many expe rts believe that significant deposits of oil and natural gas may exist under the refuge as well the presence of biological and wilderness values together with the potential for larg hydrocarbon deposits results in the current controversy over whether to allow oil drilling in the refuge all lands on the north slope were w ithdrawn january 22 1943 by plo 824 in november 1957 an application for the w ithdrawal of lands to create an arctic wildlife range was filed to protect the area s wealth of wildlife and migratory birds under the regulations in effect at that time this application segregated the lands in question removing them from disposal this fact was important because on july 7 1958 the alaska statehood act was pa ssed and on january 3 1959 alaska was formally admitted to the union on december 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued public land order 2214 reserving the area as the arctic national wildlife range5 the supreme court has held that the initial segregation of lands before statehood was sufficient to prevent the passa ge of ownership of certain submerged lands within the refuge to th state of alaska at statehood6 if this ruling had been in favor of alaska certain lands beneath the rivers in the coastal plain might have belonged to the state which could have developed the resources in them including the oil gas gravel and water in 1971 congress enacted the alaska na tive claims settleme nt act ancsa7 to resolve native claims against the unite d states this act provided the opportunity for the selection and conveyance of lands to native groups usually either the surface estate of lands to native village corporations or the subsurface estate to native regional corporations associated with the village corporations within each region usually the regiona l corporations could recei ve the lands beneath the village corporations in their area but subsurface lands beneath pre1971refuges were not available and inlieu lands were substituted for them under 22g of ancsa surface lands conveyed in such re fuges were subject to the regulations

had renamed the range the william douglas arctic wildlife range anilca did not address this proclamation but renamed the lands comprising the original range and the added lands as the arctic national wildlife refuge 10 section 3032 11 it is not clear whether this language was intentional but it may have been intended to allow preliminary activities in the additiona l lands that were added to the refugein 1980 congress enacted the alaska nati onal interest lands conservation act anilca8 which among other things renamed the range9 to be the arctic national wildlife refuge and expanded th refuge to include an additional 92 million acres mostly to the south10 section 7023 of anilca designated much of the original range as wilderness area but did not include the coastal plain instead congress postponed decisions on the developmen t or further protection of the coastal plain section 1002 of anilca di rected that all of the res ources of the coastal plain of the refuge be studied as result the coastal plain is sometimes referred to as the 1002 area the 1002 area was administr atively articulated as excluding the three townships of land belonging to th kaktovik inupiat corporation kic village corporation however these lands geographically are on the coast of anwr and are very important to the wildlife and scenic resources of the area pursuant to 1431g of anilca kic was entitled to receive approximately 19588 additional acres within the coastal plai n making total of more than 92000 acres of kic lands in the refuge secti on 1003 of anilca prohibited oil and gas development in the refuge as whole nd leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the range unl ess authorized by an act of congress11 in 1983 the united states and the arctic slope regional co rporation asrc native regional corporation executed an agreement the 1983 agreement embodying an exchange of lands under which asrc would receive title to the subsurface estate beneath the kic surface lands in the refuge normally asrc could not have received these lands because they were in refuge by the terms of the 1983 agreement the asrc lands in anwr cannot be developed unless congress opens anwr the asrc lands or both to oil development conversely if congress opens anwr then the more than 92000 acres of native lands kic surfaceasrc subsurface in the four townships within the refuge could be developed these extensive native holdings would be affected by the authorization of oil and gas development on the coastal plain and in turn could also affect the refuge and its resources in addition th ere are individually ow ned native allotments within the refuge that might be developed if oil and gas drilling is allowed all types of native lands within the refuge total more than 100000 acres the separate environmental constraints of the 1983 ag reement on asrcs exploratory activities apply unless they are superseded by statute or regulations and asrc also agreed to be bound by regulations on federal leases that are designed to protect the environment of the coastal plain whet her particular limitations such as the 2000 acre limit would apply is not clear at this

of several legal aspects of possible drilling in the refuge appears timely issues i environmental constraints one of the most controversial aspects of any consideration of possible leasing in the refuge is what the environmental effects of leasing are likely to be there have been vigorous assertions on both sides either that the bills that have been considered are highly protective of the environment or that they are not hence the environmental aspects of any bills are of par ticular interest some of the most critical elements in an analysis of environmental provisions of any bills are 1 the agency that would administer the leasing program 2 the compatibility of leasing with the purposes of the refuge 3 the standard for environmental pr otection and how might it function in practice 4 the level of industrial chnology required 5 the protections that would be statutorily provi ded with respect to the wildlife resources of the refuge 6 compliance with the national environmental policy act 7 the 2000 acre footprint limitation and 8 the ex tent to which administrative decisions and actions implementing leasing program would be judicially reviewable this last item will prima rily be discussed ter in this report under the heading judicial review this section discusses only the nvironmental constraints applicable to the federal lands for discussion of possi ble environmental c onstraints on native lands see native lands below administration of leasing under the national wildlife refuge system administration act refuge administration act on the management of the national wildlife refuge system it is the secretary of the interior acting through the united states fish and wildlife service who is to administer refuge lands12 this language was added by congress in 1976 to clarify th at management of refuges could not be administratively assigned to other agencies13 several provisions in the refuge administration act address the management of refuges in alaska for example planning for the management of re fuge lands in alaska is to be governed by the refuge planning provisions of anilca14 and 304g of anilca provides planning procedures for refuges in alaska and other provisions on refuge management under current law applicable to nonalas kan refuges when evaluating whether to approve an activity in refuge the director of the fws or an fws officer to whom the duties are delegated may approve an activity only if it is compatible with the major purposes for which the system and the particular unit were created longerterm uses must be compatible with all the purposes major or otherwise of both the system and the particular unit 16 usc 668ddd under 304 ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs5 15 16 usc 668dda1 16 see secretarial order

or political subdi visions of the state with respect to lands within adjacent to or near any national wildlife refuge which agreements shall provide that the land subject to the agreement shall be managed by the owner or occupant in manner compatible with the major purposes of the refuge section 304 of anilca also generally wit hdraws all public lands including whatever submerged lands if any were retained in federal ownership at the time of statehood but does not withdraw them from the operation of mineral leasing laws similarly the refuge administration act does not w ithdraw nonalaskan refuges from possible oil and gas leasing but many individua l units are so withdrawn and leasing is allowed on very few also with respect to refuges in alaska the refuge administration act expressly subjects resource management by any other agency of the federal government under cooperative agreements to dir ect supervision by the fws with respect to refuge lands in the state of alaska those programs relating to the management of resources for which any other agency of the federal government exercises administrative responsib ility through c ooperative agreement shall remain in effect subject to the direct supervision of the united states fish and wildlife service as long as such agency agrees to exercise such responsibility15 although the bureau of land management blm another agency also in the department of the interior is currently the general mineral development manager for the united states16 the mineral leasing act does not specify that the secretary of the interior is to administer leasing through that agency current mineral leasing regulations recognize the authority of fws over the wildlife resources on refuge lands and reserve considerable authority to the director of fws with respect to oil and gas leasing in refuges sole and complete jurisdiction ov er such lands for wildlife conservation purposes is vested in the fish and wildlife service even though such lands may be subject to prior rights for other public purposes or by the terms of the withdrawal order may be subject to mineral leasing b there is to be drilling or pros pecting under any mineral lease heretofore or hereafter issued on lands within w ildlife refuge except with the consent and approval of the secretary with the conc urrence of the fish and wildlife service as to the time place and nature of ch operations in order to give complete protection to wildlife populations and wild life habitat on the areas leased and all such operations shall be conducted in acco rdance with the stipulations of the bureau on form approved by the director of the national wildlife refuge system17 this protective posture is repeated in another regulation that

alas ka that are open to leasing are not to be available until the fws has first completed compatibility determinations19 new compatibility policy and ne w regulations were publis hed on october 18 2000 and became effective november 17 200020 compatible use is defined as proposed or existing wildlifedependent recreational use or any othe r use of national wildlife refuge that based on sound pr ofessional judgment will not materially in terfere with or detract from the fulfillment of the nati onal wildlife refuge system mission or the purposes of the nati onal wildlife refuge21 as will be discussed native lands in alaskan refuges that are subject to certain restrictions under 22g of ancsa are expressly subject to the special regulations on compatibility in 50 cfr 25 and 2622 plo 2214 which withdrew lands to create the original arctic national wildlife range withdrew the lands from operati on of the mining laws but not from the mineral leasing laws congress in 1003 of anilca reserved to itself the decision of whether to lease the coastal plain area23 the current bills would authorize oil and gas leasing and address both management and compatibility hr 6 states in 2203a that leasin g is to be under the mineral leasing act mla24 and administered by the secretary of the interior acting through the director of the bureau of land management blm as noted above generally leasing under the mla is conducted by the blm with the concurrence of and under stipulations provided by the director of fws when the leasing is in refuge because there is reference to the usual powers of the director of fws and because under 2203 of hr 6 the secretary is to impose envi ronmental constraints through new leasing regulations and other measures the role of the fws is not yet clear in 1981 court found the administrative assignment of responsibility for studying the coastal plain area under 1002 of anilca to the united states geological survey rather than to fws to be unlawful because the refuge administration act requires that the refuge system be administered by the secretary of interior through fws absent clear ly expressed legislative intent to

measures involving appropriate technology engineering and environmental control measures including siting and timing re strictions are likely to result in widespread continuedcontrary25 hr 6 expressly assigns leasing responsibilities to the blm in consultation with the director of fws arguably placing blm in charge of the leasing program for anwr and evidently reducing the otherwise applicable role of fws could divorce the mineral developmen t aspects from the biologicalwildlife purposes and the expertise of fws personnel and may result in the coastal plain of anwr receiving less protection than lands in other refuges do under current law and regulations however the bill does not expressly modify the usual authority of fws to manage and protect the refuge res ources and to condition mineral leases therefore an argument can be made that fws retains that authority and would develop the environmental constraints on surface disturbance in the leasing regulations however the intent of congress in this regard is not clear as the legislation evolves the respective jurisdictions of blm and fws in this context may be clarified both the 1983 agreement and many pa st bills in congress continued responsibility for anwr leasing with the fws subject to congressionally enacted direction pursuant to 1002 of anilca the fws adopted regulations see 50 cfr part 37 governing the explorator activities that took place in the refuge b compatibility section 2203c1 of hr 6 states that for purposes of the national wildlife refuge administration act the oil and gas leasing program and activities authorized in that section are deemed to be compatible with the purposes for which the arctic national wildlife refuge was established and that further findings or decisions are requi red to implement this determination emphasis added this provision both answers the compatibility question and appears to eliminate the usual compatibility determination processes for purposes of refuge management it does not however resolve all ambiguities as to what extent and by whom impacts resulting from activities occurring on federal and native lands may be regulated see native lands secti on below also the general statement that leasing activities are compatible arguably may encompass great many actions such as construction and ope ration of port facilities stag ing areas personnel centers etc c environmental standard hr 6 uses significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife their habitat subsis tence resources and the environment as the standard to guide leasing this phrase is not defined but has been used in the past it was used in 1002 of anilca as the st andard for the limited exploration of the coastal plain allowed under that section it is used throughout the 1983 agreement in past bills that would have authorized leasing in anwr and it is used with respect to leasing in the npra26 arguably it could be seen as analogous to the

national environmental policy act nepa which is significant effect on the quality of the human environment in practice this has been interpreted as addressing only significant adverse effects although the contexts are different judicial interpretation of nepa may provide guidance in applying the standard the standard of significant adverse effects might allow considerable environmental harm before the threshold is crossed lthough the standard has been used before congress has also chosen other more protective language at times for example the language congress used with respect to exploration in environmentally sensitive areas of the national petroleum reserve alaska was to assure the maximum protection of such surface values consistent with the requirements of this act for the exploration of the reserve27 another example of other language congress has used is the wilderness act of 1964 which requires that mineral leases in wilderness areas shall contain such reas onable stipulations as may be prescribed by the secretary of agriculture for the protection of the wilderness character of the land consistent with the use of the land fo r the purposes for which they are leased permitted or licensed28 statute that addresses already existing mining rights in national parks requires that mining rights be subject to such regulations prescribed by the secretary of the interior as he deems necessary or desirable for the preservation and manage ment of those areas29 in anwr congress would be authorizing new leasing in special stat ute and hence would have greater latitude to impose protective standard w ithout infringing upon existing rights d technology standard section 2203a of hr 6 would require the use of the best commercially available technology for oil and gas exploration development and production and 2207a2 would require that standard for all new exploration development and produc tion operations computer search indicates that the phrase best commercially available technology is not currently used in the us code and does not have any available judicial interpretation30 because it refers to technology that already is more widely available it may be more lenient standard than best availa ble technology economically achievable or best practicable control technology both of which standards are used in the clean water act31 section 2203a2 goes on to di rect that the best commercially available technology standard be applied in manner that ensures the receipt of fairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs9 32 for additional discussion of issues rela ted to

directional drilling which permits horizontal drilling under special areas although the two terms are similar in common usage directional drilling may be the broader term and the same term should be used in both the caption and substance of the section market value for the public for the mineral resources to be leased it is not clear how this additional requireme nt might affect the app lication of the standard specific environmental protections hr 6 would provide some specific environmental protections but woul d leave much to the discretion of the secretary the evaluations of environment effects made by the secretary and the particular actions taken by the secretary in the exercise of the secretarys discretion would be insulated under 2208 by the string ent provisions on judi cial review see judicial review below this fact that the secretarys environmental choices could be difficult to overturn is relevant to many of the provisions discussed in this part 2000 acre limitation section 2207a3 of hr 6 contains an acreage limitation on surface area that can be cove red by production nd support facilities the language provides that the max imum amount of surface acreage covered by production and support f acilities including airstrips nd any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for support of pipelines not exceed 2000 acres on the coastal plain the reference to surface acreage cove red by production nd support facilities appears to exclude the parts of structur and facilities that dont touch the ground eg the pipes in elevated pipelines tw thousand acres is small amount relative to the 15 million acre plain however give n that the secretar would be required to lease not less than 200000 acres in the fi rst lease sale greater footprint might prove necessary and this limitation would be changed also it is likely that oil development facilities would not be in single consolidated footprint but would be scattered over much larger area and be connected by pipelines and possibly roads that would impact much larger area32 equally important if oil and gas were discovered in commercial quantities it appears that support and development facilities could be c onstructed on some or all of the more than 100000 acres of native lands in the refuge free of the 2000 acre limitation see native lands below special areas section 2203e of hr 6 pr ovides that the secretary after consultation with the state of alaska city of kaktovik and the north slope borough is authorized to designate up to total of 45000 acres of the coastal plain as special areas and to clos such areas to leasing if the secretary determines that they are of such unique character and interest so as to require special management and regulatory protection however closure is discre tionary and designated areas could be leased if the secretary prohibits surface occupancy by lessees33 t h i s provision does not expressly re quire consultation with the fws and the secretary could implement the advice of state and local entities as to designation special protection and possible closure of unique and special areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs10 this section would also impose an acreage limit of 45000 acres out of the 15 million coastal plain acres that could be designated as special areas for optional special protection or closure the secretary is directed to designate the sadlerochit spring area approximately 4000 acres as special area and to manage the special areas to protect and preserve the areas unique and diverse character including its fish wildlife and subsisten ce resource values the closure authority in the bill is stated as being the sole source of closure authority this might eliminate any separate author ity under the refuge administration act to close areas and also raises the question of whether closure is an available option if it is determined to be necessary to avoid jeopardizing species under the endangered species act possibly esanecessitated cl osures could exhaust the acreage available for closure making that t ool unavailable where closure is merely desirable to avoid harm rather than being crucia l to survival of species seasonal closures section 2206a2 provides that the secretary may use lease terms to close on seasonal basi s portions of the coastal plain to exploratory drilling activities as necessary to protect caribou calving areas and other species of fish and wildlife and 2207d2 author izes seasonal limitations on exploration development and related ac tivities where necessary to avoid significant adverse effects during periods of concentrated fi sh and wildlife breeding denning nesting spawning and migration language that did not expressly include the word production it is not clear what would ve needed to be shown to demonstrate the necessity of seasonal closures or to demonstr ate effects sufficiently significant and adverse to justify closure it also is not clear whether seasonal closure areas would have counted toward the acreage limitation on closures but probably they would not environmental regulations under 2203 of hr 6 the secretary is to develop regulations to govern the leasing of the coastal plain within 15 months of enactment and under 2204e1 the first l ease sale is to be held within 22 months after enactment see the heading nepa compliance below for discussion of the fact that other bill provisions would eliminate comprehensive new environmental studies in order to achieve this accelerated leasing schedule the leasing regulations required under the house bill are required to include regulations that relate to the protection of the fish and wildlife their habitat subsistence resources and the environment of the coastal plain in addition the secretary is directed to impose terms and conditions on leases to address environmental concerns the environm ental provisions would undoubtedly provide some protections but the net import of some of the provisions is unclear under 2206a6 environmental conditions could be part of lease as required pursuant to 2203a2 emphasis added this language might mean only as required to avoid s ignificant adverse effects reclamation the reclamation standard in 2206a5 requires reclamation to condition capable of supporting the uses which the lands were capable of

standards at least as effective as the safety and environmental mitigation measures set forth in items 1 through 29 at pa ges 167169 of the final legislative environmental impact statement apr il 1987 on the coastal plain these measures include many bene ficial items but some of the measures by regulating certain activities may basica lly condone those ac tivities eg the provisions that address roads and other permanent infrastructure facilities incinerators marine facilities docks causeways etc although the hr 6 language requires the new anwr leasing standards to be at least as effective as the 1987 measures and therefore allows more stringent measur additional statut ory requirements and guidance might provide clarity regarding some of those important infrastructure topics and to guide

posture however under 2207b3 this plan is to be deve loped after consultation with the agency or agencies having jurisdiction over matters mitigated by the plan apparently this last reference is to the fws which ag ency under current law has the authority to develop and approve of such plans and activities rather than merely to consult regarding them exploration section 2207d3 requires that exploration activities be limited to the winter and be supported by ice ro ads etc but then also provides that the secretary may allow other exploration if the secretary finds such exploration would

five exceptions to the taking prohibition which party to the agreemen t may allow these exceptions include several relating to traditional take by partys nationals take for scientific purposes for conservation purposes or to prevent rious disturbance of the management of other living resources article ii of the agreement requires certain actions to protect habitat of the bears parties are to 1 take appropriate action to protect th ecosystem of which polar bears are part 2 give special attention to habitat components such as denning and feeding sites and migration patterns and 3 manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data recently some critics have sserted that oil and gas development in the arctic may be

increasingly im portant to the polar bears thereby making development more significant 44 donald c baur reconciling polar bear protection under united states laws and the continuedregard40 one of the principal issues raised is that the mmpa permits the unintentional taking of polar bears incidental to other lawful activities the draft report asserts that such take would be inconsistent with the agreement because there is exception for such take in article i or iii and if lethal take were to occur during activities c onducted under incidental take authority the united states arguably could be considered to not be in compliance with the agreement41 however the argument can be made that all references to killing or taking polar bears in the agreement whether in the prohibition or the exceptions sections are to intentional take given this fact the argu ment could continue it is not inconsistent with the agreement for an implementing law to permit but regulate incidental take that this could be an appropriate interpretation is bolstered by the wording of the discussion accompanying the recommendation to ratify the agreement which also discusses only intentional takes whethe r through hunting or for other specified reasons42 furthermore the state department in presenting the agreement to the president for transmission to the senate for its advice and consent took the position that the mmpa provided adequate domestic legislation to implement the terms and provisions set forth in the agreement however more generalized argument could be made that the opening of anwr to leasing with concomitant development of the native coastal lands either per or as such development progressed in actuality could violate the pledge by the united states to protect the eco system upon which the bears depend43 in such an eventuality recourse would be available to the other parties to the agreement but the argument exists as policy argument against such leasing activities and at least one commentator asserts that such leasing might result in an inconsistency with the agreement such that either the ag reement or the mmpa should be amended the polar bear agreement does not authorize incidental take within the polar bear protection zone such takes are authorized under section 101a5 of the mmpa because the agreement does not now prohibit harassment an inconsistency exists only to the extent such takes would be lethal involve the capture of bears or be product of hab itat degradation or destruction because there is potential for polar bears to be thally taken incidental to activities such as oil and gas operations it is necessary to either amend the agreement or to amend the mmpa to prohibit such takes if consistency with the agreement is the goal takes by harassment could still be allowed under the mmpa consistent with the agreement44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs14 44 continued international agreement for the conservation of polar bears 2 nimal law 9 85

airstrips disposal of wastes gravel mining water sources etc many details of the environmental constraints are left to the leasing regulations that are to be developed by the secretary with very little advance study and little statutory guidance other than the avoidance of significant adverse effect s the role of the fws is ambiguous but would be less than under its current author ity many decisions relating to the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the refuge and the protection of the environment in general would be committed to the discretion of the secretary acting through the director of blm whose c hoices would be difficult to challenge under the strict standards for judicial review hr 6 would apparently rely principally on the penalties available under the

native lands in the refuge total over 100000 acres and although some of the most important elements in assessing the possible impacts of opening anwr to leasing involve the property intere sts of

unless the terms of the agreement are superseded by statute or regulations statutory and regulatory leasing requirement s designed to protect wildlife and the coastal plain would apply to developmen t

however at this time the subsurface was still federa l and its development was s ubject to federal regulation further it is important to note that geog raphically the kic lands are on the coastal plain and are important to the wildlife of the area section 103c of anilca states that only the public lands within the boundaries of an conservation system unit ar deemed to be included as portion of the unit and that nonpublic lands ie conveyed native or state lands are not subject to the regulations applicable solely to the public lands within such units this issue of separate regu lations is addressed sewhere in this report under 1431g of anilca kic was au thorized to obtain additional lands and obtained the rights to fourth townsh ip in the 1002 area as result kic has surface rights to three townships along the coast of anwr that are outside the defined coastal plain and one township inside that area all totaling approximately 92160 acres however all of the kic lands are within the

instead of proceeding at some future date with an exchange under th 1431o aut hority then secretary of the interior james g watt on august 9 1983 four months after pub lishing the legal description of the 1002 area that excluded the kic lands ba sed on nonfederal mineral ownership entered into an exchange agreement known as the 1983 agreement or the chandler lake agreement after lands acquired by the united states in the gates of the arctic national park using the ge neral exchange authority of 1302h of anilca under this agreement the united states received the surface rights to certain lands elsewhere in alaska and asrc received the subsurface rights beneath the kic lands but any oil and gas deve lopment of these lands was expressly contingent on congress authorizing such development section 1431o4 of anilca provides that the secretary may promulgate regulations regarding the subsurface estates acquired pursuant to that subsection to protect the environmental values of the re serve or range consis tent with regulations governing the development of those lands within the reserve or range which have been opened for purposes of development including 22g regulations however that subsection of anilca did not apply to the asrc exchange in anwr since different exchange authority was utilize d instead the 1983 agreement contained considerable detail relating to exploration and environmental issues thereby making those features matter of contract law asrc also agreed in the 1983 agreement that 22g and hence refuge regulati ons would apply to its lands but with significant additional terms also as part of the chandler lake ag reement asrc was given the contractual right to drill within certain window of time up to three exploratory wells on the kic lands outside the 1002 area one test well was drilled within the specified time but the results of that well have been kept confidential however full oil and gas development of the asrc lands was prohibited

the control of c ongress over whether the coasta l plain would be opened for oil and gas development the report states the committee believes that under current law the secretary of the interior does not have authority to administratively exchange lands within the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife re fuge as defined in section 1002b of anilca congress clearly reserved to itself the sole prerogative to make the decision as to whether anw r would be opened to oil and gas development and if so under what terms and conditi ons section 1003 of anilca states production of oil and gas from the arctic national wildlife refuge is prohibited and leasing or other devel opment leading to production of oil and gas from the range sic shall be undertaken until authorized by an act of congress it is the committees view that the 96th congress did not intend the secretarys general exchange authority under section 1302h to apply to the coastal plain of anwr59 the report goes on to discuss the fact th at the department continued to assert that it had complete and unilateral authority to trade away oil and gas rights to allow exploratory drilling and to waive the righ ts to bonus

after securing legislative approval by an act of congress however this section is not intended to effect sic lands validly selected prior to july 28 198760 this reiteration of congress authority to make the decision regarding oil and gas leasing in the coastal plain of anwr is repeated on p 12 of the report the committee would note that the decision of whether to open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil and gas devel opment is decision which congress has reserved for itself the senate report repeats the language in the house report regarding the fact that congress reserved to itself the right to decide if and when oil and gas leasing would be permitted in anwr and that the new legislation would insure that such congressional prerog ative is preserved61 subsequent legislative history as in later committee report commenting on previous enactment expressing an interpre tation of previous statute is not given much weight because as the supreme court has put it the views of subsequent congress form hazardous basis for in ferring the intent of an earlier one62 however the views of later congress incorporated into later statute must be interpreted and applied nd are given great weight in statutory construction63 still other statutes may be premised on particular interpretation of an earlier statute if so the interpretation may be given effect especially if contrary interpretation would render the amendments poi ntless or ineffectual64 the 1988 amendment to anilca seems somewhere between the latter two interpretive choices the 1988 direction that more

withdrawn by public land order 6959 to allow kic to make its final selections to co mplete its four townships in the refuge65 pursuant to 22h2 of ancsa and 1410 of anilca the order made more lands available than was kics entitlement thereby providing some flexibility as to choices this larger quantity of lands desired by kic had been identified initially in an agreement eff ective january 22 1993 before the plo was issued those lands were withdrawn and under the terms of the january agreement kic was then to have filed selection application and simultaneously submitted prioritization of land choices from which conveyances coul d be completed up to the amount of the entitlement allotments in addition to the kic and asrc native lands there are also individual native allotments within

will be subject to the same or similar controls whether whatever constraints are placed on the federal refuge lands would also pertain to the native lands within the refuge or if not what other constraint s on environmental eff ects and development facilities might apply to the native lands these issues are vitally important to understanding the possible overall effect s of oil development on the refuge in considering this question the vari ous native property interests must be considered separately 1 the interests of kic in the surface estate of lands within the coastal plain and the refuge as whole 2 the interests of asrc in the subsurface and related use of the surface within the coastal plain and the refuge and 3 individual allotments in the coastal plain and refuge as discussed above one town ship of kic lands is in the defined coastal plain three townships are outside the defined coastal plain all are on the geographical coastal plain and within the boundari of the refuge as whole currently asrc has rights to the subsurface beneath the kic lands and beneath allotments both within and outside the coastal plain it is important to note that the 1983 agreement and its appendi ces address oil explorati on and development on the asrc lands and provide that its terms will govern unless superseded by statutory or regulatory provisions although asrc holds the subsurface estate the owner of mineral estate typically has the right to use as much of the surface as may be reasonably necessary to reach and remove the minerals68 the term asrc lands defined in the

subject of paragraph b9 read ing of b9 as whole would seem to indicate that the latter continuedand production activities undertaken on asrc lands will be in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements specifically development on asrc lands surface and subsurface shall be in accordance with the substan tive statutory and regulatory requirements governing oil and gas exploration including exploratory drilling and development and production that are designed to protect the w ildlife its habitat and the environment of the coastal plain or the asrc lands or both emphasis added other provisions of the 1983 agreement so pertain to environmental effects appendix 1 provides that the grant of lands to asrc is subject to 1 the requirements of the second ntence of 22g of ancsa which requires compliance with the regulations of the refuge 6 the covenant that asrc will use the lands in conformance with the land use stipulations att ached as appendix 2 7 the covenant that asrc shall not us those lands or the surface of those lands in any manner that significantly adversely affects the fish and wildlife their habitats or the environment of those lands or arctic national wildlife refuge lands therefore it appears that as general matter the environmental constraints of any bills applicable to the coastal plain arguably would apply to development of all asrc lands both within the coastal plain and outside it70 the same standard the avoidance of significant adverse effects is used in the 1983 agreement and in both bills however absent express new statutory nguage that addre sses the relationship of the new legislation to the 1983 agreemen t and to particular management and land use considerations issues may arise hr 6 leaves much to be fleshed out by the secretary of the interior in new leas ing regulations for the refuge the 1983 agreement contemplates that subsequent legislation and regula tions may supersede its provisions on exploration and will pply to development and production to whatever extent the congressional acts and administrative regulations do not clearly supersede the 1983 agreement it appears that the terms of the agreement will govern oil exploration on the asrc lands paragr aph b9 of appendix 2 pp 2829 states that certain provisions in paragraph b3c m that set out an approval process for plan of operations for oil exploration will remain in effect71 t h i shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs24 71 continued interpretation is more likely the correct one given the importance of this issue congress may wish to clarify this point provision may mean that congress would have to expressly address and change this plan approval process or the terms of the agreement may still govern the referenced paragraph b3c m provisions provide sp ecial process for approval of plan of operations for asrc explor ation under which if the regional director of fish and wildlife service and asrc disa gree as to whether part of proposed plan would significantly adversely affect th wildlife habitat or environment of the asrc lands or refuge lands or would othe rwise be inconsistent with any provision of the agreement ultimately after some prescribed exchanges of written points of view and negotiations the united states must obtain court order restraining implementation of the plan of operations or else asrc will have the right to implement the plan of operations as origina lly proposed or as subsequently modified in other words the opinion of asrc as to harm will prevail unless the united states obtains the agreement of court with its views in every instance should asrc assert that this provision rema ins in effect even if the director of blm rather than the regional director of fws is the responsible leasing official this language appears to impose difficult burden on the united states to assert and control adverse effects of oil and gas ex ploration on native lands also if other terms are not superseded some agreement provisions that were intended as state of the art environmental constraints in 1983 but which are less desirable standards today may pertain for example provisi ons in appendix 2 of the agreement speak to reserve pits and ponds as means for th disposal of wastes on the surface of the refuge while current practice is to rein ject wastes underground rather than using reserve pits other provisions in the agreement also address environmental considerations in ways that might not be considered acceptable today the agreement specifically addresses for example the use of explosives aircraft fires disposal of gray water on the surface of the refuge removal of water from streams incineration fuel pits extraction of sand and gravel and the type and location of support facilities depending on the specific ity of the regulations on exploration that the secretary is to develop some of thes provisions of the agreement that are not expressly superseded may ultimately function to permit pollution and the siting and use of facilities that might not be permitted under current practices hr 6 does not clarify how it relates to the 1983 agr eement with asrc it does not expressly provide that any of its environmental constraints supersede the provisions of that agreement and ther efore arguably the provisions of the agreement on oil and gas exploration apply unless changed in the regulations and so does the general provision that activities on asrc lands will be covered by the statutory and regulatory constraints applicable to federal oil and gas activities specific issues may arise however fo r example the applicability of the 2000 acre surface footprint limitation on the coasta l plain is not clear asrc agreed in the 1983 agreement to be bound by s ubstantive statutory and regulatory requirements designed to protect the wildlife its habita t and the environment of the coastal plain or the asrc lands or both the 1983 agreement defines coastal plainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs25 72 opinion to the director bur eau of sport fisheries and w ildlife from the acting associate solicitor for conservation and wildlife september 11 1973essentially in the same way as does hr 6 therefore at least one township of asrc lands is within the defined coasta l plain and arguably subject to the 2000 acre limitation on any surface use if so how decision might be made as to how to allocate the 2000 acres among federal nd asrc lands in the coastal plain is unclear an argument can also be made that development on all of asrc lands is subject to the 2000 acre limit in that paragr aph b9 states that development on asrc lands shall be in accordance with requirements to protect the wildlife and coastal plain the 2000 acre limit does not appear to pply to surface development on native lands outside the defined coastal plain that is not associated with development of asrc lands eg surface use and development on kic lands that serves federal oil and gas development in the coastal pl ain through support facilities ports dumps airstrips etc some bills in previous congresses have specifically addressed oil development related activities on native lands within the refuge and expressly set out development limitations and specifications together with expedited judicial review of possible native claims for breach of contract or takings under the 5th amendment of the constitution see eg hr 3601 in the 100th congress and hr 1320 in the 102d congre ss which limited port facilities and other development support activities and directed the promulga tion of refugewide regulations within specified time 3 section 22g constraints both the kic and asrc lands are currently subject to 22g of ancsa and hence to the laws and regulations governing anwr the kic lands by the terms of anc sa and asrc lands by the terms of the 1983 agreement and arguably the 1984 barrow gas field act beginning in 1973 analysis of how 22g might apply to native lands in refuge concluded that because the lands were privatelyowned parate regulations were appropriate one set of regulations should govern the use of the public lands within refuge and separate regulations should govern what could be done by natives on their lands the latter regulations should also reflect the fact that the native lands had been conveyed under statute ancsa to acco mplish settlement in conformity with the real economic and social needs of the natives and with their maximum participation72 this interpretation that separate regulations are appropriate was confirmed by certain aspects of anilca notably lang uage in 103c which states that only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands as such term is defined in th is act shall be deemed to be included as portion of such unit lands which before on or after the date of enactment of this act are conveyed to the state to any native corporation orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs26 73 see memorandum from attorney office of the regional solicitor alaska region to the regional director alaska region fish and wildlife service february 17 1983to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units federal lands is defined in 1022 as lands the title to which is in the united states and public landsis defined in 1023 as federa l lands except lands selected by native corporation but not yet conveye d or lands referred to in section 19b of ancsa certain entitlements of village co rporations therefore it appears that the department of the inte rior concluded before the enactment of the barrow statute in 1984 that special regulations applicable to native lands in refuges are appropriate to implement 22g73 before the development of separate compatibility regulations for lands subject to 22g several exchanges including the asrc exchange had contained landuse stipulations to attempt to clarify what could and could not be done on the native lands because 22g requires compliance with the laws and regulations pertaining to the particular refuge of which the native lands are part any law enacted to lease anwr could impose some constraints on th native lands and special regulations governing those lands might also be developed current 43 cfr 265046 states that regulations governing the use and development of refuge lands conveyed pursuant to 14 of ancsa shall permit such uses that will not materially impair the values for which the refuge was established this appears to be standard that would allow considerable range of activities the new compatibility regulations ddress 22g lands and state that compatibility determinations for those lands are to be made in compliance with the requirements stated in the regulations several of which are relevant to this report notably the regulations state for example that only the effects on refuge lands that result from use made on native lands not the use on the native lands itself will be considered and that the refuge management plan will not include the native lands 1i refuge managers will work with 22g landowners in implementation of these regulations the landowners should contact the refuge manager in advance of initiating use and request compatibility determination after compatibility determination is requested refuge managers have longer than ninety 90 days to complete the co mpatibility determination and notify the landowner of the finding by providing copy of the compatibility determination or to inform the landowner of the specific reasons for delay if refuge manager believes that finding of not compatible is likely the refuge manager will notify the landowner prior to rendering decision to encourage dialog on how the proposed use might be modified to be compatible ii refuge managers will allow all uses proposed by 22g landowners when the refuge manager determines the use to be compatible with refuge purposes iii compatibility determinations will include only evaluations of how the proposed use would affect the ability of the refuge to meet its mandatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs27 purposes the national wildlife refuge system mission will not be considered in the evaluation refuge purposes w ill include both preanilca purposes and those established by anilca so long as they do not conflict if conflicts arise anilca purposes will take precedence iv determination that use is not compatible may be appealed by the landowner to the regional director the appeal must be subm itted in wr iting within fortyfive45 days of receipt of the determination the appeals process provided for in 50 cfr 3641i3 through 5 will apply v compatibility determinations for proposed uses of 22g lands will only evaluate the effects of the use on the ad jacent refuge lands and the ability of that refuge to achieve its purposes not on the effects of the proposed use to sic the 22g lands vi compatibility determinations for 22g lands that use is compatible are not subject to reevaluation unless the use changes significantly significant new information is made available that coul d affect the compatibility determination or if requested by the landowner vii refuge comprehensive conservation plans will not include 22g lands and compatibility determinations affecting ch lands will not be automatically re evaluated when the plans are routinely updated viii refuge special use permits will not be required for compatible uses of 22g lands special conditions necessary to ensure proposed use is compatible may be included in the compatibility determination and must be complied with for the use to be considered compatible g except for uses specifically authorized for period longer than 10 years such as rightsofways we will reeva luate compatibility determinations for all existing uses other than wildlifedepe ndent recreational uses when conditions under which the use is permitted change significantly or if there is significant new information regarding the effects of the use or at least every 10 years whichever is earlier in addition refuge manager always may reevaluate the compatability sic of use at any time h for uses in existence on november 17 2000 that were specifically authorized for period longer than 10 years such as rightsofways our compatibility reevaluation will exam ine compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization not the authorization itself we will frequently monitor and review the activity to ensure that the permittee carries out all permit terms and conditions however the service will request modifications to the terms and conditions of these permits from the permittee if the service determines that such changes are nece ssary to ensure that the use remains compatible after november 17 2000 uses will be permitted or re authorized for period longer than 10 ye ars unless the terms and conditions for such longterm permits specifically allo w for modifications to the terms and conditions if necessary to ensure compatibility we will make new compatibility

preuse perspective74 these regulations and the 1983 agreement could allow considerable range of development on the kic and asrc lands unless superseded or elaborated on by new statutory and regulatory leasing provi sions hr 6 provides that oil and gas leasing in the refuge is compatible with the purposes of the refuge and further findings or decisions are required to impleme nt this determination the exact effect of this statutory finding on the scope of possible regulation under 22g is not clear 4 allotments allotments it will be recalle d are lands to which individual native americans have full or partial title in most if not all instances the united states retained the oil and gas and coal beneath allotments but the surface is in non federal ownership and can be developed allotments w ithin the refuge were not subject to the requirement of 22g of ancsa that uses on native lands chosen under that act must comply with the re gulations of the refuge but under the 1983 agreement asrc received the subsurface beneath most allotments in the refuge and agreed to be bound by 22g in its development of them75 the uses that an allottee might make of these lands or permit to be made of these lands could have significant impacts on the refuge if oil development were allowed allotments could be used for st aging areas port development or refuse storage or direct drilling development ther efore the size and location of allotments is relevant to assessing the possible overa ll effects of oil development on the coastal plain and the refuge as noted above so patented allotments are located on the coast but outside the defined coastal plain and in the sadlerochit spring area blm advises that 9797 allotment acr have been conveyed in the refuge and another 1720 acres have been approved other statutes relating to the management of environmentally sensitive federal conservation units have provided for re gulation of valid existing rights and inholdings for example the wilderness act authorizes mineral leasing under such reasonable stipulations as ma be prescribed by the secretary of agriculture for the protection of the wilderness character of th land consistent with the use of the land for the purposes for which they are leased 76 congress also subjected existing mining rights in national parks to such regulations prescribed by the secretary of the interior as he deems necessary or desira ble for the preservation and management of those areas77 as discussed above pl 108337 author izes the subdivision and virtual conveyance of allotments as if th ey were held in fee simple httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs29 hr 6 does not address allo tments within the refuge at all eg by providing for regulated use or for buying them out etc 5 timing section 2203b1 of hr 6 would repeal the 1003 prohibition against oil and gas development in the re fuge thereby allowing such development but would not place any time limitations on activities on native lands leading to development or production even though leasin g regulations for the federal lands are not to be finalized for 15 mont hs as discussed above the b ill does not expressly address the 1983 agreement and which of its provisions are superseded therefore it is not clear that asrc must wait until the federal leasing regulations are completed before moving forward in accordance with the terms of the 1983 agreement it will be recalled that an exploratory well was already drilled on kic lands and some oil companies could be ready to move forward immediately on the native lands express provisions addressing this issue of timing could ensure fair start under the same rules iii access rights of way and exports title xi of anilca provides for rights of way across federal conservation areas for transportation and utility systems s ection 2210a of hr 6 provides that title xi of anilca shall not apply to the i ssuance by the secretary under section 28 of the mineral leasing act of rightsofway and easements across the coastal plain for the transportation of oil and gas emphasis added however access to develop the oil and gas for transportation is not dealt with expressly subsection b of 2210 requires th at terms and conditions on rights of way or easements to transport oil and gas ensure that such transportation does not result in significant adverse effect on the fish and wildlife s ubsistence resources their habitat and the environment of the coastal plain curre nt 30 usc 185h on rights of way under the mla requires that the secretary impose stipulations on the right of way that are designed to control or prevent i damage to the environment including damage to fish and wildlife habitat this standard in current law may be more protective than that in hr 6 the rights of way language in hr 6 ddresses only the trans portation of oil and gas under the mla which section relates onl to pipelines hr 6 does not address access to the areas or other forms of rights of way that might be needed any use of the surface of the federal lands is right of way the areas occupied by drilling pads or other oil development structures for example would require right of way or easement yet the bill does not address these situations as discussed in the first section of this report ambiguities remain as to which agency would otherwise be the managingpermitting authority and with what scope of authority hence it is not clear under the hr 6 which laws and regulations would pertain to nonpipeline rights of ways used in connection with leasing ac tivities title xi of anilca provides process for obtaining rights of way for transportation and utility systems in federal conservation areas in alaska which term includes refuge s and 2210a states only that title xi of anilca does not apply to the issuance of pipeline rights of way the refuge administration act provides at 16 usc 668ddd1b that the secretary acting through the fws may gr ant easements across or upon refuge lands whether these provisions could come into play may depend on how the management division between blm and fws is interprete d arguably too rights of way couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs30 78 under 1323 of anilca 16 usc 3210 the secretary of the interior is to provide access to nonfederally owned land surrounded by national forests or public lands managed under the statute that usually governs blm lands the federal land policy management act flpma however if blm would be admi nistering leasing in the refuge rather than managing the refuge lands under flpma th is anilca access provision appears not to apply 79 16 usc 3170b 80 congress has at times regulated access to i nholdings in other conservation areas for example under 16 usc 1134b access to i nholdings in designated wilderness areas is allowed by reasonable regulations consistent with the preservation of the area as wilderness by means which have been or ar customarily enjoyed with respect to other such areas similarly situated 81 nrdc v lujan 768 f supp 870 ddc 1991be addressed in the regulations authorized by 2203 but it is unclear what statute would provide that authority hr 6 does not address access to the na tive inholdings in the refuge but under 1110b of anilca notwithstanding any other law the secretary is to grant access rights to the owner or occupier of inholdings in conservation system units78 the access rights are to be as may be necessary to assure adequate and feasible access for ec onomic and other purposes to the concerned land such rights shall be subject to reasonable regulations issued by the secr etary to protect the natural and other values of such lands79 as noted the refuge administration act provides that the secretary acting through the fws in that instance may provide permit or grant easements across or upon areas within the refuge system but b ecause of the notwithstanding language in the anilca access provision arguably th is statute would not apply to access easements80 subsection s of 30 usc 185 allows the export of oil transported by pipeline through the transalaska pipeline system taps unless the president determines that export is not in the national interest it has generally been assumed that oil from anwr would be piped over to the taps for transport south to the port of valdez if so then the oil normally could be exported however 2206a8 would require anwr leases to prohibit export of oil produced under the lease iv compliance with nepa some observers question whether the ex isting final legislative environmental impact statement fleis prepared in 1987 to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa is ad equate to support development now or whether supplement or new eis should be prepared court in declaratory judgment action in 199181 held that the doi should have prepared supplemental environmental impact statement seis at that time to encompass new informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs31 about the 1002 area in connection with the departments recommendation that congress legislate to permit development therefore it seems clear that either an seis or new eis would have to be prep ared before developm ent unless congress changes this requirement section 22032 of hr 6 states that the congress finds the 1987 eis adequate to satisfy the legal and procedural requirements of nepa with respect to the actions authorized to be taken by the secretar of the interior in developing and promulgating the regulations for the establishment of the leasing program thereby eliminating the need to redo or update the eis for the leasing regulations under 2203c3 of hr 6 the secretary is dir ected to prepare an eis with respect to actions other than the preparation of the regulations this is noteworthy because only the smaller document an environmental assessment might normally be sufficient depending on the magnitude of the action i nvolved the rest of that paragraph sets out limitations on the alternatives that the secretary must consider as to leasing as though this paragraph re lates only to the leasing stage rather than to all actions the section goes on to say that the secretary is to identify only preferred action for leasing and single alternative and anal yze only those two choices and to consider public comment only on the pr eferred alternative public comments must be submitted within 20 days of publication of the environmental analysis and the secretary may only consider public comments that specifically address the preferred action the analysis on the first lease sale is to be completed within 18 months of enactment compliance with paragraph c3 is stated as satisfying all requirements for consideration and analysis of environm ental effects however paragraph c3 both directs the preparation of an eis for ll actions authorized by the act other than the development of coastal plain leasing regulations yet also speaks as though it is only meant to address proposals for lease sa so the intended import is not clear section 2207b1 of hr 6 requires site specific analysis to study the effects of any drilling or rela ted activities which analysis argu ably must be an eis under the 2203c3 requirement v judicial review hr 6 contemplates prompt action to put leasing program in place and expedites judicial review section 2208 of hr 6 require s that judicial review be sought within 90 days from the date of the action being challenged or the date the complainant knew or reasonably should have known of the grounds for the complaint section 2208a1 requires filing of any cha llenge to the leasing title or to any action of the secretary under the title in any appropriate district court yet 2208a2 requires filing of cha llenges to an action of the secretary only in the us court of appeals for the district of columb ia the section also provides that actions of the secretary that could have been reviewed under th section on judicial review may not be reviewed as part of civ il or criminal enforcement proceeding in addition 2208 of hr 6 also limits th scope of review by stating that review of secretarial decision to conduct lease sale including the environmental analysis thereof shall be limited to whether the secretary complied with the terms of the act and shall be based upon the ad ministrative record of that decision furthermore the secretarys identification of preferred course of leasing action andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs32 82 see charles h koch dministrative law and

make overturning decision difficult vi disposition of leasing revenues another issue that has arisen during debates over leasing in the anwr is that of disposition of possible revenues whet her congress may validly provide for disposition of revenues other than the 9010 percent split mentioned in the alaska statehood act under 35 of the mineral leasing act mla83 an act that applies to the leasing of oil and gas and certain othe r minerals from federal public lands certain western states receive directly 50 of re venues an additional 40 goes to those states indirectly through the construction and maintenance of irrigation projects under the reclamation act of 1902 these percen tages previously were 37 ½ and 52 ½ respectively because the territory of alaska did not benefit from the reclamation act it initially received only 37 ½ shar of federal leasing revenues before enactment of the alaska statehood act congress amended the mla to provide that the territory of alaska would receive an additional 52 ½ share thereby putting alaska on the same footing as the other states receiving total of 90 of revenues from leasing under the mla84 section 28b of the alaska statehood act again amended the mla to change the references from the territory of alaska to state of alaska85 section 317 of the federal land po licy management act of 1976 again amended the revenues section of mla to di rect payment of 90 to alaska rather than the separate percentages previously stated86 the committee report accompanying the 1976 change states under heading regarding changes to distribution of revenues from mla operations that the acti on was intended to clarify that alaska was to continue to receive 90 of the mineral revenues taken in from lands in alaska87 alaska has asserted that the 90 tota l referenced in the statehood act cannot be changed and must always be paid to the state because the statehood act is ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs33 88 alaska v united stat 35 fed cl 685

one meant to recognize that alaska should receive share comparable to th at of other states sharing revenues under the mla but does not preclude the congress from changing the mla or at times making special provision for leasing certain areas under different regimen alaska sued in the us court of federal claims asserting that because the united states had an obligation under th statehood act both to maximize mineral leasing in alaska and to always pay 90 share of gross receipts to alaska the united states had either breached the cont ract established by the statehood act or taken property of alaska by withdraw ing some lands in alaska from leasing notably anwr and by deducting administr ative costs prior to the disbursement of the 90 revenues to the state the court found that the statehood act and the previous statute providing the territory of alaska with the same shares as the other states simply plugged alaska into the mla along with the other states88 therefore congress could amend the mla eg to provide different way of calculating receipts and the changes would lawfully pertain to alaska furthermore the court concluded that the united states did not promise in the statehood act to make federal mineral lands pr oductive of royalty revenues for the state and that the united states therefore retained discretion over leasing decisions89 because of these findings the court also granted the gove rnments motion for summary judgment on the takings claim although this case was in the context of the power of the united states to pay administrative costs befo re dividing mla revenues with alaska arguably the same analysis of the provi sion in question would apply to direct challenge to the authority of congress to change the revenue shares under particular statutory leasing regime as opposed to pa ying 90 as stated in the statehood act if the statehood act simply means that alaska will be treated like other states under the mla the question may be asked whether congress may legislate specially as to anwr and prescribe different revenue sharing provisions in that particular leasing context congress has directed different split in the past with respect to leasing under particular statutes eg th national petroleum reserves in which situation all of the revenues go into the federal treasury90 and the national petroleum reserve in alaska in whic h instance the revenue sharing is 505091 therefore arguably congress has flexibility regarding revenue sharing in special legislation regarding oil and gas leasing in the refuge absent new provisions revenues might either be di vided as currently provided under the mla if leasing in anwr is under that statute or go to the us treasury as miscellaneous receipts under 31 usc 3302 or be divide d in some other way congress specifies issues may remain however because of the wording of the current bills section 2203a of hr 6 states that the leasing program is to be under the mla yet 2209 states that notwithsta nding any other provision of law 50 ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31115crs34 revenues are to be paid to alaska gi ven that leasing is to be under the mla whether the revenue splitting language validly overrides the provisions in the alaska statehood act is not clear if not and the language is stricken court would then be faced with severability stions and the validity of th rest of the bill could be at issue hr 6 has severability s ection so court might strike the revenue splitting language in which case the court would have to decide whether the usual mla 9010 split should again pertain or the court could strike the revenue language and also decide whether congress would ve enacted the legislation without the new revenue provisions if court concludes that cong ress would not have done so the entire title might fall section 2212 of hr 6 establishes local government impact aid and community service assistance fund for th secretary to provide assistance to eligible entities the fund is cappe d at 11 million but under 2212e 5 million is authorized to be appropriated to the secretary for each fiscal year
