specialist in aging policy domestic social policy division debra b whitman specialist in the economics of aging domestic social policy division social security raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base summary social security taxes are levied on covered earnings up to maximum level set each year in 2008 this maximum or what is referred to as the taxable earnings base is 102000 the taxable earnings base serves as both cap on contributions and cap on benefits as contribution base it establishes the maximum amount of each workers earnings that is subject to the payroll tax as benefit base it establishes the maximum amount of earnings used to calculate benefits since 1982 the social security taxable earnings base has risen at the same rate as average wages in the economy however due to increasing earnings inequality the percentage of covered earnings that are taxable has decreased from 90 in 1982 to 85 in 2005 the percentage of covered earnings that is taxable is projected to decline to about 83 for 2014 and later since the cap was indexed to the average growth in wages the share of the population below the cap has remained relatively stable at roughly 94 of the 95 million americans with earnings above the base roughly 80 are men and only 9 had any earnings from selfemployment income the district of columbia has the highest share of the population above the maximum 12 and south dakota has the lowest share 2 crs estimated the potential impact of eliminating the taxable wage base on future benefits and taxes if the base were removed in 2013 crs estimates that by 2035 21 of beneficiaries would have paid some additional payroll taxes over the course of their lifetimes however the average change in taxes and benefits would be small looking only at individuals who would pay any additional taxes over the course of their lifetimes at the median total lifetime tax payments would rise by 3 and benefits would increase by 2 relative to current law in general those in the highest income groups would have the largest changes in both tax payments and in benefits relative to current law raising or eliminating the cap on wages that are subject to taxes could reduce the longrange deficit in the social security trust funds for example if the maximum taxable earnings amount had been raised in 2005 from 90000 to 150000 roughly the level needed to cover 90 of all earnings it would have eliminated roughly 40 of the longrange shortfall in social security if all earnings were subject to the payroll tax but the base was retained for benefit calculations the social security trust funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years however having different bases for contributions and benefits would weaken the traditional link between the taxes workers pay into the system and the benefits they receive in the 110th congress hr 5779 was introduced which would require workers and employers to each contribute 3 of earnings above the

beginning of the program social security taxes have been levied on covered earnings up to maximum level set each year referred to as the taxable earnings base social security was enacted in 1935 and the social security payroll tax was first levied in 1937 from 1937 through 1949 the tax rate was 1 on employee and employer each on earnings up to 3000 year since that time the rate has risen to 62 and the taxable earnings base has been increased to help meet the financing needs of the program and to keep up to date with changing earnings levels since 1982 the social security earnings base has risen at the same rate as wages in the economy by law the commissioner of social security is required to raise the base whenever an automatic benefit increase cost of living adjustment cola is granted to social security recipients assuming wages have risen the increase in the base from 97500 in 2007 to 102000 in 2008 is based on the increase in average wages from 2005 to 20061 origin and history of the taxable earnings base in 1935 the designers of social security president franklin roosevelts committee on economic security did not recommend maximum level of taxable earnings in its plan and the draft bill that president roosevelt sent to the hill did not include one the bill emphasized who was to be covered by the system not how much wages should be taxed being in the midst of the depression the administrations attention was on the large number of aged people living in poverty its goal in proposing social security program was to complement public assistance measures oldage assistance in its plan the plan offered immediate cash aid to the aged poor and created an earningsreplacement system intended to lessen the need for welfare benefits in the long run it was recognized that the new system would not be sufficient to provide full income in retirement but would provide core benefit as floor of protection against poverty not concerned about highincome retirees the administrations proposal exempted nonmanual workers earning 250 or more month from coverage ie 3000 on an annual basis manual workers were to be covered regardless of their earnings but few had earnings above this level it was the social security bill reported by the house ways and means committee that clearly established maximum taxable amount which it set at 1 the reason for the twoyear lag in reflecting increases in average wages in the taxable earnings base is that average wages for the year immediately prior to the year of the increase simply are not known in time crs2 3000 per year2 in addition the committee dropped the exemption for nonmanual workers with high earnings the committees report and floor statements made at the time give clear record as to the reasoning for the taxable limit but concerns about tax equity and attaining as much program coverage of the workforce as possible were suggested as factors for rejecting the highearner exemption not covering them meant that they would not pay the tax where lower wage earners would and coverage would be erratic for workers whose earnings fluctuated above and below the 250 monthly threshold although tax policy concerns were raised in later years with higher base preferred by those seeking more proportional tax system there was little if any serious attention given to eliminating the base entirely in the late 1940s and early 1950s and to lesser extent later on the major arguments were over the bases size and how it affected the development of social security larger base meant that more earnings would be credited to persons social security record and would lead to higher benefits since benefits are based on workers earnings proponents argued that the base needed to be raised to reflect wage or price growth so that the benefits of moderate and welltodo recipients would not erode over time thereby preserving their support for the system critics argued that this would increase benefits for people who could save on their own while making saving by private means more difficult in 1972 as means of financing costofliving adjustments for social security recipients procedures were enacted that increased the base automatically to reflect the growth in average wages in 1977 the base was raised beyond what resulted from the automatic increase provision by 7500 over three years as means of raising revenue to help shore up the programs ailing financial condition these ad hoc adjustments were intended to achieve base under which 90 of all covered payroll would be subject to tax medicare was enacted in 1965 with the hospital insurance hi portion of the program financed with payroll taxes the hi tax was first levied in 1966 at rate of 035 on employee and employer each and the maximum taxable amount was set at the same level as social securitys3 the hi rate was subsequently raised periodically reaching its current level of 145 in 1986 to meet the financing needs of the program however its base continued to be the same as social securitys through 1990 then to reduce federal budget deficits the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101518 raised the hi base to 125000 the hi base then rose automatically to 135000 over the next two years in 1993 as part of his plan to reduce budget deficits president clinton proposed that the hi base be eliminated entirely as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 the hi base was removed raising an estimated 29 billion in revenues over 2 the maximum for worker was to be 3000 per year per employer so that under the original legislation enacted in 1935 someone could have paid tax on more than 3000 in earnings per year and received benefits from all such wages if they worked for more than one employer 3 the same maximum taxable amount was set for the selfemployed when they were covered in 1951 and for the disability insurance di portion of the tax when it was first levied in 1957 crs3 the fy1994fy1998 period as there

income used to calculate contributions to social security unlike income taxes workers who have earnings over the limit whether they earn 105000 or 1 million pay the same dollar amount in social security payroll taxes under the 2008 limit of 102000 the maximum amount wage and salary worker contributes to social security is 6324 his or her employer contribute an equal amount while self employed individual contributes maximum of 126485 the taxable earnings base also limits the annual amount of earnings that are used in benefit calculations and thus sets ceiling on the amount social security pays in benefits for example the maximum amount of earnings in 2008 used to calculate workers benefit is 102000 regardless of whether the worker earned above that amount if an individual earned at or above the earnings base for his or her entire career6 and retired in 2008 at the full retirement age his or her annual benefit would be 26220 2185 per month the maximum benefit payable under current law7 however very few americans receive the maximum benefit as it is extremely rare to have had such consistently high earnings over lifetime 4 social security administration 2008 fact

and income tax deductions apply the taxable earnings base over time the portion of social security covered earnings that are subject to the payroll tax has fluctuated over time figure 1 when the program began in 1937 taxable earnings represented 92 of covered earnings table a1 by 1965 this ratio had dropped to its low of 71 prior to 1972 the taxable earnings base was updated periodically by congress which contributed to its dramatic fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s since 1972 the base has been indexed to the increase in wages in the economy which has reduced the volatility somewhat as described earlier to raise revenue congress raised the taxable earnings base in the 1977 amendments to the social security act to level that would cover 90 of aggregate earnings by 1982 since the 1980s the share of covered workers below the taxable earnings base has remained relatively stable at roughly 94 however the share of covered earnings that are taxed has fallen from 90 of all earnings in 1982 to 86 in 2004 crs5 the large declines in the late 1990s were mainly due to the fact that salaries for top earners grew faster than the pay of workers below the cap8 figure 1 share of earnings and workers above the taxable earnings base 19502004 100 percent of covered 90 earnings below social percentage security 80 base 70 percent of 60 workers with covered earnings 50 below social security

supplement 2006 the taxable earnings base by state in 2005 six percent of workers had earnings above the taxable base of 900009 however focusing on the nationwide average hides the diversity among the states and the district of columbia the share of the population above the base in 2005 ranges from high in the district of columbia where 12 of covered workers earn above the base to low in south dakota where 2 of workers earn above this amount table a2 the states with the lowest share of workers over the base are south dakota mississippi arkansas north dakota and montana those with the highest share of workers over the base are the district of columbia new jersey connecticut massachusetts and maryland 8 at least some of this decline and subsequent increase in the ratio after 2000 is believed to be due to stock option activity surrounding the stock market bubble in 2000 and is not likely to recur ssa 2005 oasdi trustees report 9 note that the years denoted for tables a1 a2 and a3 differ slightly due to differences in availability of data crs6 the taxable earnings base by employment status and gender according to statistics from the social security administration small share of workers earn above the taxable earnings base each year in 2004 6 of workers 94 million individuals earned more than the taxable earnings base table a310 most of the individuals earning above the base were men 74 million individuals or roughly 80 of the total in 2004 9 of all male workers and 3 of all female workers had earnings above the maximum most individuals earning above the base were wage and salary workers roughly 90 of the total only 1 in 10 individuals who earned above the base were selfemployed roughly 6 of all wage and salary workers 86 million individuals and 5 of all selfemployed workers 809000 individuals had earnings above the base in that year the future of the taxable earnings base the taxable wage base is increased annually by the average growth in wages so the share of the population below the cap is expected to remain relatively stable over time however due to increasing earnings inequality the share of payroll that is taxed is expected to decline even further under the intermediate assumptions of the 2007 trustees report the percentage of covered earnings that is taxable is projected to decline to about 83 for 2015 however the trustees report assumes the levels will remain stable thereafter projections of the share of the population earning above the taxable wage base over their lifetime workers earnings rise and fall during their careers so any analysis of the population that earns above the taxable wage base in given year is limited in that it may miss individuals who were above the base in previous years or will have earnings above the base in the future to address this issue crs used the dynasim microsimulation model to estimate the share of individuals in the future who will ever have earned above the currentlaw taxable wage base over the course of their lifetimes11 10 social security administration annual statistical supplement 2006 httpwwwssagov policydocsstatcompssupplement20064bhtmltable4b1 hereafter referred to as ssa statistical supplement 2006 11 the urban institutes dynamic simulation of income model dynasim is computer model that uses survey data to project earnings demographic changes retirement income and social security benefits through the year 2050 for more information about the model how it works and how to interpret results see crs report rl33840 options to address social security solvency and their impact on beneficiaries results from the dynasim microsimulation model by laura haltzel et crs7 figure 2 share of the population with earnings above the taxable wage base over their lifetime source congressional research service crs calculations using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model in 2004 6 of workers earned more than the taxable earnings base12 the dynasim model projects this share will remain relatively constant over time while small share of workers are projected to earn above the taxable earnings base in given year the model estimates that roughly one in five individuals would earn above the maximum at some point in their lifetimes figure 2 the model projects that 12 of workers would earn above the earnings base for between one and five years over the course of their working lives very few individuals sustain the high earnings for long periods in their careers the model estimates that only 5 of workers would earn above the taxable wage base for more than five years13 very few individuals have earnings higher than level of taxable earnings that would cover 90 of aggregate earnings the level congress attempted to achieve when it last addressed social securitys finances the dynasim model projects that roughly 1 of workers have earnings above 90 limit each year in other words due to high levels of earnings inequality roughly 1 of the population earn 10 of all the earnings14 looking over the course of an individuals lifetime the model 12 ssa statistical supplement 2006 13 the share of the population affected by this policy is influenced by the way the dynasim model projects an individuals earnings there is significant amount of yeartoyear variation in the projection of each individuals earnings 14 the dynasim model projections are consistent with current data on wage inequality in continued crs8 projects that less than 4 of the population would ever earn above the 90 base and nearly all of those who do would earn above the base for less than five years figure 2 impact of raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base raising or removing the taxable earnings base could reduce or eliminate the longterm social security deficit15 the additional tax revenues would be substantial however the full impact of the policy change would depend on whether the wages above the maximum would also be counted toward benefits raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base while maintaining the current benefit structure where benefits are calculated on the full contribution base would lead to higher monthly social security checks for individuals who earned more than the taxable wage base during their careers these higher benefit payments would lead to greater program outlays although these expenditures would be more than offset by greater tax revenues while the solvency impact would be improved to greater degree if the cap on taxes was eliminated and the cap on benefits was retained the traditional link between contributions and benefits would be broken rather than eliminate the taxable wage base policymakers could set it to cover constant share of aggregate earnings as described previously the portion of social security covered earnings subject to the payroll tax has fluctuated since its inception rising inequality primarily increases in the earnings of the highest paid individuals has led to decline in the share of us earnings that is taxed the proportion of earnings that is taxed is projected to continue to fall maintaining consistent tax base would increase revenue and help to improve the systems solvency some have proposed raising the taxable earnings base to consistently tax 90 of aggregate us earnings restoring it to roughly the level in 1982 when congress last addressed social securitys finances the social security administration and the joint committee on tax have also used this benchmark to analyze the impact of raising the base on the social security trust funds and the budget the following sections examine the impact of raising or eliminating the taxable wage base on individuals the social security trust funds on federal revenue and on workers and employers behavior 14 continued 2004 the top 1 of earners were paid 11 of aggregate earnings source crs analysis of the march 2005 current population survey 15 there is precedent for this proposal when the hospital insurance hi tax was levied in 1966 the maximum taxable amount was set the same as for social security as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 the hi base was removed crs9 impact on individuals lifetime payroll taxes and social security benefits if the taxable wage base were eliminated to estimate how much individuals taxes and benefits would rise if the wage base were eliminated crs has used the dynasim microsimulation model to look at social security beneficiaries in the year 2035 the estimates assume the taxable wage base would be completely eliminated starting in 2013 for calculating both the payroll taxes and future social security benefits the following sections detail the impact of eliminating the base on beneficiaries based on their income and gender16 aggregate changes if the base were removed the majority of beneficiaries would pay additional taxes compared with current law as fewer than 8 of workers are projected to earn above the taxable wage base each year examining the impact on individuals receiving social security benefits in 2035 roughly one in five beneficiaries 21 would have paid any additional taxes over their lifetimes compared with current law figure 3 for most of these affected individuals the increase would be moderate roughly 16 of all beneficiaries would see their lifetime tax payments increase by less than 10 however 3 of all beneficiaries would have their tax payments increase by 10 to 19 and 2 would have tax increases of 20 or more to maintain the traditional link between contribution and benefits policymakers could choose to calculate benefits based on workers total earnings including those above the taxable wage base under this option some beneficiaries would receive higher social security benefits crs estimates that 23 of beneficiaries in 2035 would have higher benefits than under current law this share of beneficiaries who receive higher benefits is greater than the share of individuals who pay higher taxes because some low earners receive benefits based on their spouses higher earnings most of the affected beneficiaries 20 would see their benefits increase by less than 10 relative to current law only 3 of beneficiaries would see their benefits increase by 10 or more while 21 of beneficiaries in 2035 would pay some additional payroll taxes over the course of their lifetimes if the base were removed the average change in taxes and benefits would be small looking only at individuals who would pay higher taxes over the course of their lifetimes at the median total lifetime tax payments would rise by 3 and benefits would increase by 2 relative to current law 16 crs estimates of the impact of this and other reform proposals including raising the base to cover 90

microsimulation model note lifetime taxes include both individual and employer oasdi contributions or selfemployment contributions throughout the individuals entire career changes by income group the impact of eliminating the taxable wage base on payroll taxes paid varies significantly by income group17 the overwhelming majority 98 of beneficiaries in 2035 in the lowest income quintile would pay additional taxes over their lifetime figure 4 few in this group would receive benefit increases if the cap were removed under this proposal only 3 of beneficiaries in the lowest income category would receive benefit increases and the increase would be for less than 10 the story is different for higher income beneficiaries roughly onehalf of those in the highest income quintile are estimated to have had tax increases over their lifetimes relative to current law while 35 of beneficiaries in the top quintile would see their lifetime taxes rise by less than 10 some 7 would see their taxes rise between 10 and 19 and some 6 would see their taxes rise 20 or more beneficiaries in the highest income groups would also see the largest change in their benefits if the taxable wage base were removed onehalf of beneficiaries in the top 17 note that the income groups are defined in 2035 using family income after an individual claims disability retirement survivor or spousal benefits thus some low income beneficiaries are affected by the policy if they earned above the taxable wage base at any point in their careers crs11 fifth of the income distribution in 2035 would have an increase in benefits relative to current law in this highest quintile 42 would have benefit increases of less than 10 some 5 would have benefit increases of 1019 and few 3 would have benefit increases of 20 or

microsimulation model impact on the social security trust funds under the assumptions of the 2005 trustees report the actuaries at the social security administration calculate that it would take an immediate increase in combined payroll taxes of 192 of taxable payroll from 1240 to 1432 to achieve solvency over the next 75 years18 without this increase or other changes to the system the 2005 trustees report projected that the oasdi trust funds would be exhausted in 2041 the actuaries at ssa have estimated the impact on the trust funds of three options to change the benefit and contribution base which are described below 18 the projections in this section were done using the assumptions of the 2005 trustees report to match the estimates in table 4 which are the most recent estimates available for these options crs13 table 1 impact on the social security trust funds of raising or eliminating the social security taxable earnings base year the 75year percent of trust

intermediate assumptions of the 2005 trustees report solvent beyond 75year estimate option 1 cover 90 of earnings and pay higher benefits one proposal would slowly raise the taxable wage base for both employers and employees to cover 90 of all earnings and credit these taxes to allow individuals to receive correspondingly higher benefits in 2006 it was estimated that cap of 171600 would roughly cover 90 of wages19 under this option benefits at retirement for high earners would also rise these changes would have net positive impact on the social security trust funds table 1 raising the wage base to 90 would eliminate 43 of the longrange financial shortfall extending the trust funds exhaustion date to 2044 to achieve solvency for the full 75year projection period under this option the total payroll tax rate would have to be raised by an additional 109 percentage points from 1240 to 1349 or other policy changes would have to be made to cover the shortfall20 19 social security

advisory board memorandum dated august 10 2005 available at httpwwwssagovoactsolvencyprovisionsindexhtml crs14 option 2 cover all earnings and pay higher benefits if the earnings base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all earnings were taxed 95 of the projected financial shortfall in the social security program would be eliminated to achieve solvency for the full 75year projection period under this option the total payroll tax rate would have to be raised by an additional 01 percentage points from 124 to 125 or other policy changes would have to be made to cover the shortfall under this scenario high earners would pay higher taxes but also receive higher benefits however the net benefit to the trust funds is positive as 5 in additional revenue would provide only 1 in additional benefits on average over their 75year valuation period annual social security benefit payments would be much higher than todays maximum of 25440 worker who paid taxes on earnings of 400000 each year would get benefit of approximately 6000 month or 72000 year replacement rate of 18 while someone with lifetime earnings of 1 million year would get monthly social security benefit of approximately 13500 month or 162000 year replacement rate of 1622122 option 3 cover all earnings and pay additional benefits finally if the base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all earnings were taxed but those earnings did not count toward benefits solvency would be restored to social security the increased revenue would eliminate 115 of the projected shortfall and the program would have projected surplus equal to 28 of taxable payroll under this scenario the payroll tax rate could be immediately lowered from 1240 to 1212 and the system would remain solvent for the next 75 years however the traditional link between the level of wages that is taxed and the level of wages that counts toward benefits would be broken impact on federal revenue raising the taxable earnings base would lead to an increase in total federal revenues the joint committee on taxation has estimated that raising the wage base to 90 of earnings to 186000 in 2008 would generate 221 billion in additional revenue over the fiveyear budget window of 20082012 table 22324 over 10 21 calculations are for 2005 from reno and lavery options to balance social security funds february 2005 22 benefits this high would be extremely rare as very few individuals earn above the taxable wage base for their entire career 23 congressional budget office budget options revenue option 39 increase the upper limit for earnings subject to the social security payroll tax february 2007 httpwwwcbogov 24 note that the estimates by the actuaries at the social security administration ssa and the joint committee on taxation jct differ slightly due to different assumptions ssa assumes the maximum wage base will be adjusted each year to keep taxable wages at constant percent of wages while the jct assumes it will be onetime increase with continued crs15 years the policy would generate more than 524 billion raising the payroll tax base to cover an additional 12 of income above the 90 level would generate 32 64 billion more over five years and 80158 billion more over 10 years table 2 revenue impact of raising the social security taxable earnings base taxable wage base total

committee on taxation 2007 impact on workers and employers behavior the reaction of highearning workers and their employers to raising or removing the taxable earnings base is unknown and was not taken into consideration in the above estimates of the distributional trust fund and revenue impacts workers who earn more than the cap would have reduced incentive to work as their aftertax earnings will fall25 however whether these individuals would significantly reduce the amount they work is matter of debate26 each worker would face decision between the reduced earnings and the additional leisure time based on the workers individual preferences workers who have earnings above the current base would also have an incentive to change the form of their compensation eg from earnings to fringe benefits to avoid paying additional payroll taxes27 the impact of raising the base on employers of highincome earners is also unknown employers contribute 62 of workers wages up to the taxable wage base toward social security if employers are unable to pass along the higher tax costs to 24 continued adjustments only for inflation thereafter jct estimates also account for the effects on all sources of revenue including changes to income taxes and medicare taxes 25 the response by high earners may depend on whether the wage base is raised slightly or completely eliminated 26 for more detailed discussion of this debate see crs report rl33944 increasing the social security payroll tax base options and effects on tax burdens by thomas l hungerford 27 see martin sullivan budget magic and the social security tax cap tax notes march 14 2005 crs16 workers in the form of reduced earnings their overall labor costs will increase employers may react by raising prices to consumers reducing other nonwage forms of compensation such as health benefits or pensions or reducing the number of workers legislation legislation in prior congresses number of proposals to raise or eliminate the taxable wage base have been made in recent sessions of congress although none have received legislative action in the 105th congress senator moynihan proposed raising the base to 97500 by 2003 15600 more than it was projected to be under current law as part of package of changes to restore social securitys longrange solvency s 1792 he again included an increase in the base in solvency package he introduced in the 106th congress s 21 similar base hikes were contained in other solvency bills in the 106th introduced by senators gregg and breaux et s 1383 and s 2774 and by representative nadler hr 1043 in the 107th congress hr 2771 introduced by representatives kolbe and stenholm held the base at 86 of total payroll in the 108th congress two bills raised the wage base bill by kolbe and stenholm hr 3821 gradually raised the base to 133200 in 2008 and then held the base equal to 87 of total payroll thereafter hr 5179 sponsored by representative obey brought the percentage of covered earnings subject to the social security payroll tax up to 90 by increasing the rate of growth in the social security taxable wage base by 2 percentage points above average wage growth for years 2006 through 2036 two bills were introduced in the 109th congress to change the taxable wage base hr 440 introduced by representatives kolbe and boyd gradually raised the base to 142500 in 2010 and then indexed it to 87 of total payroll thereafter bill by representative wexler hr 2472 required workers and employers to each contribute 3 of earnings above the taxable wage base while selfemployed individuals contribute 6 of earnings above the taxable wage base under the wexler bill earnings above the taxable wage base taxed at the 3 rate would not be credited for benefit computation purposes legislation in the 110th congress in the 110th congress bill by representative wexler hr 5779 was introduced that would require workers and employers to each contribute 3 of earnings above the taxable wage base while selfemployed individuals contribute 6 of earnings above the taxable wage base these contributions are in addition to the social security contributions payable under current law for wages below the current taxable wage base under the wexler bill earnings above the taxable wage base would not be credited for benefit computation purposes crs17 arguments for and against raising or eliminating the base some of the general arguments for and against changing the social security taxable earnings base follow arguments for the major critique about the social security base is that it creates regressive tax structure workers earning less than the base have greater proportion of earnings taxed than workers whose earnings exceed it in 2008 someone with annual earnings of 30000 pays 1860 in social security taxes or 62 of his or her earnings ignoring the employer share of the tax however because the tax is levied on only the first 102000 in earnings someone earning 200000 year pays 6324 or 3 of his or her earnings supporters of changing the wage base point out that only 6 of workers have earnings above the base in any given year however due to rising earnings inequality the amount of their earnings that escapes taxation has risen from 12 to 15 since 1991 and is projected to continue to rise through 2014 they therefore contend that the current tax structure favors small group of the more welloff workers in society they also point out that the overall employee tax rate rose from 613 in 1980 to 765 in 1990 counting the medicare portion or by 25 and assert that this increase is one of the main reasons for disproportionate rise in the aggregate federal tax burden on lower and middleincome people over that decade28 they further maintain that for most workers social security and medicare taxes counting the employer share which they view as foregone wages are now greater than their income taxes supporters argue that subjecting larger percentage of earnings to the payroll tax would also adjust for the higher life expectancies of high earners29 on average people with more education and higher earnings live longer than those with lower earnings and less education and this difference has been growing over time the impact on the social security program is that these individuals receive benefits for more years over their lifetimes making the system less progressive30 they claim that raising the taxable wage base would make reasonable adjustment for the faster thanaverage life expectancy gains among high earners 28 see crs report rl32693 distribution of the tax burden across individuals an overview by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov 29 see peter diamond and peter r orzag saving social security balanced approach brookings institution 2004 30 the social security benefit formula is thought to be progressive in that the monthly benefits of lowwage earners replace greater proportion of their earnings than do the monthly benefits of highwage earners crs18 thus supporters of changing the base argue that raising or eliminating the base not only would be more fair but also that social securitys projected longrange financing problems could be substantially alleviated or alternatively that the payroll tax rate could be reduced without causing loss of revenue to the system it is estimated that almost 100 billion in revenue to the social security program would be generated annually by taxing all earnings and if such revenues were not used to lower the tax rate they would reduce the governments outstanding debt and eliminate about 95 of social securitys longrange deficit among supporters of changing the current base there is disagreement regarding how high the base should be raised or if other changes should be made to tax income above the base several proposals would not eliminate the base entirely but raise it to cover 90 of taxable wages restoring the level that was set in the 1977 amendments to the social security act others have claimed that increasing the base to 90 would be large tax increase for those who earn between the current base and the new level but would have little impact on the share of taxes paid by individuals with the highest earnings31 other options would be to remove the cap completely over the base but lower the tax rate on those higher earnings32 or tax employers and employees at different rates above the current base others have called for broadening the sources of income that are taxed beyond earnings33 proponents of these ideas argue that they would close significant portion of social securitys long range deficit without subjecting uppermiddle income individuals to sizeable increases in their marginal tax rates arguments against those who support keeping the base as it is point out that while the structure of the payroll tax may be regressive it is offset by the progressive calculation of benefits they further maintain that its critics fail to take into account the effect of other tax and transfer programs targeted to lowearners they point out that mitigating the social security tax bite was part of the motivation for creating the earned income tax credit eitc which provides an income tax credit on earnings up to 41646 in 2008 for married workers with two or more children up to 15880 for married workers without children they also point out that lowincome families receive greater share of government transfer payments that are not subject to social security payroll taxes they argue that the combination of these factors mitigates the flatrate nature of the tax at lower earnings levels and that for most other workers the tax is 31 for study of how the effective tax rates paid by different income groups would change under such proposal see crs report rl33949 increasing the social security payroll tax base options and effects on tax burdens by thomas l hungerford 32 robert c posen pin money wall street journal january 9 2007 33 citizens for tax justice an analysis of eliminating the cap on earnings subject to the social security tax and related issues november 30 2006 at httpwwwctjorgpdf socialsecuritytaxearningscapnov2006pdf crs19 proportional because it is flatrate it is only at the upper end of the income spectrum that it takes on regressive appearance critics also argue that raising the cap will serve as disincentive to work and could serve as drain on the economy34 because additional work effort would generate less aftertax income supporters claim that workers faced with this higher marginal rate would either reduce their hours or avoid the tax by changing the form of their compensation from another perspective some who might otherwise espouse progressive taxation support raising the base but not eliminating it having cap makes social security seem less like general purpose taxation they argue that the system needs support from people of all earnings levels and that the larger benefits that high earners would receive would represent poor return for the higher taxes they would pay moreover regardless of the moneys worth issue some question the wisdom of paying large benefits to welltodo people they argue that the purpose of the program is to provide floor of protection for retirement not large benefits for those who can save on their own they contend that eliminating the base would raise public cynicism about publicly financed system that pays enormous benefits to people who already are well off 34 see d mark wilson removing the social securitys
