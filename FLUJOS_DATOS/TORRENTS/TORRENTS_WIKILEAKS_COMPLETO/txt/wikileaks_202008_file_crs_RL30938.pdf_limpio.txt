security threats ranging in scope from intercontinen tal ballistic missiles to th use of weapons of mass destruction wmd by terrorists the debate over the seriousness of the various threats intensified recently even before the events of september 11 2001 various studies and commissions recommended far reaching changes in the us approach to domestic preparedness and response to th reats to the homeland many now being implemented many experts believe the probable long rm effects of wmd attack by terrorists on the population environmen t and the economy make it imperative that the us be fully prepared to either deter or interdict an attempted terrorist attack this paper reviews the current legislation and policies that govern the militarys role when supporting law enforcement in domestic terrorism crisis and highlights some of the issues confronting the u s government to fully understand the militarys role in domestic crisis response it is necessary to explore existing national level structures and respons options prior to the involvement of military forces crisis management is predominately law enforcement function that manages the resources necessary to prevent or

of an actual terrorist incident the department of defense dod as supporting agency in domestic law enforcement operations has developed and maintains plans and capabilities to respond to threats or acts of terrorism incl uding those involving the use of nuclear biological or chemical weapons in domestic crisis dod may be called upon to assist in several different ways ranging from actual interdiction of the terrorists to the loaning of specialized equipment for use by law enforcement agencies dod has published specific policy for assistance to civil law enforcement officials in emergencies involving terrorism and wmd us terrorism policy is an issue of growing policy debate most experts believe that co mprehensive national strategy for domestic terrorism is critical step in defeating the threat some say more effectively employing dods capabilities during domestic crisis res ponse operations or new relationships based on the recent creation of the department of homeland security are the best methods to ensure success against domestic terrorism lastly newly proposed congressional oversight roles are seen by many as an important factor in more effective response to dom

fbi defines terrorism as including the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce government the civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of

pursuit of goals that are generally political religious or ideological the state depa rtment by statute defines terrorism as premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by continueduntil recently terrorism to many amer icans was remote if frightening possibility that affected only individuals or groups outside the territorial boundaries of the united states events of the past decade indicate that the terrorist threat has changed significantly in ways that make it more dangerous and much more difficult to counter the terrorist attacks of the 1970s and 1980s usually had clear political objectives these attacks resulted in just enough bloodshed and loss of life to gain attention to the terrorists cause yet not enough to alienate them from the public support they sought bombings kidnapings and aircraft hijacking were accomplished by declared identifiable groups with specific political goals in mind in contrast the decade of the 1990s has pr oduced different type of terrorism terrorism designed to produce massive casualties with little regard for distinct political goals and often claims of respons ibility recent examples of this type of attack such as the world trade center bombing in new york city the alfred p murrah federal building bombing in ok lahoma city the east african embassy bombings in 1998 and destruction of the wo rld trade center in 2001 make it appear that terrorists aim is to kill as many people as possible the possible inclusion of weapons of mass destruction in the terrorists arsenal now makes this an even more dangerous proposition recently in the trial of the perpetrators of the east african embassy bombings witness testified that usama bin laden s group qaeda arabic for the base sought to acquire chemical and nuclear material to use against the united states4 although it is unknown whether qaeda was successful in acquiring the material the probability that terrorist groups who have openly threatened the united states are attempting to acquire wmd capability is serious escalation of this dangerous problem the forecast trend many recent government and private sector reports and studies conclude that the united states is becoming increasingly vulnerable to terrorism5 although terrorism is defined in different ways by various us government agencies6 it is

inflict indiscriminate casualties as evidenced by the data in figure 1 in the preceding decade the united states emerged as the only superpower and as such the most lucrative target for terrorists source countering the changing threat of international terrorism report from the national commission on terrorism p 5 although many analysts agree that terrori sts are most likely to use conventional

mass casualties the group spent millions of dollars using hi ghly skilled technicians with an overall result that probably produced far fewer casualties than conventional explosives8 however the global cultural and political impact of the attack was massive although terrorists have l ong intended to harm the public now they may posses much greater capabilities to do so former member of qaeda

sudan where it was to be used for transporting the terrorist organizations weapons qaed vividly portrayed its ability to effect undercover transactions10 the central intelligence agency and th national intelligence council forecast the following trends that may affect the future security of the united states asymmetric threats in which state and nonstate adversaries avoid direct engagements with the us military but devise strategies tactics and weapons some improved by sidewise technology to minimize us strengths and exploit perceived weaknesses internal conflicts stemming from religi ous ethnic economic or political disputes will remain at current numbers or even increase in number prospects will grow that more sophistic ated weaponry including weapons of mass destruction indigenously produced or externally acquired will get into the hands of state and nonstate belligeren ts some hostile to the united states the likelihood will increase over this period that wmd will be used either against the united states or its forces facilities and interests overseas chemical and biological threats to the united states will become more widespread such capabilities are easier to develop hide and deploy than nuclear weapons some terrorists or insurgents will attempt to use such weapons against us interests against the united states itself its forces or facilities overseas

current us government policy the implications of successful wmd attack against the united states goes beyond the potential loss of life mass casualties and infrastructure damage of single incident many experts say the proba ble long term affects of such an attack on the population environment and the ec onomy make it imperative that the us be fully prepared to either deter or interdict an

military members may participate in the search and seizure of evidence or take the necessary precautions to avoid degrading or destro ying the evidence all military personnel likely to support law enforcement agencies ar also trained in the rules of engagement they are to follow when assisting civil law enforcement members in the performance of their duties this is particularly im portant when the secretary of defense has authorized that the military personnel be armed when performing their duties because of the danger involved in the mission requests for tactical assistance employing military tactical force in response to domestic law enforcement emergency concerning terrorism and wmd could take place in two situations 1 armed conflictlike situations that threaten the continuity of government and 2 threat endangering public safe ty that is beyond the tactical response capability of law enforcement most feel the more likely scenario for employment of tactical military force in domestic situation will be alleviating public safety threat that requires capabilities exceeding the traditional law enforcement functions of arrest and prosecution in either case employment of military force to resolve domestic terrorist incident whether or not some type of wmd is involved will mean acting outside of statutory limitations normally imposed on the military when assisting law enforcement agencies constitutional authority only the president can authorize the employment of active duty military in domestic situati on although not expressly stated in the constitution it is generally accepted constitu tional interpretation that the president has authority under his commander in chie f powers to direct the conduct of military action to include the employment of military force to repel sudden attack against the united states among several other situations if the president determined that terrorist situation threatened national survival or continuity of government or to ensure public safety he could order the employment of the military in domestic role44 the insurrection statutes title 10 usc sections 331334 known as the insurrection statutes author ize the

law enfo rcement technical assistance and the prohibitions of the posse comitatus act the president may when requested by state legislature or governor when the legislature cannot be convene d send active military forces to suppress an insurrection against state authority46 normally the state authorities will specify to the president that the violence cannot be brought under c ontrol by state and local law enforcement agencies and the state national guard the president may also take unilateral action by invoking sections 332 and 331 of the in surrection statutes when he finds that widespread unlawful activities make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the united states or when the violence hinders the execution of the laws of that state and of the united states within that state or obstructs the execution of federal law47 if the president either receives request for assistance from state or decides to take unilateral ac tion under the insurrection statutes he would execute the process in two steps following 10 usc section 334 proclamation to disperse first the president would issue proclamation co mmanding all persons engaged in acts of domestic violence and disorder in the affected area to cease and desist and to leave the area peaceably the president would th immediately issue an executive order authorizing the secretary of defense to use active duty members of the armed forces to suppress the violence described in th proclamation the secretary would be authorized to determine when the activ military forces should be withdrawn from the area the order would also require the secretary to coordinate law enforcement policies with the attorney general48 military tactical assist ance operational response if military force is authorized by the president dod has variety of options the most likely option in the case of terrorism especially wmd situation would involve tactical assistance in the form of joint special operations task force jsotf the task force is an agile highly trained special mission force available to the fbi if threat or an actual incident of domestic terrorism is considered beyond the tactical response capability of law enforcement in such case the fbi onscene commander would request that the fbi director recommend th at the attorney general seek dod support for the situation the fbi would normally ask for military support only if its assets are overwhelmed by multiple threats or incidents or if the specific target including suspected or known wmd is beyond the capability of fbi tactical and technical assets the jsotf may include or have immediate access to specially trained personnel capable of dealing w ith various types of wmd the attorney general will begin the process by conferring with the secretary of defense to determine if militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30938crs18 support is appropriate using the same criteria employed in technical assistance situation the osc will also request that the fbi director ask the attorney general to deploy the emergency support team if it has not already been launched to the incident site the dod component of the dest w ill include liaison officers familiar with the capabilities of the military units most likely to be tasked to support the fbi in potentially hostile domestic terro rism situation the launching of the dest aircraft and all dod personnel assigned to the team must be authorized by the secretary of defense the military liaison officers assigned to the dest are allowed to report directly to dod and contingency planning for possible military intervention may begin the commander of the jsotf is integrated directly into the command group of the fbi joc in order to gain first hand knowledge of the tactical situation technical assistance operations may run in concert with military tactical assistance planning dod may undertake precautionary st eps such as the prepositioning of limited number of military forces near the incident site with the approval of doj and the osc when the osc anticipates that federal milita ry assistance is necessary to resolve the incident he will immediately notify the fbi director who will advise the attorney general of the situation after consultation with the secretary of defense the attorney general will advise the president that conditions warrant the employment of federal military forces if the president decides to approve the use of military force he i nvokes the insurrection statutes as previously discussed the attorney general through the fbi remain s responsible for coor dinating all activities for federal state and local agencies assisting in the resolution of the incident and the administration of justice in the affected area when presidential approval to use military force is granted the attorney general will advise the fbi who will notify the osc the secretary of defense will advise the commander of the military task force who in turn will begin coordination with the osc for transfer of operational control of the incident site to the military responsib ility for the t actical phase of the operation is transferred to military authority when the osc relinquishes command and it is accepted by the military commander the osc may re voke the military authority at any time prior to the assault phase of the operation if he determines that military intervention is longer required provided that the military commander agrees withdrawal of forces can be accomplished without endangering the safety of his personnel once the incident is resolved the military commander will return onscene authority and responsibility to the osc the military forces will normally evacuate the area to mutually agreed upon relocation s ite to prepare for redeployment to their home station however key military personnel may be reque sted to remain at the incident site if the osc determines their presence is necessary in the investigative process the fbi will provide the military members the appropriate constitutional and procedural safeguards including the presence of military counsel if required by the circumstances the fbi will also to the extent permitted by law protect the identity of the military members participating in the event and any sensitive tactics techniques and procedures used by the military during the

concerning the appropria teness of the use of federal troops and how military force should be employed in the united states49 conclusion and issues for congress number of intelligence and terrorism experts argue that the trend toward terrorists use of wmd is not as great danger as other mo re traditional national security threats but because of the seri ous implications of the successful use of wmd by terrorists on american soil it is most likely not an event that the american public is willing to accept either to successf ully combat the possibility of terrorist incident especially one using wmd the current interagency domestic crisis management policies and structures s hould be analyzed to determine their effectiveness against the current threat and their adaptability to the future threat there are many critical issues concerning us terrorism policy overall and domestic terrorism specifically several issues that could significantly affect the nations crisis response capabilities were explored in recent nationallevel commissions most experts believe th at comprehensive national strategy coherently linking national policy with the capabilities of the many agencies charged with domestic terrorism responsibilities is critical step in defeating the threat many experts also contend that the ited states would be better served by employing the full range of dods cap abilities during domestic crisis response operations50 some see the creation of an entirely new agency with responsibility for homeland defense as the best met hod to ensure success against domestic terrorism51 lastly newly proposed congressiona l oversight roles are seen by many as an important factor in more ffective response to domestic terrorism national strategy the current national strategy for terrori sm is seen by many as an uncoupled system of plans that individually respond to various aspects of the threat but do not collectively ensure comprehensive res ponse capability in the event of crediblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30938crs20 threat or actual terrorism act on american soil as starting point most observers recommend the united states articulate an end state to which it should aim to accomplish its combating terrorism policy for example there is one definition of terrorism to use when coordinating interagency combating terrorism policy the state department the department of justice and dod all use definitions w ith subtle yet farreaching differences if terrorism is defined as merely legal issue then law enforcement takes priority in legal terms terroristrelate d acts are now arson murder or kidnaping if terrorism is seen as affecting national security it is political or military issue that could end with response by military forces to prevent deter or interdict the terrorist act with specific national objectives for which federal state and local agencies can gauge progress or measure capability terrorism policy it is argued becomes an exercise in executing programs within t budget the general policies that involve preparation for interdicting threatened terrorist act have clear priority of implementation among those responsible fo r executing the policy comprehensive threat and risk assessments concerning th possible use of wmd by terrorists would allow federal authoritie s to make judgments as to wh ether funding is at the proper level overall as well as allocations for specific programs these same assessments could assist in establishing priorities and reducing or liminating duplication of effort in combating terrorism programs employing the full range of dod capability current statutory authority allows the us military to act in support role in domestic crisis response even if the president invokes the insurrection statutes allowing military response to specifi c situation federal law enforcement personnel remain in overall char ge of the operation it is debatable what affect the employment of the military as lead fede ral agency in domestic crisis response role during limited terrorist attacks would have on the militarys capabilities and probability of success the military appear s to have sufficient capability to respond to the narrow mission of interdicting domestic terrorist event prior to its execution or responding to situation in progress when the fbi either does not have the capability or is overwhelmed by multiple contingencies what appears to be the main stumb ling block to better coordination and response between the fbi and the military is the numerous and often confusing statutory and regulatory authorities that govern the use of the military in domestic situation different statutes apply to situation dependi ng on whether it is nuclear chemical or biological threat or incident many experts assert that clearly specified legal authority in place prior to the us of federal military forces in domestic situation could allow for more streamlined and effective use of these forces while ensuring civil liberties and law enforcement concerns are respected different laws apply when employing the military in tactical role as opposed to providing non hostile technical assistance current laws may tend to delay or complicate military involvement in the situation which could re duce effectiveness another issue is that some in dod see the use of crisis response forces in domestic situation as not being legitimate mission they express concern about the effect such use has on the preparation of those forces to fight nd win our nations wars reduced forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30938crs21 52 see for

police work although others point out that military forces do train in law enforcement situations and regularly exercise with federal agencies in crisis response s ituations in the united states52 laws that more clearly specify the militarys role in domestic crisis res ponse would most likely make committing resources pe rsonnel and effort to that role more successful while at the same time continuing to protect the civil liberties of our citizens new federal structures several recent studies nd legislative initiatives proposed new governmental structures to alleviate what they conte nd is the federal gove rnments fragmented approach to homeland security recomme ndations dealing with combating terrorism issues range from creating an independent homeland defense agency responsible for the entire spectrum of security to reorganizi ng the existing structure with more focus on current terrorism issues and thr eats these recommendations tended to concentrate on the consequence management side of the combating terrorism issue how the nation should prepare to respond to the aftermath of successful terrorist attack many of these deba tes were resolved when th administration proposed and congress mandated the formation of the partment of homeland security formed in january 200353 the narrower mission of crisis response interdicting or deterring an attack with either law enforcement or military forces receives much less attention in the proposals many of the suggestions for creating new agency were grounded in the perceived need for unified national frame work for combating terrorism the new structure would be responsible for planni ng and integrating the activities of the multiple government agencies involved in terrorism policy budget considerations and operations most importa ntly supporters say the ag ency would coordinate the federal response with local and state aut horities to make full use of all resources available while all these suggestions may make great strides towards focusing federal state and local consequen ce management programs on the current challenges they do not nece ssarily make contribution to crisis response issues many

rism crisis response appear to work well overall while protecting civil liberties congressional oversight congress has taken proactive approach to the significant challenges associated with combating terrorism recent gislation like the nunnlugardomenici domestic preparedness pr ogram has been successful in enhancing domestic consequence management capabilities at the federal state and local levels however other attempts to legislate policy and structure for combating terrorism have been less successful proposals to cr eate an office of terrorism preparedness and new deputy attorney general for combating domestic terrorism during the last congressional ssion while initially r eceiving wide support were eventually not approved when the final version of the b ill emerged the proposals were an attempt to create structure that would have budgetary and po licy oversight on the dozens of departments and agencies responsible for responding to terrorist attacks with over 11 billion in the fiscal year 2001 co mbating terrorism budget congressional oversight of increasingly complex and rapi dly growing programs is considerable task responsibility for reviewing the comba ting terrorism budget is now divided among number of key congressional commi ttees in both houses several recent studies have recommend new approach to providing oversight for both combating terrorism policy and budget special jo int committee or one in each chamber with fulltime staff having the necessary ex perience and background in terrorism issues that would bridge these jurisdic tional boundaries has been proposed55 proponents point to the permanent select committees on intelligence that each chamber now employs for oversight of an equally complicated issue the objective is to help eliminate duplication in programs and funding and develop more coherent national plan for combating terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30938crs23 additionally congress may wish to undert ake thorough review of the current statutes and other legislation affecting domestic combating terrorism policy with view toward facilitating increased coopera tion among federal agencies charged with combating terrorism responsibilities conclusion most experts agree that the united states is vulnerable to terrorism while intelligence experts contend that the use of wmd is less likely than the more conventional forms of terrorism the conse quences of successful attack could be massive many believe that current us policy for dealing with domestic terrorism lacks coherent focus recent proposals fo r restructuring nationa llevel organizations to deal with major terrorist event have mostly centered on the consequence management aspect crisis response cooperation between the fbi and the military is well demonstrated the military s demonstrated that it understands its supporting role to law enforcement and is pr epared to act with technical assistance or tactical forces as called upon recent changes in the nsc policy structure will most probably take some time to have an effect on policy or operational issues additionally reshaping national strategy on domestic terrorism more clearly articulating the militarys statutory authority or limitations in domestic situations and providing critical and focused congressi onal oversight and assistance to those functions would clearly enhance the capabilitie s of crisis response forces to deter or interdict possible terrorist incident
