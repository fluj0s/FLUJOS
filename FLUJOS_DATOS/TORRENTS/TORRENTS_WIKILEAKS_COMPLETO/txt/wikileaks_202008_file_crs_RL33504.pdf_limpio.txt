an economic and environmental justification for federal participation other issues that shaped the wrda 2007 debate included different opinions on corps re form measures such as i ndependent review and project planning and the need for prioritizing among authorized projects increases in the federal cost for some water resources activities and nonfeder cost share credits and expansion of the corps authorizati ons in municipal water and wastewater infrastructure called environmental infrastructure projects wrda 2007 authorized more than 2 billion in construction activities to restore wetlands in coastal louisiana as well as 6 billion in actions to improve hurricane protection in new orleans authoriz ations for navigati on improvements 22 billion and ecosystem restoration 17

presidential ve to of wrda 2007 wrda 2007 pl 110114 became law on november 9 2007 authorizin g approximately 900 projects studies and modifications to existing authorizations the president vetoed wrda 2007 citing excessive authorizations and lack of fiscal discipline and priorities this was the first congressional override of ve to by president george w bush for information on the override pr ocess see crs report rs22654 veto override procedure in the house and senate by elizabeth rybicki authorization level central issue in the debate over wrda 2007 was its level of authorizations congressiona l budget office cbo analysis of the conference report estimated the 15year impact at 23 billion the conference reports authorization level exceeded the timates for the house and senate versions of the bill which were around 14 billi on and 15 billion principal among the reasons for the higher authorization vels in the conference report were that it included majority of authoriz ations in the house and senate bills and many of the authorizations were only in one of those bills the army corps in august 2007 incr eased federal cost estimates for new orleans hu rricane protection by approximately 36 billion previous estimates had been for approximately 22 billion in federal funding beyond the suppl emental appropriations already provided for this work and to lesser extent approx imately 20

environmental justification for federal par ticipation agency reform issues throughout congressi onal consideration of wrda 2007 independent review remained debated policy issue conferees were faced with the challenge of reconciling the house and senate language the provisions had differed on which projects coul d be reviewed ie the scope of the review which projects could be exempt ed or included for review who would be performing and directing the reviews and how recommendations resulting from the reviews would be treated wrda 2007 used the technical review approach of the house bill rather than the senates broader policy review wrda 2007 did not create separate office of independent re view which had been part of the senate language wrda 2007 also established safety assurance review process for hurricane protection and flood damage pr ojects it gave the corps chief of engineers discretion regarding when to call for safety review regional project authorizations other issues that shaped wrda 2007 included different opinions about the specifi cs of project authorizations including the billiondollar regional authorizations for coastal louisiana wetlands restor ation flood and storm protection and navigation projects including authorization of the morganato the gulf project and the author ization levels and specifics of wetlands restoration activities for coastal louisiana florida everglades ecosystem restoration projects including authorization of activities under the modified water deliveries project and upper mississippi river illinois waterway umriww navigationand ecosystem restoration projects including concerns about linking the funding of navigation and restorati on activities other issues wrda 2007 created committee on levee safety to make recommendations for national levee safety program it also authorized the corps to participate in more than 200 munici pal water and wastewater infrastructure projects called environmental infrastructure at the corps some taxpayer groups spoke out against these authorizations argu ing that other government agencies had existing competitive programs to assist with these municipal infrastructure needs 2 and that these projects were outside the scope of the agencys core missionsproponents of environmental in frastructure argued that these authorizations were necessary to assist projects that were in eligible or unsuccessful at obtaining funds through other programs some new issues entered the wrda bate during consideration by the 110 th congress for example some environm ental groups raised concerns that wrdahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33504crs3 2007 did not directly address the impact of climate change on flood risk across the nation interest in directing the corps to study the energy and fuelrelated consequences of dam re moval also was raised background and analysis the us army corps of engineers is federal agency in the department of defense with military and civ ilian responsibilities at the direction of congress the corps plans builds operates and maintains wide range of water resources facilities in us states and territories the agen cys traditional civil responsibilities have been creating and maintaining navi gable channels and controlling floods in the last two decades congress has increased the corps responsibilities in ecosystem restoration municipal water and wastewater infrastructure disaster relief and other activities the agencys regulatory responsibility for navigable water extends to issuing permits for private actions that might affect wetla nds and other waters of the united states wrda is the main legislative vehicle for corps civil works authorizations after providing background information on wrda this report considers the major issues that shaped wrda 2007 in the 110th congress including changes to corps project development practices and policies coastal louisiana wetlands restoration activities umriww investments and everglades restoration projects wrdas authorizing corps studies and projects wrda legislation provides the corps with authority to study water resource problems construct projects and make major modifications to projects the provisions and contents of wrda are cumulative and new acts do not supersede or replace previous acts unless explicit language modifies replaces or terminates previous authorizations new wrda adds to the original language and often amends provisions of previous acts congress generally authorizes corps wa ter resources studies as part of wrda or in resolution by an authorizing committee the house transportation and infrastructure committee or the senate environment and public works committee authorization for construction projects and changes to the policies guiding the corps civil works program such as project costsha re requirements are typically in wrdas authorization of corps projects generally does not expire however there is process to deauthorize projects that have not received appropriations for seven years although congress has historically author ized corps projects as part of wrda authorizations also have been included in appropriations bills especially in years when wrda has been delayed or not enacted at all corps authorizing committees generally discourage authorizations in appropriations bills authorization in appropriations bills may be subject to point of order on the house floor authorization establishes projects essential character which is seldom substantially modified durin g appropriations the appropr iations process however plays significant role in realizing pr oject appropriations termine which studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33504crs4 3 for more information on the corps appropriations see crs report rl33346 energy and water development fy2007 appropriations coordinated by carl behrens and projects receive federal f unds3 many authorized activities never receive appropriations during the last 15 years congress has authorized not only navigation and traditional flood control projects but so ecosystem restoration environmental infrastructure assistance and other activities increasing competition for construction funds prior to wrda 2007 the corps had an existing backlog of more than 800 authorized projects with more than 500 projects not consistently receiving construction appropr iations before the enactment of wrda 2007 the corps estimated the construction b acklog at 39 billion for authorized projects that remained active corps projects wrdas in past congresses wrda 1986 pl 99662 was milestone fo r the corps it marked the end of decadelong stalemate between congress and the executive branch regarding authorizations and changed the relations hip and costsharing requirements between the agency and the nonfederal sponsors of its projects it also established user fees and environmental requireme nts pressure to authorize new projects increase authorized funding levels and modify existing projects is often intense thus promoting consideration of wrda enactment however may be complicated because of more general bate about the corps missions and how best to use the agencys resources and budget since 1986 cycle of biennial consideration of wrda has been loosely followed biennial enactment has been less consistent with wrdas enacted in 1988 pl 100676 1990 pl 101640 1992 pl 102580 1996 pl 104303 1999 pl 10653 nd 2000 pl 106541 after 2000 the 107th 108th and 109th congresses considered but di d not enact wrda legislation wrda 2007 issues because of the number of projects awaitin g authorization and the length of time since congress enacted the last wrda in 2000 there was considerable support among some stakeholders for the 110th congress to enact wrda 2007 the bush administration did not send congress wrda proposal instead it expressed its position through administration letters and statements of administration policy by the office of management and budget omb reason cited by the president for vetoing wrda 2007 was billions in new aut horizations including billions for projects that the administration considers to be outside the core mission of the agency that create unrealistic expectations among local communities of likely federal actions and funding the administr ation also opposed provisions that would increase the federal financ ing of corps projects corps reform and policy changes some stakeholders sought changes to th agency and its procedures like those in s 564 the water resources planning and modernization act of 2007 othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33504crs5 4 although the 106th congress did not enact corps changes it asked the national academy of sciences to review corps planning in 216 of wrda 2000 in april 2004 the academys national research council nrc published four reports from this review each report recommended changes in corps practi ces and the larger federal water resources management and organizational context the four 2004 nrc reports were 1 adaptive management for water resources planning 2 analytic methods and approaches for water resources project planning 3 river basins and coastal systems planning within the us army corps of engineers and 4 us army corps of engineers water resources planning new opport unity for service washington dc nati onal academy press 5 the corps released five new policy documents in 2005 for the agencys planning activities available at httpwwwusacearmymilpublica tionsengcircularseccwhtml one on collaborative planning of corps projects is an update to the agencys planning guidance another set out processes for the peer revi ew of scientific engineering and economic information and assessments used to inform decisionmaking third established civil works review board that approves the final planning reports before submitting them to the chief of engineers opposed changes to the corps support for changing the corps practices gained momentum in 2000 in the wake of series of critical articles in the washington post whistleblower allegations and ensuing investigations many of the allegations raised were particularly critical of the corp s umriww navigation studies that were underway in the 1990s the failure of corp sconstructed floodwa lls in new orleans and the findings of subsequent investiga tions strengthened support for some corps reform measures and heightened concerns about the quality of the agencys work many advocates for change primarily environmental groups sought to modify corps project planning eg by changing th benefitcost analysis and consideration of environmental impacts and benefits to require dditional review of corps projects eg through external review of corps feasibility reports and to strengthen environmental protection eg through modifications to fish and wildlife mitigation requirements these kinds of changes ofte n were referred to as corps reform although corps reforms were discussed in the 106th4 107th 108th and 109th congresses significant changes were enacted the corps argued that it hadtransformed itself by po licies it had implemented since 2000 these included refinements in consideration of environmen tal benefits during pl anning internal peer review and guidance about optional external review 5 other stakeholders argued that any changes should have moved the agency in different direction than the measures pursued by nvironmental groups supporters of streamlining corps practices which incl uded many of the nonfederal sponsors for corps projects argued that the provisi ons supported by the environmental groups were unnecessary and would dd delay cost and uncertain ty to an already lengthy project development and c onstruction process they wanted to increase the predictability of the corps planning process by making changes such as standardizing planning procedures models and data limiting the length of studies and requiring tracking of the agencys construction backlog wrda 2007 contains range of provisi ons that changed corps policies including an independent review provision the house and senate provisions had differed on which projects coul d be reviewed ie the sc ope of the review whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33504crs6 projects could be exempted or included for review who would be performing and directing the reviews and how recommendations resulting from the reviews would be treated the senate vers ion included requirements for independent safety reviews of the construction of corps flood nd storm damage reduction projects requirement prompted by th floodwall failures in new or leans similar safety review was included in the house bill wrda 2007 includes safety assurance review for hurricane protection and flood damage projects but gives the corps chief of engineers discretion regarding when to call for safety review over all wrda 2007 adopted the technical review approach of the house bill rather than the senates broader policy review and did not create separate office of independent review which d been part of the senate language it also adopted the suns et provision for the independent review requirements from the house bill but extended the deadline from four years to seven years wrda 2007 allowed the chief of gineers to exempt from review projects considered routine some projects invol ving rehabilitation and replacement and projects that pose minimal loss of life risks environmental infrastructure the administration some members of congress and some stakeholders oppose authorizations for projects outside the agencys core mission areas of navigation flo od control and ecosystem restoration in particular they oppose environmental infrastructure projects ie municipal wate r and wastewater projects before 1992 the corps had not been involved in these types of projects in recent years appropriations for corps environm ental infrastructure have ranged from 94 million in the fy2007 work plan for the agency to more than 200 million in some years representing between 2 and 4 of the agencys budget opponents of corps involvement in environmenta l infrastructure argue that other government agencies have existing competitive programs to assist with these municipal infrastructure needs proponents of envir onmental infrastructure argue that these corps projects are necessary because existing federal programs are unable to address all the existing needs either because of pr ogram eligibility criteria or constrained resources wrda 2007 authorized more than 200 new corps environmental infrastructure projects coastal louisiana the corps has prominent role in new orleans and southeast louisiana hurricane recovery efforts including repa iring damaged floodwalls and levees and strengthening hurricane resiliency through infrastructure fortification and longterm wetlands restoration the co rps continues to repair nd strengthen many of the areas hurricane protection levees and floodwalls using authority and funding provided in supplemental appr opriations legislation funding for this work is an ongoing appropriations issue the 109th congress on the last day of the session december 9 2006 passed the gulf of mexico energy security ac t of 2006 pl 109432 it shares 375 of certain offshore oil and gas re venues with four specified gulf coast states including louisiana these funds may total almo st 350 million over the next decade and morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33504crs7 than 25 billion over the next 45 years according to an omb projection from july 2006 they are to be used for projects nd activities to provide coastal protection including conservation coas tal restoration hurricane pr otection and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses as well as fish and wildlife mitigation the law increases funding available in l ouisiana to commit to the nonfederal portion of restoration and hurricane protec tion efforts authorized in wrda 2007 wetlands restoration and protection coastal wetlands in louisiana have been disappearing at high rate as result of both human activities and natural processes those losses are forecast to c ontinue if actions are taken to reverse current trends federal agencies led by th corps and in coordination with the state developed several ve rsions of plans to slow the rate of loss and restore some of these wetlands the current corps feasibility report was re leased in november 2004 before hurricanes katrina and rita it received favorable recommendation in january 2005 in report by the corps chie f of engineers the report recommended measures totaling an estimated 20 billi on 11 billion for projects and programs for immediate authorization more than 01 b illion for investigations of largescale concepts that have already been authorized and 07 billi on for future authorization of 10 restoration features the corps feasibility report proposed activities to divert water from the mississippi river to convey sediments into near by wetlands and to help stabilize the co astline it is important to note that even if this plan is fully implemented losses will continue but at much slower rate the federal government would pay about 65 of the to tal estimated cost in the diversions wetlands would gradually r eestablish themselves on ne wly deposited sediments the coastal louisiana title of wrda 2007 title vii used the corps feasibility report as starting point to reflect concerns raised and knowledge gained by hurricanes katrina and rita additional pr ovisions were added by the house and senate and further changes were made in the conference report the conference report makes number of adju stments to language on what is to be considered in restoration often combining language from the two chambers bills the enacted title authorizes more projects than were included in either of the passed bills either directly if the secretary determines they are feasible or with the approval by resolution of the two authorizing co mmittees the house transportation and infrastructure committee and the senate environment and public works committee more specifically title vii authorized the development and periodic update of comprehensive plan for coastal louisiana and listed several planning priorities including not only wetlands creation but also flood protection it also created federalstate task force to participate in developing and implementing the plan supported by expert working groups the task force makes r ecommendations to the secretary and submits biennial report to congress title vii also authorized funding for activities in several areas the task force might examine including 10 million for modification of existing project s 100

describing any modifica tions before it starts any of these five projects it also limited cost increases for each of these initial projects to 150 of the current estimated cost it also authorized the corps to carry out four additional projects that are in earlier stages of pl anning with total estimated cost of 1846 million if they are determined to be feasib and to submit feasibility reports to the authorizing committees by the end of 2009 nd to provide feasibility reports on six other projects with total estimated co st of 5346 million by the end of 2008 the corps can carry out any of these 10 projects if favorable chiefs report is completed by the end of 2010 and both authorizin g committees have pproved resolution title vii allows the secretary to forg economic evaluations if these projects environmental benefits to the coastal louisiana ecosystem are demonstrated in addition to the reports to congress listed above title vii called for several other status reports on progress of the work th most significant of which may be comprehensive overview to be provided six years after the date of enactment hurricanes katrina and rita altered the debate over wetlands restoration proposals and the costshare for restora tion investments many restoration proponents are ca lling for more extensive efforts than those authorized in wrda 2007 generally their support has centere d on

agricultural products in some global markets the river is also losing the habitat diversity that allowed it to support an unusually large num ber of species for temperate river system this loss is partially attributable to changes in the distribution and movement of river water cau sed by navigation structures and operation of the 9foot navigation channel the corps chief of engineers appr oved

continuedarmy civil works requested that an economic reevaluation of the navigation investments be made ava ilable by the end of september 2007 the reliability and completeness of the corps analysis of the umriww navigation investments previously had been the subject of contr oversy and investigation critics of the investments argued that the economic justification for the navigation locks were decreasing with the use of corn in the re gion for ethanol production rather than the corn being shipped on the waterway to international markets the critics questioned the urgency necessity and national benef it of the investments supporters of the investments argued that competitiveness of us products was being harmed by the additional cost and travel time incurred during transit through and waiting for availability of the existing shorter locks the corps ecosystem restoration plan was less controversial than the umr iww navigation investments general agreement existed that the ecosystem is declining and general support existed for the first 15year increment of the corps 50year ecosystem restoration plan deba over the restoration proposal focused primarily on implementation strategies including linkages between the ecosystem restoration and navigation i nvestments and the federal nonfederal cost share for restoration activities everglades restoration projects under the comprehensive everglades restoration plan the largest corps ecosystem restoration effort to date is in the florida everglades with threedecade 109 billion re storation program congress approved the corps implementation of the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp as framework for everglades restor ation in wrda 2000 with 50 federal50 nonfederal cost share for the program th principal objective of cerp is to store freshwater that currently flows to the ocean and redirect it back to the everglades where it originally was kept the retained water is expected to help restore the natural hydrologic functi ons of the everglades ecosystem wrda 2000 authorized an initial set of cerp rest oration projects with tota l costs estimated at 14 million representing 700 million in federa l responsibility it also established process for additional projects outlined in cerp to be developed and au thorized wrda 2007 authorized more than 18 billion in cerp activities representing 09 billion in federal responsibility modified water deliveries project prior to cerp the federal government and the state of florida had undertaken other everglades re storation activities including the modified water deliveries pr oject mod waters the project is controversial ecological restor ation effort in south florid designed to improve water delivery to everglades national park9 completion of

directions to the corps on mod waters for example it directed the chief of engineers to take immediate steps to increase flows to the everglades national park without si gnificantly increasing the risk of roadbed failure it also directed the chief of engineers to reexamine prior reports and environmental documentation associated with modifying water deliveries to the park and to submit to congress by july 1 2008 recommendations on practicable alternatives for increasing the flow of water under tamiami trail and into the park wrda in the federal water resources context in addition to directing future federal investments in water resources through wrda authorizations congress also is fronted with addressing water resources issues that are not resolved through aut horizing new projects an example of an ongoing water resource issue affecting the corps and the nation that may receive congressional attention outside of wrda is multiuse river management an array of interests are questioning current river management practices across the nation and how management can balance benefits and harm across multiple river uses including instream uses how the nation us and values its rivers has changed over time rivers now are seen as providing not only economic benefits but also recreational opportunitie s and species habitat this shift has resulted in reexamination by the courts agencies and stakeholders of the distribution of economic and other benefits of management alternatives for example missouri river management raises some fundamental questi ons about water resources management such as whether some river us should take prior ity over others eg threatened and endangered species prot ection over inland wate rway transportation or vice versa and how precedence should be decided eg balancing competing uses versus maximizing economic benefits versus maintaining minimum levels of some values the rivers management is prime example of the complex issues in which the corps is embroiled that often result in congressional consideration through oversight or legislative language in wrda or other bills broad water resource issue that is unlik ely to be directly addressed by wrda but is significant to the agency and the na tion is the federal role in water resources hurricane katrina raised questions about this role in particular the disaster brought attention to the tradeoffs in benefits costs and risks of the current division of responsibilities among local state nd federal entities for flood mitigation preparedness response and recovery the stion of the federal role also is raised by increasing competition over water supplies not only in the west but also for urban centers in the east eg atlanta wh ich have resulted in growing number of communities seeking financial and other federal assistance actions and permits related to water supply velopment eg desalinati on and water reuse projects reservoir expansions and re operations congress rarely chooses to pursue broad legislation on federal wate r resources policies for many reasons including the challenge of enacting changes that affect such wide breadth of
