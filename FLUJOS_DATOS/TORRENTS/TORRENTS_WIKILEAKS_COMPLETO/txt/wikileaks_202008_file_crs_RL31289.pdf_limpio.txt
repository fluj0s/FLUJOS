activities terrorist act in certain circumstances the act enables law enforcement officials to intercept the communications of computer trespassers and improves their ability to track computer

nations critical infrastructures are minimally detrimental although the act does not explicitly address electronic commerce commerce many of the laws provisions may impact it in particular title iii responds to concerns that more can be done to prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism over time these provisions may affect ecommerce broadly and electronic fund transfers specifically electronic government egovernment c ould be affected by the act in both positive and negative ways the intense focus on improving data collection and information sharing practices and systems may contribute to the establishment of governmentwide technical standards and be st practices that could facilitate the implementation of new and existing egovernment initiatives it could also promote the utilization of secure web portals to help ensure the data integrity of transactions between the government and citizens nd business however concern about potential abuses of data collection provisions could dampen citizen enthusiasm for carrying out electronic transac tions with the government the act provides law enforcement officials with greater authority to monitor internet activity such as electronic mail email and web site visits while law enforcement officials laud their new authorities as enabling them to better track terrorist and other criminal activity privacy ri ghts advocates worry that in an attempt to track down and punish the terrorists who threaten american democracy one of the fundamental tenets of that democracyprivacymay itself be threatened because of the controversial aspects of some provisions in the act particularly regarding privacy congress and other groups are expected to monitor closely how the act is

scrutinized while law enforcement officials heralded the passa ge of what they regard as necessary provisions for counteracting terrorists and other criminals civil liberties gr oups urged caution in passing new law in an emotiona lly charged environment during debate some representatives raised c oncerns about the process used to bring the bills to the floor in the house for example the version of hr 2975 as reported from the judiciary committee on october 11 hrept 107236 part 1 was replaced by the text of new bill hr 3801 for the purposes of debate2 hr 3801 was very similar but not identical to s 1510 as it had passed the senate hours earlier hence some representatives felt they had insufficient time to review the legislation they were being asked to vote on among the changes in hr 3801 was an extension of the sunset period on several of the electronic surveillance provisions from 2 years to 5 years some members had argued for short sunset period maintaining that the changes in the law were being made hurriedly in light of this history it appears that oversight of the acts implementation will be of considerable interest to congress and broad range of interest groups this

merely being nuisance and in most cases rises to the level of federal crime pursu ant to 18 usc 1030 it is also conceivable that under certain conditions such actions could be considered terrorist act or rise to the level of endangering national security by threatening the functioning of the country s critical infrastructure for the most part law enforcement agencies seem to have had adequate tools to investigate prosecute and penalize thes offenses one area where officials have sought improvement for some time however is in streamlining their ability to track computer trespassers both in real time or af ter the fact prior to passage of the usa patriot act procedures required investigators to re quest court orders warrants subpoenas etc from multitude of jurisd ictions since most computer trespassers will route their communications around th world while the usa patriot act is directed primarily to improve the ability of the government to detect prevent and respond to the kinds of terrorist attacks ex perienced last september and october number of the provisions affect the governments law enforcement surveillance and investigatory powers more generally those that directly and indirectly affect the ability of the government to investigate prosecute and perhaps deter computer trespassers whatever their inte nt are listed below provisions of the usa patriot act affecting computer security section 105 expands upon the us secr et services national electronic crime task force initiative the us secret service has been leading new york electronic crime task force that has been held up as model of success for investigating variety of electronic crimes ranging from cloning cell phones to denialofservice attacks against online trading companies4 the task force includes

that is used in manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the united states 6earlier versions of the bill would have allowed the trespassers communications to be intercepted wherever they were directed the acts more restricted language was compromise position 7a pen register allows the user to code or decode the dialing routing addressing or signaling information transmitted by an inst rument or facility in terms of computer continuedsection 202 and section 217 clarify that law enforcement officials may seek permission to intercept electronic comm unications of computer trespassers section 202 adds 18 usc 1030 computer fraud and abuse offenses to the list of offenses for which the attorney general or other signated officials may authorize request for court order to intercept targeted communications section 217 defines computer trespasser as someone who accesses protected computer5 without authorization and thus has reasonable expectation of privacy in any communication to through or from the protected computer section 217 also specifies the conditions under which the communications of comput er trespasser may be intercepted those conditions are the owner or operator of the protected computer authorizes the interception the pers on acting under color of law is lawfully engaged in an investigation the person acting under color of law has reasonable grounds to expect the c ontent of the computer trespassers communication is relevant to the investigation and the interception acquires only the trespassers communications within the invaded computer6 prior to the act the statute was less explicit in specifying the terms under which computer trespassers communications could be intercepted section 210 expands the information th at law enforcement officials may obtain with appropriate authoriza tion from providers of electronic communications service or remote computing services regarding subscriber or customer of those services the information may now include subscribers or customers means and source of payment the language is also modified to include information more clearly related to internet use eg session times and temporarily assigned network addresses these changes are to improve the ability of law enforcement officials to track the activity and identity of suspects concerning wide range of offenses including terrorist activities and those of computer trespassers section 211 clarifies that in the dere gulated telecommunications environment cable providers that also provide comm unication services are governed by the same statutes as other electronic communication providers in regard to interception of communications disclo sure of customer records and application of pen registers and trap and trace devices7 prior to deregulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31289crs4 7continued security it allows the law enfo rcement official to identify the address to which computer trespasser is sending message trap and trace device allows the user to identify the source of wire or electronic communication in terms of computer security it allows the law enforcement official to identify the address from which the computer trespasser is sending messagecable providers followed different rules therefore law enforcement officials now have the same surveillance and investigatory powers in regard to cases involving cable internet services information regarding subscribers selection of video programming however continues to be governed separately section 216 modifies the authorities rela ting to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices as result of secti on 216 single court order authorizing the use of pen register or trap and trace device can be used to apply those devices to any computer or facility anyw here in the country prior to the act authorization had to be obtained in each jurisdiction where the devices needed to be applied also the availability of this authority with respect to computer communications was unclear it was generally thought that these devices could only be used on telephone equipment section 220 allows single court w ith jurisdiction over the offense under investigation to issue warrant allowing the search of electronic evidence anywhere in the country prior to this the warrant needed to be issued by court within the jurisdiction where the information resided section 808 adds certain computer fra ud and abuse offenses to the list of violations that may constitute federal crime of terrorism the new provisions apply to anyone who knowingly accesses computer without authorization and obtains classified information and anyone who knowingly causes the transmission of program informa tion code or command and as result intentionally causes damage to protect ed computer the inclusion of these offenses in the definition of federal crime of terrorism in section 2332bg5b relates primar ily to who has investigatory authority over the offenses the attorney general in this case however by virtue of cross references in other parts of the act including these offenses in the definition of terrorism also affects the extension of their statute of limitations section 809 of the act postrelease supervis ion of someone convicted of these offenses under certain circumstan ces section 812 of the act and applicability of the racketeering statutes section 813 of the act according to section 809 should these computer offenses result in or create foreseeable risk of death or serious bodily injury there is statute of limitations under similar conditions section 812 could lead to lifetime postrelease supervision th crossreference to r acketeering statutes gives law enforcement officials more tools with which to prosecute computer trespassershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31289crs5 section 814 increases the penalties fo r certain computer fraud and abuse offenses the penalty for first offe nse of causing the transmission of program information code or command that inten tionally causes damage to protected computer increases from 5 years to 10 years the penalty for second such offense or second offens of intentionally gaining unauthorized access to protected computer and as result recklessly causing damage is increased from 10 years to 20 years also it is now an offense to attempt to commit these offenses this section also redefines damage damage is now defined as i loss to one or more persons during any 1year period aggregating at least 5000 in value ii modifi cation or impairment or potential modification or impairment of the dical examination diagnosis treatment or care of one or more individuals iii physical injury to any person iv threat to public health or safety v damage affecting computer system used by or for government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice national defense or nati onal security item v is new also item i is rewritten prior to this it was not cl ear whether the 5000 threshold was per person affected or the total value of damages caused to all people affected the new language clarifies that it is the latter finally the section also modifies the language in 18 usc 1030 regarding civil suits this includes new language that says victims suffering damages resulting from an offense listed in section 1030 may not sue under th is section for negligent design or manufacture of hardware software or firmware this is broad immunity that protects manufacturers should any design or manufacture problem lead to damages including one would expect security vulnerabilities which are common problem in trying to make information systems more secure section 816 authorizes the expenditure of 50 million to develop and support regional cybersecurity forensic capabilities there are already number of computer forensic laboratories blished this would encourage the establishment of additional ones in addition to assisting federal authorities to investigate and prosecute computer crimes the laboratories are to train federal state and local officials in computer forensics to assist state and local officials in investigating and prosecuting state and local computer offenses and to share expertise and information on the latest developments in computer forensics provisions affecting criti cal infrastructure protection since information networks including the internet are considered critical infrastructures the above sections are also relevant to this discussion however there are two additional provisions that affect the protection of other critical infrastructures more generally title vii is entitled increased information sharing for critical infrastructure protection however the lone section in the title section 701 really addresses set of illegal activities much broader than attacks on critical infrastructures there exists within the department of justice bureau of justice grant program that helps establish

activities tracked by the information sharing system section 1016 puts into statut elements of the critical infrastructure policy that have been articulated by both the c linton and the bush administrations8 that is to ensure that any physical or virtual ie computerinduced disruption of the nations critical infrast ructures be rare brief geographically limited manageable and min imally detrimental to the economy human and government services and national secur ity of the united states the section defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters the section also establishes national infrastructure simulation and analysis center the center is to support related counter terrorism threat assessment and risk mitigation activities in particular the center is to model and analyze the largescale complexity of critical infrastructures and use those models and analyses to train authorities in incident response to recommend change s in system designs or protections and to provide recommendations to policymakers the center is to receive data from state and local governments and the private sector to assist in developing its models the section so authorizes the appropriation of 20 million through the department of defenses defense threat reduction agency to support activities at the center policy issues many of the provisions related to the surveillance and investigatory powers of law enforcement have raised concerns within the privacy and civil liberties communities these are discussed in more detail later in this report some of the provisions do not necessarily grant law enforcement officials more power in practice but clarify that those powers exist and put them on sounder basis many observers believe that the most important changes affecting law enforcement officials are those provisions allowing for nationwide warrants court orders etc to facilitate the tracking of computer trespassers in the cas of investigating offenses after the fact these provisions may save more resources than time however in cases where officials are trying to track computer trespassers in real time time is of great importance and the provisions should be that much more effective in regard to increasing the penalties for computer trespasse rs there is some debate about

unlikely that the act will immediately affect retail ecommerce eg online catal ogue orders or businesstobusiness commerce eg the use of the internet for inventory orderi ng and management while these forms of ecommerce are growin g very rapidly to date they have not been identified as being particularly susceptible to misuse by terrorists retail commerce and businesstobusiness ecommerce require verifiable information between parties that may include names addresses credit card numbers and other information and can be traced relatively eas ily however some observers have not ruled out terrorists using existing ecommerce exchanges to facilitate their activities in the future18 the more common method of using ecommerce for illicit and terrorist purposes is through financial transactions for example the terrorists involved in the september 11 attacks reportedl used wire transfers rou tinely to fund their activities in the united states most money tr ansfers even relatively small amounts transferred as money orders by firms like western union money gram and other smaller companies are done electronically there is need to establish bank account or fill out credit reporting forms identification requi rements are minimal money wire firms outlet may be located in supermarket or drugstore and staffed by store employees and it can take less than fifteen minutes to send money around the world19 the usa patriot act addresses wire transfers and money orders by requiring among other provisions the regi stration of all money order agents by december 31 2001 and increasing the crimin penalties for those who knowingly conduct or ssist in transferring money that is intended to promote or support an illegal activity these provisions not only cover the physical transfer of money for these purposes but electronic transfers as well20 larger financial institutions whic h conduct much of their business electronicallyand therefore are part of the ecommerce business sectorare also affected by the usa patriot act among the provisions affecting large multinational financial corporations are increased authority for us law enforcement officials to

and resources to comply with the ac t without providing any assistance in the war against terrorism according to ellen zimiles partner in kpmgs forensics practice large us bank spends 10 million per

defense and security over time title iii of the usa patriot act may affect ecommerce broadly and electronic transfers specifically how this act will affect law enforcement and security efforts in the internet age and its actual impact on privacy rights and data integrity remains to be seen electronic government26 significant component of many of the in itiatives regarding the usa patriot act specifically and homeland s ecurity generally involves the use of information technology to enhance existin g government processes or create new ones some of these initiatives may contribute to the growing effort to implement egovernment projects by both congress and the bush administration through enhanced data sharing and greater confidence in the security and reliability of the networks other initiatives may inadvertently create obst acles by restricting access to information flows and re ducing privacy protections provisions of the usa patriot act affecting electronic government there are number of provisions in th usa patriot act that are relevant to egovernment interests egovernment involves using information technology and especially the internet to improve the delivery of government services to citizens business and other government agencies27 most of these provisions are independent of one another reflectin g the often disparate and disconnected nature of government

enterprise uses its collective intelligence to accomplish its strategic objectives28 as the above summary of the relevant provisions suggests enhanced data shar ing and knowledge mana gement techniques are expected to play significant role in homeland security efforts several of the provisions focus on improving access and th sharing of centralized databases by federal state and local law enforcement ag encies some of the provisions also seek to establish more fully integrated database system for processing and tracking the granting of visas as well as the entry and exit of foreign nationals in the united states in many cases these provisions are designed to rectify the problems associated with having multiple incompa tible and sometimes overlapping databases which have been identified as one of the contributing factors to the difficulties law enforcement and intelligence agencies have had tracking suspected terrorists29 just as knowledge management has been reco gnized as an important component of improved homeland security its proponents argue that knowledge management could play significant role in egovernment initiatives generally knowledge management efforts involving egovernment have so far encountered va riety of obstacles30 some of these obstacles include creating the appropriate technical and support infrastructure achieving user buyin and managing the development and use of specialized information some have sugge sted the creation of the position of chief knowledge officers ckos at the agency department andor federal level to facilitate the execution of specific knowle dgeintensive projects and support larger government reform effort s the success of knowledge managementdata sharing efforts in the homeland security area coul d affect the

to realize the efficiencies hoped for and convenience necessary to achieve the sired citizen usage levels so far such standards have been established the challenge of establishing large scale pki system raises many issues some of these include the lack of federal interoperable standards the feasibility of implementation and high costs33 first the lack of fede ral interoperable standards raises the question of who would be res ponsible for developing and promulgating such standards the national institute of standards and tec hnology nist often works with industry to fac ilitate and develop t echnical standards and measurements however it is currently unclear what role nist would play in developing any pki standards assuming the acceptance of the pki approach it is also unclear whether the federal government should work to creat standard for its own use or if it should rely on the development of an indus try standard which may take longer to emerge second large scal fullfeatured pki syst ems are not common raising questions regarding the scalability of th technology and the resources needed to accomplish the task implementation of such system would require policy makers to decide if the federal government has sufficient expertise and resources to create large scale pki system inhouse or if it will need to be outsourced to one or more private contractors third the largely unc harted nature of such an undertaking and the high costs of pki systems generally raises concerns for budget planning and oversight proponents of gove rnmentwide pki system maintain that if these issues can be adequately addresse d the creation of single governmentwide pki system could promote the utilization of secure web portals to ensure the data integrity of transactions between the government and citizens and business privacy in contrast to the two previous ly discussed issues the implications of the usa patriot act on privacy could have negative effect on egovernment initiatives surveys have shown that the loss of privacy as result of egovernment is significant concern among citizens34 as mentioned in the earlier section on computer security the act expands the type of information that may be collected by law enforcement officials from providers of electronic communications services or remote computing services it also allows for the issuance of nationwide search warrants to facilitate the track ing of computer trespassers concerns about potential misuse of these data collection provisions could dampen citizen enthusiasm for carrying out electronic

monitoring of internet usage35 until the september 11 2001 terrorist acts the internet privacy debate focused on consumer privacy issues sparked by the collection use and dissemination of personally identifiable information by commercial web site operators36 t h practices of law enforcement agencies in monitoring the activities of individuals as they use the internet for electronic mail email or visiting web sites was an important but less visible issue congre ss addressed it primarily in the context of ensuring that the federal bureau of inve stigation fbi did not overstep its authority in using software program called carnivore later renamed dcs 100037 with court order the fbi could in stall carnivore on the equipmen t of an internet service provider isp to monitor suspects inte rnet activity which raised concern about whether the software was sufficiently precise to avoid monitoring the activity of other isp customers and hence impinging on their privacy while congress remains interested in overseeing the fbis use of carnivore the september 11 terrorist attack s sharpened the debate over how to strike balance between law enforcements need to investigate criminals and protecting what most citizens believe to be their right to privacy38 congress included provisions in the usa patriot act that make it easier for law enforcement to monitor internet activities also many isps that opposed law enforcement monitoring of their customers internet activity reportedly have been quite willing to assist law enforcement in its search for email and other internet evidence

notification is required but disclosure specifically does not include subscribers video programming choices section 212 allows isps to divulge records or other information but not the contents of communications pertaining to subscriber if they believe there is immediate danger of death or serious physical injury or as otherwise authorized and requires them to divulge such records or information excluding contents of communications to governmental entity under certain conditions it also allows an isp to divulge the contents of communications to law enforcement agency if it

sections excluded from the sunset are sections 210 211 and 216 policy issues as noted the challenge for policy makers is balancing the needs of law enforcement with the desire by the public to maintain its privacy in the wake of the terrorist attacks the public appears more willing to make sacrifices in the privacy arena to protect the country against further attacks and br ing the perpetrators of the september 11 assault to justice criticism of the usa patriot act from privacy standpoint has been relatively muted possi bly because of the perception that the public is willing to accept such measures at this time an october 2001 harris poll found that 63 of americans favored monitoring of internet discussions and chat rooms and 54 favored mon itoring cellphones and email42 however privacy advocates worry that in this emotionally charged climate congress is passing legislati on that it later will regret groups such as the american civil liberties union aclu center for

policies mr swindle so pointed out that it is his understanding that the law does not cover web sites only isps he wondered if an online bookseller received many requests for books on for example how to make bombs or fly an airplane and the name of the purchasers reflected one or another ethnic group would that be alarming under concern for terrorism it would seem to that common sense would say that would be alarming but theyre not covered by this49 john kamp an attorney with wiley rein fielding commented that the definitions in the act were murky and we b sites might be covered but that it is clear that this law wasnt designed to go there50 the question of definitions is raised by others including eff in particular eff cites the lack of definitions of cont ent of emails that cannot be retrieved without warrant and the term without au thority in the definition of computer trespasser51 packets of data that comprise email messages may c ontain both content and noncontent information such as rou ting information the act allows law enforcement officials access to noncontent information but not to content thus this definition could be quite important regarding computer trespassers section 217 defines computer trespasser as person who accesses protected computer without authorization but it does not include person with an existing contractual relationship with the owner or operator of the computer eff wants that term to mean only individuals who intentionally br eak into computers with which they have relationship some isps express satisfaction that guidance issued by
