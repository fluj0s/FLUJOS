report which will not be updated describes the industry and discusses several industryrelated issues that have arisen in the 108th congress1 introduction renderers convert dead animals and animal parts that otherwise would require disposal into variety of materials including edible and inedible tallow and lard and proteins such as meat and bone meal mbm2 these materials in turn are exported or sold to domestic manufacturers of wide range of industrial and consumer goods such as livestock feed and pet food soaps pharmaceuticals lubricants plastics personal care products and even crayons also see table 1 on page 6 although rendering provides an essential service to the increasingly intensive and costcompetitive us animal and meat industries and is subject to certain government food safety and environmental regulations the industry has largely operated outside of public view however rendering has attracted greater public attention since the discovery 1 for periodic updates on issues affecting the industry see crs issue brief ib10127 mad cow disease agricultural issues for congress 2 among other sources for this report are sparks companies inc the rendering industry economic impact of future feeding regulations june 2001 and livestock mortalities methods of disposal and their costs march 2002 both prepared for the national renderers association nra don franco and winfield

announced or are considering new regulatory actions intended to reassure foreign and domestic customers that bse will not threaten food safety or us cattle herds these actions are likely to cause changes in renderers business practices costs and product values any changes in the economics of rendering likely will affect the economics of animal and meat producers too industry overview renderers annually convert 47 billion pounds or more of raw animal materials into approximately 18 billion pounds of products sources for these materials include meat slaughtering and processing plants the primary one dead animals from farms ranches feedlots marketing barns animal shelters and other facilities and fats grease and other food waste from restaurants and stores in meat animal slaughtering and processing plants the amount of usable material from each animal depends largely upon the species for example at slaughter 1200 pound steer can yield anywhere from 55 to 60 of human edible product including httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771 meat for retail sale edible fat and variety meats organs tongue tail etc according to various estimates subtracting another 58 for the weight of the hide which goes into leather leaves 3240 of material for rendering if this range were applied consistently to all 355 million us cattle slaughtered in 2003 the equivalent would represent the weight of approximately 11 million to 14 million live cattle3 elsewhere independent renderers collect and process about half of all livestock and poultry that die from diseases or accidents before reaching slaughter plants sparks 2002 us farm animal mortalities in 2000 included approximately 41 million cattle and calves totaling 19 billion pounds 18 million hogs 1 billion pounds 833000 sheep lambs and goats 64 million pounds and 82 million chickens and turkeys 347 million pounds according to sparks which examined usda data disposing of these mortalities is complicated because of the need to minimize adverse environmental consequences such as the spread of human and animal disease or the pollution of ground or surface water sparks 2002 observed for many producers paying modest fee to have renderer remove dead carcasses is likely preferred to finding alternative onfarm disposal methods ie burial incineration or composting number and types of rendering plants one study estimated that 137 firms operated 240 plants in 1997 with total payroll of nearly 10000 employees4 more recently the national renderers association nra estimated that canada and the united states have combined 250260 rendering plants rendering facilities may be either integrated or independent operations 3 yield estimates vary however for example the world health organization who has estimated that half of every cow and third of every pig is not consumed by humans who understanding the bse threat october 2002 4 pl 1079 federal interagency working group animal disease risk assessment prevention and control act of 2001pl 1079 final report january 2003 appendix 6 crs3 integrated plants operate in conjunction with animal slaughter and meat processing plants and handle 6570 of all rendered material the estimated 95 us and canadian facilities nra render most edible animal byproducts ie fatty animal tissue mainly into edible fats tallow and lard for human consumption edible rendering is subject to the inspection and safety standards of usdas food safety and inspection service fsis or its state counterparts which by law already are present in the meat slaughter and processing plants these plants also render inedible byproducts including slaughter floor waste into fats and proteins for animal feeds and for other ingredients because meat plant typically processes only one animal species such as cattle hogs or poultry its associated rendering operations likewise handle only the byproducts of that species the inedible and edible rendering processes are segregated independent operations handle the other 3035 of rendered material these plants estimated by nra at 165 in the united states and canada usually collect material from other sites using specially designed trucks they pick up and process fat and bone trimmings inedible meat scraps blood feathers and dead animals from meat and poultry slaughterhouses and processors usually smaller ones without their own rendering operations farms ranches feedlots animal shelters restaurants butchers and markets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771 as result the majority of independents are likely to be handling mixed species almost all of the resulting ingredients are destined for nonhuman consumption eg animal feeds industrial products the us food and drug administration fda regulates animal feed ingredients but its continuous presence in rendering plants or in feed mills that buy rendered ingredients is not legal requirement the rendering process in most systems raw materials are ground to uniform size and placed in continuous cookers or in batch cookers which evaporate moisture and free fat from protein and bone series of conveyers presses and centrifuge continue the process of separating fat from solids the finished fat eg tallow lard yellow grease goes into separate tanks and the solid protein eg mbm bone meal poultry meal is pressed into cake for processing into feed5 other rendering systems are used including those that recover protein solids from slaughterhouse blood or that process used restaurant grease this restaurant grease generally is recovered often in 55gallon drums for use as yellow grease in nonhuman food products like animal feeds value and use of rendered products the 18 billion pounds of ingredients that renderers produce each year have been valued at more than 3 billion of which 870 million is exported of the 18 billion pound total 10 billion pounds were feed ingredients with value of approximately 1 billion sparks 2001 mbm accounted for 66 billion pounds of this poultry byproducts 4 billion pounds and blood meal 226 million pounds sparks6 such ingredients are valued for their nutrients high protein content digestible amino acids and minerals and their relatively low cost poultry operations and pet food manufacturers accounted for 66 of the domestic mbm market of nearly 57 billion pounds in 2000 while hog and cattle operations took most of the rest 5 more detailed description and flowchart is on the nra website httpwwwrenderersorg 6 sparks 2001 however mbm as proportion of total animal feed consumed is relatively low at less than 1 each for ruminants and swine about 2 for poultry and 7 for pet food sparks said seventy percent of all blood meal has gone for ruminants mainly dairy otherwise federal rules prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins back to ruminants crs4 policy discussion so long as animals are raised and processed for food vast amounts of inedible materials will be generated the result of premature deaths herd culls and slaughter byproducts regardless of quantity byproducts and rendered products from the slaughter process must be sold at whatever price will clear the market or the industry and the environment incurs cost for disposal7 as government rules and industry practices evolve to address food safety and animal disease concerns like bse options for using these byproducts may become more limited if animal byproducts have fewer market outlets new questions may arise about how to dispose of them safely and who should pay feed ban impacts scientists currently maintain that infected animal feed is the primary source of bse transmission although research continues into other potential sources therefore us officials believe that regulation of feed ingredients is the single most effective method for controlling bse following the widespread outbreaks of bse in great britain and europe the fda in august 1997 imposed ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants prohibited proteins still can be fed to other animals such as pigs poultry and pets fda in late january 2004 announced plans httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771 to expand the list of prohibited proteins estimates vary on the economic impact of the feed ban according to 1997 report prepared for the fda on compliance costs and market impacts the fda feed ban could reduce mbm values by between 63 million and 252 million or 25 to 100 per ton8 sparks june 2001 estimated that the average mbm value loss since the 1997 rule was 18 per ton for total of 288 million during the period 1996 to 2000 sparks added that these losses likely were highly concentrated among renderers that produce mbm exclusively and among those handling mixed species the fdacommissioned report predicted that renderers would pass much of the lost value to packers by paying less for raw materials packers in turn were expected to reduce their payments for cattle the 2001 sparks study examined potential cost impacts of several options for more extensive feed restrictions it estimated that total animal protein feed ban to ruminants would cost 100 million yearly total ban on all ruminant proteins to all farm animals 636 million yearly and total animal protein ban to all farm animals 15 billion yearly downers and dead animals another recent regulatory action with an impact on the rendering industry was usdas december 30 2003 ban on all downer nonambulatory cattle from the human food supply us officials consider downers or animals unable to rise or walk to be one of the higherrisk cattle groups for bse although industry officials note that most animals become nonambulatory from injuries or nonbse diseases before the ban usda estimated that 150000200000 downers were entering slaughter plants one issue is whether the downer ban has removed an economic incentive to market downers and thus made it more difficult for usda to obtain such animals for bse and other disease surveillance 7 pl 1079 federal interagency working group animal disease risk assessment prevention and control act of 2001 pl 1079 final report january 2003 8 eastern research group cost analysis of regulatory options to reduce the risk of an outbreak of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in the united states addendum to the final report april 30 1997 crs5 on march 15 2004 usda announced major expansion of its bse surveillance program that will sample many more downers and dead animals adding that it is looking to renderers among other sites to make these animals available numerous practical problems such as how to recover and store carcasses who will sample the costs etc now confront both government and industry officials9 disposal questions if renderers earn less money from rendered byproducts and dead animals they will pay less for such materials in the past renderers paid for dead animals now most charge fee to pick them up10 in its 2002 study on the cost of livestock mortalities sparks assumed that so long as mbm could be sold for feed the average perhead cost of disposing of dead cattle and calves might be 825 per head if mbm is banned from animal feed the cost could rise to 2411 per head sparks estimated the perhead costs for other disposal methods at 933 for incineration 1063 for burial and 3034 for composting the 2002 world health organization who report observed that rendering because it sanitizes animal wastes performs an essential public service the environmental cleanup of wastes too hazardous for disposal in conventional ways for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771 example animal wastes provide ideal conditions for the growth of pathogens that infect humans as well as animals incineration would cause major air pollution landfill could lead to disease transmission11 usda advisory committee in february 2004 said that along with an enhanced bse surveillance program comprehensive system must be implemented to facilitate adequate pathways for dead and nonambulatory cattle to allow for collection of samples and for proper safe disposal of carcasses this must be done to ensure protection of public health animal health and the environment such system will require expending federal resources to assist with costs for sampling transport and safe disposal12 others temper this view of rendering by observing that the nations clean air and water laws are in place to address possible adverse environmental impacts these responsibilities are enforced under the purview of the us environmental protection agency epa and generally through states and localities which often impose their own environmental and health standards as well while rendering which also must abide by such standards certainly is one option for handling dead stock and animal byproducts it has been argued this option does not relieve the animal and meat industries of their environmental responsibilities because these industries created this material they should bear the costs not the public particularly at time when budget deficits are forcing difficult spending choices the argument goes 9 about 7585 rendering plants currently accept nonambulatory livestock tom cook nra president said in early 2004 about 8590 plants could handle dead animals he also has said information on the bse surveillance plan is available through usda at httpwwwusdagov 10 tom cook nra president personal communication january 19 2004 11 understanding the bse threat p 7 who also notes that bse is the notable exception to renderings ability to kill most infectious agents 12 secretarys advisory committee on foreign
