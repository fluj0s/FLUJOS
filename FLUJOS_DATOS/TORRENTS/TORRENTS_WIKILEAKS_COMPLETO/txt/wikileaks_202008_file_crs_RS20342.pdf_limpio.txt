however is reviewed in this report present law provides that individuals are entitled to claim standard deduction amount rather than itemize deductions in tax year 2008 the standard deduction amounts that taxpayers may deduct from their in come are 5450 if single 8000 as head of household or 10900 if married and filing jointly in 2008 the additional standard deduction is 1050 for each qualifying taxpayer filing joint return who is 65 or older or blind the deduction rises to 1350 if the ta xpayer is single or head of household and 65 or older and blind if taxpayers are marri ed and both spouses are 65 or older or blind an additional 2100 is allowed on joint retu rn if both spouses are 65 or older and blind an additional 4800 is allowed on jo int return these amounts are adjusted annually for inflation the dditional standard deduction am ount is not allowable for dependent who is 65 years old or blind3 legislative history and rationale in the past the advocates of special tax pr ovisions for elderly taxpayers have justified tax concessions based on need they argued that the elderly have small incomes and are unable to adjust their incomes in response to increases in the costofliving since they longer work thus it is surprise that gislative history indicat that the underlying basis of the special tax concessions for the derly is need that ol der persons are not as well off as younger persons who are still working at the introduction of the provision for an additional personal exemption in the 1947 tax bill which was later vetoed the house ways and means committee and the senate committee on finance recognized these considerations in their reports on the bill in the revenue act of 1948 pl 80471 the dditional personal exemption was proposed again based on these considerations both the house ways and means committee and the senate committee on finance reported that there is very heavy concentration of small incomes among persons in this age group reflecting the fact that the group as whol is handicapped in an economic if not in physical sense persons in this age group suffered with unusual severity as result of the rise in the cost of living and the increase in taxes which occurred during the war as well as the additional price increases of the immediate postwar period unlike younger persons the bulk of those over 65 could not compensate for thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20342crs3 4 us congress house committee on ways and means revenue act of 1948 report to accompany hr 4790 80th cong 2nd session hrept 1274 washi ngton gpo 1948 p 20

1987 for elderly or blind individuals 6 the 1986 act provided that beginning in 1988 the personal exemption is reduced or phased out serially for highincome taxpayers the phaseout levels are adjusted for inflationchanges in prices and taxes by accepting fulltime jobs at prevailing high rates of wages4 along with the addition of an extra pers onal exemption for the elderly the 1948 act increased the personal and dependency ex emption amounts from 500 to 600 per person the senate committee report noted that in 1947 dollars income after taxes had declined from an average of 1285 in the first quarter of 1946 to 1188 in the fourth quarter of 1947 the extra personal exemption for the derly was incorporated unchanged in the internal revenue code act of 1954 pl 83591 as th personal and dependency exemption amounts increased ove r the years so too did the amount of the additional exemption accorded the elde rly the exemption amount increased from 625 in 1970 to 1080 in 1986 comprehensive revision of the income tax code was made with enactment of the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 the revi sion was designed to lead to fairer more efficient and simpler tax system in order to lower tax rates the act broadened the tax base by removing the preferential treatment of certain classes of income and expenditures eg capital gains twoearner wage deduction personal interest deductions etc this act also repeal ed the dividend exclusion the po litical contributions credit and the provision for income averaging both the personal exemption amount and the standard deduction amounts were raised thus reducing th number of taxpayers who would find it advantageous to ite mize their income tax deductions further the act repealed the additional personal exemption amount for the elderly andor blind and in its place instituted an ex tra standard deduction amount for both elderly andor blind taxpayers th is additional standard deduc tion amount was combined with the increased standard deduc tion provided by the 1986 act5 as noted earlier both the standard deduction and additional standard deduction amounts for elderly andor blind taxpayers are indexed for inflation higher income taxpayers are more likely to itemize their deductions than lower and moderate income taxpayers who are more likely to use the standard deduction thus personal exemption has greater value for higher income taxpayers than an additional standard deduction amount all taxpayers can use personal exemption whereas an additional standard duction can be used only by those who forgo itemizing deductions6 in the 1986 tax act congress was attempting to target tax benefits to lower and moderate income elderly and blind taxpayers by substituting an additional standard deduction amount for the add itional personal exemption amounts permitted those groups under prior law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20342crs4 7 note that benefits under medicare are not taxed 8 see us department of

o032004povnew01_100_01htm visited january 19 2005assessment it may be that the elderly have been singled out for special tax treatment because americans can relate to and are related to the aged tax benefits are frequently available to taxpayers parents and gra ndparents and are viewed as one method of enabling relatives to remain independent further younger taxpayers may see this tax benefit as one that they will enjoy in future years thus to the extent that the current benefits will be availa ble to them they are likely to be supportive of such tax advantages to the extent that benefits remain the same over generations any advantages to those now elderly compared with those who are young now but who will be derly later are small as noted earlier advocates for the elderly justify special tax treatment based on need they argue that the elderly face increased living costs primarily due to inflation for example the elderly are frequently faced with increased medical costs that have risen faster than prices on many goods and services7 while facing these increasing costs the elderly often have agerelated physical attributes that give rise to diminished ability to work nevertheless the premise underlying th original rationale for the provision longer holds true the argument was that the elderly were faced with inflation while their incomes were held flat since 1975 social s ecurity benefits are adjusted annually for cost inflation further to protect the elderly from high medical costs the federal government has established the medicare program thus while it is still true that many elderly individuals have low incomes it is l onger true that the elderly have the highest rate of poverty indeed more children are found to live in poverty than the aged8 because the provision is not precisely targeted at need these changing characteristics ofthe elderly mean that many who are not poor receive the benefit although not all who qualify fo r the benefit are needy it is true that not all the elderly who are needy can claim the benefit of the additional sta ndard deduction since lowincome elderly individuals who would ready be exempt from tax without the tax incentive receive benefit thus while these individuals are the most in need of financial assistance they r eceive benefit from the tax c oncession additionally the provision does not benefit thos elderly taxpayers who itemiz deductions such as those with large medical expenditures in relation to income moreover the value of the additional standard deduc tion amount is of greater benefit to higher rather than lower income taxpayers in those cases where the taxpayer does not itemize another targeting issue is presented by those who are not derly themselves but provide care for older persons as previ ously mentioned taxpayer who supports an elderly dependent may not cl aim the additional standard deduction amount many believe that taxpayer who must incur additional ex penses for an elderly dependent has as much justification to claim the additional sta ndard deduction amount as that dependent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20342crs5 9 vertical equity is the relative tax burden borne by individuals at different income levels vertical equity requires that taxpayers with larg incomes pay more in taxes than taxpayers with smaller income 10 see us department of commerce joint project between the bureau of labor statistics and the bureau of the census current population survey annual demographic survey march supplement httpferretblscensusgovmacro 032004perincnew04_001htm visited january 19 2005as noted previously the tax benefit is curre ntly more accurately targeted at need than before the tra86 changed the extra personal exemption to an extra standard deduction amount lowincome taxpayers most frequen tly use the standard deduction while higher income taxpayers are more likely than lowincome individuals to itemize deductions this is because higher income taxpayers are more likely to own their homes and therefore claim mortgage interest and property ta x deductions additionally higher income taxpayers may also owe state income taxes that are deductible in determining federal taxable income conversely it is true that ma ny of our elderly have paid for their homes and thus longer have mortga ge interest deductions however in general it remains true that as an additional standard deducti on amount this tax benefit for the elderly is more likely to go to lower or moderate income elderly taxpayers than would an itemized deduction unfortunately statis tics are not available that parate those who claim that the age deduction versus those who claim that the blindness additiona l standard deduction amount presumably most qualify based on age but there are precise data even if the tax provision were more preci sely targeted and it was only available to the needy it could still be criticized on quity grounds it discriminates against other needy taxpayers one notion of fairness is that the tax system should be based on ones abilitytopay and that ability is based upon the income of taxpayers not age9 thus the provision of an extra standard deduction amount for age violates the principle of horizontal equity since people with equal incomes will not pay equal taxes if one is young and the other elderly further the original rationale for the provision as cited earlier in this report noted that the elderl were handicapped in an economic if not in physical sense thus as but one exampl other taxpayers with disabling conditions may be in as much need of tax relief for just as the elderly are faced with diminished earning capabilities so too are many disabled persons due to their individual impairments further like many elderly many di sabled taxpayers have low incomes congress may review alternatives that w ould improve the targeting of the provision the availability of this provi sion was founded on the taxpayer having attained 65 years of age in the intervening years life ex pectancy has increased the social security program recognized this fact and provided that future retirees will r eceive full benefits but only at higher age levels one alternative would be to raise the eligibility age for example the census bureau reported that total money income of the elderly declines when those between the ages of 65 to 74 years old are compared with those 75 years and over10 thus to return the program to its original rationale need and the inability to compete financially with taxpayers still work ing age could be correlated to the poverty level to determine more advanced age at which to provide this tax benefit options for changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20342crs6 11 us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20072011 jcs307 washington gpo 2007 p 35as previously noted the value of the add itional amount is greater for higher rather than lower income taxpayers if congress wanted the provision more focused to benefit lower income elderly then it could be converted to tax credit with phaseout range for example the dependent care tax credit amount decreases as income rises the credit might be made unava ilable to higher income taxpayers such as is done in the case of the tax credit for the elderly and permanently and totally disabled anot her alternative would be to investigate change from taxbased program to grant program under grant program the revenue costs ar known and benefits precisely targeted with conclusive rules and regulations it may be noted however that grant results in taxable income to the recipient unless specifically excluded by statute demographic trends are such that with the nation aging it may be that this tax expenditure could grow in size the joint committee on taxation estimated that the revenue cost over the five fiscal years of 20072011 at 89 billion for those who use the additional standard ductions available to the elderly and blind11
