egtrra pl 10716 hr 1836 this report summarizes the provisions of the bill analyzes effects and considers the development of the legislation to comply with senate proce dural rules the act included sunset provision that rescinds its tax cuts at the end of calendar year 2010 during 2002 the house but not the nate passed several bills making all or some of egtrras tax cuts permanent there are indications that congress will return to this issue in 2003 in early 2001 tax cuts were principal fo cus of policymakers in february president bush sent congress the outlines of proposal to cut taxes by an estimated 16 trillion over 10 years the proposal is ba sed on plan the president set forth during the 2000 presidential campaign the prin cipal elements of th plan were cut in marginal individual inco tax rates tax cut fo r many married couples an increased child credit elimination of the estate and gift tax permanent research and experimentation tax credit charitable c ontribution deduction for nonitemizers and several tax benefits for health care and education in march tax cuts similar to the presid ents proposal began moving through the house of representatives on march 8 th house approved hr 3 containing cut in marginal tax rates on march 29 the h ouse approved hr 6 containing tax cuts for married couples and an increase in the child credit and on april 4 the house approved hr 8 which would phase out the estate and gift tax on may 2 the house approved hr 10 containing tax reductions related to pensions and retirement on may 15 the senate fi nance committee approved an omnibus bill including elements of all of these proposals plus education tax be nefits the bill was reported as an amended version of hr 1836 the economic grow th and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 that was passed by the house on may 16 the bill was approved by the senate with further amendments on may 23 the principal differences between the h ouse senate and ad

effective dates in the senate bill that were generally somewhat later than those in the presidents propos and the house bills pension provisions in the house and senate plans but not in th presidents and health provisions in the presidents plan but generally not in the house or senate proposals on may 26 the house and senate bot h approved conference version of egtrra the bills reduction in marginal individual income tax rates is smaller than proposed by the house or the presiden t and larger than proposed by the senate but is closer to the senate bill than the other proposals bey ond

in june 2001 this report summarizes the provisions of the bill analyzes effects and considers the development of the legislation the broad shape of the presidents plan and the tax cuts passed by the house senate and conference committee are perhaps more marked by their similarities than their differences the centerpiece of each plan is cut in the statutory marginal tax rates that apply to indi viduals taxable incomes alt hough the precise details vary among the proposals beyond the rate cuts each phases out the estate tax expands the child tax credit and provides tax cuts for twoearner married couples the details of the plans however are far from identical as the sidebyside chart that follows makes apparent some of the major differences are larger marginal individual taxrate cut in the presidents and housepassed plans than in the senate bill in this respect the conference bill follows the senate more closely than the other two plans retroactive component in the house senate and conference bills that is designed to provide nearterm economic stimulus retention of the gift tax in the senate and conference bills but not the presidents plan or housepassed measure pension provisions in the house sena and conference plans but not the presidents health provisions in the presidents plan but not the house senate or conference proposals edu cation provisions in the conference senate and presidents plans but not the house and extension of expiring tax provisions in the presidents plan but with some exceptions not the house senate or conference bills effective dates phasein and suns et provisions that differ among the plans the tax cuts in the conference committee bill are scheduled to expire sunset at the end of calendar year 2010 this provision was included to ensure the bills compliance with the byrd rule applying to congressional consideration of budget legislation during 2002 the h ouse but not the senate passed number of bills that would rescind egtrras sunset provisions and make its tax cuts permanent there are indications that congress will take up the issue of egtrras permanence again in 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30973crs2 revenue effects the relative size of the respective tax cuts is difficult to gauge for several reasons first revenue estimates for the tax cuts that passed the house that are consistent with the senate and conference bills and the presidents proposal are not available the house tax cuts were passed in several different bills and revenue estimates were calculated for each bill separately without taking into account the impact of the other housepassed measures because the costs of the different tax cuts interact the estimates for the different house bills cannot be simply added and compared with the presidents plan or th senate bill the estimates for which do take into account interacting effects another difficulty is posed by phase ins that is each proposal contains numerous provisions that become fully eff ective only over number of years thus the total 10year revenue loss estimates for the proposals differ depending on how rapidly the particular plans provisions are phased in to illustrate the presidents plan is estimated to reduce revenue by 17753 billion over 10 years 18 trillion after rounding while the senate bills reve nue loss is estimated at 13472 billion 13 trillion in part the larger size of the presidents proposal is result of its more rapid phasein of important elements such as its rate cuts and estate and gift tax repeal an added issue in gauging the size of the conference bills tax cut is its scheduled expiration at the end of cale ndar year 2010 because of the sunset provision the 13 trillion revenue loss timated for the period fy2001 through fy2011 is smaller than it would be if th tax cuts did not expire fy2011 includes part of calendar year 2011 when the tax cuts are scheduled to longer apply the expiration provision together with the phase in of important provisions also hampers getting an idea of the longrun annual impact of the bill one important provision of the bill repeal of the estate tax is not fully effective until calendar year 2010 and due to lags in filing will not be fully reflected in revenue reductions until fy2011 solution to this might be to rely on the revenue estimate for fy2011 at the same time however reve nue estimates for fy2011 reflect the impact of the bills general sunset provisions and are therefore smaller than will likely result from the annual impact of permanent changes in the tax code the sidebyside comparison in this report presents the joint tax committees revenue estima tes after each item for fy2010 and the fy2001fy2011 total how large are the tax cuts compared to the economy the dollar value of economic variables 10 years in the future is extremely uncertain as are the actual revenue reductions that will occur from th tax cuts however based on economic projections by the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxations revenue estimates the estimated revenue loss from the conference committee bill is 13 of gross domestic product gdp or 63 of the revenue collections otherwise expected to occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30973crs3 1for more information on these diffe rent measures see crs report rl30779 across the board tax cuts economic issues by jane g gravelledistributional effects this analysis compares the distribu tional effects of the proposals using estimates made by private group citizens for tax justice this is the only organization that has provi ded consistent estimates or provided the underlying information necessary to calculate the tax as percentage of income relative distribution measure and that also include s the impact of repealing the estate tax an important element of the proposals two types of distributional measures are shown one absolute indicating the total amount of dollars received by each income group and the other relative measuring the tax cut as percentage of income1 the absolute measure indicates that most of the tax cut is received by the highest income classes and that benefits in the presidents proposal an early ve rsion and the house proposal are more concentrated in the higher classes than is the senate proposal while the conference proposal falls in between this effect occurs primarily because of differences in the rate cuts which are largest at higher income levels in the presidents proposal and the house bills and smallest in the senate proposal the tax cut as percentage of income the relative measure provides information about the effect on progressivity ideally the percentage change in after tax income should be used to show th degree to which changes in taxes make incomes more or less even using taxes as percentage of pretax income reduces the percentage change at higher income levels but nevertheless provides reasonable depiction of the distributional effects while the tax cut is relatively even handed in the middle income classes the highest income individuals would receive much larger tax cuts relative to income this effect is in part due to the estate and gift tax repeal about half of the tax cut for the top 1 comes from the estate tax repeal without that tax cut the percentage change in taxes as percent of income would be 279 for the presidents and house plan 179 for the senate plan and 257 for the conference plans all four measures ther efore increase differentials in aftertax income the average tax cut as percent of income shown in the totals row for the last four columns indicates that in the l ong run the conference plan is the largest with an average cut of 243 of income note that some measures of distribution compare the percentage change in tax liability these measures do not however provide information about progressivity for two reasons first percentage changes in tax liability can be very large if initial tax liability is small and they will differ substantially depending on what is chosen as the base eg income taxe s or all federal taxes proportional cut in an already progressive tax will reduce progressivity in the sense that incomes are distributed less equally for cut in progressive tax to be distributionally neutral cuts must be smaller at the top than at the bottom but the extent of that difference depends on existing progressivityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30973crs4 note also that while the tax cuts at the top arise mostly from rate cuts or reductions in estate taxes which benefit all taxpayers in those groups most of the middle class tax cut is directed towards particular groups familie s with children and married couples citizens for tax justice finds for example that in the presidents plan the average tax cut is 500 but the average tax cut for families with children is 1114 the average tax cut for single pa rents is 326 and the average tax cut for singles is 283 some of these differences reflect differences in average incomes however the vast majority of single i ndividuals with children will receive more than 300 the new 10 rate bracket because there is tax reduction in the 15 rate bracket and singles do not receive benefits focused on children or joint returns table 1 distributional effects of the presidents tax plan the house proposals hr 3 hr 6 hr 8 the senate proposal and
