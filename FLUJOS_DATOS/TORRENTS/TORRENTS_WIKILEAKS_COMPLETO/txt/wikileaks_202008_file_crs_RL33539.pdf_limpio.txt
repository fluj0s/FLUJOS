intelligence community in the 21st century congressional and executive branch initiatives have sought to improve coordination among the different agencies and to encourage better analysis in december 2004 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 was si gned providing for director of national intelligence dni with substantial authorities to manage the national intelligence effort the legislation also established separate director of the central intelligence agency making cooperation effective presents substantial leadership and managerial challenges the needs of intelligence consumersranging from the white house to cabinet agencies to military commandersmust all be met using the same systems and personnel intelligence collection systems are expensive and some critics suggest there have been elements of waste and unneeded duplication of effort while some intelligence targets have been neglected the dni has substantial statutory authorities to address these issues but the organizational relationships remain complex especially for defense department agencies members of congress will be seeking to observe the extent to which effective coordination is accomplished international terrorism major threat facing the united states in the 21 st century presents difficult analytical challenge techniques fo r acquiring and analyzing information on small groups of plotters differ significantly from those used to evaluate the military capabilities of other countries us intelligence efforts are complicated by unfilled requirements for foreign language expertise whether all terrorist surveillance efforts have been consistent with the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 fisa has been matter of controversy changes to fisa were enacted in legislation pl 110161 signed on july 10 2008 intelligence on iraqi weapons of mass destruction was inaccurate and members have criticized the performance of the intelligence community in regard to current conditions in iraq iran and other areas improved analysis while difficult to mandate remains key goal better human intelligence it is widely agreed is also essential intelligence support to military operations continues to be major responsibility of intelligence agencies the use of precision guided munitions depends on accurate realtime targeting data integrating intelligence data into military operations challenges traditional organizational relationships and requires innovative technological approaches counterterrorism requires the close coordination of intelligence and law enforcement agencies but there remain many institutional and procedural issues that complicate cooperation between the two sets of agencies this report will be updated as new information becomes

intelligence threats facing the united states in the new century in response congress approved significantly larger intelligence budgets and in december 2004 passed the most extensive reorganization of the intelligence community since the national security act of 1947 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereafter the intelligence reform act pl 108458 created director of national intelligence separate from the director of the central intelligence agency who heads the intelligence community serves as the principal intelligence adviser to the president and oversees and directs the acquisition of major collections systems as long urged by some outside observers one individual is now able to concentrate on the intelligence community as whole and possesses statutory authorities for establishing priorities for budgets for directing collection by the whole range of technical systems and human agents and for the preparation of communitywide analytical products pl 108458 was designed to address the findings of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission that there has been inadequate coordination of the national intelligence effort and that the intelligence community as thenorganized could not serve as an agile information gathering network in the struggle against international terrorists the commission released its report in late july 2004 and congress debated its recommendations through the following months key issue was the extent of the authorities of the dni especially with regard to budgeting for technical collection systems managed by defense department agencies in the end many of the recommendations of the 911 commission regarding intelligence organization were adopted after compromise provision was included that called for implementing the act in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory authorities of department heads on april 21 2005 the senate confirmed the nominations of john d negroponte who had served as ambassador to iraq as dni and lt general chael v hayden then director of the national security agency as deputy dni in may 2006 hayden became director of the cia on february 7 2007 retired navy vice admiral j michael mcconnell was confirmed by the senate as negropontes successor as dni

greatly complicate the intelligence effort the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr is one of the smaller components of the intelligence community but is widely recognized for the high quality of its analysis inr is strictly an analytical agency diplomatic reporting from embassies though highly useful to intelligence analysts is not considered an intelligence function nor is it budgeted as one the key intelligence functions of the fbi relate to counterterrorism and counterintelligence the former mission has grown enormously in importance since september 2001 many new analysts have been hired and the fbi has been reorganized in an attempt to ensure that intelligence functions are not subordinated to traditional law enforcement efforts most importantly law enforcement information is now expected to be forw arded to other intelligence agencies for use in allsource products the intelligence organizations of the four military services concentrate largely on concerns related to their specific missions their analytic products along with those of dia supplement the work of cia analysts and provide greater depth on key military and technical issues the homeland security act pl 107296 provided dhs responsibilities for fusing law enforcement and intelligence information relating to terrorist threats to the homeland the office of intelligence and analysis in dhs participates in the interagency counterterrorism efforts and along with the fbi has focused on ensuring that state and local law enforcement officials receive information on terrorist threats from nationallevel intelligence agencies the coast guard now part of dhs deals with information relating to maritime security and homeland defense the energy department analyz foreign nuclear weapons programs as well as nuclear nonproliferation and energysecurity issues it also has robust counterintelligence effort the treasury department collects and processes information that may affect us fiscal and monetary policies treasury also covers the terrorist financing issue

agencies responsible for specific intelligence collection systems known as disciplines three major intelligence disciplines or intssignals intelligence sigint imager intelligence imint and human intelligence humintprovide the most important informatio n for analysts and absorb the bulk of the intelligence budget sigint collection is the responsibility of nsa at fort meade maryland sigint operations are classified but there is little doubt that the need for intelligence on growing variety of nations and groups that are increasi ngly using sophisticated and rapidly changing encryption systems requires far different sigint effort than the one prevailing during the cold war since the late 1990s process of change in nsas culture and methods of operations has been initiated change required by the need to target terrorist groups and affected by the proliferation of communications technologies and inexpensive encryption systems observers credit the thendirector of nsa lt gen michael hayden who became director of the cia in may 2006 with launching longoverdue reorganization of the agency and adapting it to changed conditions part of his initiative has involved early retirements for some nsa personnel and greater reliance on outsourcing many functions previously done by career personnel some of the initiatives relating to acquisition did not however meet their objectives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33539g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156 g156g561 g561

profound changes imagery is collected in essentially three ways satellites manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles ua vs the satellite program that covered the soviet union and acquired highly accurate intelligence concerning submarines missiles bombers and other military targets is perhaps the greatest achievement of the us intelligence community serving as foundation for defense planning and strategic planning that led to the end of the cold war in todays environment there is greater number of collection targets than existed during the cold war and more satellites are required especially those that can be maneuvered to collect information about variety of targets at the same time the availability of highquality commercial satellite imagery and its widespread use by federal agencies has raised questions about the extent to which coverage from the private sector can meet the requirements of intelligence agencies high altitude ua vs such as the global hawk may also provide surveillance capabilities that overlap those of satellites the national imagery and mapping agency nima was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing and dissemination previously undertaken by number of separate agencies nima was renamed the national geospatialintelligence agency nga by the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108136 the goal of nga is according to the agency to use imagery and other geospatial information to describe assess and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth intelligence from human contacts humint is the oldest intelligence discipline and the one that is most often written about in the media the cia is the primary collector of humint but the defense department also has responsibilities filled by defense attachés at embassies around the world and by other agents working on behalf of theater commanders many observers have argued that inadequate humint has been systemic problem and contributed to the inability to gain prior knowledge of the 911 plots in part these criticisms reflect the changing nature of the international environment during the cold war targets of us humint collection were foreign government officials and military leaders intelligence agency officials working under cover as diplomats could approach potential contacts at receptions or in the context of routine embassy business today however the need is to seek information from clandestine terrorist groups or narcotics traffickers who do not appear at embassy social gatherings humint regarding such sources can be especially important as there may be little evidence of activities or intentions that can be gathered from imagery and their communications may be carefully limited contacts with individuals or groups who may have knowledge about terrorist plots present many challenges placing us intelligence officials in foreign countries under nonofficial cover noc in businesses or other private capacities is possible but it presents significant challenges to us agencies administrative mechanisms are vastly more complicated than they are for officials formally attached to an embassy special arrangements have to be made for pay allowances retirement and healthcare the responsibilities of operatives under nonofficial cover to the parent intelligence agency have to be reconciled with those to private employers and there is an unavoidable potential for many conflicts of interest or even corruption any involvement with terrorist groups or smugglers has potential for major embarrassment to the us government and of course physical da nger to those immediately involved responding to allegations that cia agents may have been involved too closely with narcotics smugglers and human rights violators in central america the thendirector of central intelligence dci john deutch established guidelines in 1995 which remain classified to govern the recruitment of informants with unsavory backgrounds although cia officials httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33539g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156 g156g561 g561

valuable information was disapproved there was widespread belief that the guidelines served to encourage risk averse atmosphere at time when information on terrorist plans from whatever source was urgently sought the fy2002 intelligence authorization act pl 107108 directed the dci to rescind and replace the guidelines and july 2002 press reports indicated that they had been replaced major constraint on humint collection is the availability of personnel trained in appropriate languages cold war efforts required supply of linguists in relatively finite set of foreign languages but the intelligence community now needs experts in wider range of more obscure languages and dialects various approaches have been considered use of civilian contract personnel military reservists with language qualifications and substantial bonuses for agency personnel who maintain their proficiency the national security education program established in 1991 provides scholarships and career training for individuals in or planning to enter careers in agencies dealing with national security issues 1 g17g157g145g142g155g561g515g11g16g22g156g516g561 fourth int measurement and signatures analysis masint has received greater emphasis in recent years highly technical discipline masint involves the application of complicated analytical refinements to information collected by sigint and imint sensors it also includes spectral imaging by which the identities and characteristics of objects can be identified on the basis of their reflection and absorption of light masint is undertaken by dia and other dod agencies key problem has been retaining personn with expertise in masint systems who are offered more remunerative positions in private industry another category of information open source information osint newspapers periodicals pamphlets books radio television and internet websitesis increasingly important given requirements for information about many regions and topics instead of the former concentration on political and military issues affecting few countries at the same time requirements for translation dissemination and systematic analysis have increased given the multitude of different areas and the volume of materials many observers believe that intelligence agencies should be more aggressive in using osint some believe that the availability of osint may even reduce the need for certain collection efforts the availability of osint also raises questions regarding the need for intelligence agencies to undertake collection analysis and dissemination of information that could be directly obtained by user agencies section 1052 of the intelligence reform act expressed the sense of congress that there should be an open source intelligence center to coordinate the collection analysis production and dissemination of open source intelligence to other intelligence agencies an open source center was subsequently established and annual conferences are held to acquaint the public with the intelligence communitys osint efforts g11g151g157g142g144g155g138g157g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g515g11g16g22g156g516g561 the ints have been the pillars of the intelligence communitys organizational structure but analysis of threats requires that data from all the ints be brought together and that analysts have ready access to all sources of data on timely basis this has proved in the past to be substantial 1 see crs report rl32557 requirements for linguists in government agencies by jeffrey j kuenzi

data and the need to maintain the security of information acquired from highly sensitive sources some argue that intelligence officials have tended to err on the side of maintaining the security of information even at the cost of not sharing essential data with those having need to know section 1015 of the intelligence reform act mandated the establishment of an intelligence sharing environment ise to facilitate terrorismrelated information related problem has been barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement information these barriers derived from the different uses of information collected by the two sets of agenciesforeign intelligence used for policymaking and military operations and law enforcement information to be used in judicial proceedings in the united states large part of the statutory basis for the wall between law enforcement and intelligence information was removed with passage of the usa pa triot act of 2001 pl 10756 which made it possible to share law enforcement information with analysts in intelligence agencies but longestablished practices have not been completely overcome the homeland security act pl 107296 and the subsequent creation of the terrorist threat integration center ttic established offices charged with combining information from both types of so urces section 1021 of the intelligence reform act made the new national counterterroris m center nctc operating under the dni specifically responsible for analyzing and inte grating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the united states government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism except purely domestic terrorism g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 for budgetary purposes intelligence spending is divided between the national intelligence program nip formerly the national foreign intelligence program or nfip and the military intelligence program mip the mip was established in september 2005 and includes all programs from the former joint military intelligence program which encompassed dodwide intelligence programs and most programs from the former tactical intelligence and related activities tiara category which encompassed intelligence programs supporting the operating units of the armed services the program executive for the mip is the under secretary of defense for intelligence only small part of the intelligence budget is made public the bulk of the 47 billion in national intelligence spending is hidden within the dod budget spending for most intelligence programs is described in classified annexes to intelligence and national defense authorization and appropriations legislation members of congress have access to these annexes but must make special arrangements to read them for number of years some members sought to make public total amounts of intelligence and intelligencerelated spending floor amendments for that purpose were defeated in both chambers during the 105 th congress in response however to lawsuit filed under the freedom of information act dci george tenet stated on october 15 1997 that the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities for fy1997 was 266 billion he added that the administration would continue to protect from disclosure any and all subsidiary information concerning the intelligence budget in march 1998 dci tenet announced that the fy1998 figure was 267 billion figures for fy1999 and subsequent years were not been released during consideration of intelligence reform legislation in 2004 the senate at one point approved version of bill which would require publication of the amount of the nip the house version did not include similar provision and with the senate deferring to the house the intelligence reform act did not require making intelligence spending amounts public section 601 of pl 11053 implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33539g11g151g157g142g149g149g146g144g142g151g140g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156

aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the nip although after fy2008 the president could waive or postpone the disclosure upon sending explanation to congressional oversight committees consistent with that act the dni announced in october 2008 that the aggregate amount appropriated to the national intelligence program for fy2008 was 475 billion jurisdiction over intelligence programs is somewhat different in the house and the senate the senate intelligence committee has jurisdiction only over the nip but not the mip whereas the house intelligence committee has jurisdiction over both sets of programs the preponderance of intelligence spending is accomplished by intelligence agencies within dod and thus in both chambers the armed services committees are involved in the oversight process other oversight committees are responsible for intelligence agencies that are part of departments over which they have jurisdiction most appropriations for intelligence activities are included in national defense appropriations acts including funds for the cia dia nsa the nro and nga other appropriations measures include funds for the intelligence offices of the state department the fbi and dhs in the past defense appropriations subcommittees have funded the intelligence activities of cia and the dod agencies although funds for cia have been in cluded in defense appropriations acts these monies are transferred directly the senate voted in october 2004 to establish an appropriations subcommittee on intelligence but this did not occur nor did the house take similar action on january 9 2007 however the house approved hres 35 which established select panel within the appropriations committee that includes three mbers of the intelligence committee to review intelligence activities to support the work of the appropriations committee intelligence budgeting issues were at the center of the debate on intelligence reform legislation in 2004 on one hand there was determination to make the new dni responsible for developing and determining the annual national intelligence program budget which is separate from the mip budgets that are prepared by the office of the secretary of defense the goal was to ensure unity of effort that arguably has not previously existed and that may have complicated efforts to monitor terrorist activities on the other hand the intelligence efforts within the national intelligence program include those of major components of the defense department including nsa the nro and nga that are closely related to other military activities some members thus argued that even the national intelligence program should not be considered apart from the defense budget after considerable debate the final version of pl 108458 provides broad budgetary authorities to the dni but in section 1018 requires the president to issue guidelines to ensure that the dni exercises the authorities provided by the statute in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory responsibilities of the heads of of the office of management and budget and cabinet departments observers expect that implementing the complex and seemingly overlapping budgetary provisions of the intelligence reform act will depend on effective working relationships between the office of the dni dod and the president

eleanor hill the inquiry staff director summarized the inquirys findings the intelligence community did have general indications of possible terrorist attack against the united states or us interests overseas in the spring and summer of 2001 and promulgated strategic warnings however it does not appear that the intelligence community had information prior to september 11 that identified precisely where when and how the attacks were to be carried out the two intelligence committees published the findings and conclusions of the joint inquiry on december 11 2002 2 the committees found that the intelligence community had received beginning in 1998 and continuing into the summer of 2001 modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence reporting that indicated the possibility of terrorist attacks within the united states further findings dealt with specific terrorists about whom some information had come to the attention of us officials prior to september 11 and with reports about possible employment of civilian airliners to crash into major buildings the inquiry also made systemic findings highlighting the intelligence communitys lack of preparedness to deal with the challenges of global terrorism inefficiencies in budgetary planni ng the lack of adequate numbers of linguists lack of human sources and an unwillingness to share information among agencies separately the two intelligence committees submitted recommendations for strengthening intelligence capabilities they urged the creation of cabinetlevel position of director of national intelligence dni separate from the position of director of the cia the dni would have greater budgetary and managerial authority over intelligence agencies in the defense department than possessed by the dci the committees also expressed great concern with the reorientation of the fbi to counterterrorism and suggested consideration of the creation of new domestic surveillance agency similar to britains mi5 the joint inquiry was focused directly on the performance of intelligence agencies but there was widespread support among members for more extensive review of the roles of other agencies provisions for establishing an independent commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks were included in the fy2003 intelligence authorization act pl 107306 former new jersey governor thomas h kean was named to serve as chairman with former representative lee h hamilton serving as vice chairman widely publicized hearings were held in spring 2004 with administration and outside witnesses providing different perspectives on the role of intelligence agencies prior to the september 11 2001 attacks the commissions report was published in july 2004 although the 911 commission surveyed the roles of number of federal and local agencies many of its principal recommendations concerned the perceived lack of authorities of the dci the commission recommended establishing national intelligence director nid to manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the nid would annually submit national intelligence program budget and when necessary forward the names of nominees to be heads of major intelligence agencies to the president lead responsibility for conducting and executing paramilitary operations would be assigned to dod and not cia the commission also

has posed major challenges to intelligence agencies largely designed to gather information about nation states and their armed forces sophisticated terrorist groups in some cases relay information only via agents in order to avoid having their communications intercepted human collection has been widely perceived as inadequate especially in regard to terrorism the intelligence reform act stated

to the failure to provide advance warning of the 911 attacks and flawed estimate of iraqi weapons of mass destruction as reflecting systemic problems congressional intelligence committees have for some time noted weaknesses in analysis and lack of language skills and predominant focus on current intelligence at the expense of strategic analysis analytical shortcomings are not readily addressed

especially in such fields as counterterrorism and counterproliferation improving analysis depends among other things upon the ta lents of analysts brought into government service encouraging their contributions and calculated risktakings and willingness to tolerate the tentative nature of analytical judgments these factors are sometimes difficult to achieve in government organizations another significant impediment to comprehensive analysis has been shortage of trained linguists especially in languages of current interest as noted above the national security education program and related efforts are designed to meet this need but most observers believe the need for linguists will remain pressing concern for some years an enduring concern is the existence of stovepipes agencies that obtain highly sensitive information are reluctant to share it throughout the intelligence community out of determination to protect their sources in addition information not available to analysts with relevant responsibilities is many times wasted in recent years there have been calls for greater sharing in order to improve the quality of analys is but it is expected that dealing with this complex

its performance in regard to iraq the baath regime in bagdad undeniably presented major challenges it was almost impossible to penetrate the inner reaches of saddam husseins government us intelligence agencies supported the efforts of inspectors charged with determining iraqi compliance with resolutions requiring iraq to end any programs for the acquisition or deployment of weapons of mass destruction but such efforts were frustrated by the iraqi government at congresss request national intelligence estimate nie dealing with iraqi weapons of mass destruction wmd was prepared in september 2002 shortly before crucial votes on the iraqi situation the nie has been widely criticized for inaccurately claiming the existence of actual wmds and exaggerating the extent of iraqi wmd programs the senate intelligence committee concluded that the nies major key judgments eith er overstated or were not supported by the underlying intelligence reporting the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction severely criticized analysts who misinterpreted the limited intelligence about iraqi wmds that was available and failed to alert policymakers to the uncertainties in both evidence and analysis other observers note however that the intelligence community based its conclusions in significant part on iraqs previous use of wmd its ongoing wmd research programs and its unwillingness to document the destruction of wmd stocks in accordance with resolutions these factors which have never been disputed served as

intelligence community to collect analyze and disseminate intelligence regarding wmd and related 21 st century threats it addition the commission was asked to look specifically at intelligence regarding iraqi wmd prior to operation iraqi freedom and to compare prewar assessments with the findings of the iraq survey group the commission issued its report on march 31 20058 the report described in detail number of analytical errors that resulted in faulty prewar judgments on iraqs weapons of mass destruction the commission recommended that the dni take steps to forge an integrated intelligence community that intelligence functions within the fbi be combined into single national security service and urged that the dni not focus on the preparation of the presidents daily brief at the expense of the longterm needs of the intelligence community despite the inadequate intelligence on iraqi wmd programs the success of the military attack on the iraqi regime launched in march 2003 by the united states the uk and other countries was greatly assisted by intelligence the extensive use of precisionguided munitions that targeted key iraqi military and command facilities and limited civilian casualties was made possible by the realtime availability of precise locating data observers have noted that operational shortcomings in transmitting intelligence data that were frequent during the 1991 persian gulf war were not observed in the iraq campaign of 2003 as the security situation in iraq continues to be matter of grave concern intelligence collection and analytical capabilities have been severely criticized in december 2006 the iraq study group concluded that the defense department and the intelligence community have not invested sufficient people and resources to understand the political and military threat to american men and women in the armed forces the group further maintained that intelligence agencies are not doing enough to map the insurgency dissect it and understand it on national and provincial level the analytic communitys knowledge of the organization leadership financing and operations of militias as well as their relationship to government

especially dependent upon humint technical systems are good at providing information about numbers of airplanes ships and tanks but the most important information on small groups of terrorist plotters often is provided by humint sources furthermore the type of humint required for counterterrorism depends on contacts with sources far removed from embassy gatherings and requires expertise in languages that are possessed by few in this country this is distinct difference from humint collection during the cold war when soviet diplomats and military officers were often the principal targets

the legislation is expected to continue to have major influence on the intelligence community the dni has authority to task intelligence collection and analysis and manage national intelligence centers including the national counterterrorism center which encompassed ttic and the national counter proliferation center and potentially additional centers the dni will have enhanced budgetary and

intelligence agencies in the dod remain in their existing chain of command and continue to be responsible for providing support to combat commands the expansion of intelligence efforts especially those related to counterterrorism has resulted in severe shortage of trained analysts especially those with excellent foreign language talents the problem is already acute in some agencies and the

electronic surveillance in early march 2006 agreement was reached with the leadership of the two intelligence committees to establish procedures for enhanced legislative oversight of the nsa effort

10 2007 the bush administration advised the chairman and ranking member of the senate judiciary committee that any electronic surveillance that had previously occurred as part of the terrorist surveillance program tsp would thereafter be conducted subject to the approval of the fisc further the administration indicated that it would not reauthorize the tsp after the expiration of the thencurrent authorization on may 1 2007 the senate intelligence committee held an open hearing on the administrations proposal to revise fisa to take account of changes in communications technologies since the 1970s with members expressing differing views on the desirability of the legislation 14 according to media reports judge on the fisc at some point in 2007 ruled that fisc order was required for surveillance of communications between foreign persons abroad if the communications passed through the united states on august 2 2007 the dni issued statement on fisa modernization in which he contended that the intelligence community should not be required to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas although details of the effort remain classified there appears to have been wide agreement among members that fisa needed to be amended to permit surveillance without court order of such foreign to foreign communications regardless of whether they were routed through the united states the protect america act paa pl 11055 signed on august 5 2007 after extensive congressional debate excluded from the definition of electronic surveillance under fisa surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states in addition under certain circumstances fisa as amended by this legislation permitted the dni and the attorney general for periods up to one year to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states apparently including us persons and to direct communications provider custodian or other person with access to the communication immediately to provide information facilities and assistance to accomplish the acquisition those receiving such directives had the right to contest them in court the dni and the ttorney general were required to certify in part that this acquisition did not constitute electronic surveillance and the attorney general was required to submit the procedures by which this determination is made to the fisc for review as to whether the government

the protect america act was strongly criticized by some members on november 15 2007 hr 3773 the restore act the responsible electronic surveillance that is overseen reviewed and effective act of 2007 was passed by the house to clarify that court order is not required for the acquisition of the contents of communica tions between two persons neither of whom is known to be us person and both of whom are reasonably believed to be located outside the united states regardless of whether the communications passed through the united states or if the surveillance device was in the united states if in the course of such an acquisition the communications of us person were incidentally intercepted stringent minimization procedures would apply court orders would how ever be required if the communications of nonus person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states were targeted where the other parties to the targets communications are unknown and thus might include us persons or persons located physically in the us some members argued that this provision would unnecessarily tie the hands of intelligence agencies and jeopardize the counterterrorism effort the restore act would have also provided for increased judicial oversight and would have required quarterly implementation and compliance audits by the inspector general of the justice department and added related congressional reporting requirements on october 26 2007 the senate intelligence committee reported its own version of fisa amendment the senate bill s 2248 as amended contained provisions authorizing the attorney general and the dni jointly to authorize targeting of persons other than us persons reasonably believed to be outside the us to acquire fore ign intelligence information for periods up to one year under the senate bill fisc approval would be required for targeting us person reasonably believed to be located outside the us to acquire foreign intelligence information if the acquisition constitutes electronic surveillance under fisa or the acquisition of stored electronic communications or stored electronic data that requires an order under fisa and the acquisition is conducted in the us the senate bill also provided some retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies from civil suits in fe deral and states courts related to assistance that they have provided to the government in connection with intelligence activities between september 11 2001 and january 17 2007 central issue was the role of the judicial branch and the fisc in particular in approving andor overseeing surveillance that does not target but may involve individuals who are us persons some argued that only the independent judiciary could ensure that intelligence efforts would not become improperly or illegally directed towards americans at the time fisa permitted electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligen ce information pursuant to fisc order of us persons where there was probable cause to believe they were foreign powers or agents of foreign powers if other statutory criteria were met some argued however that changes in technologies since fisa was enacted in 1978 made casebycase judicial review of each international communication link that might involve us person impractical and risky to national security 15 for further background see crs

senate approved s 2248 on february 12 2008 and incorporated it into hr 3773 on march 14 the house approved an amendment to the version of hr 3773 that had been approved by the senate the house amendment would have required judicial review by the fisc of procedures for targeting nonus person located outside of the us even if the person was not reasonably believed to be communicating with us person or person in the us the house amendment would require either prior fisc order approving the applicable certification targeting procedures and minimization procedures or determination that an emergency situation exists in which case certification would have to be filed with the fisc within seven days the bush administration argued that this requirement added unprecedented requirements for targeting communications of nonus persons that could result in delaying collection efforts and the loss of some intelligence forever if the target of an acquisition were us person reasonably believed to be outside the us then except in emergencies the housepassed amendment would have required fisc order approving an application for an acquisition for period up to 90 days the acquisition could have been renewed for additional 90 day periods upon submission of renewal applications if the attorney general authorized an emergency acquisition of such us persons communications the attorney general would have had to submit an application for court order within seven days of that authorization the house version of hr 3773 would also not have granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies but would have allowed them to present evidence in their defense to court in addition the house bill would have established commission on warrantless electronic surveillance activities conducted between september 11 2001 and january 17 2007 the house version of hr 3773 did not come to vote in the senate and after considerable discussions representative reyes introduced new bill hr

they had acted in response to request for support from the executive branch hr 6304 was passed by the house on june 20 2008 and by the senate on july 9 2008 it was signed by the president on july 10
