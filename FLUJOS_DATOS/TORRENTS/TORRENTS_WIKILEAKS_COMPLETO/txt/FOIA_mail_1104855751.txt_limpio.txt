found to be clean xueamailscannerspamscore s phil i would immediately delete anything you receive from this fraud youve probably seen now the paper by wahl and ammann which independently exposes mcintyre and mckitrick for what it ispure crap of course weve already done this on realclimate but wahl and ammann is peerreviewed and independent of us ive attached it in case you havent seen please dont pass it along to others yet it should be in press shortly meanwhile i would not respond to this guy as you know only bad things can come of that the last thing this guy cares about is honest debatehe is funded by the same people as singer michaels etc other than this distraction i hope youre enjoying the holidays too talk to you soon mike at 0902 am 12302004 you wrote mike fyi just in for an hour or so today as still off until jan 4 not replied to this too much else with ipcc etc not read this in detail just printed it off have good new years eve cheers phil from steve mcintyre

contact the isp for more information xueamailscanner found to be clean dear phil i have noticed the following statements in rutherford et 2004 in which you are coauthor as compared with some of your coauthors i get the impression that while you feel very strongly about your views you are also concerned with getting to the bottom of matters and are less concerned with scoring meaningless debating points in this spirit i draw your attention to some incorrect statements in rutherford et 2004 concerning our material there is really quite serious problem with the pc methods in mbh98 and the comments made in rutherford et 2004 are really quite misleading for the reasons set out below i request that these comments be removed from the manuscript regards steve mcintyre original message from 1steve mcintyre to 2david randall cc 3scott rutherford 4paul kushner 5cindy carrick 6ross mckitrick sent tuesday december 28 2004 148 pm subject rutherford et 2004 dear dr randall recently at the website 7wwwrealclimateorg michael mann publicized submission by rutherford et to journal of climate entitled proxybased northern hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions sensitivity to method predictor network target season and target domain this paper contains some untrue statements and mischaracterizations regarding criticisms we mcintyre and mckitrick made of mann et 1998 mbh98 in 2003 paper and subsequent exchanges under the auspices of nature we are writing to request that these untrue statements be removed from the paper before any further processing of the document by journal of climate takes place first rutherford et states that mcintyre and mckitrick 2003 used an incorrect version of the mann et 1998 proxy indicator dataset the history of this matter is summarized below all relevant emails and other documentation are available at 8httpwwwclimate2003comfileissueshtm in april 2003 we requested from mann the ftp location of the dataset used in mbh98 mann advised that he was unable to recall the location of this dataset and referred the request to rutherford rutherford eventually directed us to file pcproxytxt located at url at manns ftp site in using this data file we noticed numerous problems with it not least with the principal component series we sought specific confirmation from mann that this dataset was the one used in mbh98 mann said that he was too busy to respond to this or any other inquiry because of the many problems in this data set we undertook complete new recollation of the data using the list of data sources in the si to mbh98 and using original archived versions wherever possible after publication of mcintyre and mckitrick 2003 mann said that dataset at his ftp site to which we had been referred was an incorrect version of the data and that this version had been prepared especially for through blog he provided new url which he now claimed to contain the correct data set the file creation date of the incorrect version was in 2002 long prior to my first request for data clearly disproving his assertion that it was prepared in response to my request mann andor rutherford then deleted this incorrect version with its date evidence from his ftp site it is false and misleading for rutherford et to now allege that we used the wrong dataset we used the dataset they directed us to at their ftp site more importantly for our analysis to avoid the problems with the principal component series we recollated the tree ring data identified in mbh98 from itrdb archives calculated fresh principal component series in addition we recollated other proxy data from archived versions wherever possible thus our own calculations were not affected by the errors in the supplied file as we did not use the incorrect version in our calculations to suggest otherwise as is done in rutherford et 2004 is highly misleading to date source code or other evidence has been provided to fully demonstrate that the incorrect version now deleted did not infect some of manns and rutherfords other work in this respect we note that the now deleted file pcproxytxt occurs in legend in graphic at rutherfords website indicating possible use elsewhere by rutherford of the incorrect version accordingly we request that the above claim be removed from the manuscript secondly rutherford et 2004 argues that the difference between mbh98 results and mm03 results occurs because of our misunderstanding of stepwise procedure in mbh98 for the calculation of principal component series for tree ring networks again this claim is misleading on its face while our 2003 paper did not implement the then undisclosed stepwise procedure as soon as this matter was raised in subsequent correspondence in november 2003 we implemented it and we continued to observe the discrepancies in principal component series and final results the current manuscript ignores refereed exchange at nature in which we specifically clarified in response to reviewers question that we had obtained such results while using the exact stepwise procedure described in mbh98 mann is aware of this refereed exchange the reason for the difference between our results and mbh98 results is primarily due to the fact that the tree ring principal component series in mbh98 cannot be replicated using conventional principal components method the mbh98 principal component series can only be replicated by standardizing on short segment procedure nowhere mentioned in mbh98 and only recently acknowledged in the si to the corrigendum of mann et nature 2004 in response to our concerns on the subject expressed to nature in effect mbh98 did not use conventional centered pc calculation but used an uncentered pc calculation on decentered data the impact of this method is the subject of ongoing controversy which is wellknown to the authors but the existence of the method in mbh98 is longer in doubt in discussions of pc calculations in 2004 exchanged with the authors through nature we implemented the stepwise procedures of mbh98 referred to in the present manuscript and demonstrated that important differences remain even with stepwise procedures as long as the uncentered and decentered methods of mbh98 are used the differences in pc series resulting from using centered and uncentered series has been fully agreed to by all parties in the nature exchange although the parties continue to disagree on the ultimate effect on final nh temperature calculations accordingly the discussion in rutherford et 2004 is very incomplete and misleading in this respect while we recognize that mann et have argued that they can salvage mbh98type results using alternative methodologies eg increasing the number of pc series used in the 14001450 period these salvage efforts are themselves matter of controversy and do not validate the claims being put forward in the rutherford et paper accordingly we ask that this claim also be deleted from the manuscript regards stephen
