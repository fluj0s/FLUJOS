escalation in global energy demandexpected to rise by nearly 60 over the next 20 yearshave led us policymakers to engage in wide ranging debate over how best to address the countrys future energy requirements similarly energy security has become policy priority for the european union eu and its 27 member states the eu imports about 50 of its energy needs barring significant changes the european commission expects this figure to rise to 65 by 2030 about half of the eus natural gas imports and 30 of its imported oil come from russia europes growing dependence on russian energy and longterm energy agreements between russian firms and some european governments have fueled speculation that mosc ow is using the energy weapon to try to influence european foreign and economic policy the eu has traditionally exerted little if any influence over individual member state energy policy however in march 2007 in the face of increasing concern about europes reliance on russian energy and growing public pressure to address global climate change eu member states agreed to forge an energy policy for europe they have agreed on set of euwide targets some legally bindingto increase the use of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions however member states continue to pursue divergent external energy policies particularly toward russia and some european countries remain reluctant to cede national control over energy markets the united states and europe have steadily broadened the transatlantic energy dialogue to include joint promotion of collective energy security energy efficiency and alternative energy sources at the april 2007 useu summit leaders on both sides of the atlantic agreed to advance cooperation to develop alternative and renewable energy technologies however us officials have expressed concern at some european member states unwillingness to exert more pressure on russia to comply with eu market principles on the other hand european leaders appear increasingly frustrated with us reluctance to pursue binding multilateral regulatory frameworks to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency members of congress have expressed an interest in efforts to increase european energy security particularly visavis russia in the first session of the 110 th congress committees held hearings that touched on the issue of european energy dependence on russia and on european efforts to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use the second session of the 110th congress may also hold hearings and pursue legislation on various aspects of eu energy policy this report examines some of europes critical energy security challenges and eu efforts to coordinate common european energy strategy it also includes an overview of broader transatlantic energy security cooperation and will be updated as needed for additional information see crs report rl34261 russian energy policy toward neighboring countries by steven woehrel and crs

european unions eu 27 member states have ceded some national sovereignty or competency to eu institutions in variety of areas including economic and trade policy energy policy remains primarily the responsibility of the member states decisions regarding longterm oil or gas purchases the development and improvement of energyrelated infrastructure and the use of particular fuels continue to be made at the national level by individual member states at their march 2007 summit eu member states moved to boost european coordination to help secure and diversify energy supplies increase the development and use of renewable and alternative energy resources within the eu and reduce energy demand and consumption although member state governments remain reluctant to cede national sovereignty over energy security aspects of their foreign policies they have set binding euwide targets for the use of renewable energies and biofuels and have agreed to ambitious but nonbinding energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction targets for th year 2020 in addition member states are considering potentially significant reforms to further liberalize energy markets nonetheless most observers expect member states to continue to retain significant national control over national energy markets and external relations with energyproducing countries eu heads of state are set to discuss specific policy proposals in these areas at their spring 2008 summit europes renewed interest in energy security has been influenced by both internal and external factors internally steadily rising energy prices declining european energy production and fragmented internal energy market have contributed to anxieties over europes ability to meet future energy demand the strain on global demand exerted by the emerging economies of countries such as china and india persistent instability in energy producing regions the threat of terrorist strikes against energy infrastructure and russias apparent willingness to use its energy power for political ends are all raising concerns in europe over how to address external influences that could affect future energy requirements 2 recent calls for euwide energy coordination have been driven by rising european concern about the effects of energy production and consumption on global climate change to this end eu member states recent energy policy decisions center largely on promoting energy effi ciency developing renewable energy and clean fuel sources and reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions as uncertainties surrounding global energy supply and demand persist issues pertaining to us european and global energy security are may gain importance in the second session of the 110th congress members of both parties have introduced legislation aimed at increasing energy independence and energy security and reducing carbon emissions several of these proposals envision carbon trading schemes similar to those in use in europe 3 in several hearings during the first session of the 110th congress members of congress voiced concern about europes dependence on russian energy resources and the potential for russian manipulation of european energy markets to this end senator richard lugar has raised the possibility of more proactive role for nato in guaranteeing energy security for alliance members 1 this report was conceived

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 collectively eu member states import half of their energy needs barring significant policy changes this figure is expected to rise to 65 by 20304 today oil natural gas and coal account for 80 of the energy consumed in the eu europes energy imports come primarily from ru ssia and the middle east where approximately 70 of global oil and gas supplies originate yet the middle east region is fraught with war terrorism and politically unstable regimes iraqs oil production has not reached prewar levels and there is fear that terrorist groups could target pipelines and production facilities throughout the region iran has threatened to cut back oil production if forced to abandon its nuclear power program with regard to russia recent political and economic behavior exhibited by moscow has raised the dual specter of reliability and energy politics high demand has also raised questions regarding the future availability of global oil and gas reserves although significant shortages are not projected for the next several decades uncertainties over future exploration and production in areas such as russia and the middle east have also raised concerns about longterm supply availability the international energy agency iea estimates that close to 16 trillion in new investments may be needed over the next 30 years to meet future global energy demand 5 european concern regarding the security of its energy supply was first prompted by the arab oil embargo of the early 1970s specifically the embargo highlighted three main issues first it exposed need for increased energy policy collaboration among european countries and between europe and the energy producing world second it became clear that institutional mechanisms for increased coordination in the event of future supply disruptions were essential third consensus emerged that europe should prepare strategies to prevent it from becoming the victim of future attempts by exporting nations to use energy as political or economic weapon 6 the 1974 creation of the international energy agency iea which has become europes primary instrument for monitoring and analyzing world energy markets was one response to the embargo in addition european countries sought to develop strategies to diversify energy supply after the embargo european countries began to identify russia and other eurasian countries as potential energy suppliers at the time soviet russia was beginning to realize its energy producing potential but required major investments in its energy sector the prospect of future cooperation in the energy field began to play key role in european perspectives on developing relations with the soviet union 4 see energy overview council of the european

initiative intended to promote energy cooperation and diversify europes energy supply7 the declaration gave way to the 1994 energy charter treaty that entered into legal force in 1998 and established framework of rules and agreements to promote international energy cooperation to date 51 countries and the eu have signed or acceded to the treaty8 the treaty seeks to create level playing field of rules regarding the promotion of foreign energy investments free trade in energy materials products and equipment freedom of energy transit through pipelines and grids promoting energy efficiency and providing mechanisms for addressing disputes 9 since the signing of the energy charter treaty the european commission has used its existing competency in competition and environment and consumer protection policy to attempt to shape european energy policy in variety of ways10 these include promoting an internal gas and electricity market encouraging the developm ent of alternative energy supplies and in cooperation with the office of the high representative for common foreign and security policy pursuing more cooperative approach to external relations with current and future energy suppliers g22g158g155g151g146g151g144g561g18g152g146g151g157g561 2005 germanrussian gas pipeline agreement and more recent russian manipulation of gas and oil flows to the european market have sparked newfound sense of urgency among european leaders regarding the need for more coordinated strategy these events correspond with growing concern among the european public and political classes regarding the link between energy production and consumption and global climate change in 2005 germany and russia agreed to build gas pipeline connecting the countries under the baltic sea the socalled north european gas pipeline negp while germany maintains that the pipeline will significantly enhance german and therefore european energy supply and security number of eu member states including poland and lithuania have protested the decision they counter that by running the pipeline under sea so it bypasses both countries and that by failing to coordinate with eu neighbor s when negotiating with russia germanys actions pose threat to their and broader european energy security 11 furthermore prominent swedish officials have voiced concerns that the pipeline will provide russia with platform to increase both military surveillance and its military presence in the strategically important baltic sea12 the germanrussian agreement and subsequent responses from poland lithuania and more recently sweden have reignited calls for more coordinated european energy strategy 7 for more detailed information on the treaty see an introduction to the energy charter treaty the energy charter organization at httpwwwencharterorg 8 although the united states signed the 1991 energy charter declaration it has not signed the energy charter treaty so it retains the status of observer to the charter process

between russia and ukraine and russia and belarus have exposed some undesirable consequences of european dependence on russian energy resources in late december 2005 russias gas monopoly gazprom temporarily suspended gas flows to uk raine as part of dispute over gas price increases within hours of the shut off several european countries including austria italy poland and germany reported drops in their own pipeline pressure by as much as 3013 the gas crisis lasted only few days and after russia and ukraine reached an agreement on gas prices gas was flowing again an almost identical dispute between russia and belarus with similar consequences for european countries particularly germany occurred in early january 2007 this time russian oil pipeline operator transneft shut down the druzhba oil pipeline through which germany receives 20 of its oil imports germany and the eu sharply rebuked russias decision and russia resumed oil delivery after three days of price negotiations with belarus many european observers have characterized the russiaukraine and russiabelarus gas and oil crises as wake up calls exposing europes energy security vulnerability even to unintended supply disruptions more importantly however the crises raised the dual questions of russias reliability as an energy partner and moscows willingness to use its energy power as political weapon in response european leaders have advocated coordinating decisions on energy supply so as to present unified front to producer nations like russia and have promoted energy efficiency and more efficient energy use despite these calls some european countries and energy companies have continued to pursue longterm energy deals bilaterally in the past year companies from italy austria bulgaria and serbia have signed contracts with russian energy companies which some observers contend could pose threat to collective european energy security

growing public calls for euwide action on climate change european leaders have responded by renewing efforts to establish more cohesive european energy policy during their march 2007 summit eu heads of state adopted series of european co mmission proposals that they expect will form the foundation of an energy policy for europe the adopted measures are among larger group of recommendations the commission laid out in march 2006 green paper and more detailed action plans unveiled in january 2007 and 2008 18 the commission proposals focus on three broad interconnected goals increasing european wide energy security enhancing sustainability and fostering competition in europes internal energy market commission officials place particular emphasis on the links between energy security energy

cede national economic and foreign policy making authority the eus proposed energy policy focuses largely on enhancing sustainability member states have committed in principle to take some steps toward further liberalizing the eu wide energy market and have broadly endorsed increased foreign policy coordination on securing energy supplies however the eus most farreaching commitments focus on increasing energy efficiency decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy and alternative fuels and associated technologies specifically eu member states have committed to reducing total euwide carbon emissions by 20 compared with 1990 levels by 2020 they have also pledged to seek international agreement on 30 reduction target by 2020 in postkyoto protocol international carbon emissions reduction treaty 19 in addition the eu seeks 20 increase in europewide energy efficiency by 2020 and has mandated that 20 of all eu energy consumption come from renewable sources and 10 of transport fuel from biofuels by 2020 the commission hopes that eu heads of state will agree on proposed countryspecific targets to achieve their goals during the spring of 2008 european commission president jose manuel barroso estimates that achieving these targets could cost or up to 877 billion or 05 of eu member states combined annual gdp however he has argued that this approximately 450 3 euros per week per european citizen represents far less than the cost of inaction20 according to march 2007 study by the global consulting firm mckinsey and company eu member

alternative technologies the mckinsey study suggests it may be more cost efficient for the eu to focus more of its efforts on reducing energy use than on developing and promoting alternative and renewable energy sources the russiaukraine and russiabelarus oil and gas crises have also ignited calls from the european commission and several eu member stat to increase foreign policy coordination to secure and diversify energy supply to this end eu member states have agreed to begin cooperating to form an external policy centered on expanding political partnerships with and increasing pipeline and energy infrastructure investment in producer and transit countries european states have specifically singled out central asia and the caspian and black sea areas as focal points for such activities in addition th eu has called for the formation of european energy dialogue with african countries of strategic importance the eus flagship project in the central asia and the caspian region is the nabucco gas pipeline the proposed pipeline which is backed by promise of 7 billion 5 billion euro s in european commission funding would bring central asian and caspian gas to europe without passing through russia however as discussed below the potential construction startdate has been pushed back several years and some observers question the projects viability with regard to russia some member states hope to institutionalize common commitment to market principles as outlined in the energy charter treaty through an eurussia energy dialogue and in new eurussia partnership and cooperation agreement however bilateral energy agreements between some member states notably germany italy and bulgaria and russian firms illuminate continued disagreement within the eu on how best to deal with moscow in the face of such discord the european commission is seeking to strengthen multilateral mechanisms including the energy charter to better coordinate global energy policy among consumer transit and producer nations many observers consider the european commissions call to increase competition within and among traditionally protected european energy markets to be its most controversial the commission has advanced proposals to reduce the power of stateowned energy companies by forcing them to split up ownership of generation and distribution businesses in the face of opposition from countries such as germany fr ance and spain the commission could seek backing for compromise proposal that would allow national energy industries to continue to operate both generation and distribution facilities but would subject them to oversight from an independent european regulatory body european leaders are expected to agree on solution during the first half of 2008 although european leaders increasingly pay lip service to the need for enhanced energy cooperation the success of an eu energy strategy will likely depend on the ability of member states to overcome differences in addressing three fundamental challenges first how to develop strong partnerships with energy producing and transit regions second how to use and further develop indigenous and alternative energy sources while seeking to curb overall consumption and third how to establish an internal system to provide dependable and secure energy supplies to all of europe

europeans must compete for existing and new energy sources projections for european energy consumption indicate that one of the most important energy security challenges facing the eu over the next 20 years will be europes ability to diversify the sources and modes of transit of its energy imports the bulk of the worlds energy resources located in russia the caspian sea region the middle east and north africa are all well within geographic reach of the european union in fact europe already receives energy supplies from each of these regions however europes growing dependence on russia and russias apparent willingness to use its energy resources for political purposes have spurred calls from some member states and the united states for more cohesive euwide strategy to further diversify supply the key for europe may be to determine the equilibrium point for supply from each region and how to best manage relations with the governments in those regions by strengthening political relations with these governments the eu opens additional options for its external ener gy strategy according to some the eu strategy in this regard differs from the stated aim of many us politicians and administration officials in that europeans acknowledge they can never gain complete energy independence and therefore seek to better manage their energy dependence rather than achieve outright energy independence 22 eu member states have collectively endorsed the commissions calls to develop collective international energy policy nonetheless while acknowledging that the eu may at times be in better position to determine what leverage could be used to advance the collective interests of the union as whole member states have been careful not to sacrifice their individual rights to independently pursue external relations to secure energy supplies europes energy relations with russia best elucidate the tension between calls for collective external energy policy and support for individual member state policies some of the eus newer member states in central and eastern europe appear skeptical of russias reliability as an energy partner and therefore call on eu member states work collectively to prevent russia from exploiting longterm dependencies for political purposes at the same time other member states continue to pursue longterm bilateral supply contracts with

within europe on how best to manage energy relations with russia most observers contend that russian president vladimir putin views his countrys vast energy resources as tool to regain russias stature as major force in global affairs26 thus putin sees energy as an important political force as much as it is the force driving russias economic development some experts believe that russia seeks to control as much of europes energy infrastructure as possible in return for its delivery of reliable energy supplies from this perspective moscow knows that if the eu is succ essful in creating europewide single market for electricity and gas russia will be presented with opportunities to become part of the worlds largest and most integrated energy market right on its border 27 according to analyst daniel yergin putin believes that energy security is about russias retaking control of the commanding heights of the energy industry and extending that control downstream 28 energys political importance is evident in the fact that the two major russian energy giants gazprom and rosneft have close ties to the kremlin and in particular to president putin himself rosneft is led by close

gazprom dominates the russian gas sector and controls 100 of russian gas flowing to the eu medvedev is expected to win march 2008 presidential elections on the investment side analysts also see russia playing the political card the international energy agency estimates that the russian gas sector will require upwards of 10 billion in annual investment to meet future global demands the eu has urged russia to provide european energy companies the opportunity to invest in the total range of the energy sector from oil and gas fields to the pipeline system thus far russia has refused to meet eu demands and in turn has warned the eu not to attempt to block gazproms plans to buy or invest in europes energy sector brushing aside the eus policies regarding competition and monopoly practices as well as the energy charter gazprom ceo miller told eu ambassadors in not so veiled attempt to exert russias energydriven influence that attempts to limit gazproms activities in the european market will not produce good results it is coincidence that competition for energy resources is growing and it should not be forg otten that we gazprom are actively seeking new markets such as china 29 rather than rely on significant outside investment in its energy infrastructure observers believe russia intends to satisfy its longterm gas contracts with european nations through its near monopoly on gas from central asia kazakhsta n turkmenistan and uzbekistan russia currently controls the overwhelming majority of oil and gas transportation routes from central asia and according to analysts

stream gas pipeline intended to transport caspian and central asian gas to europe via an almost identical route as the eus planned nabucco pipeline deals struck between gazprom and italian bulgarian and serbian energy companies in 2007 and january 2008 appear to confirm the view that gazprom may seek to convince nations that agreed to fund the nabucco pipeline to withdraw their commitments and rely on the south stream pipeline instead 31 these critics also warn that russias stateowned energy companies aim to incr ease their influence in the face of further european diversification by seeking to acquire controlling stakes in natural gas concerns in north africa32 g22g145g142g561g7g158g155g152g153g142g138g151g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g561 eu member states have established two primary institutional mechanisms with which to collectively address energy relations with russia the energy charter treaty and the eurussia energy dialogue as outlined above the energy charter treaty which russia has signed but not ratified would oblige russia to adopt legal framework governing investment transit and trade in energy resources some analysts contend that european leaders should make russian implementation of the treaty requirement of any future eurussia partnership and cooperation agreement such calls have contributed to delays in current negotiations of such an agreement and have hindered progress on the eurussia energy dialogue even as eu leadership in brussels moves forw ard with its ideas on common external energy strategy many question how far individual member states will agree to push russia and gazprom to adopt the eus principles of competition open its energy sector to outside investment and ratify the energy charter some believe that without such russian concessions europe will ultimately find its energy security largely under russian control indeed several member states have pursued bilateral energy deals with russia that will increase their dependence on russia for years to come both germany and italy the largest importers of russian gas have negotiated longterm deals with russia to lock in future gas supplies for germany and few others russias role as key supplier of oil and gas makes putin vital strategic partner who cannot be ignored or antagonized 33 such deals are not limited to the major energy consumers slovenia and belgium have entered into negotiations with gazprom to build pipeline across the former and to enter the gas distribution market in the latter hungarys oil and gas company mol has joined with gazprom to extend gazproms blue stream pipeline across the black sea through the balkans into hungary in january 2008 bulgaria signed deal with gazprom to join the proposed south stream project these examples of individual member states d ealing with russia bilaterally have drawn harsh criticism from other member states such as poland and the baltic states they have warned their european colleagues not to

last matter what alternatives are included in an eu energy policy but they also feel europe does not gain real security by becoming more dependent on russia in fact the growing presence of gazprom throughout the european energy market has led many to worry about the eus ability to develop an energy policy insulated from gazproms influence34 in july 2006 speech romanias president basescu went so far as to warn that europes dependence on russian gas monopoly gazprom could be the biggest threat to the region since the former soviet unions army 35 initial efforts to institutionalize an eurussia energy dialogue came to fruition in 2000 with the creation of the eurussia energy dialogue however results of the dialogue have reportedly been mixed at best despite continued russian reluctance to allow european investment in its energy sector and adopt energy market and transportation principles laid out in the energy charter several european nations continue to enable increased russian influence in their energy sectors on the other hand 2006 negotiations on renewed russiaeu partnership agreement were derailed due to polish and other member state concerns regarding russian intransigence in several areas including energy cooperation in the face of internal discord the eu appears to have agreed to focus on achieving its energy goal s with regard to enhancing sustainability while russia has shown few signs of deviating from its recent policies the energy situation with russia is not yet dire russia will continue to be europes primary energy supplier for the longterm and healthy russianeuropean relations remain priority on both sides if common external eu energy security policy is to emerge two options may be considered first europe may move to curb its dependence on russian energy by increasing its diversification to other regions without threatening russias own market security in europe in doing so europe might ask if there is point at which russia could decide that the eus commitment to diversification longer makes it financially attractive for russia to continue to invest in new supplies destined for the european market second the eu may attempt to regulate the behavior and practices of gazprom as it becomes more of dominant energy player in europe thus far few european countries have demonstrated restraint in seeking bilateral deals with the russian monopoly that would do just that if this continues europe could risk having gazprom interfere more and more in its internal political decisionmaking to avoid this the european union will likely continue to apply pre ssure on gazprom to play by europes rules on competition and work to change gazproms corporate mentality by allowing european firms to invest in russias gas industry according to some analysts however internal di scord on how to approach russia is preventing the eu from applying this kind of pressure these critics argue that the eu could collectively pressure russia by enforcing existing eu competition laws and even using russias prospective world trade organization wto membership as leverage to open russias domestic energy sector to outside investment 36 on the other hand countries such as germany appear reluctant to take any concerted action that may antagonize russia citing the need for healthy strategic partnership given eurorussian mutual dependencies and the importance of russian cooperation in addressing other issues of global concern such as the iranian nuclear program and the future status of kosovo 37 34 comments provided

one of the focal points of european energy diversification strategies is central asia and the caspian and black sea regions indeed the eus january 2007 energy policy paper recommends strengthening the eus socalled neighborhood poli cy with these areas and european leaders have sought to bolster ties with countries in these regions39 the caspian sea in central asia is bordered by azerbaijan iran kazakhstan russia and turkmenistan after the collapse of the soviet union the international community took an active interest in the region because of the potential oil and gas reserves thought to be located in at least six identified hydrocarbon fields beneath the caspian sea presently the caspian sea region is significant but not major supplier of crude oil to world markets the untapped reserves held by four of these nations might offer europe an opportunity to move away from increased dependence on russian energy estimates of the caspian sea regions proven oil reserves range between 40 and 50 billion barrels production levels in 2005 were estimated to be around 2 million barrels per day the caspian sea regions natural gas reserves are estimated at 232 trillion cubic feet tcf natural gas production in 2004 was approximately 5 tcf europes formal interest in the energy resources of the region dates back to 1995 with the creation of the interstate oil and gas transport to europe program inogate this eu initiative currently with 21 member countries was designed to promote the construction of regional pipeline systems in order to facilitate the transport of oil and gas to europe 40 this was followed by another eu proposal the baku initiative which was launched in november 2004 with the participation of the european commission and the black sea and caspian littoral states the baku initiative was designed to facilitate the progressive integration of the energy markets of the region into the eu market as well as the transportation of the extensive caspian oil and gas resources toward europe at the time inogate was formed russia dominated both oil and gas production and distribution in the region since most of the countries involved are landlocked their oil and gas had to be transported via pipelines reflecting soviet era dictates and infrastructure nearly all caspian crude oil traveled north or west via pipeline to or through russia to european markets some oil also went by tanker through the bosporus straits to western european markets via the mediterranean natural gas transportation was tied to pipelines traveling mainly north or west through russia and its monopoly pipeline systemgazprom this has provided russia with the market power to dictate in part the price it is wi lling to pay for the oil or gas to set transit fees on caspian energy shipped through its transportation network and to determine in some cases how much if any it is willing to transport this latter point was evident in 2005 when russias oil pipeline company transneft refused to allow oil from kazakhstan to be shipped through its pipeline system to lithuania for refining the caspian region nations thus have incentives to develop alternatives to routes through russia to reach european and other markets and provide leverage in negotiating transit fees on shipments that do go through the russian pipeline system 38 for more information see crs report rs21190 caspian oil

bosporus straits41 the bakutbilisiceyhan oil pipeline btc which opened in july 2006 exports oil from azerbaijan and up to 600000 bld from kazakhstan along 1040mile route from baku azerbaijan via georgia to the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan this will allow oil to bypass the bosporus straits the south caucasus gas pipeline scgp new gas pipeline venture completed in december 2006 runs parallel to the btc oil pipeline for most of its route before connecting to the turkish energy infrastructure and on to europe via transit pipeline through greece in addition to these pipelines already in service several additional projects in europe could be involved one option for additional oil transport would be to upgrade the existing oil pipeline which runs from baku in azerbaijan to supsa in georgia that line could be extended under the black sea or the oil could be loaded onto tankers and shipped to odessa ukraine the oil could then be pumped through the odessabrody pipeline

front two additional projects offer important options for europe as mentioned above the eus flagship project is the nabucco gas pipeline the other the transcaspian pipeline is intended to bring additional gas from the caspian to georgia and across the black sea to romania and the balkans eu officials had hoped that construction of the nabucco pipeline intended to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of central asian gas through turkey into bulgaria and on to austriawould begin in 2007 however the project has been repeatedly delayed and recent advances by gazprom on signing contracts for its south stream pipeline have caused some to doubt nabuccos viability eu officials remain optimistic aiming for construction of the pipeline to begin in 2009 in what some ciritics see as an additional attempt by gazprom to undermine the nabucco project gazprom is reported to have acquired 50 stake in the planned terminus of the nabucco pipeline the baumgarten transmission center in austria in january 2008 42 there can be doubt that the energy resources of the caspian sea region can offer europe viable alternative source of energy supply however the full realization of the energy potential of the region could be impeded by several additional factors one issue that continues to raise questions regarding regional stability is the unresolved legal status of the caspian sea despite number of efforts so far only azerbaijan kazakhstan and russia among the littoral states have reached agreement on delineating ownership of the seas 41 additional analysis of the caspian

legal assistance to help resolve outstanding issues second issue is the ability of the eu to work to ensure the longterm political stability of the region the conflict between azerbaijan and ar menia over nagornokarabaugh leaves the btc and the future scp pipelines vulnerable to sabotage internal political strife involving georgia and its two breakaway regions also threatens fu ture pipelines through that country continued political uncertainty in ukraine and growing iranian influence in the southern caucasus could deter future longterm investment by the private sector however the january 2007 entry of romania and bulgaria into the european union and the eus special relationship with turkey should help keep the black sea region settled third issue involves the willingness of the eu to compete with russia for political and economic influence in the region and to prevent gazprom from closing off the caspian market or at least the central asian part of the region to europe and its private sector russias higher priced gas exports to europe depend on gazproms ability to control gas from kazakhstan and turkmenistan this dependency is expected to increase over the next 710 years until russias huge gas fields in the barents sea come on line43 according to some although gazprom was unable to prevent the btc pipeline from being completed gazprom intends to continue to press the countries around the black and caspian sea regions to agree to gas supply and transit arrangements that satisfy the companys goals of channeling lowercost central asian gas to russian customers and protecting its lucrative european market 44 gazprom has already locked up much of turkmenistans gas in 25year contract and has pursued similar strategy toward kazakhstan the final issue revolves around whether europe is the optimal market for caspian oil and natural gas oil demand over the next 10 to 15 years in europe is expected to grow by little more than 1 million bld oil exports eastward on the other hand could serve asian markets where demand for oil is expected to grow by roughly 10 million bld over the next 15 years45 in fact china which opened an oil pipeline to kazakhstan in 2005 sees kazakhstan as major source of oil for the long term the caspian region will continue to be an important source of energy production for the foreseeable future especially if the estimates of its reserves particularly its gas reserves are accurate thus the region can contribute to the diversification of oil and gas supplies to europe which will add to europes energy security taking full advantage of this potential will require strong commitment on the part of the eu to encourage the private sector to take the financial risks associated with securing share of the caspian energy market for europe and to set forth an external strategy that is fully prepared to address the dynamics of the entire region for some credible energy strategy needs to demonstrate that the eu means business

libya via pipelines to italy two additional gas pipelines from algeria to spain and italy are under construction perhaps the most important development for europe in this region has been the growing availability of liquified natural gas lng today europe accounts for approximately 8 of the worlds total consumption of lng and in 2005 lng represented 15 of european gas importsa 21 increase from 2004

competition with asia and north america and longterm political instability throughout the region will likely temper the degree to which europe seeks to increase its reliance on the region nevertheless as with the caspian region if the eu is serious about lowering its dependency on any one source it must turn more and more to the middle east and north africa parenthetically europes growing interest in energy resources in north africa has not gone unnoticed by russia and gazprom just as in the caspian region russia appears to be bolstering its efforts to influence europes energy plans in march 2006 president putin along with gazprom offi cials traveled to algeria to discuss russian participation in algerias future oil and gas projects including its lng export markets some contend that

foremost challenges facing the nations of europe and its union in one sense europe is fortunate to have such large sources of available energy within relatively small geographical space however like other countries europe faces the fact that for the foreseeable future those energy producing nations pose different levels of risk ranging from outright political instability to more subtle questions of political reliability and long term intentions the eu can continue to use its common foreign and security policy cfsp and collective trade policy to promote political stability and security in countries providing the bulk of europes energy supply however perspectives on energy security policy differ among the 27 member states themselves and between the states and the european commission longterm bilateral energy agreements such as the baltic pipeline agreement between russia and germany the south stream pipeline contracts between italy and bulgaria and gazprom and lng contracts signed between spain and france and algeria demonstrate that member states continue to view energy security primarily as national policy issue such bilateral agreements may or may not take broader union security into account however they could become more commonplace unless member states agree that continued reluctance to coordinate may threaten the longterm energy security to the union especially if the states gravitate to single energy suppliers for many the european commissions call for common european energy policy makes sense nonetheless progress towards common external energy security strategy tied to the eus cfsp appears to require greater coordination than has been demonstrated heretofore

coalburning and to bring 12 sustainable fossilfuel power plants on line by 2015 nonetheless in the long term the ability of member states to meet their commitments to lowering carbon emissions the potential for using renewable energy the price of natural gas and the cost of installing clean coal burning technologies will likely dictate whether coal can remain viable alternative energy source

prevented the eu from developing common nuclear energy policy approx imately 175 nuclear reactors are in operation in europe today however while nations such as france finland sweden and the united kingdom rely heavily on nuclear power others oppose it on the grounds that it is dangerous and creates difficult waste disposal problems germany and spain for instance have committed to phasing out all of their nuclear reactors over the next several years and replacing those with gas powered facilities political pressure to rethink these decisions or at least extend timetables for the phase out is reportedly growing in both countries and the united kingdom finland and lithuania have all decided to add new reactors nonetheless given the substantial costs of putting nuclear reactor on line and the controversial nature of nuclear waste it appears unlikely that europe will see resurgence of new nuclear reactors in nations where nuclear power does not already play role at best those nations that ready utilize nuclear power could be expected to either replace or upgrade existing reactors on the other hand advocates of nuclear power generation appear to be gaining favor within europe given

oildependent transport sector accounts for roughly quarter of the eus tota l carbon emissions the eu has mandated that biofuels make up 10 share of all european transport fuel by 2020 whether the eu meets its renewable energy targets will likely depend on cost of production and the extent to which member states are willing to subsidize their development on large scale as noted earlier march 2007 mckinsey and company report estimates that eu member states will need to invest approximately 15 trillion 11 trillion euros in new technologies over the next 14 years in order to achieve their carbon emissions and accompanying renewable and energy efficiency targets it appears that the commission the european investment bank and individual member states are poised to substantially increase their investment in these sectors although specific amounts are difficult to estimate some member states have announced programs to subsidize and provide lowinterest loans to fund research and development

state control as energy security considerations have risen to the forefront of the eu agenda debate over energy market liberalization has increased the commission and some member states contend that market integration and liberalization will increase energy security by forging network connectivity and euwide interdependence and diversifying supply sources while others argue that continued national protection is important to guarantee stable and secure supply and distribution and pto rotect consumers from fluctuations in an unpredictable free market 61 commission proposals to develop europewide internal market for gas and electricity transmission and distribution continue to stoke debate and analysts do not expect member states to take concerted action in this area before mid2008 the commission launched its efforts to create competitive euwide gas and electricity market began in the midtolate 1990s by issuing series of directives focused on four primary objectives 1 to implement the single market for energy by promoting competition and efficiency in the production and delivery of electricity and gas 2 to lower prices and give all eu customers the opportunity to choose their energy supplier by 2007 3 to help improve the environment and 4 to enhance energy security however most member states appear to regard energy policy as too important to their own economic development to cede national controls arguing that in europe nationalized industries have for the most part provided stability in the energy market in fact the dominant position of energy industries in some countries has led some national governments to take measures to protect their industries even while ostensibly subscribing to the theory of open market competition 62 over the past year the commission has increased efforts to promote eu guidelines to determine ownership and access to electricity grids pipelines and emergency energy storage facilities the commissions most recent and controversial pr oposal would reduce the power of stateowned energy companies by obligating them to split up ownership of generation and distribution networks unbundling the commission contends that dual ownership blocks competition and allows for price manipulation however opposition to unbundling from germany france and spain has led the commission to seek to negotiate alternative proposals these countries are expected to present such proposals in early 2008 63 g16g142g157g160g152g155g148g561g11g151g157g142g155g140g152g151g151g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 as progress toward liberalized european energy market continues discussion on energy security is expected to focus on the internal markets ability to deliver energy supplies through interconnected pipelines and electricity grids and to provide infrastructure security and emergency supply the european power transmission grid is divided into seven regional pools that according to the commission are only weakly connected crossborder energy exchanges have increased recently for example in july 2006 the french electricity sector purchased additional power from germany to offset the demand in france brought on by heat

of europe could be delivered across national borders although there are examples of successful crossborder cooperation especially in regions such as the nordic pool many contend that wave of blackouts in 2005 and 2006 were caused by weak links between europes power grids poor coordination between national and regional power markets and insufficient generation capacity as result the eu has increased efforts to encourage investment in the construction of crossborder electricity grid connection and extending this kind of activity to gas oil and new lng distribution systems g3g156g156g142g156g156g150g142g151g157g561 most eu member states have long held that energy policy should remain the primary responsibility of the states themselves however european countries have begun to rethink energy not only as an element of individual national security but as an element of the eus common foreign and security policy cfsp furthermore growing european public and political concern regarding global climate change appears to have spurred european action to mitigate its energy dependence by seeking to increase efficiency and reduce carbon emissions within europe indeed of the three focal points of current eu energy security policyexternal relations indigenous energy supply and the internal energy marketefforts to promote cleaner and more efficient indigenous energy supply have gained the most member state support some skeptics doubt the ability of eu member states to ultimately come to agreement on host of energyrelated issues particularly in managing external relations and creating an internal market there continues to be strong disagreement on how to deal with russia and on an appropriate diversification strategy and most decisions regarding foreign supply sources and contract terms will likely remain in the hands of individual member states and their energy sectors open and competitive energy markets are desired but protection of national energy industries still prevails in several key nations including germany france and spain some countries that have reluctantly agreed to open their energy sectors to more competition appear unenthusiastic about turning regulatory decisions over to commission bureaucrats in brussels on the other hand the eu is increasing its role in coordinating and financing the development of renewable energy and the storage and use of emergency energy supplies although member states and their energy industries appear likely to retain absolute authority in determining which energy mix makes the most sense for individual countries the eu has set binding euwide targets in some areas and may continue this trend the eu also stands to play larger role in determining power grid interconnection arrangements and energy infrastructure investment levels with regard to foreign policy efforts to advance energy dialogues with russia and other energy producing and transit regions are being pursued in more open and coordinated manner between the eus office of the high representative for common foreign and security policy and the individual member states and the commission has outlined specific foreign policy goals with regard to multilateral treaties and an expansion of the eus neighborhood policy nonetheless foreign policy continues first and foremost to be determined by national governments

economic growth prosperity and trade64 within the deepening transatlantic economic relationship energy security policy is becoming higher priority for both the united st ates and the eu together the united states and the european union represent the worlds largest energy market the united states and the eu produce approximately 23 of the worlds energy but combine for almost 40 of global energy consumption65 combined the united states and the eu account for almost 40 of the worlds total carbon emissions66 at the 2006 and 2007 useu summits the parties agreed to increase cooperation on energy security climate change and sustainable development issues three institutional mechanisms to facilitate this cooperation were established an annual strategic review of useu energy cooperation useu high level dialogue on climate change clean energy and sustainable development and useu energy ceo forum none of these forums has convened more than twice however and at the april 2007 useu summit in washington dc the united states administration reportedly rejected european calls for commitment to pursue binding international global emissions and energy efficiency targets67 specifically european officials have urged us support for an international treaty regulating greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the kyoto protocol is set to expire and for an international marketbased carbon emissions credit trading system european officials appear encouraged by what they perceive as an increasing us willingness to acknowledge climate change as problem with serious global ramifications and to link energy and climate change policy however they are reportedly frustrated by us reluctance to commit to binding international emissions and energy efficiency targets the united states is not party to the kyoto protocol and the administration reportedly views global regulation to address climate change skeptically instead us officials advocate transatlantic and international cooperation to develop alternative and renewable energy sources and liberalize international energy markets to this end the united states and eu used their 2007 summit to launch series of initiatives jointly promoting technological advances in clean coal and carbon capture and storage biofuels energy efficiency and methane recovery us officials argue that such technological innovation is proving more effective in reducing emissions than global regulation and that such regulation may actually impede the economic growth necessary to sustain further technological advances to support their claims administration officials point out that despite eu participation in the kyoto protocol carbon dioxide emissions increased at faster rate in the eu than in the united states from 20002004 during the same period they add us economic growth outpaced economic growth in the eu 68 64 for more detailed explanation of the economic relationship see hamilton and quinlan deep integration how transatlantic

perceived us reluctance to link transatlantic energy security to pursuit of global climate change treaty us administration officials and analysts point to potential longterm threat to transatlantic relations arising from european dependence on russian energy and gazproms growing influence in large segments of europes energy infrastructure69 to this end the administration has been supportive of efforts to build pipelines and develop other transportation routes from central asia and the caspian region to europe that bypass russia in addition us critics of eu policy toward russia argue that the eu should strengthen its resolve in requiring russ ia to ratify the energy charter treaty and to accept standard open market business practices competition and foreign investment in its energy sector some europeans and particularly germans on the other hand appear reluctant to take concerted action toward russia that may be viewed as antagonizing country they view as an essential strategic partner on variety of important issues beyond energy 70 lastly transatlantic discussion of energy supply security also includes energy crisis management and infrastructure protection in this regard some have called for nato involvement in energy security issues including in securing supply sources distribution routes and storage facilities in 2006 poland circulated proposal for socalled energy nato calling on an increased role for na to in guaranteeing the protection of member state energy supplies in similar vein in an address at natos november 2006 summit in riga latvia senator lugar proposed the extension of na tos collective defense clause article 5 to cases where member states energy security is threatened other eu member states notably germany and france have greeted such proposals skeptically preferring to advocate an enhanced eu role in energy security matters however still others assert that natos role in energy security could be complementary to the eus effort to strengthen market forces and interdependence in the international energy sector by offering assistance for the protection of pipelines or sea lanes during times of political unrest or conflict na to partnership for peace countries such as kazakhstan and turkmenistan which are important energy producers are seeking ways to associate themselves more closely with nato in part to diminish russian influence and in part to develop reliable partners in an unstable region for some nato has the ability to help secure the energy infrastructure of such countries 71
