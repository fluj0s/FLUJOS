to address six perceived problems with the current statutes that many members identified during the 109 th congress 1 that the principal members of the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations regarding proposed or pending investment transactions 2 that cfius has interpreted incorrectly the requirements under current statutes for investigations of transactions that involve firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government 3 that reporting requirements under current statutes do not provide congress with enough information about the operations and actions of cfius for members to fulfill their oversight responsibilities 4 that cfius exercises too much discretion in its ability to choose which transactions it investigates 5 that the definition of national security used by cfius is longer adequate in postseptember 11 th world and 6 that deadlines placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions do not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations this report provides

numerous members of congress introduced over two dozen measures to address various concerns with foreign investment that arose from the proposed purchase of the britishowned po ports1 by dubai ports world2 in early 20063 in particular the transaction spurred some members to question the effectiveness of the relatively obscure interagency group the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the group has been charged with developing and implementing the administrations policy on foreign investment and with conducting national security reviews under the exonflorio provision of the defense production act 50 usc sec 2170 of the measures that were introduced hr 5337 and s 3549 from the house and senate respectively garnered significant support and passed their respective bodies on july 26 2006 the 109 th congress ended before conference committee was convened on hr 5337 or s 3549 and both measures lapsed in the 110th congress congresswoman maloney introduced hr 556 hrept 11024 the national security foreign investment reform and strengthened transparency act of 2007 which was adopted by the full house on february 28 2007 on june 13 2007 senator dodd introduced s 1610 srept 11080 the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 on june 29 2007 the senate substituted s 1610 for hr 556 and adopted the revised measure by unanimous consent on july 11 2007 the house accepted the senates version of hr 556 by vote of 37045 and sent the measure to the president who signed it on july 26 2007 it is designated as pl 11049 hr 556 and s 1610 represent efforts to correct perceived problems with the current process that arose during consideration of the dubai ports world transaction in particular many members generally expressed concerns about six areas first some members were concerned that the principal members of cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations made by cfius regarding proposed or pending investment transactions because the duty for reviewing such transactions has been delegated in most agencies to lower level personnel second some members argued that cfius was interpreting incorrectly the requirements under current statutes for investigations of transactions that involve firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government third some members argued that the current statutes do not provide congress with enough information about the operations and actions of cfius for them to fulfill their oversight responsibilities fourth some members argued that cfius exercises too much discretion in its ability to choose which transactions it investigates and that it needs to be held more accountable to congress for its decisions regarding reviews and investigations of investment transactions fifth some members questioned the definition of national security used by the committee as being too narrowly interpreted and out of sync with the post september 11 th view of national security last some members expressed their concerns that the time constraints placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment 1 peninsular and oriental steam company is leading

foreign investment in the economy cfius was established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 with broad responsibilities and few specific powers 4 pl 11049 established the committee as matter of statute rather than as creation of various executive orders the committee is housed in the department of the treasury and until recently generally has operated in relative obscurity initially cfius was established with six members but the membership was expanded to twelve through various executive orders under pl 11049 the committee membership was reduced to seven members including the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce energy and the attorney general the secretary of labor and the director of national intelligence serve as ex

engaged in interstate commerce in the united states which threaten to impair the national security the statute indicate s that the president must make an investigation to determine the effects on national security of such investments most importantly however congress directed that the president can exercise this discretionary authority only if he determines that two conditions exist 1 other us

broadly without limitation to particular industry6 in 1988 congress approved the exonflorio prov ision as part of the omnibus trade act7 through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act and he delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius8 particularly to conduct reviews of foreign investment to undertake investigations and to make recommendations although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was transformed from purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with broad mandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be suspended or prohibited the committee has 30 days to decide whether to investigate case and an additional 45 days to make its recommendation once the recommendation is made the president has 15 days to act regulations developed by the treasury department in november 1991 implemented the exon florio provision 9 these regulations created system of voluntary notification by the parties to an investment transaction and they allow for notices of acquisitions by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the not ification firms largely comply with these provisions because the regulations stipulate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the exonflorio review process but that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the president this process has become one in number of regulatory steps that firms consider as they undertake merger acquisition or takeover according to the exonflorio provision as amended by pl 11049 cfius has 30 days to decide after it receives the initial formal notification by the parties to merger acquisition or takeover whether to investigate case as result of its determination that the investment threatens to impair the national security of the united states national security also includes those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies in addition cfius is required to conduct an investigation of transaction if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states the president acting through cfius is also required to conduct national security investigation of the effects of transaction on the national security of the united states and to take any necessary actions in connection with the transaction to protect the national security of the united states under certain conditions these conditions would be 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determined that the transactions threatened to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to review of the transaction or 2 the foreign person was controlled by foreign government if during this 30 day period all of the members of cfius conclude that the investment does not threaten to impair the national security the review is terminated if however at least one member of the committee determines that the investment does threaten to impair the

statute through section 837a of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 known as the byrd amendment after the amendments sponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate proposed mergers acquisitions or takeovers in cases where 1 the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government and 2 the acquisition results in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states10 under pl 11049 these investigative requirements were strengthened the definition of national security was broadened by pl 11049 to include those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies in addition cfius is required to conduct an investigation of transaction if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of an entity engaged in interstate commerce in the united states the president acting through cfius is required to conduct national security investigation of the effects of transaction on the national security of the united states and to take any necessary actions in connection with the transaction to protect the national security of the united states if the foreign party to an investment transaction is controlled by foreign government cfius is not required to conduct an investigation even if it had determined during review that the party to transaction was co ntrolled by foreign government if it also determines that the transaction will not affect the national security of the united states this amendment came under particularly intense scrutiny by the 109 th congress as result of the dp world transaction many members of congress and others believed that this amendment required cfius to undertake full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government the dp world acquisition however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius were interpreting the amendment in particular some members of congress

factors that controlled their decision not to conduct 45day investigation of the transaction first they argued that the requirements of the exonflorio provision itself precluded them from engaging in 45day investigation because their initial review did not find credible evidence that the transaction would impair national security basic threshold for cfius to meet in order to invoke the exon florio provision secondly representatives indicated that they interpret the amendment to mean that 45day investigation is discretionary and not mandatory again because of the requirement that transaction must be found to cause an impairment to national security before the exon florio provision can be invoked cfius representatives also argued that their decision not to launch full 45day investigation of the dp world was the result of an extensive informal review of the transaction prior to the case being officially filed with cfius and as result of formal 30day review during these two reviews cfius members believed that all concerns that had been expressed by members of cfius had been adequately resolved so that by the time of the review member of cfius had any unresolved concerns about the impact of the transaction on national security they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement because cfius had concluded during the 30day review that the transaction could not affect the national security 11 as result of the attention by both the public and congress dp world officials indicated that they would sell off the us port operations to an american owner12 on december 11 2006 dp world officials announced that unit of aig global

has broad discretion under the current statute to decide the basis on which he determines whether transaction might impair the national security this list includes the following factors 1 domestic

products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to

balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations longstanding international commitment to maintain an open an d receptive environment for foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflorio provision alter the generally open foreign investment climate of the country or to have it inhibit foreign direct investments in industries that could not be considered to be of national security interest the basic approach of the provision therefore was to presume that fore ign investment generally has positive effect on the economy and that it should be encouraged and restricted only in those cases in which specific transaction had met burden of proof that the proposed investor might take action that threatens to impair the national security at the time the exonflorio provision was adopte d some analysts believed the provision could potentially widen the scope of industries that fell under the national security rubric cfius however is not free to establish an independen t approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result the discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreign investment cases reflects policy guidance from the president in addition congress did not adopt specific definition of national security when it approved the exonflorio provision instead during review or investigation of foreign investment ea ch member of cfius is expected to apply that definition of national security that is consistent with the legislative mandate of the cfius member as result the cfius process relies on each member applying their own particular definition of national security and making any concerns that arise from such review known to the other members of cfius foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industries as maritime operations aircraft banking resources and power 15 generally these sectors were closed to foreign investors primarily for national defense purposes prior to passage of the exonflorio provision to prevent these areas from being subject to foreign control

safety or any combination of those matters17 this broad definition is enhanced to some degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify certain sectors of the economy therefore as likely candidates for consideration as critical infrastructure including telecommunications energy financial services water transportation sectors 18 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states19 the following year congress adopted the language in the usa patriot act on critical infrastructure into the homeland security act of 200220 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altered the way many members of congress and many in the public view the concept of national security as result many in congress and in the public have come to believe that economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security in addition many in congress and elsewhere apparently perceive greater risks to the economy arising from foreign investments in which the foreign investor is owned or controlled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national security and the operations of cfius for some members of congress cfius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national security because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exonflorio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security activity within congress and the intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important administrative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment transactions cfius and president bush approved the acquisition of lucent technologies inc by the french based alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transaction was approved by cfius however alcatellucent was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatels access to sensitive work done by lucents research arm bell labs and the communications infrastructure in the united states the most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believes the companies materially fail to comply with the terms of the arrangement this marks significant change in the cfius process prior to this transaction cfius reviews and investigations had been portrayed and had been considered to be final as result firms we re willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firms could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or ac tions this administrative change however means 17 ibid 18 42 usc sec 5195cb2 19 42 usc sec 5195cb3 20 6 usc sec 1014

february 13 2007 with amendments the amendment offered by committee chairman frank and representative price included six changes to the bill as it was introduced on january 18 2007 these changes responded to concerns that were expressed by the bush administration that some of the procedures that would have been established und er hr 556 would have created new levels of bureaucracy and administrative bottlenecks that potentially could have delayed and discouraged foreign investment the changes would 1 allow deputy secretary or an under secretary of an agency to approve an investment transaction on behalf of the respective agency instead of requiring the secretary to approve the transaction 2 require the deputy secretary of an agency to certify investment transactions by companies that are owned by foreign government 3 give the director of national intelligence adequate time to consider national security implications instead of requiring minimum of 30 days to ex amine security implications 4 clarify that agencies act on behalf of cfius in administering agreements to mitigate security concerns that are raised about foreign investor during cfius review 5 strike provision that would have allowed cfius to reopen approvals and would have required the attorney general to report to congress 22 on february 28 2007 hr 556 was approved with amendments by the full house the three

bill retained the basic structure of the committee as it presently exists except that it would add the secretary of energy as permanent member of cfius the senate measure reduced the official number

currently exists with 30 days allotted for review 45 days for an investigation and 15 days for the president to make his determination the president retains his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit certain types of foreign investments the measures place additional requirements on firms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review is completed in hr 556 review or investigation would have been considered to be complete until it had been approved by majority of the members of cfius and signed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security to insure that principal members of cfius were aware of all reviews and investigations completed by cfius both measures require cfius to investigate all covered foreign investment transactions to determine whether transaction threatens to impair the national security or the foreign entity is controlled by foreign government covered foreign investment transaction is defined as any merger acquisition or takeover which results in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states s 1610 requires an investigation if the transaction would result in control of any critical infrastructure that could impair the national security both measures place increased requirements on cfius to review investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government both measures provide for exceptions from the requirement to investigat transactions in which the foreign party is controlled by foreign government the measures would allow cfius to exclude transaction from an investigation if the secretary of the treasury and certain other specified officials determine that the transaction will not impair the national security it is somewhat unclear however how this change will mesh with the current process the measures seem to strengthen the role of cfius in determining which transactions it will investigate the measures also do not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of recent differences between cfius and congress in particular the cu rrent statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio proces s only if he finds that there is credible evidence that foreign investment will impair national security as result cfius has determined as was the case in the dubai ports transaction that if the committee does not have credible evidence that an investment will impair the national security that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation the extent to which cfius increases its investigations of transactions that involve foreign government may cause foreign investors to regard this as an important policy change by the united states toward foreign investment as previo usly stated the current system presumes that foreign investment transactions are acceptable and that they provide positive contribution to the economy as result the burden is on the members of cfius to prove that particular transaction is threat to national security the measures however might be interpreted to presume that investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government are threat to the nations curity simply because of the relationship to the foreign government and therefore might require the firms to prove that they are not threat although the number of investment transactions ear in which the foreign investor is associated

the role of congressional oversight by requiring greater reporting by cfius on its actions either during or after it completes reviews and investigations and by increasing reporting requirements on cfius hr 556 would have required the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce to sign and approve any review or investigation in those cases in which the foreign person involved in an investment transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government majority of the members of cfius would have been required to approve the transaction and the president and the chair and vice chairs of cfius would have been required to sign off on investments in which at least one member of cfius did not agree with the decision of the majority to approve the transaction hr 556 also would have required the president to approve of any review or investigation in which foreign entity is from country that has been determined to support acts of international terrorism both measures require cfius to provide congress with greater amount of detailed information about its operations hr 556 would have requ ired cfius to notify specified members at the conclusion of any investment investigation and to report annually to congress both measures provide for greater reporting on and increased authority for cfius to negotiate provisions with the foreign firms involved in investment transactions to mitigate the impact of the transaction under current statutes cfius has authority to negotiate such agreements with firms and it is not clear that it has any authority to enforce such agreements hr 556 and s 1610 provide for process to track the agreements and to report the progress of such agreements and any changes to the agreements to the members of cfius and to the president the measures also amend the current statute regarding the meaning of national security and place additional requirements on cfius regarding national security reviews the bills explicitly require the director of national intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that posed threat to the national security the bills also provide for additional factors

investment subsequent amendment the byrd amendment requires cfius to conduct 45day investigation of transaction in any instance in which the foreign entity is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government which could result in the foreign entity gaining control of the us entity and that could affect the national security of the united states such an investigation is required to begin

foreign investment in the united states as matter of statute and would amend the current procedures for cfius review and investigation the measures strike out the first two sections of the current statute that deal with investigations and replace them with provisions that would provide for the same 30day review and 45day investigation stages that exist under the current provision but would alter the provision in number of ways first the measures explicitly indicate that the investigation will be conducted by the committee on foreign investment in the united states which was referred to only as the presidents designee prior to passage of pl 11049 next the measures amend and broaden the language in the current statute regarding national security by indicating that national security for this provision is construed so as to include those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies the measures provide for national security reviews and investigations which are not part of the current cfius process although the director of national intelligence often is asked to participate in cfius reviews and investigations in an important departure from the current procedure cfius is required shall to review any merger acquisition or takeover to determine the effects of the transaction on the national security of the united states in addition cfius is required shall to conduct an investigation of transaction if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states once review has been initiated firm cannot withdraw its notice unless it provides written request for such withdrawal and the request is approved in writing by the chairperson in consultation with the vice chairpersons of the committee the term control for this section is defined in the code of federa l regulation 31cfr800204 as the power to affect the principal assets of the entity the power to dissolve the entity to close andor relocate the production or research and development facilities to terminate contracts or to amend the articles of incorporation in addition to any entity that is party to merger acquisition or takeover being able to initiate review the measures would provide that the president the committee can request that cfius review transaction this authority could not be delegated by any member of cfius to any person other than to an appropriate deputy secretary or under secretary these individuals

conditions these conditions would be 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determined that the transactions threatened to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat

the members of cfius at least one member had voted against approving the transaction the director of national intelligence had identified particularly complex national security or intelligence issues that threaten to impair the national security of the united states and cfius members had not been able to develop and agree on measures to mitigate the threat during review s 1610 requires an investigation if the transaction results in the control of any critical infrastructure that would impair the national security the investigation is required to be completed within 45 days but the house measure would have provided for an extension of the deadline of up to an additional 45 days if the extension had been requested by the president or by roll call vote of twothirds of the cfius members both measures provide an important exception to the requirement that cfius conduct an investigation of any transaction if it determines during review that party to transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government instead the measures would not require such an investigation even if cfius had determined durin g review that the party to transaction was controlled by foreign government if it also dete rmined that the transaction will not affect the national security of the united states the house measure also would have waived the requirement for an investigation if agreement or condition was required relative to the transaction to mitigate any threat to the national security the house measure would have required the approval of majority of the members of cfius and the approval of and signed determination by the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce on any review or investigation in order for the cfius process to be considered final or complete in those cases in which the foreign entity was determined to be controlled by foreign government and at least one member of cfius did not vote in favor of approval the cfius investigation process would not be considered to be complete until the president and the chairperson and the vice chairperson of the committee signed the committee report to indicate their approval hr 556 would have required action by the president in certain cases specifically the measure would have required the president to approve and to sign his approval of an investment transaction in which the party to transaction is an entity or country that has been determined by the secretary of state under the export administration act or other provisions of law repeatedly to have provided support for acts of terrorism s 1610 requires the secretary of the treasury to publish in the federal register guidance on the types of transactions that the committee had

relates to issues of corporate ownership foreign investment and national security in the us economy the transaction revealed significant differences between congress and the administration over the operations of cfius and over the objectives the committee should be pursuing in addition the transaction demonstrated that neither congress nor the administration has been able so far to define clearly the national security implications of foreign direct investment or the national security implications of foreign investment activity in the economy these issues likely reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the us economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among members and between the congress and the administration the incident also focused attention on the informal process firms use to have their investment transactions reviewed by cfius prior to formal review according to anecdotal evidence some firms apparently believe that the cfius process is not market neutral but that it adds to market uncertainty that can negatively affect firms stock price and lead to economic behavior by some firms that is not optimal for the economy as whole such behavior might involve firms expending considerable amount of resources to avoid cfius investigation or deciding to terminate transaction that would improve the optimal performance of the economy in order to avoid cfius investigation while such anecdotal evidence may not serve as the basis for developing public policy it does raise number of concerns about the possible impact of the cfius process on the market and the potential costs of redefining the concept of national security relative to foreign investment

that the dp world transaction in combination with other recent unpopular foreign investment transactions has exacerbated dissatisfaction among some members of congress over the operations of cfius in particular some members are displeased with the way the committee uses its discretionary authority under the exonflorio provision to investigate certain foreign investment transactions as result some members of congress are proposing changes to the cfius process through legislation that is progressing through the 1 st session of the 110th congress the changes could mandate more frequent contact between the committee which generally operates without much public or congressional attention and the congress and enhance congresss oversight role over the committee the dp world transaction also revealed that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks may have fundamentally altered the viewpoint of some memb ers of congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security framework some argue that this changed perspective requires reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corporate ownership of activities that fall under the rubric of critical infrastructure as result some members of congress are looking to amend the cfius process to enhance congresss oversight role while reducing somewhat the discretion of cfius to review and investigate foreign investment transactions in order to have cfius investigate larger number of foreign investment cases in addition the dp world transaction has focused attention on longunresolved issues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nations overall security framework and the methods that are being used to assess the impact of foreign investment on the nations defense industrial base homeland security and national economic infrastructure changes to the cfius process being proposed in the house and senate bills would alter the current cfius process but it remains to be seen how the changes would affect the outcome of the cfius process in the final analysis the pr esident retains sole authority to apply the exon florio provisions and he has complete discretion to accept or reject cfius recommendation to block proposed foreign investment transaction as result cfius reflects the presidents priorities and policies relative to foreign investment to date presidents have been highly reluctant to use the authority of the exonflorio provision to block investment transactions which has happened just once since the measure was adopted in part this reluctance may stem from the narrow range of policy options that are provided for in the provision which seems at odds with the often highly complex nature of foreign investment transactions as result cfius has slowly developed an informal process that essentially expands the policy options available to the president by allowing cfius members to review proposed investment transactions ahead of any formal review and most importantly to negotiate informal agreements that mitigate aspects of the investment that otherwise would spur cfius members to oppose the transaction by formalizing this process through proposed legislation congress likely would expand the range of policy options available to the president and possibly broaden the scope of measures foreign firms may be asked to comply with in order to gain approval depending on how foreign firms view these changes they may regard them as signaling less tolerant attitude in the united states toward foreign investment and the changes potentially could add support to the renewed willingness of some foreign governments to impos additional restrictions on foreign investors most economists agree that there is little economic evidence to conclude that foreign ownership whether by private entity or by an entity that is owned or controlled by foreign government has measurable impact on the us economy as whole others may argue on noneconomic grounds that such firms pose risk to national security or to homeland security similar issues

1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the us economy increased rapidly there are little new data however to alter the conclusion reached at that time that there is definitive way to assess the economic impact of foreign ownership or of foreign investment on the economy although some observers have expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign governments acquiring us firms there is little confirmed evidence that such distinction in corporate ownership has any measurable effect on the economy as whole for most economists the distinction between dom estic and foreignowned firms whether the foreign firms are privately owned or controlled by foreign government is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warrant placing restrictions on the inflow of foreign investment nevertheless foreign direct investment does entail various economic costs and benefits on the benefit side such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation such investment also represents one repercussion of the us trade deficit the deficit transfers dollardenominated assets to foreign investors who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles including direct investment foreign investment also removes stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the total amount of capital in the economy such costs and benefits likely occur whether the foreign owner is private entity or foreign government g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance
