tv demo blocking out and dating incidents an auditing demonstration given on 15 may 1963 lrh okay this is demonstration this is demonstration of probably the only difficult piece of auditing which you will have to do on running these implants and so forth and it is demonstration purely of dating and blocking out the first incident the first engram the well youre back to 1950 but we know so much more about running engrams today than we ever did then that actually if you get few very stable data why youll be all right this is not demonstration of engram running this is demonstration in blocking out the early items and exploration of the track immediately preceding the first implant okay now your chair is fine pc uhhuh lrh is it all right if we audit in this room pc yes lrh very good and give can squeeze all right bang thats fine now what im going to do here is just try to block out the early part of this track if i can nothing very tense pc all right lrh all right all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes lrh okay start of session has the session started for you pc yes lrh very good what goals would you like to set for this session pc oh to block out the early part of the track lrh all right pc get the date and work well lrh okay very good all right now youve just successfully completed the handling of the first gpm pc yes lrh and i think thats very well as you realize theres undoubtedly data ahead of this pc uhhuh lrh and lets see if we can find it huh pc all right lrh all right now the beautiful part about this is you dont have to do very much regression and all that sort of thing because its right there now youre thats not an instructive note i mean as far as youre concerned pc uhhuh lrh now were going to look for the point of capture and were simply going to date from the beginning of the goal to forget which you have already run its the top of the stairs pc uhhuh lrh the top of the stairs in the vestibule there pc uhhuh lrh i dont know if you had any visio on it or not but that will register its from the top oppterm of the goal to forget pc right lrh thats the part were dating from were just going earlier than that pc right lrh and that were taking as zero pc right lrh and i want to know now if your first contact with these people that did the implanting was on the order of years earlier all right was it on the order of months earlier all right apparently on the order of years earlier all right now is it tens of years earlier tens of years earlier would it be on the order of hundreds of years earlier than this top oppterm of the goal to forget hundreds of years earlier tens of years earlier or just single years earlier i get little more reaction on that now is it more than five years earlier less than five years earlier well i get read what did you think pc ive got im getting six comes up lrh six is it six years earlier all right were getting little more fall on that six years earlier all right now lets be little more specific here apparently were running into little more mud than i care to have here lets find the capture pc right lrh lets date the capture now this is the first series did you have two series two series one series just one you only had one pc well i think so lrh huh is that right pc well it started out i believe and then found there were four lrh four were there four series four times you went back through this well i get fall on that did you go back through that four times three times two times one time one time two times three times four times this is very equivocal here she saidfound that there were four pc uhhuh lrh right four complete tours through this pc yes im sucker lrh four complete tours huh four complete tours or four complete engrams i mean four complete gpms four complete tours all right let verify that figure were there five complete tours six complete tours seven complete tours eight more than eight less than eight less than eight more than five less than five less than five times through all right less than five times through more than four times through less than four times through less than four times through more than four times through four times through is it four times apparently apparently there is some verification on this this is pretty muddy pc im getting pain here lrh all right very good very good seems theres sure more than once anyway pc all right lrh all right now referring to the first one pc uhhuh lrh the first time the bank youve just run and weve got point of capture there someplace right pc uhhuh lrh is there point of capture point of capture yes now is this point of capture months before months before the first goal years before the first goal months before the first goal weeks before the first goal days before the first goal ah days before the first goal pc im getting to feel im being pinioned with the arms lrh oh yeah pc yeah the arms are quite lrh very good all right this is days before the first goal all right weve got that to that that reacted all right was it five days before more than five days before less than five days before was it more than five days before the first implant was this capture more than five days before the first implant less than five days before the first implant more than five days less was it five days pc uhhuh lrh all right pc sorry i meant to tell you lrh all right very good five days before all right very good thats fine its five days before all right thats speedy one all right now weve got that point have you got any impression of what might have happened there five days before pc well something to do with my arms i was pinioned somehow with my arms so i was very shaky um i dont get anything else suffocation um i got feeling of being um i dont think it is but the nearest i can get to it is sack thrown over my head and pinioned um other ways lrh all right pc but its more of its not sack its more of um its balloon fabric lrh oh yes pc its silver balloon fabric sty lrh right right all right pc um had had arms are pinioned funny getting this arms business lrh all right now just two minutes before that where were you standine pc i was going to say on mountain lrh all right good go ahead and say it pc on mountain lrh all right thats got little bit of fall on it okay and what happened pc pains across shoulders lrh ah yes pc um im sorry ive lost where im supposed to be lrh all right well thats all right thats all right lets go to seven days before the capture seven days before the capture pc tenseness went off lrh yes pc um lrh you have any somatics there pc they it was sort of relief i seem to have lost somatics theres slight suggestion of somatics in the back again now lrh oh there is slight suggestion in the back pc uhhuh lrh all right very good ive got that now lets just move back little bit further pc min lrh lets go back year before the first implant before capture year before the first oppterm year before the first oppterm pc now ive got picture that ive had before its never been run its come up in auditing and it it again is in mount mountainous country and it seems to be in um what do you call it its not exactly valley its hollow in the mountains and theres um the mountain towers up behind it but there are high hills or rocks in front lrh uhhuh pc and um i think theres woman there lrh oh all right all right youve seen this before pc uhhuh lrh well good enough anything else you notice about that pc well the woman seems to be my boss for some reason or other lrh oh yeah pc and um shes wearing the sort of clothing that is not um um more grecian type lrh uhhuh pc dark haired lrh uhhuh pc young attractive lrh uhhuh pc powerful lrh all right very good now your somatic do you have any electronic somatics at all pc electronic lrh the same of year before you sure then hows that one that you just mentioned thats gone at this point pc ive got uh uh something across the tightness across the stomach now lrh all right very good thats all we want to know pc uhhuh lrh all right lets go two years before the top oppterm two years before the top oppterm pc that turns on the shoulderacross the shoulders immediately lrh all right and what do you see there at two years pc um dont really see it but i seem to know theres um chariot type of thing its the wheels particularly like the wheels of gun carriage uh im afraid thats all i can tell you lrh all right thats fine thats fine thats all fine now lets take it at three years now three years before this top oppterm three years before this top oppterm now what do youwhat do youwhat can you tell there pc um same scene same area not not the same scene the same area it seems um old man not sure whether its or not lrh uhhuh pc but rather um unkempt uh and not primitively dressed lrh right pc it c it could be father time or something lrh oh yes all right okay pc dont know whats amusing about it i want to laugh lrh oh all right now is that all of that pc yes lrh all right good do you have somatic there pc lrh lets inspect that very closely there pc all ive got is feeling of brightness uh above my eyes in front there lrh what do you mean brightness pc bright light brightness above my eyes its its lrh all right very good now lets find point there lets go to five years before the top oppterm five years youve got something pc dont get thing lrh well is it just pc just black not not exactly black i would say hazy lrh all right very good pc misty lrh very good now lets take it to ten years before that top oppterm ten years before the top oppterm now pc now all i get now is quivering in the eyelids the eyelids seem to be quivering lrh all right very good now lets take it one century one hundred years before the firsttop oppterm pc tin out in space doing nothing lrh thataboy pc feeling about just out in space and theres planets around and so on nothing very distinct but thats the lrh all right do you have somatic there doing nothing in space pc when you asked if i get it when im not aware of somatic until you asked lrh thats all right pc then i seem to get this across the shoulders again its not nothing very bad but im just aware particularly just right across the shoulder there lrh all right thats okay thats just what im looking for pc okay lrh all right is that present in the hundred year earlier pc its now im getting more as if tin you asked about electronics fin getting more as if im being electric shocked you know i could easily turn on this shaking with the body lrh uhhuh uhhuh therefore at hundred years there you do have an electronic sensation pc yes yes definitely lrh very good lets take it two hun pc now tin getting somatic down there as well lrh all right well find this pc uhhuh lrh two hundred years before the top oppterm two hundred years before the top oppterm of the first implant two hundred years what have you got pc i was just aware of the somatic now across the shoulders without you asking for it um theres nothing at all blank lrh that areas blank and shoulders lashed up all right thats fine whatswhat have you got there pc well its just ive got this um i mean this is even where i am lrh uhhuh pc this terrible feeling of puzzlement of bewilderment lrh ye s pc thats thats present lrh all right all right pc cant make it out lrh thats all right all right lets go three hundred years before the top oppterm three hundred years what do you got pc im not puzzled lrh good pc and um seem to be in as if ive been blinded with light and its like the afterglow of when ones been blinded by light if you you know if you get bright light flashed in your eyes and you shut them you can still see bright glow or at least i can lrh umhm uhhm pc and this is the feeling im getting here now its just darkened up slightly lrh all right thats excellent tell anything more about three hundredyear point there pc lrh all right lets go to four hundred years four hundred years before the top oppterm what do we find pc um feeling of going back feeling about my eyelids being vibrating again and uh sort of um theyre not actually halos but uh something going away from in the form like dwindling halos and theyre gradually going away lrh uhhm pc dark its like um it was purple var various colors and so on like uh auras people have lrh oh yeah pc things like that not very distinct lrh all right do you have somatic there at four hundred years pc somatic there lrh somatic pc lrh but you see these electronic pc yes lrh things departing pc uhhum yes lrh all right very good very good now you make any guesses here of what this might be in relationship to what pc well the guess is that ive i had feeling ive just come out of body or something um and am bit bemused by it all and bit lost lrh uhhuh pc uh its an area i would say of unconsciousness if anything or uh be conscious unconsciousness is the best way i can describe it as if one was aware when one was unconscious this is what one would be aware of lrh oh i see pc ah this is double dutch maybe but its er its so shadowy and vague you see theres nothing to look at nothing to do sensation nothing to feel but yet one is aware lrh uhhuh pc of this do you see lrh uhhuh pc thats all lrh all right very good now lets take jump back there to thousand years before the first implant pc cant see it but ive got bicycle um im trying to see picture of of machine with uh bicycle wheels but they they would be wheels on on aeroplane or something of that nature um yes i can see this is like um one of these acrobats bicycles you know where they ride very high lrh uhhuh pc theres chain but im trying to give the length of spindle between the wheel it seems to be on prop and holding something up it could be spacecraft or an aeroplane of some sort lrh all right pc um very big very very big lrh uhhuh pc these bicycle wheels are i called them theyre half the size of man but they look very small in relationship to this whole thing its like um the plane appears to be pitched up like the dakotas thats you know pitched up lot and the ve got the tail comes down rather low and the front is propped up i cant see the rear of it though lrh all right very good whats your relationship to this plane who are you pc im mechanic lrh all right all right do you have any somatics pc when you asked when you asked at that point i got pain in the back of the neck lrh all right pc different to where ive had it before higher up right in the nape nape up there lrh all right is this military craft can you tell pc um i should think so could be transport could be commercial transport but military seems to fit in very well lrh okay pc yes its military its the i dont know why i know this but its the color of military stuff its grayish lrh uhhuh oh very good now were getting some pay dirt youve got some pain in the back of your neck there though pc uhhuh lrh all right now lets take crack at this at two thousand years before the first implant pc somatic in the right ear immediately lrh all right pc um im in the air now this is air and there seem to be i cant locate hm ive got um view of craft in the air and theyre shaped like um delta delta craft thats right lrh mmmm pc delta craft theyre long way away im and im plane im in is in part of this formation im having trouble with my eyes i cant see i want to screw up um somatics around the eyes lrh all right pc something to do with difficulty in seeing here lrh umhm pc i ought to be able to see and cant is what i get and im sort of trying hard to find see or find out something but ive got this im forward in plane um and over on the dont know on the right lrh yes pc um theres this other deltalike plane its long way away i dont see why im so worried about that thats all ive got there lrh all right fine fine take it half an hour later pc still watching still watching that plane lrh all right then take it two hours earlier than you first squinted your eyes at it there pc were pointed at the sun suns blinding us lrh oh i see pc were being uh being outmaneuvered outmaneuvered and um i dont know what and somehow weve got directed into the sun and this is nothing to sun or the sun and its got us confused lrh um pc um the other plane isnt there lrh all right thats fine okay do you have any electronic sensations as you go into the sun there pc just this uh feeling of bright light in eyes lrh all right otherwise electronic sensations pc lrh very good very good now we found point here where we have electronic sensations okay pc right lrh now move forward toward present time to the first heavy electronic sensation from that point there we go good good now whatnow move just before that was received all right what have you got to say pc i was unconscious lrh all right okay now is this im going to date this earlier than the implant okay pc right lrh is this on the orderis this more than thousand years before the implant began yes is it greater than 1500 years before the implant began yes is it greater than 1800 years yes is it two thousand years is it greater than 1900 years before the implant yes pc 54 lrh 1954 1954 years pc um lrh is that what you got pc um lrh all right thats it thats 1954 years before implant okay very good now go just go to about 1900 go to 1955 years before the implant pc hmhm lrh got that now whatre you doing there there you got it pc ive got pain in my head lrh yeah pc um its right on the crown of my head it goes oh like shape of skull cap lrh uhhuh pc pain type of pain lrh uhhuh pc um somethings trying to show up uh its lrh yeah pc well its like the end of sparkler you know those fireworks lrh attaboy pc we had with sparklers lrh attaboy pc um i just sense that there lrh good good good lets take it at 1955 and half years before the implant 1955 and half years anything going on there pc only lrh all black pc jerking just uh want to jerk my head lrh all right now pc um lrh what pc trying to work out i feel im doing it its im watching something lrh okay pc it is uh something that is taking my attention and iyes its tm watching something moving across the the horizon or something lrh thats it all right fine now uh pc getting rather hot lrh all right lets move back to the first moment you are aware that there is something to look for at 1955 pc well this seems to be an old story of mine but its come up again very strong that ive been blinded and i cant see lrh oh yeah all right all right lets move it to 1957 years before the implant pc getting hotter lrh yeah thats it any visio there pc somethings trying to peek through um um this sparkling thing again um oh and getting somatics across bottom of shoulder blades lrh all right pc and um this that im looking at is um is about an inch long and is glowing white hot and um has uh i seem to have got rid of something i dont know what lrh uhhuh pc and uh has little sparks rays coming off of it not very big um lrh uhhuh pc quite geometrically arranged but theyre not um theyre not stationary do you see theyre coming off its like youd see the fields of magnet field of magnetism or something like that lrh right right all right pc ive got this pain across the chest lrh very good now let check this up and make sure of my exact time here this is 1957 years before the top oppterm of the first implant 1958 1959 1960 1954 1955 1955 and half years thats youre right where youre supposed to be pc good lrh all right 1955 and half years all right thats very important date 1955 and half years all right now lets move back to 1956 years before the top oppterm pc im just being messed up lrh hm pc um ive got head somatic now lrh uhhuh pc and ive got this halos going away again lrh right pc and somebodys out to confuse mister lrh yes sir all right pc and uh what theyve done is theyve got in something and i cant see out and im being moved around and i cant do anything about it im just moved around theres nothing to look at and its pretty well i get fed up with this lrh hm hm pc um nothing to do nothing to nobody to speak to nothing to say nothing to look at lrh uhhuh pc um feeling of getting pains though they give you that to make sure you know youre there lrh uhhuh pc and flushed feeling in my face but i havent got face ive got flush feeling in what lrh all right all right very good now lets move it to 1956 years before the top oppterm of the first implant pc im sorry i didnt hear what you said lrh all right move to 1956 years before the top oppterm of the first implant pc uhhuh now im getting the impression of um capsule ah it doesnt seem to be very big it seems to be the size ofi dont know if you know the sweet we call the licorice comfit but its about an inch long and its got uh its got base its more like an acorn base to it its longer you see its just like the licorice comfit and its got this base to it like an acorn has before its um comes off the tree and then we make little pipe shells out of them lrh uhhuh pc and its um seems to be upside down its at that angle and uh yes its glowing um its milky color milky color but the cap the uh base of it is uh darker color its not glowing there lrh hmhm all right pc now theres some theyre fooling again with this or somebody is because they its changed its color it goes red and im getting the feeling of uh flashing feeling as if its uh eyes lids are going on you know im getting this flashing feeling as if its um like the light coming out of movie camera that has movie projector that hasnt got film in it lrh oh all right pc dont like that lrh i got it all right very good now obviously here something has happened between two thousand years and 1956 years theres something in this this fortyfouryear period pc mmmm lrh have you got any inkling of that thats not good question but i mean just just offhand can you tell anything pc well im little bit uh they im ive had time mucked up here could you just tell where im supposed to be there then lrh all right thats fine ill give youill put you right there lets move to 1958 years before the top oppterm of the first implant pc well now im getting some uh idea of some scenery lrh all right pc uh uh its um land of milk and honey is what i want to say and thats not suggestion because not something suggested to its uh its that sort of land its very light and milk creamy and this damn capsule seems mixed up in this picture somewhere lrh yeah pc um the this is rock formation but it rock formation but its rather beautiful its more like um opal color pale opal color and it looks as good quality um and its uh its almost dazzling but very attractive very very beautiful um this is this is scene from somewhere this is what you see and oh well this is this is something i know this is something like an aerodrome lrh oh yes pc and this i think it was case of perspective with this acorn thing this is this is some form ive never seen anything the likes of this this acorn thing or capsule thing is some form of spacecraft or something and um ithis place im in is like ive got back looking out the back to this but i imagine its rather an enormous pillared terrace to this aerodrome and this thing is stuck out over on the right there lrh mm all right lets move back 1958 years before the top oppterm plus three hours 1958 years pc now im inside lrh attaboy pc um get the impression of they dont make aerodromes like this bloody silly that black marble marble they must have had lot of this material to use up you see i mean we have to oh dear it seems out of place its all theres nobody there though lrh all right pc its an empty hall um more recently ive seen empire state building decor lrh oh yeah pc and all very lush but very aesthetic i think is the word lrh uhhuh pc but um utility purpose to it and yet it must be it seems to be counters but theyre not counters you know what i mean you know table counters lrh uhhuh pc and um black and so on uh its lit by either indirect lighting or sort of phosphorous glow something like that lrh uhhuh pc or its lit through the through the walls or something or the counters there its going bit hazy now lrh all right thats all right thats fine did you invalidate something there you suppress something pc i did i was going to say it was lit through the floor and that would have made liar because id said earlier it was black floor lrh hahaha pc and uh so yes all right now i was trying to get an explanation of that and then i then it went lrh all right do you have somatic there as youre looking at that pc lrh attaboy now were getting somewhere all right now move to its going to be little bit forward heremove to 1958 years two hours pc well i seem to be sitting in the porch of this place um pillars around looking out across ver vast expanse nothing there though lrh uhhuh pc everything is deserted im the only person around here lrh uhhuh pc im well you know i feel ive got the feeling that all right everybody else has died and uh this is all mine now and um so what i mean its good to you lrh oh i see pc uh im just sitting there bit disconsolate about it all im using lot of words i dont usually use by the way lrh all right pc disconsolate isnt word i normally use lrh all right very good now were going to move forward from that point there one hour pc yes lrh what do you see there pc still sitting there man lrh still sitting there pc ye s lrh okay now pc theres nothing to do lrh 1958 years and one half hour from the top oppterm pc well i want to say theres an explosion lrh ye s pc and then and then i think thats silly to say that lrh all right thats fine pc but i dont get an impression of it lrh you get an impression of it now whats the exact moment of that explosion there was thathas it just happened or pc uh lrh is it happening pc it w i can tell you it was just how did i know that it was just about to happen when i said i got the impression of the explosion oh the explosions long way not long way but some way away and im when you said that i was aware of the explosion it the hadnt reached do you see what i mean it lrh thats it pc blast or something lrh thats it now you got that point there pc yeah lrh all right now move to 1958 years and onehalf hourthats where you are is that right pc right lrh now move to 1958 years and one hour before the top oppterm pc well im still sitting there lrh all right theres nothing happened there pc lrh right pc lrh okay well what whats visible from where you are there pc well im just sitting in this porch and theres pillars around and im just sitting there minding own business doing harm to anybody i assure you and um looking out over this what could be well it would be an enormous aerodrome enormous lrh mm pc there theres practically i mean if you can its like the perfectly smooth land hardly any inundations in it at all it just goes almost oh i see is mist it the theres limitation on how far you can see so i cant see any horizon or limit it goes off into mist theres something hidden there lrh all right very good now lets call the moment you are sitting there on the porch just that moment on the porch okay pc right yes lrh all right now rapidly move throughrapidly move through the next six hours pc well very quickly i got the impression of crack bang crash wallow and im tied up ive got this um feeling in arms being pinioned again and im lrh thats boy pc im tied up lrh all right all right now just let check something here has at that moment that you have there now pc yes lrh has this ever happened before pc not that i know of lrh i didlet check it once more on the meter has it ever happened before its dead all right thats fine now return to that moment on the porch pc yes lrh all right very good now this is just for scouting purposes i want you to rapidly scan through the next three days just go ahead now rapidly scan through the next three days and tell where you arrive pc somatic in the chest or rather lower down there darkness uh cant see um well im unconscious theres been um oh i theres this tying up business somehow or other i can get that lrh all right ok pc i get the feeling ive been tied up lrh uhhuh pc and um i just realized what just had little cognition on the unconsciousness here is that this is this is running i know im running period of unconsciousness but yet im aware do you follow lrh all right all right pc this is quite look for lrh all right pc but i in those three days im unconscious lrh all right pc theres nothing going on and theres nothing to see theyve im bottled up lrh all right thats okay pc or you know thats all i can tell you lrh all right thank you now move back to that moment on the porch pc right thats fine lrh all right you got that now pc yes lrh all right now pc ive got something extra there now lrh what have you got pc theres you know they had some funny machinery in those days there is theres big plane out on this aerodrome it is an aerodrome and its got four fuselages lrh uhhm pc four and theyre not its like i dont know what the propulsion is its not jets but theyre its in the shape of that delta i was telling you and these four enormous fuselages one or two on each in the center and they sort of uh raked back lrh uhhuh pc well thats out there lrh all right okay now just move rapidly through the next two hours pc well im im backing off something here lrh uhhm pc um theres an explosion or something happens out there the plane is there and something happens out there thats an explosion of some sort lrh all right pc which theres pretty big bang man lrh uhhuh pc its pretty big explosion im getting the feeling now of stuff going up in the air shower real shower of this stuff coming up lrh uhhuh pc um i was going to say i dont know i got hit on the head with yes i got on hit on the head with something it was shrapnel i should think it was what i we call shrapnel lrh yes yes yes pc bloody funny you know the other day i hit my head in precisely the same spot um sorry ive flipped out for minute lrh oh thats perfectly all right move back to that moment on the porch pc right lrh got that now pc ye s lrh all right very good how are you doing there on that porch pc thats all right lrh well fine now move forward to the first thought that is launched into this is there thought launched into this someplace isanybody say anything pc you cant see lrh oh is that so all right now lets move forward to the moment when that thought is launched there wheres that thought coming from pc well iyou asked ill tell you its come from bit of this this from this explosion stuff lrh thats interesting isnt it pc this whack on the head is is thought lrh umhm umhm are you saywhatwhat do pc flash of light brilliant flash of light lrh now what did you say the thought was pc you cant see lrh thats right now is there contradictory thought to that pc theres flash of bright light i can see bright light lrh oh i see all right very good is there any other contradictory thought there pc uh this isnt true lrh all right pc you dont know what youre doing lrh right pc um you cant think lrh all right any contradictory thoughts to those pc you know uh its vicious one that one lrh all right pc um you dont know where you are you know where you are um ill get you lrh uhhuh pc i get suggested youre free to do as you choose lrh yes yes all right any other thoughts you can pick up there just go ahead and give them to pc um waste not want not lrh all right pc um be careful be very careful um be well its have ago lrh oh yes pc which i dont know it its contrary to be careful you know be careful and then oh come on have go you know lrh all right pc bright lights and darkness lrh uhhuh pc uh dont believe it its true um theres something around here i cant get well theres something around here i cant get all right pc um youve got it there lrh umhm pc uh well there its there it is all right pc there it is lrh uhhuh any contradictory thought to it in any way pc i thought that that seemed to contradict the one i gave before lrh oh yes all right pc getting bit of soma im feeling easier and lighter um aware of an itching on neck lrh all right pc um i dont get any other thoughts at all now lrh all right thats all right thats fine move back to that moment on the porch pc all right lrh all right hows that now pc well weve got the aeroplane there lrh right pc and thats fine lrh all right now is it all right with you to move couple of days earlier than this pc yeah lrh all right move couple of days earlier than this pc well were inside this building and its marble and so on and its counters it seems i think theres some there are some people around this seems like very busy uh wait minute im getting loooong tunnel showing up and and its kind its shaped with arches that come up like that lrh uhhm pc and this goes long way i dont think theres nothing significant about it at all its just the architecture of the place probably runs around its um its passageway around the perimeter of this building uh goes on here this just seems like an air terminal lrh all right pc very lush lrh umhm what are you in this place pc was going to say janitor lrh all right good pc seems that that seems to that i seem to be i was going to say i feel i janitor gives it very good word for it yes look after the place and keep it clean or part of it or something lrh all right fine all right is that perfectly comfortable where you are there pc yep lrh is it all right if we park it there for the moment pc yep lrh all right very good anything else you want to say about your identity or whereabouts of this or anything pc well i dont think i really am janitor lrh all right pc this this i dont belong here really im an interloper of some sort lrh i see pc i mean it could be spy or something of that nature but i dont i wouldnt swear to that but its that sort of thing i dont really belong here lrh uhhuh pc and its strange to and its like yet im spying out the land i want to say but its um you know lrh uhhuh pc its not really i dont really belong to i may be wearing janitors stuff or got the appearance of janitor but thats perhaps an easy thing to do lrh all right very good now this seems to be very good now move forward to present time okay pc all right uhhuh lrh all right how are you doing pc fine lrh all right very good i think we have something resembling our basic incident here pc thank you lrh what do you think about it pc well its all very confusing lrh yes isnt it pc ver confusing lrh let give the exact start of the blast to your auditor and thats 1958 years and one hour we got an orientation there thats good im glad for that all right how do you feel about it pc i feel fine lrh all right very good now is it all right with you if we end the body of the session there pc yes lrh very good end of the body of the session have you made any part of your goals for this session pc well ive worked hard lrh all right pc think weve done all we set out to do havent we lrh get the date pc yes lrh yes block out the early part of the track pc yes lrh all right thats fine any gains you care
