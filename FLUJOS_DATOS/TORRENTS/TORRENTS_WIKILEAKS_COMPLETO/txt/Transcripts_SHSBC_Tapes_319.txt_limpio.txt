comm cycles in auditing shsbc 290 renumbered 319 lecture given on 25 july 1963 checked against the old level 0 cassettes omissions marked with also note one case where the old cassettes were missing paragraph that was restored in the clearsound version this is marked applause all right beautiful sunshiny day here cherish it go out and make facsimile of it this is what audience 25 july 25 july what do you know about that ad 13 saint hill special briefing course the auditing cycle once upon time there was an auditor and he knew he could audit he knew he could audit but pcs they just wouldnt pc worth nickel and the auditor said well ill have to get out of scientology because pcs are good youd be surprised how often this line of logic gets in the road most auditors early on have definite idea that theres tremendous variation in pcs and that some pcs can be audited and some pcs cant be audited and that there are good pcs and bad pcs and all different kinds of pcs well there are worrisome pcs but just to the degree that you cant get them to get tone arm action and some pcs are closer to aquiver on the subject of communication breakdown than others theyre more nervy those things are true but practically pc can stand up against good auditing cycle you know and say well im going on being aberrated for the rest of my days because that makes everybody wrong and makes right the difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle and his own impatience his disabilities in this particular line are last detected by himself in other words hes really the last to find this out if an auditor wants to polish up his auditing i recommend putting piece of session on tape at least piece of session and then listening to that tape back and not listening to the ramifications or the flubs anybody is liable to make duplicativetype flub you know like youve had to change your auditing command you heard make one the other day on that tape i had to change the command because i was getting so much bang out of mainly that i had to put mostly and then i was grooved into saying mainly and my concentration of course was for the pc and i was slipping up and i was occasionally saying mainly again when i was trying to say mostly well youre liable to pick on that kind of thing as being very important error actually it isnt very important whats important is did you complete your auditing cycle see it really isnt how gracefully you completed it but did you complete it now there are two auditing cycles involved this is sequitur to the lecture i gave you last time and those auditing cycles are pardon there are two communication cycles that make up the auditing cycles and those are causedistanceeffect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect and causedistanceeffect with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect those are completely distinct one from the other now the only place they impinge on each other at all and this is the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle is the fact that the auditor on his cycle has calculatingly restimulated something in the pc which is then discharged by the pcs auditing cycle so you see youve kind of got v lying on its side you see youve got the upper v here with the auditor at the top of the wing you see and hes cause distance effect and here at the point of the v you customarily think of that as just one turn actually theres complication right there its what the auditor has said has caused restimulation at that point and then the pc is honor bound to start an auditing cycle to get rid of the restimulation can you see that and that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and thats the entirety of the game theres nothing else esoteric about it at all dont think otherwise than that the auditor is restimulating the pc now some auditing some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc now youll see this on gross level when somebody said i had to stop auditing him because the somatics were so great you see ive actually heard somebody say that seriously and i think to myself the poor pc man at that point of the v where those two come together and where effect turns into cause where the pc is there at that point you have restimulation and then the necessity of answering the question to get rid of the restimulation now if the pc doesnt answer the question the pc does not get rid of the restimulation if he alterises at that point then every restimulation is going to become an alteris and all pcs who are having any trouble alteris at that point of the v here ill draw you picture see lecture chart here is your v and this is cause and this is distance and this is effect now heres your auditor see and heres the pc now at this point here is where you get your restimulation factor and this point is again now causedistance effect see so we get causedistanceeffect see and thats what an auditing cycle in actual fact looks like now there are some little inner cycles there are some little inner cycles that throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle and these little inner cycles are when you get causedistanceeffect and he has answered the question the auditor then says thank you well actually thats shadow and this now starts the shadow back you see you understand see theres little extra communication cycle on here its an extra cycle see and you have this as the acknowledgment cycle so you have here an ack and of course that goes this way you understand and is received over here and thats all there is to it thats little fadeout dont you see well i very often berate you for being not perceptive and not auditing the pc and not seeing whats happening to the pc or whats going on there dont you see so i get this kind of an action here there is another one of these little shadow cycles the pc has received the auditing command and that is such tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out whats going on with the pc are missing that one you say do birds fly and then you fail to perceive that the pc received the auditing command now thats because he doesnt say anything see heres your main cycle causedistanceeffect do birds fly see and the pc says well actually theres another cause in here theres another little tiny one and its right here and its little c see and youre missing that one where youre not perceiving the pc does he receive it you say do birds fly and he says thats all the cause that is emanated at this point by the pc see he just see that would be exaggerating it but you can tell by looking at him that he didnt understand what youd said or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving you see doing something peculiar with this command well its actually whatever that message is that is in response here whatever message that is does ride on this line and an auditor who isnt watching the pc at all then never notices pc who isnt receiving or understanding the auditing command and all of sudden somewhere along the line theres an arc break and then we do assessments and then we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong well they actually neednt ever have gone wrong in the first place what is the pc doing completely aside from answering well that what heisdoing is this other little subcausedistanceeffect line so complete auditing cycle consists of less than six communication cycles if you really want to get it down to the last ramifications but the important ones are four youve got four communication cycles well where are the other two wheres the other two theyre so tiny that you wouldnt really notice them but they are there causedistanceeffect of is the pc ready to receive an auditing command see is he ready to receive an auditing command hes going oh rumrumrumrum rum well that action is actually pc causing isnt it and it has to ride up the line across distance and be received at the auditor and the auditor perceives that the pc is doing something else you say thats not very important you see but it is it is youll find auditors goof that one very often and the pc is going and the auditor says hes nulling let us say and he says catfish cat fur and so forth and the pc is going like this you see see hes not noticed this first one that causes this kind of trouble youve got the item fur on list that youre nulling and you hit the item fur and it goes through actually complete auditing cycle one way or the other because you very often say thank you after youve done so its very jammedup auditing cycle but its there you see and then you go on to catfish on the next one without performing this top cycle is the pc ready to have catfish read to him hes hung up on fur and the only time you ever get into real catastrophe is when the pc is really hung up on fur god when you said fur the pc went ewwww dong and there he is see whats happened where is it ho whats happened see you ever have that happen to you somebody goes over line bong it goes and the next thing you know in the faroff distance you hear catfish cat whiskers and you say whats that wheres this whos what this one becomes terribly important when you run into situation like that you dont really pay too much attention to it but it exists got it it exists and theres another one down here theres another little one down here pc received the acknowledgment and sometimes you violate that sixth one you say thank you and the pc goes like this or that you say thank you and the pc if you were to do oldtime model session endofsession mid ruds at that point youd find out the pc asked you why you never acknowledged him see you have been acknowledging him but youve never seen that he didnt receive the acknowledgment dont you see that perception has another little tiny one in it is has the pc said everything but that actually comes on this line here has the pc answered everything see and it becomes the auditor is watching the pc see and the auditor sees that the pc has not said all he was going to say sometimes get in trouble with pcs that way pc says oh yeah it was sometime in the later days of the roman empire you know hes going to say something else see well this one isnt complete so everything at cause hasnt moved down the line here to you effect and you havent perceived all of the effect so you go into the acknowledgment one before this line has completed itself dont you see well it was in the early days of the roman empire um thank you now we will duhuhuhuh youve seen that happen thats chopping pcs comm see they didnt let this line here which is the fourth communication cycle flow to its complete end and then this one the acknowledgment takes place and of course it cant go through because this the fifth communication cycle is sitting up here on the fourth communication cycle so you say thank you and of course youre right back against and its an inflowing line and they jam right there so there are six if you really want to break it all down there are six communication cycles that make up one auditing cycle six not more than six unless you start running into trouble and when you violate that one of those six when you violate one of those six you of course are going to get into trouble then which causes mishmash of one kind or another now ill go over these again i think you would care to have do that wouldnt you audience yes all right up here we have number one the pc his emanation at that point is simply his appearance and presence thats number one is he ready to have an auditing command given to him see are we all set here for the auditing command thats number one thats communication cycle consistence of cause distance effect your next communication cycle on the thing we had better go into number three is your auditors communication straight down to the pc that is the auditing command and that you normally consider the communication cycle got it thats what you normally say do birds fly thats causedistanceeffect received at the pcs here now he has to take care of and handle the charge at this point and ill cover this in minute hell have to handle the charge at this point which has been restimulated by the auditor and now he originates although we use another designation ive used origination otherwise and so forth he has his answer which is what you normally call it his answer however is cause and thats cause distance and an effect you understand now your next one is an acknowledgment by the auditor which goes over cause distance effect is received by the pc and this is the perception of whether or not the pc receives the acknowledgment got that but you go over this work this thing out youll find out that its very complicated arrangement and you can count on anybody studying this promptly and immediately afterwards not being able to audit at all its something like taking golf pro and say how do you handle your club but this is your main show now what youve considered ordinarily the auditing cycle has been this first v which i drew which is causedistanceeffect with the pc at effect the auditor at cause and then at that v the restimulation takes place and you get causedistanceeffect now im not going to go into the rest of the auditing cycle till i show you the center of this thing okay there is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle another communication cycle and that is at the point of the v see lecture chart heres your pc and heres your auditor and here was your cause your distance effect here is your cause your distance effect and here was c and here was an dont you see causedistanceeffect at the pc thats the auditing command and then youve got causedistanceeffect which is the auditing response well weve opened up the point of the v and here is your little additional one and thats between the pc and himself here see what this is now this actually can be multiple and it depends upon the complications of the mind but because there has been an effect there that causes cause see because you have an effect at this point of impact you get restimulation now that stimulation brings about charge which then causes the pc to emanate to get rid of that charge so you have an internal one here of causedistanceeffect inside the pcs skull well that gives us seven communication cycles now i said this could be multiple this is him talking to him see and you say do birds fly and this causes picture of birds he receives the effect of the picture of birds and he causes query of the picture are they flying and as result the answer comes back of the flapping of the wings and he says yes theyre flying and so with his thought he transmits then the causative action to the auditor now directed at the auditor yes you see how that can be multiple now youre listening to the inside of his skull when youre examining that v down there now if you think that the inside of the skull is more important than the rest of the cycles youre going to be very very disabused this happens to be the least important of all of the actions except when it isnt being done and of course its the hardest to detect when it isnt being done its the hardest to detect pc says yes well now what has the pc said yes to and you sometimes are insufficiently incurious youve said do birds fly and the pc receives this and he gets picture of dinosaur who is eating and perceives that dinosaurs eat and says yes and carrying out the remaining part of the sentence it would be yes dinosaurs eat so this is actually what it sounds like to the auditor do birds fly yes thank you see thats what it sounds like to the auditor thats the big v actually this is what happened do birds fly and the point of the v is haywire we get dubin see picture of dinosaur flies up because thats safer to look at than birds for some reason or more interesting or different its an alteris of some kind or another happens on an automaticity the pc thinks he understands the question now on the basis of do dinosaurs eat and says yes and the auditor says thank you hey wait minute whats going to happen to this pc whats going to happen to the pc and that in essence is this internal perception of line which i showed you on the other side this causedistanceeffect backflash here and so forth happens to include is the pc answering the command i gave him question now all of this is very complicated isnt it and its sufficiently complicated that any auditor ought to sit down with piece of paper and work it all out and not expect to tell them i think there are very few auditors ever really inspected that to the degree that its multiple cycle there are seven or more communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle now its actually weighty enough that standing up here giving you lecture on the subject off the cuff see its very easy to get mixed up on which cycle is which because it requires little bit of concentration you have to actually mock up complete session see complete auditing cycle and pick out every communication cycle in the auditing cycle now communication cycle consists of just cause distance effect with intention and duplication thats all thats communication cycle how many of these are there in one auditing cycle and that would include every nuance of the auditing session so you have to answer with how many principal ones are there because some auditing cycles could contain couple of more the pc says huh you see thats cause that goes over distance effect and the auditor says do birds fly he says i will repeat the auditing question do birds fly and that goes causedistanceeffect but you immediately have added two more cycles and so youve got nine because there was flub see you got that so anything unusual that happens in the session adds to the number of communication cycles to the auditing cycle but theyre still all part of the auditing cycle now weve got repetitive commands as an auditing cycle and thats doing this same cycle over and over and over now ill give you some homework here this is for your own good you draw out all these communication cycles on scrap of paper for yourself just take look at all these things and mock up session like you do this and the pc does that and so forth and all of sudden itll come very straight in your skull how many of these things there are and you wont have couple of them jammed up because actually whats mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is you have confused couple of communication cycles to such degree that you dont differentiate that they exist thats why you sometimes chop pc who is trying to answer the question see you know whether he has answered the question or not well how did you know if he has answered the question or not by esoterics new subject matter esoterics if youre very skilled at esoterics you could probably manage it but there are esoterics involved even if its telepathy its cause distance effect doesnt matter how that communication took place you know whether hes answered the auditing command by communication cycle i dont care if the distance was zero it was permeation from same location in space you were in the pcs head i dont care how you sense this or if you know that ordinarily this pc is green when he answers an auditing command and he turns pale white this particular time you realize hes not answered the auditing command well how did you know that well obviously its communication cycle inside the auditing cycle so ill give you little assignment there you work that thing out how many of these things are there and then expect to drop the mashie and the niblick and hook one into the woods for day or two so thats perfectly all right to do that see i myself occasionally take apart piece of auditing and find myself gapping briefly in session because ive been trying to put together very flexible r2h because r2h the way it was originally released is very skilled activity its too much for thats right its just too confoundedly skilled i know you cant do it impossible its too prone to error good training man if you can do that you can do anything i mean it if you can do that you can do anything but boy by the time you get some pc whos got an insignificant arc break that doesnt have the punch of an engram or anything like that behind it and youre trying to date that confounded thing on meter its just smooth as glass and so forth you practically have to arc break the pc again to get the meter to read terrific training but inherent in that process inherent in that process there are great many processes which go pretty well south and which will actually practically go one shot to ot see its masked however in the exact mechanics that youre handling i found out that you have to use ten minimum of ten steps to get the terrific therapeutic result of which its capable at least ten steps in fact i got one version of it on the drawing table right now which ive been working with i dont know i think it must have about eighteen separate steps im just trying to milk this thing down for maximum tone arm action minimal error and maximal ease of auditing youre doing training version now it wont be changed go right ahead with it but this is really putting that process up to make it get its most results see and by the way there are only nine levels of assessment in this newest version im working out just nine lines takes care of the lot but thats all progress but im running all this on pc you get the idea its all brandnew and its impossible to audit the original version of it anyway and im handling something that has fifteen steps in it all of which are strange and different and the pc has done something incredible in the session that i havent yet suspected and boy you talk about the mashie and the niblick man you know that golf ball goes straight through the trees hits tree trunk caroms off rock goes straight up into the sky and vanishes forever all right well if youre nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing if thats giving you trouble and if you can get yourself into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it then it should be broken down and analyzed at the time youre auditing something nice and simple thats the time it should be broken down not until you have three woods in your right hand and four irons in your left hand and youre going to putt with the heel of your golf shoe see i mean this is not the time to practice this auditing cycle so you go ahead and break it down ive given you general pattern for an auditing cycle maybe in working it over you can find couple of extra communication cycles in the thing but theyre all there and if you made somebody go through each one painstakingly and painfully you would find out where his auditing cycle was jammed up and it isnt necessarily jammed up on his ability to say thank you it may very well be jammed up in another quarter got that now theres completely different auditing cycle inside the same pattern just wanted to make you comfortable and make you feel relaxed lets work this one out see lecture chart heres the pc this pc he gonna originate this has got nothing to do with the auditing cycle scrub that other one this now has nothing to do with it the only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles that they have in common but this is brandnew this is the bolt from mars it comes out of the blue and an auditor who is already concentrating hes auditing you know there are people they used to read theyd move their lips while they read you know and everybody would make lot of fun of them you know for you know well an auditor whos handling his communication cycles and his main auditing cycle on lipmoving level see hes brandnew at this sort of thing the pc says something see that is not germane to what the auditor is saying or doing and there is just well just trucks go over the cliff jet ships crash see all goes to hell man so you actually have to be alert for this thing happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen any time and just go into the drill that handles it and dont get it confused with the drill which you have as an auditing cycle and consider it as its own drill its its own drill you shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected and by the way this handles such thing as the pc originates by throwing down the cans thats still an origin see that had nothing to do with the auditing cycle the auditing cycle went to pieces maybe and this cycle came in well the other auditing cycle cant complete because this cycle is now here well that doesnt mean that this cycle has precedence or dominance but this cycle can start and take place and have to be finished off before the other one can resume so this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause and distance and effect and heres your auditor the pc causes something now your auditor has to originate and your v is inverted now lets investigate here lets investigate that point lets expand the point just as we did in the auditing cycle whats this going to be mad spate of question marks or rockets flying off at oblique angles or whats going to happen at this point well dankly you cant put machine at that point you cant put machine action at that point because this thing has to be understood has to be understood so to the degree that it is hard to understand you have causedistanceeffect causedistanceeffect you understand this is the auditor trying to clarify this thing and every time he asks question hes got new communication cycle well the trick that happens at the open v must not be such as to merely get the original line causedistanceeffect repeating itself you mustnt have the pc continuing to repeat that line because the pc is now going to go frantic because he cant get off of that line hes stuck in time and it really upsets him so the auditor when this v is expanded here has to be able to understand what the devil the pc is talking about now theres really substitute for simply trying to understand it the pc all of sudden says but the roman empire didnt have any legs tell little more about that please thats good response and the pc immediately goes off into can gesticulations like mad and explains how because of north africa being in its situation you see egypt being in its situation and that sort of thing the roman empire didnt run on legs it didnt run on legs at all it ran on rivers were now getting in deeper all right good enough good enough i hear what youre saying now give little more dope on this so i can get good grasp of it oh and the pc will go on and hell expostulate and understand it and hell understand it better through telling you and all of sudden youll find out that hes telling you it didnt have any legs and it didnt have any legs to stand on that is what he really meant and so forth and hes got it all doped out and all of sudden you see what the hell hes talking about and at that point you can resolve this point at the open v you see and oh thats what the hell hes talking about is the name of that expanded little v oh thats what the hell hes talking about is the name of that causedistanceeffect see and then you say causedistanceeffect thank you how many more lines can you put in there well you have to have another little line up here which is another little causedistanceeffect before that origination takes place so that you dont run into jam and you dont give the auditing command hes originated that hes going to say something he says see whatever it is and thats not the time for you to say do fish swim see you suddenly notice theres flicker across the table and the pc is saying see thats another little communication cycle so its causedistanceeffect and effect at your point is to shut up see and then you actually can have another little one here thats causedistanceeffect of im listening get the idea and then of course theres your extra ones down here when youve said thank you then its your perception of the fact that he has received the thankyou and theres your origin got it audience yeah well the network that this is made out of the building brick out of which all of these things are made are communication cycles thats just cause distance effect with intention and duplication see thats the lot see but when you say duplication when you say this you are carrying then the communication cycle over into the and the r because there must be understanding now this is peculiar there is difference between an auditing cycle and military communication cycle theirs is not to question why theirs is but to do and die is definitely the military attitude toward the whole thing and whereas this too can get into auditing and actually is not disallowed and is sometimes used and not without benefit the guy is not going to touch that wall thou shalt touch that wall you see this kind of an action very often takes place hes not going to give up the withhold well you goddamn well are going to give up the withhold you know bow see that sort of thing is very often better than not doing anything about it there are more adroit ways to do it but this is real crude auditing but thats the only time it gets over into the military cycle now the military cycle is simply cause distance effect compliance and the auditing cycle is cause distance effect understand so there is an and an r at the effect point and therefore there has to be an and an r at the cause point so as to make understand acceptable at the effect point there doesnt have to be but there had better be you see that so theres where and r fit in on the communication cycle where auditing are concerned they are very carefully designed now very syrupy affinity is very often highly detrimental to auditing but too snarly or abrupt an affinity is also detrimental to auditing now lets get back to the fact that the auditing cycle we havent completed talking about the auditing cycle by long ways the auditing cycle you would say then is tr 0 1 2 3 4 and so forth well the auditing cycle has very little to do with tr 0 1 2 3 4 just as such and only as such the trs have to do with the communication cycle and you have to put one all the way together at about tr 5 or tr 6 to take in all of these communication cycles you understand what the lower trs do is teach you to handle one communication cycle see from one side or the other in varying degrees of complication now of course youve got to have tr 0 because all of these things have to do with confront all of them have to do with confront so youd say tr 0 is native to all of them tr 1 well thats an emanation and tr 2 is receipt so of course those just handle what they just handle nothing but the communication cycle do you see that now you can go on and build this up from this point on but you will find that complete auditing cycle would require fulldressparade tr that covered maybe at least six and then you could have another tr that covered it up to nine ten or twelve and you could have another tr that handled an origin through all of its cycles but thats supposed to be right now tr 4 see tr 4 youve always had trouble with tr 4 maybe ive shown you why today look at tr 4 see thats picture of tr 4 the v is the other way around this thing is all upside down you see but that isnt all there is to the and the r in connection with the communication cycle tr 1 how good is somebodys tr 1 well let tell you that the ability to say do fish swim might serve but how about being comprehensible how about being comprehensible enunciatively comprehensible you can understand the syllables how about that we can get over that point but how about giving it an understandable communication now lets look at this in its widest ramifications the rfactor has to be present there so that it can be duplicatable you very often when you leave some auditors loose on making up command or asking something or theres hole in the routine and it doesnt give them those words will do puttogether of the statement to be said to the pc which at the arrival at the pc is incomprehensible and yet an auditor is very often called upon to do this ive noticed this im not being condemnatory of auditors in general but ive noticed here and there when an auditor some auditors are left completely on their own well something like this well get list get list of the stuff hes worried about and you expect them to put together question something like what are you worried about see and you get some entirely different incomprehensible version like what are the worst part of your worries sometimes something like this now thats almost sensible compared to some of them ive seen theyre just absolutely incomprehensible absolutely incomprehensible i dont know how anybody and i have actually seen somebody run level fitted into one of these fivetofifteen command brackets which didnt make any sense at all and suddenly found to my horror that some pc had actually been running on this for hours and hours and hours and every time they arrive at it says i dont have clue what youre talking about at this point and the auditor just says i will repeat the auditing question so theres this factor in this communication cycle that the tr 1 aspect must be 1 enunciated in such way as to arrive in an understandable form but very often when the auditor is formulating something has to be formulated so that it can be duplicated so these two other factors are involved besides simply being at cause is the cause going out with any r in other words can you understand any part of this thing is this an understandable statement do fish someti ill repeat the auditing question do fish somet naturally auditing can proceed you start dropping ss off of everything or get somebody with japanese curve you get somebody doing something that is little bit offbeat in pronunciation somebody from boston lets go worse somebody from maine you ever hear maineiac talk i was up there finding the canadian border the united states government lost it theyd lose their heads you know if you didnt watch them anyway they lost the canadian border and went up and found it again found tree had fallen on it and buried the marker they have little pyramids that look like the washington monument that mark the border it was very necessary because the prohibition agents didnt know where their authority started and ended see it caused terrible things we took the problem off because what we were doing when we were surveying is we would stop the rum runners and tell them we were prohibition agents relieve them of their cargo and we always had lot to drink anyway we solved this problem practically the us government couldve taken lot of leaves from i think most of us on practical solutions to these problems but i spent the most delighted summer trying to learn to speak maineiac gorgeous and the french that had been living up along the st lawrence didnt speak french and they didnt speak english they spoke something else but it was sure interesting got so i could speak the thing you know id talk about baahaaba bar harbor with the best of them but it wouldnt go in an auditing session and very often some pc gets saddled with an auditor that he cant quite comprehend along some corner or another now you should recognize whats out the only thing that is out is the rfactor in the tr 1 and an auditor should actually take great care to keep that one smoothed out if he knows hes doing something weird that the pc cant comprehend it doesnt matter how clumsily he sets it right so long as he sets it right the pc always questions supposing you cant tell the difference between the way he pronounces flue and the way he pronounces six you can imagine these two getting jammed the pc for some reason or other always thinks the auditor is saying five when hes saying six and six when hes saying five what do you thinks going to happen in r3r see so therefore it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible thats where the rfactor comes in be comprehensible not only from standpoint of accent but sense the comprehensibility diction enters into this i can see some university in the future teaching auditing english you see or auditing speech actually itd be big department because youd have to have the translation of all this stuff into german you have translation and then its enunciation in german same factor would apply dont you see the same factor in swedish japanese chinese russian all of this stuff how do you audit these guys you see well all right so youre going to have auditors perhaps from that country but remember they will have the same frailties of pronunciation the following paragraph was cut from the old level zero version but is present in the modern clearsound version probably cut from the old version for reasons of confientiality how about translation of line plots what line plots actually sum up into some of these countries dont have good terminology to follow through on line plot and yet the line plot will only fire on the right terminology dont you see theres lot of stuff to be worked out on this particular factor but theres stuff to be worked out on it right now an auditor who is not comprehended by the pc isnt doing his tr 1 right and therefore the rfactor is very germane to whether the communication cycle can take place at all and if you say do fish you cant do that do you see that nothing happens and communication cycle takes place at all so the rfactor can do complete wipeout interesting isnt it then you have the pc who doesnt want to be audited he doesnt want to be audited at all well how on earth can you start that one going because youve got to have communication cycle before you can even put an rfactor in see thats worse end to he just wont listen to any part of scientology this is not speech defect but actually requires lowerlevel process which gets him to talk about scientology anyhow we used to have one well tell why you shouldnt be audited tricky kind of an approach of this particular character this is all very feasible but this comes under the heading of getting communication cycle started and the auditor is very often confronted by that so there is something which actually is prior to the communication cycle see and that you are very often happy to see exists and when it goes out the window you very often are sitting there with your eyes popped you dont know quite what to do well the thing is you cant get the communication cycle going now very often the rfactor is out wildly or the affinity factor is out the affinity factor is out because the pc is being very misemotional well oddly enough you can do an arc break assessment today and find the bypassed charge and use that to complete the communication cycle which you started and which wouldnt complete because it is the generated charge and that was why i showed you particularly the expanded point of the v what has happened there is inadvertently one way or the other the point of the v has gone awry the auditor somehow or another or the pc somehow or another has restimulated charge which has then not been originated either to the auditor or the pc see an overrestimulation has taken place there its quite easy to do its quite easy though to pick up these days so these arc break assessments is are pilot of completing the communication cycle and getting the auditing cycle going again see how that fits in all right now thats all very well to talk about the auditing cycle and say thats just all there is to the auditing cycle but theres i mentioned moment ago the repetitive auditing cycle this cycle going over and over and over and over and over again is specialized activity theres an auditing cycle of one cycle and then there is the auditing cycle of the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle see thats different thing doing it many times you get your repetitive process and this is where that gets you in trouble there is point where this overandoveragain gets you in trouble you must you absolutely must complete communication all communication cycles of an auditing cycle therefore you must complete an auditing cycle but you must also differentiate the difference between one auditing cycle and the repetitive auditing cycle and why must you generate this difference its because one auditing cycle must be completed and repetitive auditing cycles are very often overdone and dont need to be completed in some cases theres difference ooohh where am i leading you now you will say whats this whats this you mean you dont flatten process yes you always flatten process but some auditor can get so eagerbeaver with his series which is flatten the process see that he forgets why he is flattening the process and that is your dominant cycle is ability regained why are you auditing the person in the first place to do an auditing cycle to do series of auditing cycles known as repetitive cycles so that you can get flattened process now you say well youre doing that to flatten the tone arm action thats right there with repetitive auditing cycle that belongs right there with repetitive auditing cycle dont you see there is something that dominates all of this theres greater domination ill show you what these points are this will intrigue you i dont think perhaps many of you have ever looked at this before see lecture chart heres your big cycle which is major cycle see thats major auditing cycle and its proper name is ability regained i can see some of you now youre auditing engrams like mad and you hit this key engram and you hit the thing and you all of sudden got an ot on your hands and the fellow gets up and stretches and that sort of thing and hes getting all ready to square away and hes wondering what he should do with the body and you know hes all set and youre going on all right what is the duration of this engram well thats just too much dedication to this next cycle see and this you can call the process cycle process auditing cycle this of course is just your single auditing cycle your progress of case is up like this see now if you dont have your single cycle down then of course you cant do repetitive cycle cant do repetitive auditing cycle you cant flatten the process in other words you see now process is flattened by tone arm action out comm lag left or intermediate ability regained pardon or cognition ill draw you picture of these things or ability regained see lecture chart now you understand were going here from the process cycle to this ability regained cycle you understand were going just between those two you understand here that if you cant do single cycle then its certain that youre not going to be very successful in completing any process auditing cycle which is the repetitive cycles and if you cant do this then you certainly are not going to produce the upper one of ability regained see thats obvious but what is flat process cycle you sometimes come cropper on this and dont realize what youre coming up against now three equal commands this is the lousiest one see three equal commands thats smelly but you say the process is flat see safe to leave it well youd better leave it at the cchs otherwise your pc is going to start being unhappy but remember that they must be confidently done or something like that you cant have he screamed three times you see you very often youd be surprised you very often have this question asked of you you have some hpa student sometime saying well but he was angry the same way for three different commands so therefore the process was flat now your next level up here your next level is more interesting level from standpoint of that but its perfectly safe to flatten it on cognition guy gets cognition oh yes see even minor cognition do you understand thats not major cognition thats you know minor cognition he had win hey well what do you know thats why elephants fly you know thats all set hasnt too much to do with the process but you sort of stop the process at that point the pc is not going to suffer you understand that these first two levels that im talking to you about of how do you flatten process are just oh thats awful shabby sort of way to look at the thing but thats just the minimum thats the minimum security now lets get to the real one which is ta flat flat by ta thats your auditing cycles repetitive auditing cycles and you longer have ta action on it here dont you see and up above this and there are two levels of this to make it better is major cognition youll see that sometimes youll see that sometimes that takes precedence you havent got the ta flat but all of sudden he cognites all of the level is flat youre running youll see him go pow pow pow off the meter youve got failure to scream was the level you were running about cats and he says oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we used to mock up these fortymilehigh cats and yeah oh well what the hell yeah and you see the meter blow down and bang and everything goes to hell you try to run this process again he hasnt got any level there left to run in fact continuing the process after one of those things is invalidation of the pc now this is ability regained and that takes precedence over all of these this guy couldnt walk and youre halfway through this and you havent got the ta flat and so forth and he hasnt had any cognition youre thinking about and your processing cycles repetitive cycle and all of sudden the pc says hey what do you know you know and he throws the electrodes down sideways and he gets up and starts walking you know eh yeah i can do it good are you going to flatten the process now you may think im pointing out something ridiculous but you do this quite often you spoil it youve got to know when to cut and run see what i mean what you got coming right up is youre all of sudden going to make an ot and continue to flatten the process now lets look at this then this single cycle you got to have that one down cold and theres doubt about that got to be able to complete that you got to be able to complete it repetitively time after time again and thats for flattening out process and the thing which takes dominance over that of course is you flatten out the process until you run into the ability regained now sometimes you dont run into an ability regained and you go on and flatten the process and have to do another process before you regain the ability dont you see sometimes you have to flatten lot of these before you get up to that sometimes you halfway flatten one and youre suddenly up to it you see but im just talking about auditing cycles repetitive auditing cycles and where theyre aiming toward youre aiming toward always getting this one completed but the only thing that interrupts it in any single cycle is cognition similar to repetitive cycles ability regained single auditing cycle that you are doing runs into cognition what do you do in case like that well you dont spoil the cognition by completing the auditing cycle you can start another auditing cycle if it is necessary to do so to that degree to those modifications these other things must be pushed through to the bitter end all right well ive given you the dope on this i imagine that you find this somewhat intriguing its better look perhaps than we have had at it ive been meaning to get around to it for some time actually and ive been breaking it down myself so that it could be talked about better and youre seeing here bit of gain this isnt something which ive known all the time and so forth and so on but i have been studying this ability regained in relationship to finishing whole series of auditing cycles and then i started breaking down the single auditing cycle in its communication cycles and got it into more communicable form and i think youll find this very useful both in teaching people and in auditing yourself i wish you luck just go on and audit dont try to make guilty by suddenly knocking the ball into the rough because youve lost the grip okay thank you very much
