currently website dedicated to this program considerations for congress dod and individual military service support programs provide focal point for disabled service members and their families to resolve pay and promotion problems receive assistance through the medical evaluation and retirement process and aid in the seamless transition to the department of veterans affairs the fy2006 national defense authorization act further requires dod to prescribe comprehensive policies and procedures for these programs that will be uniform across the services to the extent practicable although each program appears successful there may be some aspects of these programs that could benefit from further refinement 1 guidance these support programs appear to be reflection of the genuine concern by civilian and military leaders who place high priority on caring for wounded military personnel however these programs were established independently by different authorities and at different times during 2004 and 2005 there is dodcoordinated directive or instruction that established complementary service roles delineated responsibilities set eligibility criteria or mandated standardized metrics for program evaluation this lack of coordinated guidance could result in inefficient or inequitable care among the various services 2 eligibility dod and each of the services established their own program eligibility criteria so there is little consistency across the programs for example dods msi program will assist anyone who contacts them while the army is relatively rigid and requires participants to be classified as special category and hold 30 army disability rating to be eligible potential duplication of effort also exists because the dod program will assist any service member while the other programs are service specific crs6 3 metrics standardized program metrics to measure effectiveness have not been established across all programs but there has been an effort to establish databases this may make it difficult to identify strengths weaknesses and potential new directions as these programs mature and become permanent the fy2006 national defense authorization act ndaa requires the secretary of defense by june 1 2006 to prescribe comprehensive policy on the provision of assistance to members of the armed forces who incur severe wounds or injuries in the line of duty to the extent practicable these procedures and standards should be uniform across the services and integrated into service regulations by september 1 20067 while not required by the ndaa dod might report to congress on its efforts to implement this legislation at the time this report was updated dod had not finalized the submitted the required comprehensive policy
