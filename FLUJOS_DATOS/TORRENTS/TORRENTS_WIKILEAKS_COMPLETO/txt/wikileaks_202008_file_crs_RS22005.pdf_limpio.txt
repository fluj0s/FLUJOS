its roots in early english law it is reminiscent of three early english procedures deodands forfeiture of estate or common law forfeiture and statutory or commercial forfeiture at early common law the object that caused the death of human beingthe ox that gored the knife that stabbed or the cart that crushedwas confiscated as deodand coroners inquests and grand juries bound with the duty to determine the cause of death were obligated to identify the offending object and determine its value as well the crown distributed the proceeds realized from the confiscation of the animal or deadly object for religious and charitable purposes in the name of the deceased although deodands were not unknown in the american colonies they appear to have fallen into disuse or been abolished by the time of the american revolution or shortly thereafter in spite of their limited use in this country deodands and the practice of treating the offending animal or object as the defendant have frequently been cited to illustrate the characteristics of modern civil forfeiture forfeiture of estate or common law forfeiture unlike deodands focused solely on human offender at common law anyone convicted and attained for treason or felony forfeited all his lands and personal property attainder the judicial declaration of civil death occurred as consequence of the pronouncement of final sentence for treason or felony in colonial america common law forfeitures were rare after the revolution the constitution restricted the use of common law forfeiture in cases of treason and congress restricted its use by statute in the case of other crimes the third antecedent of modern forfeiture statutory or commercial forfeiture figured prominently in cases in admiralty and on the revenue side of the exchequer in precolonial england it was used fairly extensively against smuggling and other revenue evasion schemes in the american colonies and has been used ever since in most instances the statutes have called for in rem confiscation proceedings in which as with deodands the offending object is the defendant occasionally they have established in personam procedures where confiscation occurs as the result of the conviction of the owner of the property although contemporary american forfeiture law owes much to the law of deodands and the law of forfeiture of estate it is clearly descendant of english statutory or commercial forfeiture g18g155g152g153g142g155g157g162g561g138g151g141g561g22g155g146g144g144g142g155g561g5g155g146g150g142g156g561 modern forfeiture is creature of statute while there are some common themes and general patterns concerning the crimes that trigger forfeiture the property subject to confiscation and the procedures associated with forfeiture the federal forfeiture statutes are matters of legislative choice and can vary greatly virtually every kind of property real or personal tangible or intangible may be subject to confiscation under the appropriate circumstances the laws that call for the confiscation of contraband per property whose very possession has been outlawed are the most prevalent property particularly vehicles used to facilitate the commission of crime and without which violation would be less likely is also frequently subject to confiscation in some instances congress has authorized the confiscation of the direct and indirect proceeds of illegal activities and of substitute assets when the property normally subject to confiscation under particular statute has become unavailable traditionally the crimes that triggered forfeiture were those which threatened the governments revenue interest eg smuggling tax evasion hunting or fishing without license or those crimes which because of their perceived threat to public health or morals might historically have been considered public nuisances subject to abatement eg gambling or dealing in obscene material or illicit drug use beginning with the racketeering statutes number of jurisdictions have created third category adding some of the kinds of crimes which involve substantial economic gain for the defendant even if not at the expense of government revenues but which may greatly enhance government revenues eg racketeering and money laundering the trend is most obvious in the civil asset forfeiture reform act

which money laundering or rico prosecution might be based following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 congress authorized the confiscation of another type of crimerelated property property owned by certain terrorists regardless of whether property is traceable used to facilitate or connected in any other way to any practical crime

criminal forfeitures according to the nature of the judicial procedure which ends in confiscation or administrative forfeitures if confiscation occurs without judicial proceedings civil forfeiture is ordinarily the product of civil in rem proceeding in which the property is treated as the offender within the confines of due process and the language of the applicable statutes the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant it is enough that the property was involved in violation to which forfeiture attaches in the manner in which statute demands criminal forfeiture proceedings on the other hand are in personam proceedings and confiscation is only possible upon the conviction of the owner of the property and only to the extent of defendants interest in the property as general rule since the proceedings are in rem actual or constructive possession of the property by the court is necessary first step in any civil confiscation proceeding because realty cannot ordinarily be seized until after the property owner has been given an opportunity for hearing the procedure differs slightly in the case of real property where the seizure of the property causes an undue hardship cafra affords an owner the opportunity to petition the court for release of the property pending the completion of forfeiture proceedings and it affords the government the opportunity to petition for restraining or protective order to preserve the property pending the completion of forfeiture proceedings in the interests of expediency and judicial economy congress has sometimes authorized the use of administrative forfeiture as the first step after seizure in uncontested cases the procedure requires that those with an interest in the property be notified and given an opportunity to request judicial forfeiture proceedings when administrative forfeiture is unavailable or when claimant has successfully sought judicial proceedings or when the government has elected not to proceed administratively the government may seek to secure declaration of forfeiture by filing either complaint or libel against the property in money laundering and other civil forfeitures governed by the cafra the government must establish that the property is subject to confiscation by preponderance of the evidence in cases such as those arising under the customs laws and cases filed before the effective date of the cafra amendments the government must establish probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture if the government overcome s this initial obstacle the burden shifts to the claimant who must establish standing and by preponderance of the evidence that his or her interest in the property is not subject to declaration of forfeiture claimant may successfully challenge confiscation on several grounds he or she may be able to show that the predicate criminal offense did not occur or that his or he r property lacks the statutorily required nexus to the crime claimants innocence or even acquittal only bars civil forfeiture to the extent that statute permits or due process requires for most civil forfeitures other than those arising under the tax or customs laws cafra established tw innocent owner defensesone for claimants with an interest in the property at the time the forfeituretriggering offense occurred and the other for claimants with an interest acquired after the forfeituretriggering offense occurred the first is

being criminally used or who did all that could be reasonably expected of them to prevent criminal use of their property the second is for good faith purchasers who did not know of the taint on the property at the time they acquired their interest where the court determines that the property is not subject to forfeiture it must be released to its owner assuming the property can be lawfully possessed by its owner regardless of the statutory procedure initially invoked prevailing claimants may be entitled to compensation for damages to the property incurred while in federal custody attorneys fees postjudgment interest and in some instances prejudgment interest where the property is declared forfeited its disposal is matter of statute the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury enjoy wide latitude to transfer confiscated property to state local and foreign law enforcemen t agencies to the extent of their participation of in the case although both must be assured that the transfers will encourage law enforcement cooperation at one time this equitable sharing transfer authority could not be used unless the attorney general was convinced that confiscated property was not so transferred to circumvent any requirement of state law that prohibits forfeiture or limits use or disposition of property forfeited to state or local agencies the restriction addressed sometimes controversial adoptive forfeitures adoptive forfeiture occurs when property is forfeitable under federal law and the department of justice adopts for processing under federal law forfeiture case brought to it by state or local law enforcement officials and in which the united states is not otherwise involved federal adoption is sometimes attractive because of the speed afforded by federal administrative forfeiture it may also be attractive because forfeiture would be impossible or more difficult under state law or because law enforcement agencies would not share as extensively in the bounty of successful forfeiture under state law the circumvention restriction is longer in effect but the treasury and justice departments insist that state and local law enforcement agencies indicate the law enforcement purposes to which the transferred property is to be devoted and that the transfer will increase and not supplant law enforcement resources

judicial proceedings are required this is particular true since there now exists bridge statute 28 usc 2461c which permits confiscation using its criminal forfeiture procedure as an alternative whenever ci vil forfeiture is authorized criminal forfeiture is consequence of conviction the indictment or information upon which the conviction is based must list the property which the government asserts is subject to confiscation and the defendant is entitled to jury finding of the necessary connection between the crime of conviction and the property to be confiscated since the courts jurisdiction does not depend upon initial control of the res it need not be seized before forfeiture is declared the court however in some instances may restrain the use or transfer of property the government contends is subject to confiscation the defenses to criminal forfeiture differ somewhat from those available in cases of civil forfeiture for example since conviction is prerequisite to confiscation acquittal will bar forfeiture thirdparty interests are less likely to be cut off by virtue of the propertys proximity to criminal conduct simply because only the defendants interest in the property is subject to confiscation and because bona fide purchaser exceptions are more common bona fide purchaser exceptions protect good faith purchaser who acquired the property after

usually declares forfeited property described in the indictment and found subject to confiscation by the jury or the trier of fact those with claims to the property other than the defendant are then entitled to notice and judicial hearing on their claims g6g146g156g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g8g152g155g143g142g146g157g142g141g561g3g156g156g142g157g156g561 disposal of forfeited property is matter of statute as noted earlier the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury enjoy considerable discretion to transfer confiscated property to state local and foreign law enforcement agencies in most instances federal law requires that confiscated cash or the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property which remain after any transfers or other statutorily authorized disposition be deposited in special fund the department of justice asset forfeiture fund and the department of the treasury forfeiture fund first created in 1984 constitute such statutory depositories together they receive close to three quarters of billion dollars per year and are available to pay forfeiture related expenses rewards to informants in illicit drug cases rewards to in formants in forfeiture cases liens and mortgages against forfeited property remission and mitigation in forfeiture cases to equip cars boats and planes for law enforcement purposes to purchase evidence of money laundering or of federal drug crimes to pay state and local real estate taxes on forfeited property to pay overtime travel training and the like

required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted punitive forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause if it is grossl disproportionate to the gravity of defendants offense forfeitures that congress has designated as remedial civil sanctions do not implicate double jeopardy concerns unless the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate congress intention to establish civil remedial mechanism the sixth amendment assures the accused in criminal proceedings the right to jury trial and to the assistance of counsel the right to the assistance of counsel in criminal cases however does not prevent the government from confiscating fees paid to counsel or upon probable cause showing from obtaining restraining order to fr eeze assets preventing the payment of attorneys fees the amendment is by its terms only applicable in all criminal prosecutions and consequently there is constitutionally required right to assistance of counsel in civil forfeiture cases the supreme courts opinion to the effect that ther is right to jury trial on disputed factual issues in criminal forfeiture rests on somewhat battered foundation the fact that criminal forfeiture is penalty within the prescribed statutory maximum for the triggering offense and that rule 322 of the federal rules of criminal procedure affords an expanded jury determination right however would seem to shield federal criminal forfeiture procedures from sixth amendment challenge although the implications for the preponderance standard of proof might appear slightly more ominous the federal appellate courts have either explicitly or implicitly accepted the standard in criminal forfeiture cases thus far due process objections can come in such multitude of variations that general statements are hazardous more specifically due process demands that those with an interest in the property the

hearing to contest in some instances due process permits the initiation of forfeiture proceedings by seizing the personal property in question without first giving the property owner either notice or the prior opportunity of hearing to contest the seizure and confiscation but absent exigent circumstances the owner is entitled to the opportunity for preseizure hearing in the case of real property where there is real danger that the property will be spirited away in order to frustrate efforts to secure in rem jurisdiction over it due process at some point will also require pretrial hearing on the forfeitability of property made subject to postseizure pretrial restraining order to designed to prevent dissipation while due process clearly limits at some point th circumstances under which the property of an innocent owner may be confiscated the court has declined the opportunity to broadly assert that due process uniformly precludes confiscation of the property of an innocent owner any delay between seizure and hearing offends due process only when it fails to meet the test applied in speedy trial cases is the delay unreasonable given the length of delay the reasons for the delay the claimants assertion of his or her rights and prejudice to the claimant in other challenges the lower federal courts have found that due process permits the procedure of shifting the burden of proof to forfeiture claimant after the governme nt has shown probable cause and allows use of probable cause standard in civil forfeitures postponement of the determination of third party interests in criminal forfeiture cases until after tr ial in the main and fugitive disentitlement under 28 usc 2466 section 3 of article iii of the united states constitution does not appear to threaten most contemporary forfeiture statutes it provides in part that attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted the section on its face seems to restrict forfeiture only in treason cases but at least one court has suggested broader scope even if article iii when read in conjunction with the due process clause reaches not only treason but all crimes its prohibitions run only to forfeiture of estate they do not address statutory forfeitures of the type generally found in state and federal law the critical distinction between forfeiture of estate and statutory forfeiture is that in the first all of the defendants property related or unrelated to the offense and acquired before during or after the crime is confiscated in the second confiscation is only possible if the property is related to the criminal conduct in the manner defined by the statute
