qualifying child for the personal exemption which are the same as the pre2005 rules for the earned income credit if one taxpayer is the parent the parent claims the qualifying httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22016 child if both taxpayers are parents the parent the child lived with longest during the tax year claims the child if the child lived with both parents for the same amount

the earned income credit taxpayer must have qualifying child as defined by the personal exemption the qualifying child cannot be married and the principal place of abode when the child lives with the parent to be qualifying child for the personal exemption must be the united states however an exception to the definition exists in that the qualifying child may provide more than onehalf of his or her own support in addition an individual is the qualifying child of the custodial parent as the determination for the earned income credit disregards waiver of the personal exemption and child tax credit to noncustodial parent child tax credit to be eligible for the child tax credit taxpayer must have qualifying child as defined for the personal exemption who is under age 17 and is resident of the united states as under pre2005 rules waiver transfer of the personal exemption for qualifying child to noncustodial parent also is waiver of any potential child tax credit associated with the

household filing status an unmarried taxpayer must maintain household that has as member of the household qualifying child as defined for the personal exemption like the earned income credit an individual is the qualifying child of the custodial parent as the determination for head of household filing status disregards the waiver of the personal exemption and child tax credit to noncustodial

physically or mentally incapable of taking care of themself who has lived with the taxpayer for more than onehalf of the tax year the new rules remove the pre 2005 requirement for the dependent care tax credit that the taxpayer maintain household in which the qualifying individual lives other tax provisions in addition to the changes for the above tax provisions used by families technical amendments were made to number of tax provisions to conform them to the new definitions in the personal exemption the joint committee on taxation estimated that the changes made by the new law for more uniform definition of child will result in revenue loss of 942 million over the fy2005fy2009 period1 current issues on february 6 2006 the national association of enrolled agents sent letter to the commissioner of the internal revenue service expressing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22016 concern about ambiguities and uncertainties with respect to the definition of child in certain cases2 the letter outlined through examples specific taxpayer circumstances in which literal interpretation of the new definition could lead to unintended consequences that may be contrary to the intent of the law for the new definition of child one of the examples cited is that of married couple with two children aged 14 and 22 living at home with an adjusted gross income agi of 400000 on their joint tax return the couples 22yearold child is not student and has 15000 year in wage income the older child can not be claimed as dependent by the couple under prior law and must file his own tax return under prior law the minor child 14 would be claimed as dependent by the couple on their joint tax return but because of the couples agi level the personal exemption for the child would be phased out they would be receive tax benefit and the child tax credit would not be available to them the association notes that under current law with the new definition the minor child 14 could be the qualifying child of the older child 22 enabling the older child to claim personal exemption for the minor child the child credit and earned income credit resulting in significant tax refund the administration as part of its fy2007 budget proposed two clarifications to the definition of child 1 that taxpayer could not be the qualifying child of another individual if the taxpayer is older than the individual and 2 if parent resides with child for over half of the tax year only the parent would claim the child as qualifying child the administration estimates that these clarifications would raise 11 billion over the fy2007fy2011 period 1 joint committee on taxation estimated revenue effects of the conference agreement for hr 1308 the working families tax relief act of 2004 jcx8004 sept 2004 2 national
