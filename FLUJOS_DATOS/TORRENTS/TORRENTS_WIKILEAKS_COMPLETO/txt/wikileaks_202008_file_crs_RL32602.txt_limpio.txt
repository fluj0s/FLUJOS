adolfo j fernandez national defense fellow foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress military role in space control primer summary this report reviews department of defense dod military space control efforts and related policy and resources since the 1991 gulf war us military forces have become increasingly reliant on space resources for communications intelligence imagery weather warning navigation and timing asserting that us space assets have become an integral part of todays warfare the department of defense dod has begun to emphasize the importance of protecting these resources although us military space systems have been relatively unchallenged military leaders anticipate increasing threats to these systems because they provide significant military advantage dod defines space control as the combat combat support and combat service support operations to ensure freedom of action in space for the united states and its allies and when directed deny an adversary freedom of action in space dod space control initiatives are embryonic and mostly represent legacy resources used for space surveillance the dod budget however identifies early stages of developing counterspace measures military space control efforts like many other facets of military space are in significant phase of transition the ability of the united states to harness space power may be critical to victory on the battlefield especially as information dominance becomes more pervasive in the ensuing evolution of network centric warfare

introduction the secretary of defense asserts that space is the ultimate high ground2 since the 1991 gulf war us military forces have become increasingly reliant on space resources for communications intelligence imagery weather forecasting warning navigation and timing spacebased services facilitate rapid collection transmission and dissemination of information to us forces and decision makers consequently some say space is becoming an area the united states may have to protect space control is one of four national security space mission areas defined in the current national space policy 19963 dod defines space control as the combat combat support and combat service support operations to ensure freedom of action in space for the united states and its allies and when directed deny an adversary freedom of action in space4 space control describes the means to ensure us forces have unhampered access to space and spacebased services and to deny an enemy the advantages of space capabilities counterspace operations support the space control mission and consist of those operations conducted to attain and maintain desired degree of space superiority by allowing friendly forces to exploit space capabilities while negating an adversarys ability to do the same5 congress might be faced with decisions involving the increased projection of military operations into space the

information on march 25 2004 during his testimony to the senate subcommittee on strategic forces retired vice admiral arthur k cebrowski director of force transformation office of the secretary of defense stated transformation across the force is happening much faster than we expected when we announced the journey just 28 months ago not just concept and not just action in the future transformation is happening today its happening due in large part to information and power derived from our vital space capabilities7 beginning with the persian gulf war in 1991 there has been steady infusion of space capabilities into virtually all aspects of us military operations navigation communications meteorology missile warning and targeting information management8 the most prominent example includes the use of global positioning system gpsguided precision munitions in 1999 gpsguided weapons demonstrated allweather precision strike capability during operation allied force in serbia and in kosovo during the afghanistan conflict in 2001 precision munitions comprised twothirds of all the bombs dropped during the first two months of the war of those precision munitions 64 percent were gpsguided joint direct attack munitions9 military reliance on space also extends to commercial and civil space resources according to army general joseph cosumano commander of us army

us military dependence on space systems may continue to outpace dod budget and production capability the analysis concludes that dod may have to continue looking to the commercial and civil sectors to satisfy portion of its space service requirements11 vulnerability of us military space resources space systems consist of three segments the space segment containing satellites the ground segment that controls the system operations and the electromagnetic links that connect the space segment to the ground segment the most significant threats to space systems may be the physical electronic and information warfare threats faced by the personnel facilities and equipment comprising the ground segment and the links to and from the space segment however the possibility also exists for the emergence of threats to us spacebased satellite systems12 in january 2001 the report of the commission to assess united states national security space management and organization the commission is also called the space commission made statement about the susceptibility of us space systems the report states the relative dependence of the us on space makes its space systems potentially attractive targets many foreign nations and nonstate entities are pursuing spacerelated activities those hostile to the us possess or can acquire on the global market the means to deny disrupt or destroy us space systems by attacking satellites in space communications links to and from the ground or ground stations that command the satellites and process their dataan attack on elements of us space

options may help mitigate possible threats broadbased space control concepts include offensive and nonoffensive means offensive methods may include directed energy weapons dew which include radio frequency weapons lasers and particle beam weapons14 offensive weapons may also include kinetic energy weapons kew which would use the kinetic energy of direct impact or pass close enough to target for shrapnel from an exploding device to destroy it15 nonoffensive techniques include passive defense methods that protect satellite from attack or minimize the effects of an attack such as hardening shielding or redundancy eg fielding many satellites so that the loss of one is minimized other nonoffensive methods may include active defensive means which avoid or minimize the impact of attack by maneuvering space vehicle to avoid damage or rapidly reconstituting system if it has been damaged during an attack16 refer to appendix1 for descriptions of other space control techniques that may be explored impacts of possible attacks attacks on us space assets military commercial or civil may reduce or eliminate the military effectiveness gained by terrestrial warfighters from space systems tom wilson former space commission staff member states as harmful as the loss or degradation of commercial or civil assets would be an attack on intelligence and military satellites would be even more serious for the nation in time of crisis or conflict17 in threat assessment prepared for the space commission wilson outlines several scenarios of how an attack on us space assets would affect military forces they include18 impairing or eliminating reconnaissance satellites would reduce situational awareness and could lead to military surprise an underestimation of enemy strength and

disrupt troop command and control at all force levels impairing or eliminating weather satellites and earth observation systems would make it more difficult to plan effective military operations impairing or eliminating navigation satellites would make troop movements more difficult aircraft and ship piloting problematic and could render many precisionguided weapon systems ineffective or useless and impairing or eliminating satellites that detect missile launches would degrade us ability to perform missile launch warning missile defense and could increase the psychological impact of an adversarys missile attacks possible threats and key players in future conflicts potential us opponents may possess technologies that will challenge us spacebased capabilities adversaries might attempt to jam satellite uplinks or downlinks this would make commercial systems wideband services and small mobile users most vulnerable19 in the summer of 2003 group of iranians operating in cuba disrupted usbuilt commercial satellite communications transponder carrying broadcast voice of america to the middle east20 this example and the attempted jamming of gps signals by iraqi forces in operation iraqi freedom may suggest that future adversaries are willing and able to attack americas military and commercial space capabilities by this method21 because of trends in technology proliferation globalization of space industries and commercialization of space systems many countries may have the capability to deploy technologies that can impede us space systems and the ground facilities that command them an opponent may exploit electronic countermeasures to disrupt satellite navigation signals or may choose to develop laserlike means to dazzle imagery and sensing systems

related to space activities and report to the nsc deputies committee by february 28 200325 to date the nsc has not made any public recommendations to revise the current policy dod space policy following directly from the 1996 national space policy secretary of defense william s cohen issued department of defense directive dodd 310010 space policy on july 9 1999 before this directive the last major revision of dod space policy was in 1987 memo from secretary cohen which accompanies the dod directive states space is medium like the land sea and air within which military activities shall be conducted to achieve us national security objectives the ability to access and utilize space is vital national interest because many of the activities conducted in the medium are critical to us national security and economic wellbeing26 specifically addressing space control and the defense of the united states secretary cohen stated the capability to control space if directed will contribute to achieving the full dimensional protections battlespace dominance and information superiority necessary for success in military operations27 dodd 310010 establishes dod policy and assigns responsibility for space activities within dod the following are some of the policies that dodd 310010 identifies relating to military space control28 ensuring the freedom of space and protecting us

mission air force doctrine document 22 afdd 22 space operations states the purpose of counterspace operations is to attain and maintain desired degree of space superiority by allowing friendly forces to exploit space capabilities while negating an adversarys ability to do the same29 afdd 22 further defines counterspace operations as consisting of three submissions space situational awareness ssa defensive counterspace dcs and offensive counterspace ocs the ssa mission includes traditional space surveillance reconnaissance of space assets collecting and processing of space intelligence data and the analysis of the space environment defensive counterspace operations serve to safeguard the ability to exploit space by protecting space capabilities from enemy attack or interference offensive counterspace operations preclude an adversary from exploiting space to his advantage30 dod space control initiatives and priorities dod space control initiatives explore mix of key technological capabilities and emphasize the protection of national security interests against known vulnerabilities and credible threats on february 25 2004 in his statement before the house armed services committees subcommittee on strategic forces peter b teets under secretary of the air force described the near and midterm dod space control initiatives and priorities to ensure freedom of action in space dod nearterm initiatives investigate new space surveillance capabilities and ways to integrate them into space systems that enhance space situational awareness dod is investing to improve the ability to detect track and characterize objects in space by upgrading to new hardware on selected radar and optical sensors dod endeavors to modernize the space surveillance network and establish it as the mainstay for space situation awareness dod seeks to integrate improved ssn sensor data with space intelligence and environment data to produce common space picture for military decisionmakers31

representatives subcommittee continued crs9 space control may also involve the use of antisatellite asat weapons to prevent satellite from performing its mission through destroying it or damaging its sensors the army is currently developing kinetic energy antisatellite keasat system using groundlaunched interceptors that would destroy satellite through impact although the program does not have widespread dod support in recent years for example air force officials have expressed concerns about these types of weapons because of collateral damage that could be caused to us and allied satellites from resulting debris dod has not requested funding for keasat in many years but congress added money for it in fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 fy2000 fy2001 and fy2004 the keasat program was initiated in 1989 after the air force discontinued an earlier asat development program in which the interceptor was launched from an f15 aircraft several tests of that asat device were conducted but congressional restrictions on tests against objects in space led the air force to cancel the program in 198832 congressional interest in restricting tests against objects in space has been renewed by the missile defense agencys mdas near field infrared experiment nfire to study exhaust plumes from rockets to assist in the design of sensors for other mda systems nfire is designed to carry one sensor on the main nfire spacecraft and second sensor on kinetic kill vehicle kkv that would be ejected from the main spacecraft to make very close observations of rockets plume mdas fy2005 budget documentation noted that the kkv might impact the rocket stimulating debate over whether it was type of asat or spacebased weapons test dod reportedly is close to deciding to delete that part of the mission to assuage congressional concerns33 under secretary teets described dod near to midterm plans to deploy two new spacebased surveillance and characterization sensors space based space surveillance sbss and orbital deep space imager odsi sbss would be constellation of optical sensing satellites in lowearth orbit designed to provide timely and accurate information on satellite locations the first sbss satellite is planned to launch in fy2007 once operational the system is to improve us ability to detect deepspace objects by 80 percent over the current system the second new

development is the rapid attack identification detection and reporting system raidrs under secretary teets described raidrs to have the ability to detect radio frequency interference on communication satellites and the capacity to locate the attacking source on earth the system will also detect laser attacks attempting to disrupt missilewarning satellites such as the defense satellite program dsp

its transformation plan appendix 1 space control methods hardening hardening components on satellite protects its receivers amplifiers and sensors from directedenergy weapons using filters and optical shutters prevents laser or microwave weapons from causing harm hardening satellite makes it increasingly difficult to harm it41 shielding this technique keeps electromagnetic pulses emp generated by nuclear detonations or weapons systems from penetrating satellite cavities and severely damaging satellite metal shielding and resistant paint coats on the internal surfaces enhance survivability42 circuit protection another important protection strategy is the use of circumvention circuits in satellite design during an emp event protective circuits switch off nonessential components to prevent possible damage by secondary nuclear or emp attacks43 denial and deception denial prevents an adversary from gaining information about space systems by reducing the electrooptical and electromagnetic signature of satellites using thermal blankets and energyabsorbing materials on satellites makes optical and heat emissions harder to detect by enemy sensors or radars deception is another technique this method misleads an adversary into believing false information about space system the use of decoy satellites is an example of how deception could force an enemy to waste resources on false targets or withhold fire for fear that it is shooting at decoy44 39 ibid p c12 40 ibid 41 baines p 4041 42 ibid 43 ibid 44 ibid p 3940 crs12 maneuvering satellites can maneuver to evade enemy surveillance or targeting however most satellites do not carry fuel for this purpose satellite can longer perform its mission once its limited supply of propellant is gone using maneuvers to avoid threats would significantly reduce the useful life of satellite developing an onorbit refueling capability in the future could present new opportunities to consider satellite maneuvers as cost effective space control method45 redundancy and reconstitution to increase survivability most satellites have redundant subsystem packages to prevent singlepoint failures and most system constellations have multiple satellites to provide systemlevel redundancy launchondemand lod capability is another option that could quickly regenerate constellation after an attack46 dispersion of space systems because most satellite orbits are predictable scattering them into various orbital altitudes and positions offers added protection dispersion also includes the building of networks of many smaller satellites or microsatellites the microsats would operate collectively to perform the services of larger and more vulnerable satellites and result in more survivable system47 ground segment security ground control stations provide critical links used to operate space systems since terrestrial targets are much easier to destroy than targets in space the ground control segment is probably the most vulnerable protecting the ground segment not only includes the hardening of facilities to survive kinetic weapons or emp attack but also physical personnel and information security measures to protect against cyber intrusions or electronic attacks firewalls and encryption techniques may be critical as well in addition mobile ground stations could be use to evade detection and attack or assume control if primary facility were destroyed48 stealth and cloaking by minimizing energy reflection and maximizing the absorption of energy stealth and cloaking technologies make satellites difficult to detect through use of radar infrared visual or acoustic sensors an option in the future may 45 ibid p 4142 46 ibid p 43 47 ibid p 4344 48 ibid p 45 crs13 be to camouflage space vehicle in an adaptive skin that changes molecular characteristics and deflects or absorbs incoming energy49 satellite bodyguards large fleet of satellite bodyguards in orbit could protect vital us space assets spacebased bodyguards would function as network of integrated microsatellites designed to protect other satellites these escorts would detect enemy presence and take actions to negate the threat bodyguard system would likely be costly and require key network components including sensor detection arrays highspeed crosslinking communications and robust resupplying launch capability50 directed energy weapons dew this weapon concept involves projecting intense energy to disable or destroy satellite dews would damage satellite by using lasers focused radio frequencies or particle beams the notion presents several engineering and technological challenges one is trying to solve how to prevent the loss of energy as the beam travels through the atmosphere another challenge is the need to develop highly complex targeting solution to focus beam on target for sufficient time to cause damage51 kinetic energy weapons kew kews generate highvelocity projectiles to destroy target kinetic energy antisatellite asat weapon may be launched from the ground air or space an asat would approach satellite and impact explode or propel shrapnel at the intended target to destroy it space mines employ variation of the kew concept prepositioned near their intended target well before hostilities break out space mine waits in reserve for signal to detonate significant problem with kews is that they could create debris and possibly present danger to other space assets52 49 zielinski robert h worley ii robert m black douglas s henderson scott johnson david c star tekexploiting the final
