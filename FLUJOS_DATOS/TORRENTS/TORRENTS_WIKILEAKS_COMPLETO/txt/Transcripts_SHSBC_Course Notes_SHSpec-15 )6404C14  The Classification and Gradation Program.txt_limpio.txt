6404c14 shspec15 the classification and gradation program the classification program applies to auditors for pcs there is the gradation or levels program such program became necessary as it became evident that one was bringing people up the line from reality to higher levels the levels became necessary to bring the general public up the line on gradient what gave auditors trouble was that pcs didnt know anything about what they were doing or where they were going in the west there is tradition of philosophy in practical life the healing tradition is one of failed help since time immemorial members of the public have had nothing but failed help that is what the member of the public compares us to psychiatry etc so people have tradition of treatment healing improvement ability etc there is tradition of selfbetterment our biggest task is to define scientology to people where there is datum to compare it to gradient and common communication ground so they cant get their wits wrapped around scientology the pc just sits there in the midst of confusion getting processed without knowing what processing is so we have to create not only science but also communication eighty percent of untrained people will vanish because they never got out of earlier practices that they didnt like auditors were losing these pcs because of not getting the pcs educated to know what they were in furthermore the auditor in the field was upset about pcs having to take formal course to get up to class iv so there is compromise the pc must get educated as he gets processes but the training is done by the auditor and the pc must pass training requirements lrh proposes checksheet to go before each grade on which the pc will get checked out before going on to the next level the pc learns definitions he gets an idea that there is something here that aligns with his goals the pc failed in his goals long time ago and is in apathy unless someone else helps him going on up to level iv the pc would have to be trained on clay table this would never have been possible without line plots and goals plots even now the pc needs good training to understand gpms and to be able to follow commands about them whats more when he gets on up the line he wont be completely ignorant ot there are three routes to getting up the line 1 the pc route 2 the coauditor route 3 the classed professional auditor route on the pc route grade is something pc has that compares with the levels of scientology the pc is not welldisciplined lrh says that he has found it hard to audit someone right off the street or even to get him to answer sensible question such person reinterprets it etc this gets straightened out as he goes up the grades each grade has an ability that the pc attains the pcs conquest of the environment is the index of his grade this gives him measure of his advancement the grades are gradient scale of confront of the environment for instance at level iii the pc is not always dwelling on things that happened in the past he has relative freedom from the past there is difference between hurting and worrying about hurting at level iv the pc has stopped trying to make everybody wrong and himself right thus the levels are defined in terms of abilities regained processing improves confront of the environment so does training training gives the pc something to look forward towards instead of providing merely negative gain book can evaluate for pc without the auditor having to an auditor can process pc up to the class that the auditor is trained to the second route is that of the coauditor on this route person isnt classified but receives certificate as coauditor he may not charge for his processing or call himself professional he has been through the training courses but he hasnt been classified the coauditor can get an hca certificate but not an hpa certificate someone who goes on through the academy and gets classed gets the hpa certificate he has been formally trained examined judged competent to audit pcs etc person can coaudit getting auditing in exchange for auditing sooner or later he will either get up to getting professional class vi auditing or he will get on class vi course at central organization and go up that way the professional or classed auditor gets his training gets his classification and now has some selectivity about his coaudit he probably gets audited by another pro he is likely to get more precise processing this way and any errors would be remedied quickly he would probably get up the levels rapidly furthermore pcs can help him get further trained by getting him more pcs there are points in training that are easily overlooked or forgotten matter how much they are emphasized and stressed these get straightened up when auditors come to saint hill the classifications for auditors are stiffened up changing the original issue to this degree someone can go to the academy and get his certificate but when he wants to be classed he has to be good at that level if someone has certificates up to level iv but classifications he would have to get classed up from class i on tough requirement for actual performance all training and all courses depend on 1 having valuable material or data to impart weve got that in scientology 2 the material must be codified in must be in condition in which it can be imparted to others so that it communicates 3 the material must be instructed because the questions that will arise will be individual to the student instruction consists of handling those questions by showing where the correct answer is the second point is being handled now to clarify codify and simplify the available material down to the necessary amount there are only about thirty operations that cover all of auditing at all levels instruction is the most random area since different levels of application and understanding may be demanded of the person being checked out on certain piece of data education should not be merely to keep someone occupied
