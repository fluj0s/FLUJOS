chinese government has strongly criticized us announcements that it wil l develop or assist in deploying missile defense systems involving cooperation with us allies in east asia and reports of such possibl us cooperation with taiwan for those in the united states the us plans have many pe rceived disadvantages and advantages1 the latter include notably providing degrees of protection for the united states and its allies against ballistic missile attack many in china believe that proposed us development and deployment f ballistic missile defenses at home and in east asia pose potentiall serious complications for chinas ability to use its nuclear weapons to deter possible us pressure and aggression and to use chinese ballistic missile capability to exert leverage over japan taiwan and others in east asia beijings options includ using political means to curb us efforts or to seek reassurances from the united states military options include increasing the number of chinese missiles and warheads an d using force to intimidate taiwan from developing viable missile defense system though the us government may attempt to reassure china that it is not the target of the new systems initial chinese reactions suggest that the united states may face serious difficulties with china if on balance it sees us inter ests well served by current plans and goes ahead with them and especially if it supports ballistic missile defense efforts i n taiwan this report will be updated periodically introduction the chinese government has strongly criticized us announcements that it wil

chinese official s increased public criticism with the forei gn minister and the premier denouncing the plans7 chinese nuclear and ballistic missile forces status and intentions8 since the mid19 50s china has made strong efforts within its limited economic and technical capabilities to develop modest nuclear force and related delivery systems i n order to help deter superpower or regional eg indian conflict and intimidation secure strategic retaliatory capability in case of nuclear war and demonstrate chinas international power chinas few dozen nuclearcapable bombers are too slow and technically backward to penetrate modern air defenses beijing relies for nuclear weapons delivery mainly on its mobile groundbased and nascent seabased ballistic missiles about 100 missiles chinas current mobile missiles landor sea based are not long range and generally would not be addressed by the proposed nmd system they may be blocked by the tm d systems proposed by us advocates about 20 longerrange chinese icbms mainl y9 silobased missile s may be able to overwhelm limited national missile defense system but as static targets those silobased missiles might be vulnerable to attack by n adversary with sufficiently accurate ballistic missiles both russia and the united state s have such missiles china is in t he final stages of developing mobile longrange ballistic missile that would not have this vulnerability against this backdrop many in china believe that the proposed us developmen t and deploy ment of ballistic missile defenses at home and in east asia pose potentiall serious complications for chinas ability to use its nuclear weapons to deter possible us aggression pressure intimidation or other such actions including the possible us military interve ntion against

forces in east asia and us allies and friends in the region among possible negative factors for consideration are beijings possibl reactions to such us actions in general ch inas possible reactions are seen as following two paths one involves possible chinese militarypolitical measures directly related to the us actions the other involves broader chinese international security policy an d relations with the united states militarypolitical measures beijing could choose to wait until the us and its allies and associates actuall develop and deploy defensive systems affecting chinese missile forces chines leaders have seen washington and moscow debate such antiballistic missil systems for long time going back to the 1960s but the results have t substantially jeopardized chinese missile capabilities beijing could endeavor to use arms control initiatives to halt or curb missil defense developments andor deployment in the process china might be prepared to offer c oncessions in other areas eg chinas development of nuclearcapable missiles and proliferation of those missiles or relat ed technology deemed important to the united states and its allies and associates china could seek formal reassurances from the united states that missil defense systems would not be directed at china and that the united states would deploy them in ways that would be seen by beiji ng as not primarily directed against chinese missiles this may be hard to do and could prove to be especially difficult if japan and south korea were to receive tmd systems such deployments

technology delivery systems or ther such sensitive material in unstable areas of keen interest to us policy eg the persian gulf china could pursue military measures to counter missile defenses this coul d involve developing greater number of and more capable missiles using decoy s and socalled penetration aids developing multiple warheads for existing or future chinese missiles increasing the mobility of chinas long est range missiles and other steps beijing may feel compelled to resume nuclear testing in order to develo p warheads better able to penetrate missile defenses china could launch military actions near taiwan and possibly japan as warning against developing missile defenses such actions could include repeat of the livefire artillery and ballistic missile exercises seen in the taiwan area i n 1995 and 199615 chinese international security policy us action on missile defense may affect an ongoing debate in china ove r international security policy and relations with the united states even if us intentions16 were otherwise chinese leaders could conclude from such us development an d deployment that the united states and its partners see china as real or potentia l adversary that cannot be trusted and needs to be checked with missile defenses others in china argue that chinas interests are best serve d through closer economic political and other interaction with the united states and its allies the outcome of this debate will probably be among the factors determining ho w accommodating china is prepared to be on the wide range of bilateral regional and global issues important to the united states issues range from chinese policies on nuclear and missile proliferation trade questions and human rights conditions to beijings role i n dealing with the danger posed by north koreas nuclear program global arms contro l efforts and other issues17 us implications and options this brief review of possible chinese reactions suggests that the united states may face serious difficulties regarding china if the us develops and deploys missile defense systems at home and east asia and especially if i t supports ballistic missile defense efforts in taiwan most notably china might see little choice other than to increase nuclear httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20031crs6 capable and conventional missile testing development and deploymentthereb challenging us interests in curbing missile development and reducing the numbers of nuclear arms beijing may even feel compelled to resume nuclear testing in order t develop weapons better able to penetrate missile defenses there is distinct possibility of military tension in the taiwan area us concern with these possible developments will be weighed against the man perceiv ed benefits for the united states us forces overseas and us allies an d associates of the proposed nmd tmd and possible us sharing of such systems with taiwan us advocates of these approaches likely will urge going forward as means of increasing protection of the united states and its allies despite chinese criticism an d opposition some in this group also believe that current highlevel prc criticism i s designed to intimidate the united states and therefore judge that giving in to prc pressure would send the wrong signal about us determination to play leading strategic role in asian affairs others may seek to reassure china that it is not the target of the ne w systems perhaps even offering to share information about the system with china although beijing is thought to be interested in learning about missile defenses this benefit may not be sufficient to offset the negative impact of the missile defenses system in th united states and east asia on chinese missile forces and missile modernization some observers suggests the united states could endeavor to offset china for this impact n chinese security concerns with gestures in other areas possibilities include mor liberalized us civil technology transfer policies easing chinese market access to th united states stronger sup port for chinas entry into world trade organization wto stronger us backing for beijin gs position visavis taiwan and other steps of course each of these gestures would have consequences for other kinds of us interests an d opposition from certain sectors
