oilforfood program illicit trade and investigations summary the oilforfood program offp was th centerpiece of longstandi ng security council effort to alleviate human suffering in iraq while maintaining key elements of the 1991 gulf warre lated sanctions reg ime in order to ensure that iraq remained contained and that only humanitari an needs were served by the program the program imposed controls on iraqi il exports and humanitarian imports all iraqi oil revenues legally ear ned under the program were held in uncontrolled escrow account and were not accessible to the regime of saddam hussein the program was in operation from december 1996 until march 2003 observers generally agree that the program substantially eased but did not eliminate human suffering in iraq concerns about the programs early difficulties prompted criticism of the united states critics asserted that the us strategy was to maintain sanctions on iraq indefinitely as m eans of weakening saddam husseins grip on power at the same time growing regional and international sympathy for the iraqi people resulted in pronounced relaxation of regional enforcement or even open defiance of the iraq sanctions the united states and other members of the united nations security council were aware of billions of do llars in oil sales by iraq to its neighbors in violation of the sanctions regime and outside of the offp but did not take action to punish states engaged in illicit oil trading with saddam husseins regime successive administrations issued annual waivers to congress exempting turkey and jordan from unilatera l us sanctions for their violations of the oil embargo on iraq until 2002 the united states argued that continued sanctions were critical to preventing iraq from acquiring equipment that could be used to reconstitute ba nned weapons of mass destru ction wmd programs in 2002 the bush administration asserted th at sanctions were eroding and the administration decided that the overthrow of that regime had become necessary the program terminated following the fall of saddam husseins regime the assumption of sovereignty by an inter im iraqi government on june 28 2004 and the lifting of saddamera sanctions however after the fall of the regime there were new allegations of mismanagement and abuse of the program including allegations that saddam husseins regime manipulated the program to influence officials contractors and politicians nd businessmen in numerous countries new attention also has been focused on iraqs oil sales to neighboring countries outside the control or

background and structure of the oilforfood program the establishment of the united na tions oilforfood program offp reflected longstanding security council effort to alleviate human suffering in iraq while pressing iraq to comply w ith all relevant security council resolutions1 the program was temporary and limited exception to the international trade embargo imposed on ir aq by security council resolution 661 adopted on august 6 1990 after iraqs invasion of kuwait on august 2 1990 security council resolution 687 apr il 3 1991 provided for the international embargo on iraqs exportation of oil2 to end once iraq had fully complied with efforts to end its weapons of mass struction wmd programs the wmd inspections began in april 1991 but proceeded more slowly than expected and an end to sanctions did not app ear to be in sight by the mid1990s without oil export revenues iraq was unable to import sufficient quantities of food and medical supplies and according to virtually all accepted indicators infant and child mortality caloric intake and other indicators living cond itions deteriorated sharply during 19911995 the first version of an oilforfood plan would have allowed iraq to export 16 billion in oil every six months it was adopted by the council in 1991 in resolutions 706 august 15 1991 and 712 an implemen ting plan adopted september 19 1991 but iraq rejected it as too limited in scope and an infringement on iraqs sovereignty there was little movement on the issue dur ing 199195 despite dram atic declines in iraqs living standards during this pe riod iraq continued to sell its oil under the terms of trade protocols with some of its neighbors in vi olation of the sanctions regime these sales were known to member s of the sanctions committee including the united states on april 15 1995 the security council adopted resolution 986 which took into account one of iraqs concerns by allowing the export of 2 billion in oil every six months pressured by fears of unrest caused by the drop in living standards iraq accepted this proposal and it and th united nations signed memorandum ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30472crs2 3 memorandum of understanding between the secretariat of the united nations and the government of iraq on the implementation of security council resolution 986 available at httpdaccessddsunorgdoc undocgenn96127 71pdfn9612771pdf 4 the sanctions committee set up by resolution 661 consists of representatives of the member states on the security council understanding on the program on may 20 1996 document number s1996356 3 after several more months of negotiations on details the first iraqi oil exports under the offp began on december 10 1996 after the first year of the program the secretary general determined that the pr ogram was not meeting the food and medical needs of the iraqi people and resolution 1153 february 20 1998 raised the oil export ceiling to 5256 billion per sixmonth phase in an effort to provide iraq an incentive to cooperate with new prog ram of wmd inspections the security council in resolution 1284 december 17 1999 abolished the export limit entirely oilforfood program operations prior to the 2003 war from inception in december 1996 until the usled war that began march 19 2003 the offp was progressively modified to try to remove obstacles to the delivery of civilian goods to iraq however th program did not nd was not intended to restore normal economic activity to iraq or completely blunt the effect of international sanctions on ir aq during the rule of sadda m hussein moreover the program did not and was not intended to monitor iraqs compliance with the wider trade embargo governed by reso lution 661 the sanctions committee4 administered the implementa tion of sanctions on iraq and was responsible for ensuring that iraq complied with all rele vant sanctions including the embargo on oil sales outside of the pr ogram during the rule of saddam hussein after the fall of the regime at the hands of us for ces on april 9 2003 the united states achieved support for its proposal to phase the program out entirely and to allow iraq to resume normal commercial interactions for an outline of offp operations see appendix in order to ensure that only humanita rian objectives were served the offp placed substantial controls on approved iraqi oil exports and humanitarian imports under its jurisdiction under the terms of the memorandum of understanding drafted to implement resolution 986 iraqs state owned oil marketing company state oil marketing organization somo was empow ered to negotiate contracts with international oil companies to sell iraqi oil once finalized the oil purchase contracts were reviewed by panel of oil contr act overseers reporting to the sanctions committee the oil overseers reviewed iraqs pricing proposals monthly under the program iraq was allowed to expor t only oil not any other products the oil sold under the offps auspices was exported through an iraqturkey pipeline and from iraqs terminals in the persian gulf according to resolution 986 the larger share of these oil exports ran through the turkish route the proceeds from these sales were deposited directly by the oil purchasers into unmonitored escrow account held at the new york bran ch of frances banque nationale parishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30472crs3 5 in response to

exports were monitored at the point of exportation by personnel from saybolt ne derland bv an energy services firm working under contract to the program u nder its contract saybolt was not asked or expected to ensure that iraq was using only the approved export routes or to police any other illicit exportation of oil according to secretary general reports on the program6 in each sixmonth phase of the progra m iraq purchased goods and services directly from supplier firms in accordance w ith an agreed distribution plan allocating anticipated revenues among categories of goods to be purchased in that phase prior to the major amendment to the program approved in may 2002 wh ich is discussed below the sanctions committee reviewed and had authority to approve contracts for the export of goods to iraq the committ ee operated by consensus any sanctions committee member could place hold on contract for goods to be imported by iraq and the united states often placed hol ds on exports of dual use items civilian items that could have military applications in decidi ng whether to place hold on contract the us representative on the sanctions committee consulted with agencies of the us government to determine whether iraq could use the requested items for military purposes under the procedures adopted in s ecurity counc il resolution 1409 may 14 2002 and placed into effect in july 2002 the weapons inspection unit unmovic monitoring verifica tion and inspection commission reviewed export contracts to ensure that they did not contain items on designated list of dual use items known as the goods review list grl if so the sanctions committee then decided whether to approve that tion of the contract containing the grl items in question under us regulations written for the program us firms could buy iraqi oil and sell goods to iraq including oil industry spare parts and equipment over the last few years purchases of iraqi oil by us firms ranged between onethird to onehalf of iraqs pre2003 war ex port volume of about 21 million barrels per day in february 2003 just prior to the start of th war us imports of iraqi oil tended toward the high end of that range about 1 million barrels per day the us imports came primarily by purchases from intermediate energy trading firms rather than direct buys from iraq once contract was approved funds from the escrow account were used to pay letters of credit for the purchased goods the arriving supplies were monitored athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30472crs4 7 cotecna replaced lloyds regist er as pointofentry

of the auspices of the offp and neither firm was empowered or expected to do so under the terms of resolution 986 or the memorandum of understanding agreed to by the united nations and the iraqi government cotecna was not responsible for searching or authenticating other goods imported by iraq through bilatera l trade agreements with its neighbors or purchased with other iraqi government funds even if those goods entered iraq through the approved offp border entry poi nts mentioned above nor was cotecna responsible for certifying what price wa s paid for the goods imported under the

inspection regime was not in operation inside iraq security council resolution 1284 december 17 1999 replaced unscom with unmovic which was to perform that enduse monitoring function after reentering iraq in november 2002 although unmovic withdrew from iraq on the eve of operation iraqi fr eedom before beginning those monitoring activities during the 19982002 hiatus in weapons inspections enduse monitoring in iraq was performed by some of the 158 employees who monitored the distribution of civilian goods coming into iraq however these monitors were not trained weapons inspectors and this caused the united states and britain to closely scrutinize and to place many holds on exports of dualuse items to iraq httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30472crs5 the offp attempted to help iraq meet its international obligations and ensure equitable distribution of imports to the ir aqi people the revenues from iraqs oil sales were distributed as follows 25 was transferred to compensation commission

currency gains the total funds available to the program were 695 billion the resolution laid the groundwork for foreign investment to explore for and produce oil in iraq although the resolution made this investment contingent on full ir aqi cooperation with unmovic in 2000 and 2001 the sanctions committee approved drilling in existing fields by two russian fi rms tatneft and slavneft and turkish firm turkish petroleum company but exploration of new fields was still not permitted resolution 1284 created incentives for iraq to cooperate with unmovic by expressing the intention if iraq is deemed to have cooperated in all respect s with unmovic to suspend export and import sanctions for 120 days renewable by the security council the resolution implied that the security council would have to vote to implement the sanctions suspension resolution 1284 made some oil indus try spare parts eligible for streamlined approval process contracts for such equipment were scrutinized by the same sanctions committee panel of oil overseers that reviewed iraqs oil sales contracts without requiring full sanctions committee review security council resolution 1293 march 31 2000 increased the value of oil industry spare parts that iraq could import per oilforfood phase to 600 million from 300 million this decision was taken in response to recommendations by the secretary general that improving the humanitarian situation was contingent on the rehabilitation of iraqs ability to export its oil accomplishments of the program there is consensus among officials and outside observers that the offp eased substantially but did not eliminate severe economic hardship in iraq the program as well as some economic libera lization measures nd illicit activity outside the program discussed below enabled iraq to achieve 15 economic growth during 2000 according to the cias world factbook 2001 in total the program ge nerated about 642 billion in revenues with oil sales of approximately 34 billion barre ls of oil to 248 companies9 of that amount according to the office of the iraq programme the administering office for the program headed by benon sevan about 39 billion worth of humanitarian supplies and equipment were delivered to iraq both baghdad controlled and kurdish controlled under the program up to the november 21 2003 the termination date of that amount 61 billion was for the ku rdish areas that amounted to 88 of total funds available somewh at less than the 13 intended to be used for the kurdish areas iraqs oil exports were shut down during the usled war that began march 19 2003

the report in baghdadcontrolled iraq iraqis were receiving about 2200 kilocalories of food pe r person per day about 90 of the target caloric intake of 2463 kilocalories per person per day the full ration was achieved only during december 2000 the repor t noted that 60 of iraqs families relied solely on the food ration under the program to meet all household needs according to november 19 2003

sanitation and electricity the report said that there were notable achievements in the health sector including an increase in major surgeries performed and reduction in communicable diseases this and previous reports on the program noted improvement in the diagnostic and other equipment in use in iraqs hospitals in the related ar ea of water and sanitation the fact sheet of november 19 2003 said that the deter ioration of water f acilities was halted by the offp the november 2002 report sa id the status of electricity provision had been improving gradually noting mo re reliable supply of electricity to iraqis than was the case previously in mid1999 unicef released its first countrywide survey of infant and maternal mortality in iraq since 1991 the unicef survey team took number of precautions to ensure that the survey results would not be altered or modified and unicef is confident that the survey information is accurate it showed that infant mortality in the southern and central secti ons of iraq under the control of the iraqi government rose from 471 deaths pe r thousand live births during 19841989 to 1079 deaths per thousand during 19941999 th under fiveyearold mortality rate rose from 56 to 1306 per thousand live births in the same time period according to the report this increase in mortality resulted in about 500000 more deaths among children under five than would have been the case if child mortality trends noted prior to 1990 imposition of sanctions had c ontinued in northern iraq the mortality rate has declined over the same period infant mortality dropped from 639 per thousand live births in 19841989 to 587 in 19941999 and under fiveyearold mortality dropped from 802 per thousa nd live births to 718 per thousand education the report identified significant shortages of materials and equipment throughout the education sector particularly school overcrowding the report says that the distribution of 12 million school desks had met 60 of the need at primary and secondary schools whereas prior to the inception of the program students sat on bare floors according to an earlier report september 8 2000 iraqs literacy rate 537 of adu lts and 707 of the youth has remained fixed for number of yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30472crs9 prewar debates over sanctions the accomplishments of the program did not end debate over how strictly to enforce some of the programs restrictions the united states and britain tended to place most of the blame for the programs shortcomings on iraq alleging that the iraqi regime disregarded the needs of its pe ople administrators of the program criticized iraq on similar grounds but they also attributed program deficiencies to us and british policy which they said slowed or halted the flow of infrastructure equipment that was required to r ealize the programs benefits the issue of contract holds on infra structure equipment was one of the most contentious that the offp faced past reports on the program claimed that infrastructure equipment such as trucks communications gear forklifts electricity and water treatment equipment were crucial to the timely distribution and proper storage and functioning of foodstu ffs and medical products at the time of the adoption in may 2002 of aspects of the sma rt sanctions plan discussed below the united states had placed almost 5 billion of goods on hold in response to criticism of the holds the united states asserted th at 90 of all contr acts were approved and that the holds had minimal impact the united states maintained that all contracts needed to be scrutinized to ensure that equipment would be used to rebuild wmd programs especially during the time weapons inspectors were not in iraq december 1998 november 2002 to monitor dualuse exports that were shipped there reports did not accuse iraq of purposely diverting imports from the program to the military or re gime supporters although some us reports such as february 28 1998 state department f act sheet made such allegations the smart sanctions plan at the start of the george w bush administration with permanent end to inte rnational sanctions in sight due to the lack of weapons inspections the deba over further modifications to the offp was the centerpiece of broader debate ove r iraq policy and sanctions the debate intensified in may 2001 when the five pe rmanent members of the security council began discussing the us plan to adopt smart sanctions on iraq the smart sanctions plan represented an effort articulated primarily by secretary of state colin powell in early 2001 to rebuild cons ensus to contain iraq when the bush administration came into office administration officials asserted that international sanctions enforcement was collapsing and that iraq was using the relaxation to acquire prohibited goods and raise illicit revenue the u s smart sanctions proposal centered on tradeoff in which restricti ons on the flow of civilian goods to iraq would be greatly eased and in return ir aqs illicit trade with its neighbors would be brought under the offp and its monitoring and control mechanisms the net effect according to the concept would be to target sanctions only on limiting iraqs strategic capabilities and not on its civilian economy the smart sanctions plan was intended to defuse criticism by several governments including permanent member s of the security council france russia and china that the united states was using international sanctions to promote the overthrow of the iraqi government or to punish iraq indefinitely for the invasion of kuwait however differen ces between the permanent members over how to implement these measures prevented immediate agreement on the us plan the september 11 2001

offpapproved oil shipments and to solicit kickbacks from suppliers of humanitarian and other civilian goods purchased with funds from the ffp escrow account some of those i llicit funds were used to

companies from countries that sought to do business with iraq or were symp athetic to easing sanctions on iraq34 us major oil companies were said to have bought iraqi oil shipme nts from these small traders however according to us officials some member states reputed to be the same countries seeking to ease sanctions on iraq did not immediately agree to these proposed mechanisms35 in september 2001 the security council reached agreement to move to pricing formula called retroactive pricing in which the oil was priced after sale this significantly reduced iraqs oil sa by about 25 alt hough the united nations noted rebound to previous levels about 2 million barrels per day as of september 2002 iraq sometimes unilaterally interrupted the sale of oil to protest security council policy or to challenge the united st ates and its allies for example iraq suspended its offp oil sales for the mont h of april 2002 in protest against israels military incursion into the west bank oil

into three categories 1 traditional oil companies that owned refineries 2 personalities and partie s including benon sevanand numerous individuals including russian yugoslav ukrainian and french
