supreme court issu ed its decision in two consolidated cases cherokee nation of oklahoma v leavitt1 and leavitt v cherokee nation of oklahoma2 these cases presented interesting questions regarding the indian self determination and education assistance ac t isda federal agencies responsibility to fund administrative costs for contracts tered into with trib governments under this act and how this responsibility compar to the federal governments general responsibility to pay contractors background the history of the relationship between the federal government and americas indian tribes is characterized not by quential steps in one certain direction but rather by periodic policy shifts dramatically altering the direction of the relationship as result the history of this relations hip is divided by historians into various periods such as the allotment era 1887 1934 when the federal government sought to break up indian reservations into indi vidual allotments of f ee simple ownership and the termination era 19531968 when the federal government sought to eliminate the special limitedsovereign legal status that tribes enjoy since the early 1970s however the united states has pursued course of self determination for indian tr ibes under which the federal government encourages the continued existence of the tribal governance structure and allows tribes increasing control over their own destinies the centerpiece of the selfdetermination movement is the isda3 passed by congress in 1975 the purpose of the act was to transfer planning conduct and management responsib ilities for certain indian programs normally carried out by federal agen cies eg hospitals and clinics to the tribes themselves4 consequently the department of the interior and the department of health and human services hhs are authorized to enter into contracts withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs2 5 id at 450fa1 hhs and the department of the interior generally carry out their isda responsibilities through

resolution the relevant secretary finds that certain statut ory requirements ve not been met6 the secretaries must devote at least as much funding to these triballyoperated programs as the secretaries would have voted to these programs had they been operated by the agencies themselves7 this amount of funding is commonly known as the secretarial amount in addition the secretaries are author ized to issue grants to tribes for variety of purposes including improving tribes abilities to enter into isda contracts8 while the isda became more successful as an increasing number of tribes took control of government programs operated for their benefit the original version of the isda had critical shortcoming in that administrative costs commonly called contract support costs cscs9 were not covered in th secretarial amount as result tribes that assumed programs unde r isda contracts often experienced serious financial shortfalls10 congress moved to remedy this situation in 1988 when it added to the isda the following language there shall be added to th secretarial amount contract support costs which shall consist of an amount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried out by tribal organization as contractor to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and prude nt management11 congress also added language in the 1988 legislation conditioning the funding of cscs on the availability of appropriations the availability clause12 and declaring that the secretary is not required to redu ce funding for programs projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs3 13 25 usc

the underfunding of selfdetermination contracts particularly with respect to cscs continue d to be controversial as agencies failed to fully fund cscs even after the 1988 amendments citing the availability and reduction clauses in 1999 congress im posed oneyear moratorium on any new selfdetermination contracts14 in the last few years congress when appropriating funds for isda contracts has placed explicit caps on cscs and in doing so has quelled some of this contr oversy questions still rema in however about the liability if any incurred by federal agencies that underfunded cscs for isda contracts before these statutory caps became the norm to answer this questi on one must inquire as to how much discretion the fede ral agencies possess with regard to these contracts this issue is at the heart of the conflict in cherokee nation the isda contracts and the circuit court decisions both of the consolidated cases that came before the supreme court had roots in the same controversy since 1983 th cherokee nation the nation has carried out many responsibilities tran sferred to it from ihs under an isda compact the nation and the hhs secretary agreed to expand the nations responsibilities in 1994 to include the operation of two new ihs c linics in 1995 to include ihss contract health care outpa tient chcop physician re ferral program and in 1997 to include the inpatient physician refe rral program from 19941997 hhs failed to fully pay for the nations cscs ihs has established two tiered approach for allo cating annual appropriated funds to tribes for cscs contracts are cla ssified as either existing ie those that have already been in operation in previous years or new and expanded ie new contracts or existing contracts that have been modified in the last year15 i h s generally allocates funds for existing c ontracts according to the recommendations of the appropriation committees tribes with new and expanded contracts on the other hand are placed on priority list based on th date of the contract for their shares of the fund specifically set aside by cong ress for these new and expanded contracts the isd fund in practice this has meant that there is not enough money in the fund to distribute to all the tribes on the list in given year16 ihs did not fully fund the cherokee nations cscs for either its ongoing contracts or the new and expanded portions of those contracts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs4 17 tenth circuit decision joining the nation in filing this claim was the shoshonepaiute tribe in nevada who also argued that

to the isda for failing to fund cs cs and this claim eventually made its way to the tenth circuit which ruled in favor of the federal government17 the cherokee nation also filed on its own an administrative claim for breach of contract under the contract s disputes act18 for failing to fund cscs the federal circuit court of appeals issued ruling on this claim in favor of the nation19 creating circuit split20 the tenth circuit decision at issue for the tenth circuit were appropriations for 1996 and 1997 the legisla tion in those years appropriated to ihs 17 and 18 billion respectively for the admin istration of the isda while various reports from both the house and senate appropriations committees included recommendations that 160 million should be earmarked for cscs for existing contracts21 neither statute included this re striction the only isdaappropriated money required to be used for specific purpose then according to the statutes language was 75 million required to remain available for cscs22 when ihs allocated funds for cscs in both years it did so according to the recommendations contained in the co mmittee reports consequently only 160 million was allocated for ongoing cscs the tribes argued that this was in clear violation of the statutes explicit language and that ihs had lumpsum appropriations approaching 2 billion each year from which the secretary was required by contract to extract monies for cscs the court however found in favor of th government for two primary reasons first the court reasoned that the reduction clause necessarily implied congressional intent that the secretary have some discretion with regard to those funds in order to avoid cutting into the budget of other trib programs here the court touched on what appears to be fundamental tensi on between the purpose of the isda and the reduction clause congress clearly intended to limit the discretion of federal agencies to underfund isda contracts but the reduc tion clause implies that the federal agencies must have discretion to protect the myriad tribal programs these agencies administer23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs5 24 pl 105277 314 112 stat 2681288 25 tenth circuit decision 311 f3d at 10641065 26 federal circuit decision at 10841086 27 id 28 id at 10871088the tenth circuit also found support for its holding in later congressional enactment as mentioned above congre ss in 1998 became concerned and placed yearlong moratorium on new isda contr acts in section 314 of that same legislation congress inserted the following language notwithstanding any other provisions of law amounts ppropriated to or earmarked in committee reports for the bureau of indian affairs and the indian health service byth 1996 and 1997 appropriationsfor payments to tribes and tribal organiza tions for cscs associated with self determinationcontractswith the bureau of indian affairs or the indian health service as funded by such ac ts are the total amounts available for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for such purposes24 the tenth circuit viewed this language as in essence enacting the aforementioned earmarking language from the 1996 and 1997 committee reports in other words the court ruled congress in tended to cap the available funds for ongoing contracts at 160 million and new and expanded cscs to 75 million25 the federal circuit decision the federal circuit began its analysis from perspective very different from that of th tenth circuit the federal circuit used as the touchstone for its analysis certain general principles of appropriations law26 that in the courts view established pres umption that an agency is required to meet its contractual obligations if there is money available to do so applied to the facts before it the federal circuit found that hhs had an obligation under its contract with the cherokee nation and this obliga tion required the secretary to reprogram unrestricted funds if necessary27 the court rejected the idea that the av ailability and reducti on clauses necessarily vest the secretary with cer tain amount of discretion as to paying cscs according to the court such discretion would be contrary to the purpose of the 1988 isda amendments which was to remedy the federal agencies traditional failure to fully fund tribal cscs28 in so finding the court again diverged significantly from the tenth circuits analytical path the federal circuit next addressed section 314 of the 1999 appropriations act which the tenth circuit found so compelling while the tenth circuit passed on the question of whether the 1999 language was meant to be retroactive or merely an interpretive guide the federal circuit foreshadowing the supreme courts majorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs6 29 id at 1091 30 see supra note 14 and accompanying text 31 brief of amici curiae for the united states chamber of commerce the national defense industrial association and the aerospace indus tries association in support of the cherokee nation and the shoshonepaiute tribes at 1213 concerns quickly ruled that the 1999 act could not have retroactive effect because the tribes right to payment vested well before that act was passed29 the supreme court decision as mentioned above30 before the consolidated cas were filed congress had in some ways made the debate at issue moot by routinely setting caps on expenditures for cscs when appropriating funds for is da contracts in recent years questions still remained however about th liability if any incurred by federal agencies that underfunded cscs for isda contracts before these statutory caps became the norm in addition to the submission of various amicus curiae briefs both parties to the case submitted briefs that focused in large part on the amount of discretion that congress meant to vest in the agencies with respect to the funding of cscs in isda contracts and on other issues addressed in the conflicting circuit court opinions the briefs also revealed the emergence of stion that neither ci rcuit court touched on extensively in its opinion namely what are these csc funding contracts typical government procurement cont racts or something diffe rent this question was important because its answer implicated certain settled principles of government procurement law subsequently some government contr actors expressed concern regarding the possible implications of this case with respect to the governments obligation to pay government contractors generally and submitted an amici curiae brief in favor of the tribes expressing the contractors cern for the possible ramifications of the governments position in this case for nonindian contractors who regularly do business with the federal government it is critical to understand the prac tical effect of the governments position under the governments view when contract to be funded from general lumpsum appropr iation contains subject to clause as many such government contracts dothe cont ractor is obligated to perform the contract fully yet bears the risk that the agency for whatever reasons may exhaust its general appr opriation leaving the contractor not only without payment but also without any legal re medy against the government the contractor would be forced to re ly in other words not on congress appropriations but on the uncertain fi nancial management of the agency31 while this issue was not mentioned in either the tenth or federal circuit opinion during oral arguments the suprem court justices showed good deal of interest in the governments obligati on to honor contracts generally and the precedent the courts decision could set for other government contracts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs7 32 cherokee nation of oklahoma v

ultimate decision reflected the prominent place this issue had attained as the consolidated cases made their way to the supreme court at the beginning of its opinion the court stat ed its view of the facts before it the government does not deny that it promised to pay relevant contract support costs nor does it deny that it failed to pay the government does not deny that were these contracts ordi nary procurement contracts its promises to pay would be legally binding the tribes point out that each year congress appropriated far mo re than the amounts here at issue between 1277 billion and 1419 billion for the indian health service to carry out inter alia the indian selfdetermination act these appropriations acts c ontained relevant st atutory restriction32 emphasis in original the court further noted that when po ssessing adequate unrestricted funds agencies cannot generally back out of th eir contractual obligations by reason of insufficient appropriations from these st arting points the court framed the issue before it thusly if the government ist demonstrate that its promises were not legally binding it must show something speci about the promises here at issue33 in other words in order to avoid appli cation of the general rules of government contracts law the burden was on the federa l agencies to prove that indian self determination contracts are not standard government procurement contracts at all but rather something different in the courts view the agencies did not meet this burden significantly the justices rejected the governments argument that isda contracts are not really contracts at all but rather agreements by which tribes step into the shoes of the relevant agency consequently the government argued these tribes like agencies are not entitled to receive any amounts promised by congress the court however looked at the isdas language as well as its purpose and gleaned congressional intent that isda contracts be treated like normal government contracts34 the courts finding that isda contr acts are different than general procurement contracts allowed the justices to easily dispose of the governments aforementioned reduction clause and availability clause arguments35 indeed the government in its own brief had ceded that an agency must honor normalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32681crs8 36 cherokee nation of oklahoma v leavitt

wl464860 2005 slip op at 14 citations omittedprocurement contracts even if the agency has allocated the needed funds for another purpose36 the court conceded that section 314 of the 1999 appropriations act presented more difficult question in that the statutory language is easily given to two interpretations on the one hand the cour t wrote the language could be read to retroactively bar payment of cscs for contracts from 19941997 on the other hand the language could be interpreted in the courts view as only prohibiting the use of funds left over from previous year s appropriations to pay cscs37 the court found however that the first interpretation presented possible constitutional difficulties in that statute that retro actively repudiates the governme nts contractual obligation may violate the constitution and such an interpretati on is disfavored38 faced with two interpretations one of which presented potential constitutional problems and one that did not the court followed its own precedent and chose the latter conclusion in sum the supreme court found that isda contracts are similar to government procurement contracts and as such they bind agencies to honor the payment terms where agencies possess sufficient unrestri cted appropriated funds to meet those terms as ihs here had enough unrestr icted money to pay the isda contracts in question the court ruled in favor of the tribes as mentioned above congre ss has in some ways made the debate at issue in these consolidated cases moot by routinely setting specific caps on expenditures for cscs when appropriating funds for isda cont racts in recent years this case makes clear however that congress must continue to do so if it expects cscs to be capped in other words the decision to cap cscs must come from congress because the federal agencies do not have the di scretion to cap payment of cscs
