17 2004 melinda gish domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress child care issues in the 108th congress summary the 108th congress inherited several child carerelated agenda items from the previous congress including tasks of providing fy2003 appropriations for many child carerelated programs and the reauthorization of both the child care and development block grant ccdbg and the welfare block grant temporary assistance for needy families tanf the appropriations task was completed whereas the issue of reauthorizing ccdbg and tanf will again spill over into the hands of the 109th congress fy2003 appropriations were provided in the form of the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 signed into law pl 1087 on february 20 2003 among other funding the law included 21 billion in discretionary funds for the ccdbg and 6668 billion for head start mandatory child care funding and tanf block grant funding both of which expired at the end of fy2002 have been provided at the fy2002 level via series of temporary extensions as the programs await reauthorization the 109th congress will confront an additional extension if reauthorization legislation is not passed before march 31 2005 two weeks prior to the signing of the fy2003 appropriations law the administration released its budget request for fy2004 it proposed to maintain level funding for the ccdbg tanf and the social services block grant ssbg while providing increases for head start early reading first and individuals with disabilities education act idea grants for infants and families the fy2004 budget requested cuts in funding for the 21st century community learning centers and even start the presidents fy2004 budget also included proposals to transfer the head start program from hhs to the department of education and to offer states the opportunity to administer the head start program both in the context of the programs anticipated reauthorization which like that of ccdbg and tanf did not occur during the 108th congress the housepassed reauthorization bill hr 2210 did not include the transfer proposal but it did propose an eightstate demonstration program the senate help committeereported bill s 1940 contained neither the transfer nor the state demonstration proposals and differed markedly from the housepassed bill strategic teacher education program and national reporting system for assessing head start programs effectiveness with respect to promoting school readiness were implemented without legislative action the fy2004 appropriations bill was not signed into law pl 108199 until 10 days before the presidents fy2005 budget was released fy2004 appropriations generally maintained the prior years funding with head start and early reading first receiving increases for fy2005 the president requested level funding for the ccdbg ssbg 21stcclc and idea preschool increases for head start early reading first and

consolidated appropriations act 2005 hr 4818 was signed into law pl 108447 providing funding for variety of child care and related programs the law includes an acrosstheboard rescission of 08 which applies to the discretionary programs discussed in this report however not all federal agencies eg the department of health and human services have released funding tables reflecting the rescission so precise appropriation levels remain to be seen for details regarding fy2005 funding for child care and related programs see fy2005 appropriations later in this report on september 30 2004 congress approved hr 5149 pl 108308 measure to extend funding at the current rates for both tanf and the mandatory portion of the child care and development fund through march 31 2005 both the tanf and ccdf programs continue to await reauthorization federal child carerelated programs and tax provisions several federal programs support child care or related services primarily for lowincome working families in addition the tax code includes provisions specifically targeted to assist families with child care expenses descriptions of those programs and tax provisions follow as does table 1 which shows funding or estimated revenue loss or obligations where applicable for the programs and tax provisions for the past five years in many cases other congressional research service crs reports are referenced as sources for more detailed information about individual programs several programs were up for reauthorization during the 108th congress ie ccdbg tanf head start and idea and readers should be aware that this report does not attempt to cover all issues connected with each of those reauthorizations child care and development block grant ccdbg1 the primary federal grant program funding child care is the ccdbg which was created in 1990 and reauthorized and substantially expanded in 1996 as part of welfare reform the ccdbg has been due to be reauthorized since the end of fy2002 and remains so as the 108th congress comes to close the ccdbg is administered by hhs and provides formula block grants to states which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many 1 for more information see crs report rl30785 the child care and development block grant background and funding by melinda gish crs2 states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold child care services are provided on sliding fee scale basis and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates which can be used with provider of the parents choice including sectarian providers and relatives states receiving ccdbg funds must establish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered in addition states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving ccdbg subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseases building and physical premises safety and health and safety training for care givers however federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements the ccdbg is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement grants referred to in combination as the child care and development fund or ccdf and state maintenanceofeffort moe and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds2 states must use at least 4 of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care and according to statute must target 70 of entitlement funds on welfare recipients working toward selfsufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency however because all families falling below the 85 of state median income requirement can be categorized as at risk the 70 targeting of the welfare and atrisk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served in theory all funds may be used for lowincome nonwelfare working families however state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families more than 5 of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs for fy2005 the consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 provides 21 billion minus an acrosstheboard rescission of 08 in discretionary funding for the child care and development block grant mandatory or entitlement ccdbg funding beginning in fy2003 has been provided at the fy2002 rate 2717 billion for the year under series of funding extensions the eighth extension hr 5149 was approved by congress and signed into law pl 108308 on september 30 2004 it provides funding at the same fy2002 rate through march 31 2005 temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf created in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 provides fixed block grants 165 billion annually through fy2002 and extended through march 31 2005 by hr 5149pl 108308 for statedesigned programs of timelimited and workconditioned aid to needy families with children child care is one of many services for which states may use tanf funding in fy2003 hhs reports that states spent 17 billion in federal tanf funds for child care within the tanf program and 177 billion in state tanf and separate state program ssp moe funds of that 177 billion in state spending approximately 905 million could be double counted as state spending 2 for more detailed information on the ccdf financing structure and spending trends see crs report rl31274 child care funding and spending under federal block grants by melinda gish crs3 toward the ccdf moe requirement in addition states may transfer up to 30 of their tanf allotments to the ccdbg ccdf to be spent according to the rules of that program as opposed to tanf rules the transfer from the fy2003 tanf allotment to the ccdbg totaled almost 19 billion representing 11 of the fy2003 tanf allotment3 child and adult care food program cacfp the cacfp provides federal funds in some cases commodities for meals and snacks served in licensed child care centers family and group day care homes and head start centers child care providers that are exempt from state licensing requirements must comply with alternative state or federal standards children under 12 migrant children under 15 and children with disabilities of any age may participate although most are preschoolers eligible providers are usually public and private nonprofit organizations the cacfp is an openended entitlement administered by the department of agriculture for fy2005 obligations are estimated to be 21 billion4 social services block grant ssbg title xx of the social security act authorizes social services block grants which may be used for social services at the states discretion there are federal income eligibility requirements targeting provisions service mandates or matching requirements an hhs analysis of state expenditures indicates that almost 8 of total ssbg expenditures made in fy2002 205 million were for child care in that year almost equal to those made for child care in fy2001 201 million title xx is capped entitlement and state allocations are based on relative population size it should be noted that although the ssbg has an entitlement ceiling appropriations may not always abide by it for example the ceiling in fy2001 was 17 billion however congress appropriated 1725 billion for that year despite the ceiling the consolidated appropriations act 2005 pl 108447 provides 17 billion for the ssbg and maintains states authority to transfer up to 10 of their tanf block grants to the ssbg note the ssbg is not discretionary program and thus is not affected by the acrosstheboard rescission5 head start head start provides comprehensive early childhood education and development services to lowincome preschool children typically but not always on parttime basis the head start act has been due to be reauthorized since the end of fy2003 however the act was not reauthorized during the 108th congress funding has nevertheless been provided through the appropriations process under current law head start funds are provided directly by hhs to local grantees which must comply with detailed federal performance standards however in its fy2004 budget request the administration proposed to give states the 3 for more information on use of tanf funding for child care see crs report rl31274 child care funding and spending under

developing skills and behaviors including language development prereading skills numeracy and social and emotional competence while meeting stateestablished accountability standards this proposal proved controversial in both the house and senate and reauthorization legislation proposed by the house included more limited version of it there was sign of the provision in the senates committee reported bill the head start reauthorization bill passed by the house hr 2210 on july 25 2003 would have restricted the state demonstration option to maximum of eight states whereas the senate help committeereported bill s 1940 proposed state demonstration option6 similarly the presidents fy2004 budget proposal to fully transfer authority over the head start program from hhs to the department of education by fy2005 was not championed in either the house or senate legislation proposed during the 108th congress the most recent available data show funded enrollment for head start in fy2003 to have totaled 909608 children of whom almost 73000 were under age three participating in early head start the consolidated appropriations act 2005 pl 108447 provides 6899 billion for head start of which 14 billion becomes available in fy2006 note the 6899 billion does not reflect the acrosstheboard 08 offset to which head start is subject 21st century community learning centers 21st cclc the

13 appropriations bills yet to be completed at the close of the 2002 fiscal year september 30 2002 followed by the end of the calendar year and congressional session the new 108th congress undertook the task of passing an omnibus appropriations bill they ultimately passed consolidated resolution hjres 2hrept10810 and it was signed into law pl 1087 by the president on february 20 2003 funding for the departments of labor hhs and education was included in division g of the law and those levels are reflected in the fy2003 column of table 1 readers should be aware that the consolidated

for multiple agencies including the departments of hhs and education both of which administer child carerelated programs the following is summary of child carerelated funding and initiatives proposed in the fy2004 budget documents and how those compared to enacted funding levels table 2 shows how the funding requested by the president for fy2004 compared to house and senate proposals and ultimately to the levels signed into law pl 108 199 ccdbg the administrations fy2004 budget included request for the same rounded levels of ccdbg discretionary and mandatory entitlement funding as were appropriated for fy2003 and fy2002 21 billion in discretionary funding and 2717 billion in mandatory funding likewise the budget request proposed that the same setasides be reserved from the discretionary funding total 19 million for child care resource and referral of which 1 million would be dedicated for the child care aware hotline 273 million for quality child care activities of which 100 million would be dedicated to improving infant and toddler care and 10 million for child care research and evaluation the fy2004 appropriations law included the presidents requested level of funding for the discretionary portion of the ccdbg minus an acrosstheboard rescission of 059 that applied to many discretionary programs in the bill the rounded figure remained 21 billion for fy2004 and that amount encompasses all the setasides requested by the president the mandatory portion of ccdbg funding is not appropriated as part of the appropriations bill process however such funding was provided for fy2004 at the same rate as in fy2003 through series of extensions the final of fy2004 being pl 108262 social services block grant the presidents fy2004 budget proposed to continue funding the ssbg at its authorized level of 17 billion the administration also proposed to maintain states authority to transfer up to 10 of their tanf allotments to the ssbg if they so chose the fy2004 appropriations law provided the same level of funding for the ssbg as was appropriated in fy2003 and as was requested by the president the transfer authority of 10 was also maintained head start the administrations fy2004 budget request included funding increase for head start of 148 million which would have taken its total to 6816 billion of which 14 billion would be advance appropriated for fy2005 the budget request also included background information and proposals that were expected to be addressed as part of the programs anticipated reauthorization in 2004 crs10 according to the fy2004 budget request the administration expected that in fy2004 almost 923000 children would receive head start services including 62000 in early head start the administration contended that the increased funding coupled with the presidents proposal to allow states to administer head start in coordination with other preschool programs would enable the program to maintain current service levels and increase enrollment by up to 10500 children fy2004 program data are not yet available the fy2004 budget explained that in order to improve coordination between head start and other federal state and local programs affecting preschool children the president plans to move responsibility for managing the head start program from the department of health and human services to the department of education14 it proposed that this transition begin in 2004 with the department of education assuming full responsibility for the program in 2005 the administrations transfer proposal was not included in any legislative proposals introduced during the 108th congress however the house reauthorization bill hr 2210 would have allowed state administration for up to maximum of eight states the bill reported from the senate help committee s 1940 contained such provision to allow state administration of head start the fy2004 consolidated appropriations law included 6816 billion minus an acrosstheboard rescission of 059 which reduced the head start funding total to approximately 6775 billion 21st century community learning centers the administration requested 600 million for 21st cclc decrease of 394 million from the fy2003 level in the explanation of the request for less funding the budget justification cited disappointing initial findings from rigorous evaluation of the centers funded in the programs first three years 19992001 despite the presidents initial request congress proposed and the president approved funding the 21st cclc program at level of 1 billion with the across theboard rescission taken into account the appropriation for fy2004 was 999 million even start the administration requested 175 million for even start in fy2004 which marked decrease of 73 million from the fy2003 funding level the department of educations budget justifications cited the results from national evaluations of even start as support for decreasing the programs funding level furthermore even start was among programs rated as ineffective by the office of management and budgets new program assessment rating tool part according to the administration the part identified several weaknesses in even start including lack of numerical targets to demonstrate progress toward shortterm and longterm goals and also cited findings from the aforementioned national evaluations 14 see fiscal year 2004 budget of the us government analytical perspectives p 251 crs11 the fy2004 appropriations law funded even start at level of 248 million less the rescission reducing it to 247 million still more than the presidents requested amount idea grants for infants and families the administration requested 447 million for the idea grants for infants and families in fy2004 which reflected an increase of almost 13 million above the fy2003 funding level the administration asserted that the proposed funding level would help states in meeting rising costs associated with implementing statewide systems expanding childfind activities serving larger numbers of children increasing the focus on providing services in natural environments and improving transition services for children with disabilities and their families the fy2004 appropriation was slightly below the presidents request as the acrosstheboard rescission reduced the funding level to 444 million idea preschool grants the administration requested 390 million for the idea preschool grants in fy2004 the same rounded level as appropriated in fy2003 prior to the rescission which decreased funding by about 25 million in 2002 the preschool grant program served 617394 children aged three through five years and the department of education predicts that the number of children served will increase by 25 from 2003 to 2004 as with the idea grants for infants and families the fy2004 appropriations law funded the idea preschool grants at the level requested by the president less the 059 rescission which brought it to level of 388 million early learning fundearly learning opportunities act program the administration requested funds in its fy2004 budget for this program instead the president proposed to fund similar activities through the early reading first program and the early childhood education professional development grant although the house followed the presidents lead in proposing to eliminate the early learning opportunities act program the senate favored funding it and ultimately the fy2004 appropriations law included 34 million for this program early childhood educator professional development the administration requested 15 million for supporting early childhood educator professional development in fy2004 the same level provided in fy2003 prior to the 98000 rescission according to budget justifications the request would support new round of grants for use in helping local communities especially those with high concentrations of young children in poverty to improve the knowledge and skills of early childhood educators and care givers the fy2004 appropriations law included 25 million for early childhood educator professional development as requested by the president in his fy2004 budget early reading first the administration requested 100 million for the early reading first program in fy2004 an increase of 25 million over the fy2003 crs12 funding level the proposed increase would support efforts in additional lowincome communities to develop model programs for fostering the school readiness of young children as mentioned above the administration proposed to eliminate the early learning opportunities act program also known as the early learning fund to fund similar programs through the early reading first program and the early childhood education professional development grant see above the early reading first program received an increase in funding under the fy2004 appropriations law but not as much as was requested by the president the law included 94 million for this program in fy2004 child care access means parents in school campis the administration requested 15 million in fy2004 for campis this marks decrease of slightly over 1 million from the fy2003 appropriation level the administration stated that the fy2004 funds would be used for the continuation of grants first funded in fy2001 and fy2002 funds were requested for new grant awards the fy2004 appropriations law maintained campis funding at level of 16 million 1 million more than was requested by the president loan forgiveness for child care providers the administration requested funding for this program in fy2004 and none was appropriated according to the department of educations budget justifications funding at the current level 994000 in fy2003 is not costeffective to administer and does not support broad enough pool of recipients from which representative data on the effectiveness of loan forgiveness can be assessed the same document notes that the elimination of funding would not affect existing recipients because funds have already been obligated to support them through the fiveyear forgiveness period crs13 table 2

funded in the fy2005 appropriations law pl 108447 instead of continuing to fund these two programs the administration proposed to redirect funds to reading first and early reading first which they contended were more successful literacy programs the budget proposed to increase funding for early reading first by 38 million the administration also proposed to increase funding for head start by 169 million the presidents fy2005 budget requested 69 billion for head start estimating that it would help provide 919000 children with head start services including 62000 children in early head start in fy2005 of the 69 billion the administration proposed to use 45 million to fund nine state pilot projects to coordinate state preschool programs federal child care grants and head start into comprehensive system of early childhood programs this coordination was proposed in keeping with the administrations goal of improving preschool programs to help ensure school readiness the

at the annual rate of 2717 billion through march 31 2005 crs17 administrations early childhood initiative proposals included in the fy2004 and fy2005 budgets and other efforts underway during the 108th congress reflect the goals outlined in good start grow smart the bush administrations early childhood initiative first announced by the president in april of 2002 good start grow smart focuses on three overall areas 1 strengthening head start 2 partnering with states to improve early childhood education and 3 providing information to teachers care givers and parents as mentioned above the presidents fy2004 budget proposed to transfer the head start program to the department of education as well as to provide states with the option to administer the program the head start reauthorization bill passed by the house hr 2210 did not include the proposal to transfer the program to ed but did include provisions to allow maximum of eight states to administer the program provided they meet designated requirements the administration moved ahead with two additional efforts that are in keeping with the good start grow smart initiative but that did not require legislative changes to the head start act one is the strategic teacher education program also known as project step described by the head start bureau as comprehensive multifaceted sequential professional development endeavor to ensure teachers use researchbased strategies to implement early and emergent literacy as part of this development during the summer and fall of 2002 3000 head start staff and 100 state child care administrators received 32 hours of training in strategies to support childrens emerging literacy those who were trained are expected to serve as mentor coaches for staff within their respective head start programs the second effort is the development and implementation of national reporting system that can be used to assess the effectiveness of head start programs in achieving successful outcomes for children in terms of school readiness particularly the areas of literacy and number knowledge this national reporting system was implemented starting in the fall of 2003 and assesses head start four and fiveyear olds twice year on educational performance measures using indicators that were included in legislation as part of the 1998 reauthorization of head start legislative activity in the 108th congress child care and welfare reauthorization several bills pertaining specifically to tanf and ccdbg reauthorization were introduced in the latter part of the 107th congress however none were passed into law therefore the reauthorizations of both programs remained on the agenda in the 108th congress legislation to reauthorize the programs received attention but never made it out of both house and senate the house passed reauthorization bills for both tanfccdbg hr 4 and head start hr 2210 whereas in the senate comparable bills hr 4 tanfmandatory child care funding s 880 ccdbg and s 1940 head start were reported out of committee but did not clear the floor hr 4 tanfmandatory child care was on the floor for consideration march 29 april 1 and one
