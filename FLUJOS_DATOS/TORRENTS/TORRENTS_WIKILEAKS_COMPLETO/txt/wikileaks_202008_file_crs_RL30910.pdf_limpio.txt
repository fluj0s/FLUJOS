other collegial board or commission as we ll as the average time the president took to submit nomination may not be as meaningful when considering boards or commissions as it is when considering executive departments and singlehead independent agencies nearly all positions on boards and commissions are for fixed term of office and when term expires the incumbent usually may remain in office until he or she is replaced by successo r moreover nomination is frequently submitted before an incumbents term expires consequently the time taken to confirm nomination generally is not as crucial for independent regulatory boards and commissions as it is for executive partments and sing lehead independent agencies where nomination is generally made to position that is vacant the length of time given nomination may be pending in the senate varies widely some nominations are confirme d within few days others may not be confirmed for several months and some are never confir med this report provides for each board or commission nominati on that was confirmed in the 107th congress the number of days between nomination and confirmation days to confirm some senate recess days are not included in this sum because senators are unable to take up nominations on these days for prac tical reasons only days from the longer recesses around august and between cong ressional sessions are excluded these recesses are often longer than 30 days th is cutoff point is suggested by the senate rules which provide that i f the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon shall be returned to the president although this rule is often waived3 the 32 days during the august 2002 recess and the 33 days between the first and

organization and the table of all nominations in appendix shows both the mean and the median the mean is the average as it is commonly calculated in order to calculate the mean days to confirm for example for each organization the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations in the organiza tion were added together and then divided by the number of confirmed nominations the median is the middle number when the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations are arranged in numerical order although the mean is the more familiar kind of average the median is included on the larger table because it diminishes the influence of fe w extreme entries it is not included on the smaller tables where the influence of such entries is more directly visiblecongress were subtracted from the days to confirm for those nominations that spanned one or both recesses days were subtracted for the august 2001 recess because as discussed below all pending nominations were returned prior to that recess an accurate calculation of the average time the senate took to confirm nomination in the 107th congress is made more challenging by an unusual characteristic of the session as just note d the senate rules pr ovide that all pending nominations are to be returned to the pres ident at the beginning of recesses of thirty days or more usually the senate agrees by unanimous consent to waive this rule and retain pending nominati ons over their recesses prior to the 31day august 2001 recess however the senate did not r each such an agreement and 162 pending nominations 13 of which were to the orga nizations discussed in this report were returned to the president4 the president sent forward nominations for some of these individuals again after the recess those nominations were considered to be new nominations rather than continuations of the prerecess nominations as result when such nominations are confirmed the ngth of the confirma tion process shown in the tables of this report as days to confirm does not include any prerecess time during which the nominee was under considera tion in the senate consequently the average is smaller than it would be if the pre and postrecess nomination times were added together for example the mean num ber of days to conf irm for all boards and commissions is 70 days but if the prer ecess days during which nominee was under consideration in the senate were included for all confirmed nominees this mean would be 72 days likewise the median days to confirm for all board and commission nominations is 51 but it would be 52 if prerecess da ys were included5 table notes provide figures that take such prerecess time into account in general however comparisons between average confirmation times from this report and those from previous reports should be made cautiously since most of these boards and commissions require political balance among their members ie more than simple majority may be from the same

negotiations involve stions not only of patronage but also of policy especially when the board or commi ssion is involved in areas that at the time may be particularly sensitive this often results in packaging process in which the president submits several nominations together for positions in particular agency and the senate then confir ms them as group sometimes however only one or two nominations are submitted when three or four positions may be available when this occurs nomination may remain before the senate for many months until one or two additional nominations are submitted

portance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy9 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination although the senate confirms most nominations president can safely assume that his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejec tions in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the mination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factor s that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination the most recent study of senate confirmation action which looked at the period between 1981 and 1992 found that th senate failed to confirm 22 of all nominations to fulltime positions on boards and commissions during the same period
