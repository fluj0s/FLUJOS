thirtythree states have added victims rights amendment to their state constitutions similar proposals have been made to amend the united states constitution including sj res 3 and hj res 64 in this congress proponents claim an amendment is necessary to balance the rights of victims with those afforded the accused in the criminal justice system to make protection of victims rights and remedies uniformly available and to replace inadequate enforcement mechanisms opponents claim an amendment would flood the courts with litigation would undermine the rights of the accused perhaps discriminatorily and would jeopardize effective prosecution sjres 3 and hjres 64 like many of the statutory and state constitutional provisions focus on enduring the rights of victims to be notified of to attend and to be heard at judicial proceedings like several of those provisions they leave to another day the definition of victim for purposes of the amendment they do address however victim participation in bail proceedings plea bargaining trial sentencing hearings among otherseach of which are already subject to wide variety of legislative regulation it is as yet unclear whether sjres 3 or hjres 64 will wipe the slate clean or simply supplement existing law and whether it will trump conflicting defendant constitutional rights or if the need to accommodate both will in rare instances preclude prosecution in order to avoid conflict appendices include references to state and federal legislation in several of the areas touched upon by the amendment

rights amendments to the united states constitution background the victims rights amendments are the culmination of efforts on several fronts they have their origins in the confluence of drives by several groups each of whom began with more narrowly defined focus including those seeking to reform drunk driving laws domestic violence laws laws covering the treatment afforded rape victims and child abuse and elderly abuse laws4 those reacting to the supreme courts extensive reidentification of the constitut ional guarantees and protection afforded the accused in both the state and federal

and unusual punishments 24 presidents task force on victims of crime final report 114 1982 had the amendment been added to the constitution the sixth amendment of the bill of rights would have read as follows in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence likewise the victim in every criminal prosecution shall have the right to be present and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings 25 in 1985 the national organization of victim assistance task force offered this language as proposed amendment to the united states constitution victims of crime are entitled to certain basic rights including but not limited to the right to be informed to beprovisions22 and by commun ity notification provisions of various state megans laws23 the history of victims rights amendment to the united states constitution begins with the 1982 presidents task force on victims of crime recommendation which would have simply appended the following sentence to the sixth amendment likewise the victim in every criminal prosecution shall have the right to be present and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings 24 proponents subsequently floated freestanding variants25 questions over the impact of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs6 present and to be heard at all critical stages of federal and state criminal justice processes to the extent that these rights do not interfere with existing constitutional rights reprinted in the rights of crime victims in the criminal justice system is justice blind to the victims of crime 16 new england journal on criminal civil confinement 241 266 1990 two years later the victims constitutional amendment network suggested another version the victim of crime or his or her representative shall have the right to be informed of to be present at and to be heard at all criminal justice proceedings at which the defendant has such rights subject to the same rules of evidence which govern the defendants rights reprinted id at 267 26 karmen whos against victims rights the nature of the opposition to pro victim initiatives in criminal justice 8 stjohns journal of legal commentary 157 170 1992 when the victims movement launched campaign in the 1980s to reform the sixth amendment to the constitution some were alarmed that basic civil liberties enshrined in the bill of rights could come under attack part of the movement sought to add language to the sixth amendment to the effect that victims were entitled to certain basic rights among these rights were the right to be informed and the right to be present and heard at all critical stages of the criminal justice process these rights were to be tailored so as to not conflict with existing constitutional guarantees extended to accused persons however others in the movement formulated the proposed constitutional amendment in more contentious way they sought to match defendants rights with victims rights currently in 1992 the drive for an amendment to the united states constitution is being redirected in favor of efforts to codify victims rights into state constitutions some of the sharpest battle have broken out over proposals to strengthen the hand of the state in the name of the victim some proposals include legislation to make it easier for the police to effect an arrest for defendant to be kept in jail rather than released on bail to change the rules of evidence or limit the cross examination of complainants or lastly for the government to keep convicts behind bars by shutting off avenues of appeal and review 27 although the state constitutional amendments tend to be individualistic they share common themes one of the first the california constitutional amendment for example contains specific provisions for safe schools exclusionary rule limitations bail restrictions and recidivist sentencing features rarely replicated in other states on the other hand it also calls for victim restitution component common to those of several states c alconst art1 28amendment proposals upon defendants rights threatened to splinter the movement and the effort was redirected towards the states26 more than half of the states have now amended their state constitutions to include victims rights amendments27 issues proposals to add victims rights amendment to the united states constitution raise two basic issues why and what why should the constitution be amended and what should be included in any such amendment purpose why victims rights amendment to the united states constitution proponents have historically offered several reasonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs7 28 these contentions can be variously parsed and arranged see eg hudson the crime victim and the criminal justice system time for change 11 pepperdine law review 23 2933 19841 there are serious injustices in the present system because it ignores victim interests and often treats victims unfairly 2 the present system harbors the inequity of elaborate procedural rights for the accused but denies the victim standing in the criminal justice process and grants him very few procedural rights 3 enhancement of the rights and privileges of crime victims will encourage victim cooperation within the criminal justice system 4 if legislators are to find more funds for law enforcement corrections and other criminal justice system programs it is politically important for the public to feel that the system is working for them not just for the rights of the accused convicted or institutional interests 5 what can be collectively termed humanitarian and social welfare rationales are often cited for the establishment of statefunded victim compensation victimwitness assistance and counseling programs such rationales generally describe the government service as benefit bestowed as matter of legislative or executive grace rather than right or entitlement 6 the governments monopoly on the use of force carries with it the duty to protect its citizens from attack and theft 7 victim rights reforms are largely non punitive nonrepressive constitutional politically popular and fiscally inexpensive 8 the wehavetriedeverythingelse argument 9 some victim reforms have correctional value in themselves and are more costeffective than the alternative of longer incarceration 10 the time has come after twenty years of judicial decisions and statutory enactments fully implementing the constitutional rights of criminal defendants for the theoretical remedies of crime victims to receive practical implementation 29 145 congrec s707 daily ed jan 19 1999remarks of sen kyl statutory and state constitutional provisions are always subservient to the federal constitution so in cases of conflict the defendants rights which are already in the us constitution will always prevail our amendment will correct this imbalance 145 congrec s709 daily ed jan the criminal justice system is badly tilted in favor of criminal defendants and against victims interests and more appropriate balance should be restored the shabby treatment afforded victims has chilled their participation in the criminal justice system to the detriment of all society has an obligation to compensate victims existing statutory and state constitutional provisions are wildly disparate in their coverage resulting in uneven treatment and harmful confusion throughout the criminal justice system and existing state and federal law is inadequate and likely to remain inadequate28 the need for greater balance the due process clauses and other defendants rights components of the constitution supplied the foundation for the defendantfocused jurisprudence of the 50s and 60s it has also served as one of the catalysts for the early victims rights movement call for greater constitutional protection of victims rights seems predictable feature of the belief that the criminal justice system must involve greater balance between the rights of victim and those of the defendant29httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs8 19 1999remarks of sen feinstein nowhere in the text of the usconstitution does there appear any guarantee of rights for crime victims to rectify this disparity senator kyl and i are putting forth is crime victims rights amendment the victims bill of rights are victims all dressed up with place to go 8 st johns journal of legal commentary 251 276 1992it is necessary to provide constitutional protection to the crime victim in order to correct the imbalance in the criminal justice system the defendant is afforded many rights in the constitution but the victim is not federal legislation while step in the right direction does not transcend state legislation and fails to adequately meet the need for enforceable victims rights constitutional victims rights provision will equalize the grossly unbalanced treatment of the victims and the defendants in the criminal justice system young constitutional amendment for victims of crime victims perspective 34 wayne law review 51 64 65 1987from victims perspective mere privileges are not sufficient because victims endure extensive pain and suffering in the wake of victimization victims want and deserve the criminal justice system to afford them equal access equal treatment and equal justice as provided for the accused as result of both the lack of remedies and the vulnerability of existing legislation to constitutional challenges the victims contend that it is necessary to pass an amendment that ensures them place equal to the accuseds in the criminal justice system eikenberry victims of crime victims of justice 34 wayne law review 29 48 1987the victims rights amendment is not merely one groups view of social policy it is instead way of balancing the grossly unbalanced criminal justice system it is way of returning victims to their rightful position in the criminal justice system and it is consistent with the purpose and effect of other amendments to the constitution 30 cf carter when victims happen to be black 97 yale law journal 420 1988discussing the case of bernhart goetz charged with attempted murder and assault and ultimately convicted for possession of an unlicensed handgun following subway confrontation with muggers 31 logic might suggest that the victim also suffers when the guilty escape unpunished because an innocent individual has been accused instead but this view is rarely heardthe balance argument is hardly new close to three quarters of century ago the supreme court observed that the law as we have seen is sedulous in maintaining for defendant charged with crime whatever forms of procedure are of the essence of an opportunity to defend but justice though due to the accused is due to the accuser also the concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to filament we are to keep the balance true snyder v massachusetts 291 us 97 122 1934 critics might suggest that victims already enjoy equal constitutional rights with the accused the victim who repels an unlawful assault with excessive force may find himself criminally charged in that case he is entitled to exactly the same constitutional rights as his attacker30 moreover many of the constitutional rights afforded the accused benefit the victim as well they are designed to ensure that the guilty are convicted and that the innocent are not the accused benefits when the innocent are not convicted the victim benefits when the guilty are31httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs9 32 dolliver victims rights constitutional amendment bad idea whose time should not come 34 wayne law review 87 91 1987the bill of rights was designed to protect personal liberties from governmental infringement not to protect private individuals from each other personal liberty of victim is infringed upon by the government at any time during the criminal prosecution the victim has not been arrested is not being tried is not in danger of being fined or imprisoned as is the defendant and is not being deprived of any alternative legal remedies against defendant any rights the victim seeks to secure are not of constitutional character thus victims rights amendment is an inappropriate means of securing victims rights 33 cardenas the crime victim in the prosecutorial process 9 harvard journal of law and public policy 357 381 1986the prosecution of one charged with criminal offense is an adversary proceeding the prosecuting attorney represents the state it is not only his right but his duty to present the states case and to argue for and to seek to obtain the states objective in the proceeding that objective is not conviction of the defendant regardless of guilt nor punishment disproportionate to the offense or contrary to the states policy it is the conviction of the guilty the acquittal of the innocent and punishment of the guilty appropriate to the circumstances in the interest of the future protection of society in the discharge of his duties the prosecuting attorney is to required to be and should not be neutral he is not the judge but the advocate of the states interest in the matterquoting state v westbrook 279 nc 18 367 181 se2d 572 583 1972 34 on the other hand time costs and the prospect of judgmentproof defendant may render civil justice less than fully satisfactory in many instances 35 eg house hearing 867 prepared statement of elisabeth semel on behalf of the national association of criminal defense lawyersthe father whose daughters killing provided the necessary political impetus for the rapidfire enactment of three strikes has become an omnipresent commentator on gamut of criminal justice issues the jury in the trial of richard allen davis the man charged with the little girls murder had the initial task of deciding whether davis was actually guilty of the offense and if so whether the prosecution had proved four special circumstances each of which if found true could lead to death sentence for davis the jury took but few days to discharge its sworn responsibility to consider the evidence with due deliberation but that was not fast enough for the victims father soon after they had retired to deliberate the father went on nationalmore often however the response has been that the balance argument represents fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of individual constitutional rights32 and of the nature and purpose of criminal prosecution33 the law provides field which it tries to keep level and upon which victim may seek vindication of his or her rights at the expense of an accused in most instances the victim of crime enjoys the right of civil cause of action against the perpetrator for damages injunctions and other forms of equitable relief as well as punitive damages in some cases it is here not on the criminal side opponents contend that the victims interests are relevant34 in the same vein one of the motives critics attribute to victims rights advocates is rejection of the basic premise under the american criminal justice system they suggest victims believe the criminal justice process constitutes an unjustifiable waste of time in procedure that should be reduced to identifying and then punishing suspects they consider suspect accused defendant and guilty synonymous terms process is too quick punishment sufficiently severe acquittals are an injustice35 critics say that investment of rights short of allowing the victim tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs10 television to chastise these twelve citizens for failing to

four years brandt was quoted as saying the last time the police caught the guy but the court let him go 36 see eg lamborn victim participation in the criminal justice process the proposals for constitutional amendment 34 wayne law review 125 182 185 1987a right established by the united states constitution is the supreme law of the land paramount to conflicting federal and state statutes judicial opinions and administrative regulations thus the victims constitutional right under the proposal to be present and to be heard would supersede the defendants common law or statute right to the exclusion of witnesses of course if two provisions of the constitution conflict with each other resolution of the issue is not so simple for example the defendants right to the exclusion of witnesses may have basis in the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and the fourteenth amendme nts which would conflict with the victims right to be present under the proposed amendment in such cases of conflict generally the newer provision prevails over the older and the specific provision prevails over the general thus the victims rights to be present and to be heard being both new and specific would supersede the defendants rights to the exclusion of witnesses 37 in the lamborn example just cited where the victims right to be present conflicts with the defendants constitutional right to have witnesses sequestered barred from hearing the testimony of other witnesses if the victims right is subordinate the victimwitness may be sequestered if the defendants right is subordinate the victimwitness may be allowed to be present throughout the trial if neither is subordinate and the conflict cannot be avoided eg by having the victim not testify or by calling the victim as the first witness there can be trial personally inflict punishment upon those he or she considers guilty is ever likely to balance the scales for these victims if in fact such victims exist finally the debate over an amendment to the united states constitution introduces an issue that need not have previously been considered state victims rights constitutional amendment or state or federal statute may intrude upon the rights the united states constitution affords the criminally accused federal statute or state constitutional provision can roll back the demands of due process or any of the other rights granted by the bill of rights an amendment to the united states constitution can federal victims rights amendment if so intended by definition amends any prior inconsistent provision in the constitution36 unless the proposed rights are made subordinate to defendant rights in case of conflict either defendant rights must be subordinate or prosecution in which they are in conflict must be avoided abandoned or repudiated37 obligations the need for victim participation there seems to be little dispute that shabby treatment of victims makes them less inclined to report crimes to step forward as witnesses or to otherwise participate inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs11 38 the victims veto way to increase victim impact on criminal case dispositions 77 california law review 417 1989de spite the importance of victim participation to the operation of the criminal justice system commentators have observed that crime victims are largely excluded from the system and that those victims who do participate suffer second victimization at the hands of that system the victims themselves have become increasingly dissatisfied with process that denies them prominent role in bringing an accused offender to justice they show their dissatisfaction by removing themselves from the system they fail to report crimes they fail to appear in court and at times they resort to vigilantism victim withdrawal from the criminal justice process creates public impression that the system is inefficient and unresponsive and thus exponentially increases the likelihood that more victims will be deterred from reporting crimes and testifying in court goldstein defining the role of the victim in criminal prosecution 52 mississippi law journal 515 518 1982a key assumption underlying the victims movement is that the failure of victims to cooperate with the criminal justice system has reached epidemic proportions recent statistical studies of victimization confirm what we have known for some time victims often do not report to the police the crimes that have been committed against them and the more crime we have the larger this dark figure of unreported crime becomes even when they report crimes remarkably large proportion of victims later refuse to testify which leads prosecutors to dismiss or reduce charges conversely victims often find police unwilling to investigate and prosecutors unwilling to charge in short each authorities and victims finds the other uncooperative resulting in reciprocal cycle of decline confidence in justice is eroded enforcement efforts are impeded and conviction rates when measured against crimes actually committed tumble downward 39 young constitutional amendment for victims of crime the victims perspective 34 wayne law review 51 52 1987since 1975 congress and the various state legislatures have enacted some 1500 statutes and programs designed to address the full range of concerns raised by victims however the current reports indicate that in state after state the duty to give victims interests decent consideration is rhetorical facade behind which it is bureaucratic business as usual the victims bill of rights are victims all dressed up with place to go 8 stjohns journal of legal commentary 251 27374 1992a constitutional amendment appears to be desirable it would be more forceful way of ensuring that victims in fact do have rights since it would be part of our constitution it would present minimum standard to the states and would guarantee effects victims at least that degree of protection victims would be shielded from the negative effects of legislative whim and could benefit if state legislature set out to provide victim with greater rights than the constitution would require victims rights amendment if drafted properly would also create liberty interest in victims rights as result victims would be able to enforce those rights against and obtain relief from state prosecutors and judges pursuant to section 1983 of the civil rights act victims might also be able to similarly redress these wrongs against federal officials by providing such remedy to aggrieved victims victims rights amendment would servethe process38 but here and with respect to the third justification of an amendment societys obligation to compensate for its failure to protect its citizenry the quarrel is not as much with the identification of the problem as with the selection of solution inadequacy of alternatives the adequacy of alternatives now and

plagues the area of victims rights eikenberry victims of crimevictims of justice 34 wayne law review 29 4849 even though some statutes grant victims substantial rights the rights are still subordinate to those of the defendant the rights of victims should be protected from the shifts in political priorities from year to year different issues emerge that are popular with elected officials and the public but elected officials change new constituencies arise and new issues replace the old crime victims should not have to hope for favorable political climate for their rights to be recognized this is the very reason that the framers of the constitution thought it proper to include in the very first amendments to the constitution the bill of rights protection for those accused of crimes as the supreme court stated the very purpose of bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts board of educ v barnette 319 us 624 638 1943 kyl feinstein victims rights do we need constitutional amendment to ensure fair treatment

minority views of sen thompsonthere is general federal police power accordingly it seems incongruous to have federal constitutional amendment addressing victims rights when the constitution itself

and the states are likely to object the more restrained the amendment the more victims rights advocates are likely to question its sufficiency the need for uniformity victims rights are different in every jurisdiction in the united states some find this diversity reason for an amendment to the united states constitution41 there is the implication that the presence of many individual standards contributes to the failure of existing provisions diversity breeds uncertainty that leads to failure to comply and failure to claim more recently advocates have spoken of the need for floor or baseline sometimes with and sometimes without an indication that diversity above the line is to be encouraged42 critics argue that this would essentially federalize the state criminal justice process

constitutionally enthroned victims rights amendment is the loss of more generous treatment under the law of particular state who is victim what would proposed victims right amendment to the united states constitution do large part of the answer depends upon how victims are defined for purposes of the amendment the breadth of proposal may vary according to the class of individuals and entities whose rights it seeks to protect in common parlance victim of crime is one who is adversely affected by crime the concept is fairly broad it encompasses the appealing and not so appealing victim the rape victim and the ripped off drug dealer the casualties of gang warfare both participant and bystander the middleman in pyramid scheme44 the defendant who is acquitted or whose conviction is overturned45 and the elderly person defrauded the savings of lifetime the term often contemplates parents and other members of the family of deceased incapacitated or juvenile victim in the case of property crimes it may include anyone with an interest in the property eg an owner tenant mortgage holder insurer in commercial setting it embodies those who are economically disadvantaged by crime even if they suffered direct injury to an identifiable property interest in the case of civil rights violations hate crimes and terrorism any member of the group targeted for intimidation may correctly be counted victim in the case of public solicitation for prostitution public drug trafficking and other crimes with elements of environmental nuisance anyone who lives in does business in or has occasion to visit any affected geographical area might be listed among the victims46 the various megans law efforts seem to suggest that at least in the public mind the concept of victim also may encompass potential victims under some circumstances47 finally the concept of criminal law is based upon the premise that ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs15 48 the definitions of various state victims rights statutes and constitutional provisions appear in appendix iv note that most of the state constitutional amendments leave the definition of victim either expressly to the legislature or implicitly to the legislature and the courts in several instances the definition of victim may be different for purposes of different rights so that for example corporate entity might be considered victim for purposes of restitution within particular jurisdiction but not for purposes of victim compensation 49 eg wv code 6111a2 victim means person who is victim of felony the fiduciary of deceased

effect appear to still be matter of debate at the state level the term has been fairly narrowly drawn imposing limitations based upon the nature of the crime the victim characteristics offender characteristics andor locality of the offense48 nature of the crime the concept of victim can be limited by the seriousness of the crime some state victims rights provisions exclude victims of crimes other than felonies and some are limited primarily to the victims of crimes of violence49 states that limit notification and other victims rights to victims of felonies or violent crimes nevertheless often permit restitution for the victims of property crimes50 the proposals offered in the 104th congress to amend the united states constitution spoke in terms of crimes of violence or crimes of violence and felonies but essentially left the task of defining victims to implementing legislation51 sjres 6 of the 105th congress protected victims of crime ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs16 52 the committee report on sjres 44 indicates somewhat different reading of implementing authority although the committee deleted provision that would have given the federal and state governments parallel implementing authority the congress and the states shall have the power to enforce this article within their respective jurisdictions by appropriate legislatio n it declared the committee anticipates that congress will quickly pass an implementing statute defining victim for federal proceedings moreover nothing removes from the states their plenary authority to enact definitional laws for purposes of their own criminal system since the legislatures define what is criminal conduct it makes equal sense for them to also have the ability to further refine the definition of victim srepno 105409 at 23 emphasis added this might be seen to permit state to negate the amendment by limiting the definition of victims of violent crime to coincide with pre existing state victims right coverage and more the reports subsequent description of congresss implementing authority argues for slightly less sweeping construction the federal government and the states will retain their power to implement the amendment for example the states will subject to the supremacy clause flesh out the contour s of the amendment by providing definitions of victims of crime and crimes of violence srept

short of fulfilling his minimum sentence he was paroled his victim patricia pollard was given notice but because he was bad actor not long after he was paroled he was back under arrest again this time for narcotics violations but again he was to be released the parole board had considered release again prior to the time he served his minimum sentence and again without notice to her this time however the arizona constitutio n had provided in the interim an opportunity for victims to be heard at such proceedings someone found out about it even though notice was given to patricia pollard she was ultimately given the opportunity to persuade the parole board not to parole her assailant as result he remained in jail i asked her about this i said did you fear for your life she saidmore

participation rights in juvenile proceedings runs contrary to the tradition of nonadversarial inquiry and confidentiality that attends juvenile proceedings in recent years however that tradition has yielded in the interest of protecting victims rights in some states63 historically some proposals like sjres6 in the 105th congress have provided that the rights established by this article shall apply in all federal and state proceedings including juvenile justice proceedings but have also empowered the states to enact exceptions when required for compelling reasons of public safety or for judicial efficiency in mass victim cases this language clearly anticipates that the victims rights amendment will apply in federal and state juvenile proceedings it would appear to preempt the field except for subsequently enacted provisions based on public safety or judicial efficiency more difficult to predict is the resolution of any conflicts between the rights contemplated by the amendment and constitutionally based rights of juvenile clear statement in the amendment would be dispositive64 in the absence of clear statement the courts would endeavor to construe the two rights to avoid

question in discussing the right to notice attend and be heard the report notes that the amendment extends the right to be heard to proceedings determining conditional release from custody it would include release from secure mental facility for criminal defendant or one acquitted on the grounds of insanity and that in the case of the notice due upon release or escape from custody related to the crime that the phrase related to the crime would include not only release after criminal conviction but also for example release of defendant found not guilty of crime by reason of insanity and then

think of victims as their clients or customers another possibility is to view the crime victim as consumer along with the criminal perpetrator of criminal justice services provided by the government these analogies while not perfectly fitted to the criminal justice process are useful in defining an appropriate new role for the crime victim in the criminal justice system another traditional idea that must be discarded in order to make the criminal justice system work for the victim is the legal fiction that the state rather than the victim is the injured party in criminal case as stated by

1987by constitutionally emphasizing the conflict between the victim and the accused and placing the victim in the role of quasi prosecutor or cocounsel the victims rights amendment represents dangerous return to the private blood feud mentality the original purpose of establishing the public prosecutors office was to insulate the victim from the accused and to relieve the victim of the burdens of private prosecution the time money and risk of life inherent in the private blood feud any attempt to use the constitution to enhance victims rights by placing the victim in direct conflict

357 384 1986assigning the prosecutorial function entirely to the district attorney is done for indisputably good reasons the power to prosecute is an enormous power which if abused can subject innocent citizens to great harms and costs entrusting this power to trained public official sworn to do impartial justice is arguably the best means to ensure liberty of the innocent and punishment of the guilty additionally by centralizing prosecutorial power in the public prosecuto r norms of public policy are more likely to be established thereby breeding uniformity in the law and its processprosecutors might be expressly authorized and afforded greater latitude92 or that the cultures of the police and prosecutor might be recast so they understand themselves to be the agents of the victim93 in response critics recall the unattractive features that characterized private prosecutors in the past94 the proposals might however have the unintended although not necessarily unfortunate result of bolstering the protection of the less popular segments of society police and prosecutors are publicly accountable they are popularly elected or directed and paid by those who are popularly elected the last decade stands as living proof that public officials will respond to those who speak for the battered spouse the raped woman or the abused child who would want it otherwise public

congress employed different terminology with the same apparent result they afforded participation rights for public proceedings relating to the crime there are such proceedings prior to formal accusation of defendant even after charges are brought against particular defendant much the same can be said of charges that are subsequently dropped or of charges that might have been brought but are not senator hatch addressed this point in his remarks on the senate report it is important to note that the proposed amendment does not specify at what point the rights attach or in other words at what point person becomes victim this is particularly important to the issue of dropped or uncharged counts against defendant who has committed multiple wrongs frequently criminal defendants are suspected to have committed crimes for which they are never charged or for which charges are dropped do the victims of these crimes have rights under the proposed amendment if so are they the same as the rights of the victims of charged counts or of the defendant such victims of course would have the same rights of notice and allocution relating to conditional release the acceptance of negotiated pleas perhaps substantially complicating plea bargains and sentencing while the exercise of these rights is unlikely to collide with any defendant rights the exercise of the right to an order of restitution for the victim of an uncharged count may indeed collide with the rights of the defendant srept 105409 at 4243 additional views of senate hatch 96 see appendix ix for summary of state laws

thus in charge bargaining the victim wants to insure that the defendant pleads to charge sufficiently serious to allow restitution and in sentence bargain the victim wants to advocate an award of restitution the victims second interest is retribution or revenge the victim feels he or she has been violated and that the criminals punishment should be severe therefore in charge bargain the victim

texas and bronx county new york 128 welling victim participation in plea bargaining 65 washington university law quarterly 302 1987presented with the alternative of implementing victim participation in plea bargains through the prosecutor or through the court participation through the court is preferable for three reasons first the prosecutors role in the plea bargain as well as throughout the prosecution is to represent society in contrast the victim represents only himself the interests of society and of the victim are not always identical and it is unwise to confuse the prosecutors function by obliging him or her to consider the victims interests unlike the prosecutor the court has already assumed the role of adjudicating competing interests to achieve justice and simply injecting one additional interest for consideration would not conflict with the courts previously defined role second victim participation through the court is preferable to participation through the prosecutor because recent empirical evidence indicates that institutional disincentives exist for prosecutors to consider victims interests one disincentive is that victim participation diminishes the prosecutor s power thus consultation through the prosector may be ineffective as practical matter third victim participation through the court is better than through the prosecutor because one of the interests that participation protects is the victims feeling of importance this feeling is more effectively fostered when the victim addresses the court directly rather than merely addressing one of the litigants 129 house hearing at 14445 prepared statement of ellen greenlee president national legal aid and defender associationprosecutors offices will be tied in knots they currently resolve nine out of ten criminal cases by plea agreement it is an indispensable way of managing the overwhelming crush of cases and of inducing cooperation by lowlevel offenders against their higherups letting victim block plea agreement turns case that would take few days into trial that could take few months yet victims understandable focus on just their own case could confound prosecutors ability to simultaneously juggle the thousands of other cases that they are expected to bring to satisfactory disposition the judicial system will be particularly crippled blocked plea agreements will mean massive increase in the current 10 percent of criminal cases which require fullblown and time consuming trial indigent defense systems will also find their workloads massively increased by the reductions in pleas and the increase in trials exacerbating this will be demands under the new amendment for lawyers to represent indigent victims to vindicate their new rights in the criminal system law would find himself in full accord with those who urge that plea bargaining be abolished or drastically curtailed127 victims advocates and the traditional critics of plea bargaining however rarely agree on solutions only few proponents of more extensive victims rights have argued that victims should have right to participate in plea negotiations they would prefer that the court give serious consideration to rejecting the bargains to which they object128 opponents argue that increased victim involvement in the plea negotiation process will reduce the number of plea bargains and thus

974 77 1985a second major victims rights proposal gives victims right to oppose continuances victims rights advocates frequently blame defense lawyers for obtaining continuances that unduly prolong the agony of the crime victim by rendering it impossible for victims to put their experience behind them proponents of the crime control model view so called stalling tactics of defense attorneys to be an overwhelming block to both efficiency and swift and sure punishment two hallmarks of this model while defense abuse of continuances occurs the development of both the prosecution and the defense in serious case can and does take time investigation forensic tests interviews and visits to crime scenes among other things are often timeconsuming and in many cases motions must be researched prepared and argued although many of those accused of crime turn out to be guilty investigation and preparation in even the most seemingly impossible cases occasionally do demonstrate that the accused is in fact innocent moreover rushing to judgment because of presumption of guilt serves neither the victim nor society particularly if the real culprit remains at large victims are likely to want psychological resolution of the matter but this kind of resolution does not ultimately depend on the outcome of the criminal case it is simplistic to assert that the rituals of condemnation will erase so profound an experience for an individual continuances and delays may cause victim to relive the event but victim is likely to relive portions of the event whether or not there is delay issues raised by victimization do notironically however the defendant is often the only person involved in criminal proceeding without an interest in prompt trial delay often works to the defendants advantage witnesses may become unavailable their memories may fade evidence may be lost changes in the law may be beneficial or the case may simply receive lower priority with the passage of time138 until recently victims had compara ble rights although their advocates contended they had very real interest in prompt disposition some victims sought to put traumatic episode behind them some wanted to see justice done quickly some hoped simply to end the trail of inconveniences and hardship that all too often fell to their lot as witnesses139 or so they were portrayed not everyone accepted this picture or more precisely not everyone agreed that the picture as portrayed was complete140httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs40 resolve themselves quickly reintegration and understanding of such questions as mortality meaning and responsibility take time therefore delay may be of great benefit to victims psychological state and time is necessary to heal the psychic wounds created by victimization only for those victims who completely deny or repress their experience is delay likely to be traumatizing because in having to recover the experience they will be without defenses or understanding sometimes delay enables victims to be better prepared for the evidence that will be introduced at trial endless delays and confusion can harm victims but rushing towards conclusion can be equally harmful temporal distance from the event is important to healing and treating the victim with respect may ultimately benefit the victim more than rapid process 141 larevstatann 461844 j the

and sjres 44 have not refered to employment or property rights but have entitled victims to final disposition of the proceedings relating to the crime free from unreasonable delay in the absence of further development either in its legislative history or in implementing legislation courts called upon to construe such provision might well find guidance in the supreme courts identification of the factors to be weighed when testing for unacceptable delay under the speedy trial and due process clauses length of delay reasons for the delay defendants assertion of his right and prejudice to the defendant146 other pretrial motions proceedings little focused attention seems to have been given thus far to the role victims and their interests should play in the sundry pretrial motions and proceedings other than bail or the acceptance of guilty pleas at the end of the plea bargaining process this is so even though the prompt disposition and speedy trial formulae appear to anticipate either victim participation or an increased appreciation of victim concerns in such proceedings147httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs43 trial these problems are compounded when the trial date is repeatedly postponed or the trial is moved to another city the inconveniences of lost work and travel time are in addition to the emotional stress experienced by the victim who must repeatedly prepare to testify to an often terrifying criminal act while the need to schedule an expert witness or to avoid pretrial publicity may override the victims interests in some cases the victim still should have

rights of the accused might require that the judge exercise this discretion to exclude witnesses even in the face of law purporting to grant the victim the absolute right to be present throughout the trial the judge might be required to consider such matters as whether the victim was actually witness to the alleged crime whether his testimony is likely to raise substantial issues at trial whether more than one witness is expected to testify on these issues and whether requiring that the victim be the first witness and thereafter allowing him to remain in the courtroom would adequately protect

before sentence was imposed upon convicted defendant the victims right to bring the impact of the crime upon him to the attention of the court was one of the early goals of the victims rights efforts the supreme court has struggled with the propriety of victim impact statements in the context of capital punishment cases ultimately concluding that they pose necessary infringement upon the rights of the accused163 it is said that permitting victim impact statements serves several beneficial purposes 1 to protect the victims interest in having the court order the defendant to make restitution164 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs49 damages and losses suffered by the victim 165 id victim participation can also be supported on the ground that the victim has information relevant to an informed sentencing decision statutory sentencing schemes may expressly mandate or permit that factors relating to the victim be taken into account in fashioning dispositional order in some states such schemes set forth presumptive sentences for particular offenses and specify aggravating or mitigating circumstances which the court may consider in imposing harsher or more lenient sentence than the presumptive sentence these statutorily defined aggravating or mitigating factors may include factors such as other offenders treatment of the victim during the commission of the crime the victims provocation of or consent to the crime and the harm to the victim resulting from the crime in jurisdictions where presumptive sentencing legislation has not been enacted judges still sometimes consider factors relating to the victim as aggravating or mitigating factors in the exercise of their discretionary power to impose sentences 166 booth v maryland 482 us at 520 scalia j dissentingmany citizens have found onesided and hence unjust the criminal trial in which parade of witnesses comes forth to testify to the pressures beyond normal human experience that drove the defendant to commit his crime with one to lay before the sentencing authority the full reality of human suffering the defendant has produced which and not moral guilt alone is one of the reasons society deems his act worthy of the prescribed penalty payne v tennessee the supreme court places its stamp of approva l on the use of victim impact evidence during capital sentencing proceedings 1992 brigham young university law review 841 852 payne strikes fair balance between the rights of the criminal defendant and the murder victim booth advanced the requirement that capital defendant be treated as unique individual human being as part of this treatment the defendant was allowed to introduce at the sentencing phase of trial virtually any relevant mitigating evidence while virtually limits were placed on what the defendant could introduce the state was precluded from introducing evidence about either the victims personal characteristic s or the loss to the victims family and society booth failed to realize that victim impact evidence is not inconsistent with the requirement of treating the defendant as unique individual human being to the contrary the admission of victim impact evidence makes the sentencing process more individualized by augmenting the information that the jury should consider in determining the appropriate punishment moreover fairness demands that the state be able to introduce evidence showing the victims uniqueness as an individual human being this gives the jury all the relevant information about the defendants moral guilt to make fully individualized decision based upon the personal responsibility of that particular individual mcleod victim participation at sentencing 22 criminal law bulletin 501 5067 1986two lives the defendants and the victims are

496 5023 1987the victim impact statement in this case provided the jury with two types of information first it described the personal characteristics of the victims and the emotional impact of the crimes on the family second it set forth the family members opinions and characterizations of the crime and the defendant in process designed to assess the blameworthiness of the defendant this information is irrelevant to capital sentencing decision and its admission creates constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury may impose the death penalty in an arbitrary and capricious manner 169 booth v maryland 482 us at 5056 but in some cases the victim will not leave behind family or the family members may be less articulate in describing their feelings even though their sense of loss is equally severe the fact that the imposition of the death sentence may turn on such distinctions illustrates the danger of allowing juries to consider this information certainly the degree to which family is willing and able to express its grief is irrelevant to the decision whether defendant who may merit the death penalty should live or die nor is there any justification for permitting such decision to turn on the perception that the victim was sterling member of the community rather than someone of questionable character hall victims voices in criminal court the need for restraint 28 american criminal law review 233 25960 1991some dimensions of the disparity concern are profoundly disquieting one of these is the potential for disparate sentence for the offender based upon the victims wealth some statutes provide that victim input may be presented by the victim or representative to the extent then that privately retained attorney or other compensated agent is able to present more forceful or convincing case for the victim clearly the financial wellbeing of the victim will determine whether that option is economically feasible should defendants sentence be based even in part upon the fact that the victim is wealthy perhaps meaning harsher sentence or poor likely suggesting more lenient sentence second concern is the extent to which defendants sentence or case disposition could be affected by the victims race it has been forcefully asserted at least in capital cases that sentencing of similarlysituated offenders may vary based upon the race of the victim specifically because of the selective empathy more lenient sentences may occur in blackvictim crimes than in whitevictim crimes one way to at least minimize the potential for raceofthevictim disparities in sentencing is to implement measures such as sentencing guidelines to check the exercise of discretion permitting victims to make sentence recommendations on the other hand may exacerbate the disparity of sentences by reason of that individuals race 170 booth v maryland 482 us at 507 putting aside the strategic risks of attacking the victims character before the jury in appropriate cases the defendant presumably would be permitted to put on evidence that the victim was of dubious moral character was unpopular or was ostracized from his family the prospect of minitrial on the victims character is more than simply unappealing it could well distract the sentencing jury from its constitutionally required task determining whether the death penalty is

blameless that the defense will try to impugn it what booth s opponents did not appreciate is that the same principle of relevance that makes victims personal familial and social worth pertinent evidence in aggravation makes his or her worthlessness in these respects pertinent evidence in mitigation in the sense that it might serve as basis for sentence less than death the payne principle not only allows defendants to counter proof of victims good character and of family members grief with evidence and argument that the deceased was in truth neither good nor grieved it also allows defendants to place the characte r of victim on trial even if the prosecutor did not thus besmirching the deceaseds memory whenever feasible has now become an unavoidable even if highly distasteful

rescheduled and conducted anew plea bargains rejected trials begun again unfaithful public servants exposed to civil and criminal liability inattentive governmental entities made subject to claims and court orders state victims rights provisions often disclaim any intention to create cause of action for disappointed victims andor grounds for defendant to overturn criminal proceedings against him196 as noted earlier the perceived inadequacy of state provisions have helped fuel the drive for federal constitutional amendment but the commentators have only infrequently addressed how federal constituti onal right might be most appropriately enforced some have noted that if victims rights amendment were silent on the question its demands would be enforceable against the state officials under section 1983 of the civil rights laws 42 usc 1983 and against federal officials under the bivens doctrine197 few proponents suggest that the equitable powers of the courts mandamus and

federal victims rights legislation which is couched in more general terms cause of action or defense in favor of any person 42 usc 10606c this wording would appear to avoid the problem suggested by united states v mcveigh 106 f3d 325 335 10th cir 1997 when it held that the more generous immunity grant of 10606c foreclosed the possibility of equitable relief against governmental entities or

any rights secured or protected under the federal constitution united states v lanier 520 us 259 1997explicitly deny the possibility of imposing civil sanctions upon government entities or their

proceedings 204 srept 105409 at 23 the committee anticipates that congress will quickly pass an implementing statute defining victim for federal proceedings moreover nothing removes form the states their plenary authority to enact definitional laws for purposes of their own criminal system since the legislatures define wheat is criminal conduct it makes equal sense for them to also have the ability to further refine the definition of victimof the principal reasons for enacting constitutional amendment rather than merely enacting statute is to ensure that the rights it grants are not easily denied or diluted one of the perils implicit in opting for extensive legislative powers is the prospect of unfulfilled promises it is certainly possible to draft very generally worded constitutional amendment in anticipation of future legislative refinements and these may be forthcoming but it may also happen that the refinements must be laboriously crafted through the courts because legislative resolution proves either unattainable or less than universally appealing early proposals granted congress and the state legislatures the power to enact implementing legislation within their respective jurisdictions201 over time some of the proposals began to expand the explicit legislative authority of congress202 and then to constrict the explicit legislative authority of the states203 the committee report explained however that the loss of state legislative authority was less sweeping than it might have appeared it asserts that the power to define the class of victims to whom the amendment would apply was by implication to be shared by congress and the states204 subject to preemptive federal legislation the states would be permitted to paint the scope of the amendment as broadly or ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs64 205 srept 105409 at 35 this provision is similar to existing language found in section 5 of the 14th amendment to the constitution this provision will be interpreted in similar fashion to allow congress to enforce the rights that is to insure that the rights conveyed by the amendment are in fact respected at the same time consistent with the plain language of the provision the federal government and the states will retain their power to implement the amendment for example the states will subject to the supremacy clause flesh out the contours of the amendment by providing definitions of victim of crime and crimes of violence 206 unlike previous versions of the proposed amendment which permitted states to enforce the amendment in their jurisdictions sjres 44 gives congress exclusive power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation i believe that granting congress sole power to enforce the provisions of the victims rights amendment and thus inter alia to define term such as victim and violent crime and to enforce the guarantees of reasonable notice of public proceedings and of the rights established by the amendment will be significant and troubling step towards federalization of crime and the nationalization of our criminal justice system it is possible that the victims rights constitutional amendment will lack the flexibility that is the hallmark of our federal system and perhaps in the process invalidate many state victims rights provisions such prospect should give us pause srept 105 409 at 445 additional views of sen hatch 207 the majority appears to believe that it can control some of the inevitable damage through explications in the committee report about how the amendment will operate we doubt that the courts will care much for such efforts they will look first at the plain meaning of the text of the amendment they will seek guidance in supreme court precedents interpreting provisions using similar language they will not resort to the majority report to interpret wording that is clearly understood in current legal and political circles any interpretative value of the majority report is further undermined by the inconsistency of the document which in some situations narrows the impact of the amendment and in other circumstances expands the impact of the amendment eg by devising role for states in implementing the amendment such inconsistency renders the majority report legally meaningless weaknesses in the text of the amendment cannot with any confidence be cured by the majoritys views especially not when the majoritys analysis is so directly at odds with the amendments plain language and with settled constitutional doctrine the majority report attempts to deflect the federalism concerns raised by sjres 44 by suggesting that the states will retain plenary authority to implement the amendment within their own criminal systems we find this suggestion surprising given the plain language of the amendments implementation clause in section 3 the congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation identical language in earlier constitutional amendments has been read to vest enforcement authority exclusive in the congress in the case of sjres 44 moreover the text is illuminated by the legislative history earlier drafts of the amendment expressly extended enforcement authority to the states these drafts drew fire from constitutional scholars who expressed doubt that constitutionallyauthorized state laws could be supreme over state constitutions or even over federal laws and concern that for the first time rights secured by the federal constitution would mean different things in different parts of the country the committee then amended the text to its current formulation faced with this history and text the courts will surely conclude that sjres 44 deprives states of any authority to legislate in the area of victims rights srept 105409 at 501 689 minority views of sens leahy kennedy and kohlnarrowly as they chose205 some committee members were troubled by this resolution206 some skeptical that

free the states and federal government from restrictions found in the bill of rights which would be reckless tampering with provisions that have served us very well for more than 200 years it is unclear what purpose the amendment servespreemptive and amending impact the question of the states legislatie powers to implement the victims rights amendment suggests another question how much if any of existing state victims rights law will survive an amendment under the present state of the law statutory and state constitutional provisions are confined by the bill of rights usconst art vi cl2 when their advocates have said nothing in them imperils defendants rights under the united states constitution they are right nothing could but an amendment to the united states constitution stands on different footing it amends the constitution its very purpose is to make constitutional that which would otherwise not have been208 it may uniformly subordinate defendants rights to victims rights it may require any conflicting law or constitution precipe state or federal to yield even in the absence of conflict it may preempt the field sweeping away all laws ordinances precedents and decisions compatible and incompatible alike on any matter touching upon the same subject it may have none or some of these consequences depending upon its language and the intent behind its language the principles used to interpret preemptive impact under the supremacy clause are fairly well developed preemption of state law may occur either by express provision by implication or by conflict between federal and state law and yet despite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence the court has never assumed lightly that congress does not intend to supplant state law indeed in cases where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation the court has worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress new york conference of blue cross v travelers insurance co 514 us 645 65455 1995 conversely by the virtue of the supremacy clause where the subject matter is one which the constitution relegates to the federal domain the vitality of state law is dependent upon the largess of congress and the constitution united states term limits inc v thornton 514 us 779 800 802 1995 victims rights amendment to the united states constitution that relegates the area to the federal domain confines state authority to that which the amendment permits or allows congress to permit few advocates have explicitly called for kingofthehill victims rights amendment but the thought seems imbedded in the complaint that existing law lacks uniformity how else can universal symmetry be accomplished but by implementation of single standard that fills in where preexisting law comes up short and shaves off where its generosity exceeds the standard httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs66 sjres 6 105th cong applied to federal and state proceedings and permitted the states to enact enforcement mechanisms within their jurisdictions it was otherwise silent on the amendments relationship to state law the statement accompanying its introduction implied an intent to establish minimum standards but to permit more generous laws to continue

even more explicit with respect to sjres 44 many sates have already extended rights to victims of such offenses and the amendment in way restricts such rights in other words the amendment sets national floor for the protection of victims rights not any sort of ceiling srept 105409 at 24 questions of the amendments impact on the rights afforded the accused may not be so easily discerned the principles of construction called into play in the case of conflict between victims rights amendment and rights established elsewhere in the constitution are similar to those used to resolve federalstate conflicts intent of the drafters is paramount the courts will make every effort to reconcile apparent conflicts between constitutional provisions cf vimar seguros reasdeguros v sky reefer 515 us 528 533 1995 in the case of unavoidable conflict between provisions of equal dignity the latest in time prevails fitzpatrick v bitzer 427 us 445 1976 if there is an unavoidable conflict between right granted by an adopted victims rights amendment and some other portion of the constitution the most recently adopted provision will prevail sjres 6 was designed to eliminate the unfair treatment that results because the criminal justice system permits the defendants constitutional rights always to trump the protection given to victims yet to do so in manner that will not deny or infringe any constitutional right of any person accused or convicted of crime 143 congrec s56061 daily ed jan 21 1997re marks of sen kyl in instances of unavoidable conflict between victim and defendant rights this seems to mean the prosecution must yield the text of sjres 6 hardly defeats this interpretation with the assurance that the amendment is not to provide grounds for the accused or convicted offender to obtain any form of relief since the rights of the accused come not from the victims rights amendment but from the sixth amendment or some other source within the constitution sjres 44 was left in somewhat different posture when the committee explicitly rejected change in the amendment that would have stated that nothing in this article shall be construed to deny or diminish the rights of an accused as guaranteed by this constitution srept 105409 at 38 the refusal to accept the amendment might have been read to mean that in the case of unavoidable conflict victims rights should prevail over defendants rights the text of the report however appeared to repudiate such an interpretation by rejecting the laterintime analysis andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97735crs67 209 srept 105409 at 223 the crime victims rights amendment creates rights not in opposition to those of defendants but in parallel to them the parallel goal in both instances is to erect protections from abuse by state actors thus must as defendants have sixth amendment right to speedy trial the crime victims rights amendment extends to victims the right to consideration of their interest in trial free from unreasonable these rights cannot collide since they are both designed to bring criminal proceedings to close within reasonable time if any conflict were to emerge courts would retain ultimate responsibility for harmonizing the rights at stake in this respect the committee found unpersuasive the contention that the courts will woodenly interpret the lateradopted crime victims rights amendment as superceding provisions in previouslyadopted ones such cannon of construction can be useful when two measures address precisely the same subject but rigid rule of constitutional interpretation requires giving unblinking precedence to later enactments on separate subjects and the committee does not believe such rule would or should be applied in this instance instead the committee trusts the courts to harmonize the rights of victims and defendants to ensure that both are appropriately protected the courts have for example long experience in accommodating the rights of the press and the public to attend trial with the rights of defendant to fair trial the same sort of accommodations can be arrived at to dissipate any tension between victims and defendants rights although critics may have questioned whether the courts would always be able to dissipate any tension between victims and defendants rights the fairtrialfreepress area may indicate how infrequently truly unavoidable conflicts were likely to occur for general discussion see twentyeighth annual review of criminal procedure public access 87 georgetown law journal 1641 1999by using
