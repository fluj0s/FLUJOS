especially cwa section 404 which has been criticized by landowners for intruding on private landuse decisions and im posing excessive economic burdens environmentalists view these programs as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems and they are concer ned about court rulings that narrowed regulatory protection of we tlands and about related ad ministrative actions many stakeholders desire clarifica tion of the acts regulatory jurisdiction but they differ on what solutions are appropriate in the 110th congress committees held hearings on legislation that seeks to provide that clarification hr 2421 s 1870 other issues discussed in this report that also have been of interest in congress include implementation of current programs to manage stormwater discharges

clean water act summary of the law by claudia copelandwater quality issues in the 110th congress oversight and implementation introduction although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established 30plus years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of th nations waters longstanding problems persist and new problems have emerged water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ra nches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to point source discharges of metals and organic and inorganic toxic substances from fact ories and sewage treatment plants the principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters is the fe deral water pollution control act pl 92500 enacted in 1972 commonly known as the clean water act or cwa it consists of two major parts regulatory provisions th at impose progressively more stringent requirements on industr ies and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and pr ovisions that authoriz federal financial assistance for municipal wast ewater treatment plant cons truction both parts are supported by research activities plus pe rmit and enforcement provisions programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency epa state and local governments have ma jor responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standardsetting permitting and enforcement1 the water quality restoration objec tive declared in the 1972 act was accompanied by statutory goals to elimin ate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain wher ever possible waters deemed fishable and swimmable by 1983 although those goals have not been fully achieved considerable progress has been made especially in controlling conventional pollutants suspended solids bacteria nd oxygenconsuming materials discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants heavy metals inorganic and organic chemicals which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in very small amounts at the partsperbillion level moreover efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources termed nonpoint source pollution rainfall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example are more recent given the earlier emphasis on point source pollution discharges from industria l and municipal

growing concern as of 2003 45 states had issued partial or statewide fish or shellfish consumption advisories because of elevated mercury levels the last major amendments to the law were the water qua lity act of 1987 pl 1004 these amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments since 1972 authorizations of appropria tions for some programs provided in pl 1004 such as general grant assistance to states res earch and general epa support authorized in that law expired in fy1990 and fy1991 au thorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 none of th programs has lapsed however as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement them epa states industry and other c itizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals which have been widely supported by the public but tely some have questione d whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth th costs criticism has come from industry which has been the longstanding focus of the acts regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and cos tly requirements criticism also has come from developers and property righ ts groups who contend that federal regulations particularly the acts wetlands permit program are costly intrusion on private landuse decisions states and cities have traditionally s upported water quality programs and fe deral funding to assist them in carrying out the law but many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates many environmental groups be lieve that further finetuni ng is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems congressional activity after pl 1004 following enactment of amendments in 1987 major cwa legislative activity occurred until the 104th congress 1995 the house approved comprehensive reauthorization bill hr 961 that was opposed by environmentalists and the clinton administration hr 961 would have ame nded many of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33800crs3 regulatory and standards pr ovisions of the law require d epa to use extensive new risk assessment and costbenefit procedures and increased flexibility with regulatory relief from current clean water programs critics said that th bill would undermine the existing framework for protecting us waters the senate did not take up hr 961 or other cwa legislation t hus legislation was enacted since the 104th congress comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced but beginning in the 106th congress number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues and programs in the law have been enacted congress first passed bill to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and coastal waters monitoring programs pl 106 284 congress also passed bill pl 106 457 that reauthorized several existing cwa programs ie chesapeake bay cleanup clean lakes and the national estuary program and bill to authorize cwa grant funding for wet weather sewerage projects included as provision of th fy2001 consolidated appropriations bill pl 106554 the 107th congress enacted the great lakes legacy act pl 107303 it amended existing great lakes provisions cwa section 118 to authorize 50 million annually for fy 2004fy 2008 for epa to ca rry out projects to remediate sediment contamination in the great lakes the bill also reauthorized cwa provisions concerning the lake cham plain basin program section 120 the 108th congress enacted legislation amending the act to extend the national estuary program nep cwa section 320 through fy2010 pl 108399 the nep authorized by the 1987 cwa amendments is direct ed at improving the quality of estuaries of national importance the 109th congress enacted two cwa meas ures in december 2005 congress passed hr 3963 hrept 109293 author izing 40 million per year to extend the long island sound program in section 119 of the act for six years through fy2010 president bush signed it on december 22 2005 pl 109137 in november 2006 congress passed hr 6121 b ill to reauthorize the lake pontchartrain basin program in section 121 of the act through fy2011 president bush signed it on december 12 pl 109392 since the 107th congress the dominant cwa issue has been water infrastructure financing ie extension and modificati on of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewat er treatment projects house and senate committees have approved b ills but none has been enacted because of varied controversies see authorization of wast ewater infrastructure funding below in addition to the enacted legislation desc ribed here throughout this period since the 1987 amendments number of bills dealing with other specific cwa programs have been reported by house and senate committees some of these were passed by one house of the congress but were not enacted the remainder of this repor t discusses key cwa issues that were of particular interesting during the 110th congress including legislation that was introduced in several of the areas it first discusses issues that were most prominent on the cwa agenda in congress including water infra structure funding regulatory protection ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33800crs4 wetlands regulating wastewater discharges from vessels and extension of the great lakes legacy act it then discusses veral other issues of interest stormwater discharges management of sewer overflows wastewater security management of nonpoint sources of pollution and regula tion of waste discharges from animal feeding operations the repor t concludes with brief discussion of appropriations for water quality programs legislative issues in the 110th congress the year 2007 marked the 35th anniversary of passage of the clean water act and 20 years since the last major amendments to the law while as noted there has been measurable clean water progress as result of the act observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain however there is less agreement about what soluti ons are needed and whether new legislation is required several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained ensuring that progress made to date is not lost through diminished attention to water quality needs and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law many issues that might be addr essed involve making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of the economy taking ac tion when there is technical or scientific uncertainty and allocating governmental responsibilities for implementing the law these factors partly explain why congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs rather than taking up comprehensive propo sals other factors also are at work these include general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the house and the senate lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation and since the terrorist attacks of sept ember 11 2001 more prominent congressional focus on security terrorism and iraq war i ssues than on many other topics including environmental protection as result of the 2006 midterm ections and changed congressional leadership many observers anticipated that the 110th congress would pursue oversight of clean water and other environmental programs particular legislative focus is water infrastructure financing legi slation specifically reauthorization of the acts financial aid program also on th congressional agenda was consideration of the geographic reach of the clean water act over the nations waters and wetlands in light of court rulings including two supreme court decisions that have narrowed the laws regulatory jurisdiction but in ways that are somewhat unclear number of other issues of interest incl uded implementation of current programs to manage stormwater discharg and nonpoint sources of pollution as these are major contributors to

authorization of water infrastructure funding meeting the nations needs to build upg rade rebuild and repair wastewater infrastructure is significant element in achieving the clean water acts water quality objectives the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant constr uction is key contributor to that effort since 1972 congress has provided more than 78 billion to assist cities in constructin g projects to achieve the acts requirements for secondary treatme nt of municipal wage equivalent to 85 reduction of wastes or more stringen t treatment where required by local water quality conditions state and local govern ments have spent more than 25 billion of their own funds for construction as well still funding needs remain very hi gh an additional 2025 billion nationwide for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states released in january 2008 an 86 increase above the estimate reported four years ago4 epa reported several reasons for increased needs problems due to aging infrastructure treatment plant improvements needed to meet more protec tive water qua lity standards and additional capacity required to handle wet weather fl ows this current estimate includes 1344 billion for wastewater treatment and coll ection systems 105 billion more than the previous

overview and background by claudia copelandabout 1 billion annually at issue has b een what the federal role should be in assisting states and cities especially in view of such high projected funding needs debate over the nature of the na tions efforts regarding wastewater infrastructure was central and controversia l part of the 1987 amendments to the act the amendments extended through fy1990 th traditional title ii program of grants for sewage treatment project construction under which th federal share was 55 of project costs the 1987 law initiated prog ram of grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds srfs which are loan programs in new title vi states are required to deposit an amount equal to at least 20 of the federal capitalization grant in the fund established under title vi under the revolving fund concept monies used for wastewater trea tment construction woul d be repaid by loan recipients to the states repayment was not required for grants under the t itle ii program to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing the expectation in 1987 was that the federal contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financing by fy1995 although most states believe that the srf is working well early funding and administrative problems and continuing large funding needs have delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility thus srf issues have been prominent on the clean water act reauthorization agenda in recent congresses6 srf monies may be used for specified activities including making loans for as much as 100 of project costs at or below market interest rates including interest free loans to buy or refinance cities bt obligation or as source of revenue or security for payment of principal and in terest on stateissued bond srf monies also may be used to provide loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities loans made by state from its srf are to be used first to assure progress towards the goals of the act and in particular on proj ects to meet the standards and enforceable requirements of the act after states ach ieve those requirements of the act srf monies also may be used to implement nonpoint pollution mana gement and national estuary programs since the srf program began states have used 26 billion to assist more than 8650 nonpoint management projects none has gone to estuary management activities all states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving srf capitalization funds under title vi many have complained that the srf program is undul complicated by federal rules even though congress had intended that states were to have greater flexibility congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the acts water quality objectives while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the srf program in meeting such needs although there has been some criticism of the srf program and debate continues over specific concerns

and analysis of key issues by claudia copeland and mary tiemann 10 us environmental protection agency sustainable water infrastructure for the 21st century see httpwwwepagovwaterinfrastructureone issue of continuing interest is impacts on small communities these entities in particular have found it difficult to participate in the srf loan program since many are characterized by narrow or weak tax bases limited or access to capital markets lower relative household inco mes and higher per capita needs they often find it harder to borrow to meet their capital needs and pay relatively high premiums to do so meeting the special needs of small towns through reestablished grant program other funding s ource or loan program with special rules has been an issue of interest to congress because remaining clean water funding needs are still so large nationally at issue is whether and how to extend srf ssistance to address those needs how to allocate srf funds among the states and how to prioritize projects and funding additionally there is concern about th adequacy of srf or other funding specifically for highcost projects d ealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment epa estimates that the cost of projects to control wer overflows from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems and manage stormwater r unoff is nearly 64 billion nationwide and more recently wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten water infrastructure systems9 bush administration officials have said that infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its own and the presidents budget for several years has advanced the concep t that federal funding would cease after 2011 and that state and local selffinancing would occur thereafter while saying that federal and state funding can help water utilities meet futu re needs epas principal water infrastructure initiative has been to support other types of responses to help ensure that investment needs are met in an efficient timely and equitable manner in particular since 2003 epa has promoted strategies that it terms the four pillars of sustainable infrastructure based on concepts of better management fullcost pricing efficient water use and watershed approaches to protection10 p i s pursuing sustainable infrastructure leadership initiative in partnership with water utilities to promote the four pillars the purpose of the initiative is to identify new and better ways of doing business in the wa ter and wastewater i ndustries and promote them widely and thus ensure sustainability of water systems for example epa is working to encourage rate structures that lead to full cost pricing and will support water metering and other conservation measures ep also is encouraging consumers to use waterefficient products g residential bath room products with the intent of reducing nationa l water and wastewater infrastructure needs by reducing projected water demand and wastewater flow thus allowing deferral or downsizing of capital projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33800crs9 legislative responses congress has consider ed water infrastructure funding issues several times since the 107th congress in that congress house and senate committees approved bills to extend the acts srf program and increase federal assistance hr 3930 s 1961 s rept 107228 report on hr 3930 was not filed neither bill receive d further action in large part due to controversies over application of prevailing wage requirements of the da visbacon act and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states the issue of the applicability of the davisbacon act to srffunded projects has affected consideration of water infrastructure legi slation for some time because that act has both strong supporters and cr itics in congress cr itics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition while supporters say that it helps stab ilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditions under the original srf program authoriz ation enacted in 1987 the davisbacon act applied to socalled first use monies provided by stat from its srf that is loans made from initial federal capitalization grants but not subsequent monies provided from repayments to the srf when that authorization expired at the end of fy1994 davisbacon requirements also expired t hus the recent issue has been whether to restore the applicability of those requirements in the 108th congress four bills to reauthorize the clean water act srf program were introduced s 170 s 2550 h r 20 hr 1560 in addition separate bills to reauthorize funding for sewer overflow grants cwa section 221 were introduced hr 784 s 567 in octobe r 2004 the senate environment and public works committee reported legislation aut horizing 4125 billion over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastruct ure programs including 20 billion for the clean water srf program s 2550 srept 108386 the bill included new formula for statebystate allocation of clean water srf grants renewal of the clean water acts sewer overflow grant program and provisions such as extended loan repayments and subsidies for disadvantaged communities prior to the senate committees action in july 2003 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment approved hr 1560 legislation similar to hr 3930 the bill approved by that committee in the 107th congress but further action occurred hr 1560 did not include language specifying that the davisbac on act shall apply to srffunded projects while s 2550 did include such requirement other factors that clouded these bills were administration opposition to authorization levels in both bills and disputes over funding allocation formulas in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 the water infrastructure fi nancing act in july 2005 srept 109 186 the bill was similar to s 2550 in the 108th congress it would have authorized 20 billion for grants to capitalize the cl ean water act srf pr ogram and 15 billion for safe drinking water act srfs th rough fy2010 as approved by the committee s 1400 would have revised the cwa formul for statebystate allocation of srf monies and also specified that the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act shall apply to all projects financed from an srf as similarly provided in the committees bill in the 108th congress further action on this bill occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33800crs10 11 for background information on this earlier legislation see crs report rl32503 water infrastructure financing legisla tion comparison of s 2550 and hr 1560 by claudia copeland and mary tiemann 12 the original version of hr 720 approved by the transportation and infrastructure committee on february 7 authorized 20 billion over fy2008fy2012 for the srf program in order to comply with budget compliance rules of the house the committee approved substitute version of the bill on march 1 with lower authorization level over fouryear period the substitute also include s provision restoring vessel tonnage duties that were in effect from 1990 to 2002 on certain cargocarrying vessels that enter or depart from us ports the additional tonnage duties ar intended to offset the cost of hr 720for some time interest has been growing in identifying and developing new mechanisms to help localities pay for wate r infrastructure proj ects beyond federal grants or srfs which appear insufficient to fully meet funding needs in june 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearings on alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at the first hearing w itnesses focused on one way to increase funding for water infrastructure that has recently been advocated by some groups creating national clean water trust fund that would c onceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying potential revenue sources that would be deemed fair and equitable the second hearing addressed other financ ing options such as expanded use of taxexempt private activ ity bonds and more fficient management techniques such as asset management programs and sustainable infrastructure initiatives in the 109th congress legislation was introduced to establish 75 billion federal trust fund for wa stewater infrastructure improvements this bill hr 4560 proposed to use concept for funding ch projects that has been promoted by wastewater treatment industry offici als other stakeholders and some environmentalists who argu it could provide new source of money for necessary system upgrades amid dwind ling federal funds the bill contemplated system of user fees to create the fund but the source of revenue was not specified in the bill congress did not act on this legislation 110th congress wastewater infrastructure financing again received attention in the 110th congress in march 2007 the house approved three bills addressing the following issues however the senate did not act on any of them hr 720 the water quality fina ncing act of 2007 was passed by the house on march 9 2007 it is s ubstantially similar to legislation that the house transportation and infrastructure committees water resources and environment subcommittee approved in the 108th congress hr 156011 it would authorize 14 billion for the clean water srf program for fy2008fy201112 it includes several provisions intended to benefit economically disadvantaged and small communities such as allowing extended loan repayments 30 years rather than 20 and additional subs idies eg principal forgiveness and negative interest loans for communities that meet states affordability criteria it includes provisions to require communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to develop and implementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33800crs11 13 these amounts do not reflect an amendment approved during committee markup to reduce all authorizations in the bill by 2an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure that is being financed one key difference between this bill and the earlier legislation is the specification in hr 720 that the davisbacon act prevailing wage requirement shall apply to all projects financed in whole or in part through an srf this issue was extensively debated during subcommittee and full committee markups of the bill nd amendments to delete the requirement and to request gao study of impacts of the davis bacon act were defeated hr 720 includes provisions requesting that gao prepare report for c ongress on alternative public and private mechanisms to fund wate r infrastructure and report on potential funding mechanisms for clean water trust fund during debate on the bill the house rejected an amendment that would have deleted the davisbacon requirement s in the bill and adopted several other amendments including one di recting epa to study us and canadian wastewater discharges to the great lakes and another

financed in whole or in part through an srf regulatory protection of wetlands how best to protect the nations remaining wetlands and regulate activities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious environmental policy issues especially in the context of the cwa which contains key wetlands regulatory tool the permit program in section 404 it requires landowners or developers to obtain permits for disposal of dredged or fill material that is generated by construction or similar activity into navigable waters of the united states including wetlands section 404 has evolve d through judicial interpretation and regulatory change to become one of th principal federal tools used to protect wetlands although that term appears onl once in section 404 itself and is not defined there at the same time its implementation has come to be seen as intrusive and burdensome to those whose activities it regulates at issue today is how to address criticism of the s ection 404 regulatory progra m while achieving desired goals of wetlands protection14 unlike the rest of the act the permit as pects of section 404 are administered by the us army corps of engineers rather than epa although the corps uses epa environmental guidance other federal agencies including the us fish and wildlife service fws and natural resource c onservation service nrcs have more limited roles in the corps permitting decisions tension has existed for many years between the regulation of activities in we tlands under section 404 and related laws on the one hand and the desire of landowners to devel op property that may include wetlands on the other hand the conflicts over wetlands regula tion have for the most part occurred in administrative proceedings as congress has not amended section 404 since 1977 when it provided exemptions for categories of routine activities such as normal farming and forestry controversy has grown over the extent of federal jurisdic tion and impacts on private prope rty burdens and delay of permit procedures and roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits judicial proceedings involving section 404 one issue involving long standing controversy and litigation is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waters wetlands wh ich are not physically adjacent to navigable surface waters often appear to provide only some of the values for which wetlands are protected ch as flood control or water purification even if they meet the t echnical definition of wetland on january 9 2001 the

from this decision remains unclear even five years after the ruling in part because of different interpretations of swancc reflected in subsequent fe deral court cases while it continues to be difficult to fully assess how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected as result of the swancc decision and other possible changes the remaining responsibility to protect affect ed wetlands falls on states and localities15 environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner gr oups welcomed the ruling policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal re gulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly the governments view on this key question was expressed in epacorps guidance issued in january 2003 it provide s legal interpretati on essentially based on narrow reading of the courts decision thus allowing federa l regulation of some isolated waters to continue but it calls for more headquarters review in disputed cases administration press releases say that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it is apparent that the issues remained under review b ecause at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm seeking comment on how to define waters that are under ju risdiction of the regulatory program16 the anprm did not actually propose rule change s but it indicated possible ways that clean water act rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction building on swancc and some subsequent legal decisions the government received more than 133000 comments on the anprm most of them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying th at the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and thus narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought chan ges to clarify interpretation of swancc in

21 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped that the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal jurisdiction the courts ruling was issued on june 19 2006 rapanos v united states 547 us 715 2006 in 54 decision plura lity of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and rema nd the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the s ubstantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices17 legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding which wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one lik ely result is more caseby case determinations and tinuing litigation there also could be renewed pressure on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking on june 5 2007 nearly one year after the rapanos ruling epa and the corps issued guidance to enable their field staffs to make cwa jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision18 according to the guidance the agencies will assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters such as traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands jurisdiction over ot hers such as nonnavigable tributaries that do not typically flow yearround and we tlands adjacent to such tributaries will be determined on casebycase basis to termine if the waters in question have significant nexus with traditional navigable water the guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whet her there is significant nexus the guidance is not intended to increase or decrease cwa ju risdiction and it does not supersede or nullify the 2003 guidance discussed above which addressed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of swancc in accompanying documents epa and the corps said that the administration was considering rulemaking in response to the rapanos decision but they noted that developing new rules to interpret the decision would take more time than issuing the guidance they also noted that while the 2007 guidance provides more clarity for how jurisdictional dete rminations will be made concerning nonnavigable

pollutants that can harm water quality including oil and grease heavy metals pes ticides soil and sediment in pl 1004 congress established firm deadlines and pr iorities for epa to require permits for

limited and inconsistent to permit assessing the costs of the stormwater program25 stormwater issues were addressed in one provision of omnibus energy legislation in the 109th congress as the march 2003 compliance deadline approached for phase ii small construction sites to comply with stormwater permit rules epa proposed twoyear extensi on of those rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact on that particular industry in march 2005 epa again extended the deadline until june 2006 during this time congress considered legislative solution which it enacted in section 323 of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 it provides permanent exemption from stormwater runoff rules for the construction of exploration and production f acilities by oil and gas companies or the roads that service those sites industry officials said that epas original stormwater rule created costly permitting requirements even though the s hort construction peri od for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater runo ff pollution the enacted provision makes epas temporary delay permanent and makes it applicable to construction activities at all oil and gas development and produc tion sites regardless of size including those covered by an earlier phase i of th stormwater program opponents argued that the provision did not belong in the energy

estimates of management costs are not ava ilable because so much depends on the sitespecific nature of problems and solu tions however in 1994 epa estimated that current and planned spending by privat sources states and cities under provisions of current law is between 750 million and 11 billion per year without adequate funding to implement stat management plans it is doubtful that much will be achieved under section 319 to c ontrol nonpoint source pollution because agricultural activities are known to be significant source of nonpoint pollution nationwide the adequacy of effo rts to address these sources has received much attention questions have been ra ised about the 319 grant programs efficacy and overlap with farm bill conservation f unding in particular the white house office of management and budget mb found that epa had not demonstrated results under the program and has urged th agency to shift its focus away from implementing projects in agricultural areas and toward implementing plans in impaired waters state officials have been concerned that omb is not fully aware of the extent to which section 319 funds ddress range of nonpoint pollution control needs beyond the agricultural sector strategy concerning animal feeding operations as noted previously epas water quality reports identify agricultural activities as the leading contributor to water quality impairments nationwide animal feeding operations afos are only subset of the agriculture category but because more than onehalf of the states specifically identify afos as contributing to impairments public and policy attention has increased on how to minimize public hea lth and environmenta l impacts of runoff from them afos are agricultural facilities that confine livestock and their feeding activities thus concentra ting animal populations and waste animal waste is frequently applied to land for disposal and to utilize the nutrient value of manure to benefit crops if not managed properly however it can pose risks to water quality and public health contributing pollutants such as nutrients sediment pathogens and ammonia to the environment clean water regulations issued in the 1970s required discharge permits for the largest afos termed confined animal feeding operations cafos however epa acknowledged that compliance and enforcem ent of these permit rules was poor less than onethird of covered facilities actually have permits and that the regulations themselves were outdated in december 2002 epa issued revised rules to regulate waste discharges from cafos among the key elements the rules include requirements for development of nutrient management plans to better manage land application of manure ep estimated that 15500 cafos w ould be regulated by the rule at an
