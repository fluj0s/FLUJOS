6108c04 shspec34 methodology of auditing notdoingness and occlusion its impossible to have judgment in auditing if ones trs are out and one is worried about making mistakes in application of the tech on running brackets problem may be that the outer legs of the bracket may not be real to him at first reality on these legs may develop as he runs the process this happens because of the dynamics as he is audited the pc gains reality on the other dynamics besides the first dynamic the pcs ability to reach is directly reflected in his ability to conceive of someone else having an idea or action so as you run the process the command you started with can be too narrow and limiting as the pcs ideas reach further and the commands could need to be enlarged more legs could be added each leg of the command stands as an individuated unit without interchange among legs each in fact could be run as an individual command in view of the fact that it doesnt harm anybody to run an unreality as long as they are moving towards reality it would be ok to run all legs of the bracket from the outset try to choose bracket and command wordings all of which fall remember that if you choose command that restricts the pc you limit his gains also the pc will tend to look at the legs not being run as his reality comes up he will have to withhold himself from those areas tending to put them on automatic an auditing command can be broadened it shouldnt be made more particular and specific if in doubt take the broadest form and run it from the outset running one which is too restricted can turn on somatics its legitimate to change the targets flows etc but not the basic form dont change how to when or could to would you can drop portions of the command too as long as in so doing you are removing particularization when the pc gets very free on flows you can drop out the legs and go to the simplicity of eg get the idea of verb an aberration is located as total imprisonment total individuation auditing commands resolve the degree of imprisonment and individuation as the degree lessens you may lose ta on one leg of the process but now have it elsewhere the ta ceases to move when the targets of the process are flat so the rule is before leaving the command check it out for all variations which might produce new action remember that the reactive mind is an idiot so you could miss something because of wrong pronoun or whatever the biggest barrier in dissemination is notdoingness and misdoingness there is an old unresolved philosophic question about the value of notdoingness to do or not to do which is better the active or the passive life if you do you get into trouble if you dont do you get into trouble theres confusion on either side for instance lrh had problem as writer whether to be super nasty if he was criticized or to be nice and let himself be criticized thus protecting his markets and friends there are contradictory lessons in this of course neither answer is right the missing datum is that they are both overts longest continuous overt is notdoingness have you ever noticed the randomity that can be produced by missing datum in problem false datum can cause some confusion but look at what missing datum on the subject of the mind has done how about missing beingness this is nearultimate in notdoingness the ultimate of course is forgetting youre not only doing nothing youre not there to do it and youve forgotten this really produces confusion thetan never ceases to try to have an effect on something to put axiom 10 in effect matter how many trillenia have gone by you are trying to process someone who is in the middle of 10000 continuous overts of omission doing something is apparently the least damaging type of overt thus withhold seems to be the more therapeutic side of ow its his notdoingness which weighs on his case doingness and notdoingness are not data of comparable magnitude notdo is enormously greater thats why people who stop doing even if what they have been doing is nasty crash when they stop thats also why men die before women underneath it all thetan knows hes important to life and knows its an overt not to participate the only greater overt is to forget this is still an attempt to create an effect so theres gradient scale of effect creation 1 you do something to have an effect axiom 10 2 you create an effect by not doing something 3 you create an effect by being absent 4 you create an effect by forgetting what degree of randomity could you produce by forgetting whole lifetime quite bit and its an overt and the fellow realizes its an overt thats the reason for whole track occlusion the overt of forgetting the law behind all this is that the thetan never ceases to have an effect on those targets he has chosen and the only thing that could ever pry him loose from those fixated effects is something like scientology he is imprisoned to the degree that he is still trying to have hopeless effect on something he is his own jailer forgetting it prevents it from ever being asised if ow can stall case how much more can it be stalled by not being there the withhold of self how much can it be stalled by withhold from self and being there and from doingness and from the subject and from any knowledge of the subject and from any communication with any beingness of the subject etc thats why the more occluded case is the harder it is to audit so you run cases on what wouldnt you mind forgetting this gets off withholds or as general pattern for command what confusion wouldcould forgettingness create weve looked on forgettingness as sort of passive thing weve looked on notdoingness as the natural state of beingness seeing them as overts opens up new zones for processing
