security income ssi or other social security benefits while in foster care ssi benefits are available under title xvi of the social security act for certain disabled children from families with low incomes and minimal assets social security benefits may be paid under title ii of the act to the children of workers who have retired become disabled or died federal regulations require that in most cases the social security administration ssa select and assign representative payeean individual organization or government entitythat manages ssi and social security payments for children including those in foster care nearly all states designated as the representative payee for foster child use the childs benefits to support the child in foster care in washington state department of social and health services v guardianship estate of keffeler hereafter keffeler the supreme court held that the process used by the state of washington to keep the social security benefits received as childs representative payee was not prohibited by the social security act the court also concluded that the use of funds for reimbursement for foster care services was consistent with the acts provisions that such funds be spent for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and within the regulatory definition of current maintenance ie food clothing shelter medical care and personal comfort items although the keffeler decision supports states practice of using ssi and other social security benefits for reimbursement of foster care some child advocates assert that by using these benefits to reimburse the cost of foster care the state agency denies the child beneficiaries funding that rightly belongs to them advocates also raise concern that child welfare agencies are often automatically assigned as the representative payee for foster children on the other hand child welfare agencies and other advocates argue that if states were not able to use benefits to pay for childs foster care they would stop screening ch ildren to determine their eligibility for these social security programs they further raise the concern that if foster childs ssi benefits were allowed to accumulate in savings account the child would soon surpass the means test for ssi and would lose eligibility for the benefits changes governing how child welfare agencies are assigned as representative payees or how they use the social security benefits of foster children would require congressional action the foster children selfsupport act hr 1104 introduced in february 2007 would prohibit the use of ssi or title ii social security benefits to reimburse state for foster care maintenance payments require state child welfare agencies to screen foster children for benefits and for any foster child already receiving benefits it would also require the state to develop plan to conserve benefits not necessary for the immediate needs of the child to enable the child to achieve selfsupport after leaving foster care finally the bill would exempt these conserved funds from the ssi means test at least two statescalifornia and new mexicohave recently proposed legislation to give qualified foster youth

attention to the case of john g north carolina foster child who receives social security survivors benefits has renewed debate concerning the use of foster childrens social security payments to fund their foster care1 john g was at risk of losing the modest house he inherited from his deceased father if mortgage payments are not made the county in which he resides was designated by the social security administration to manage his survivors benefits arguing that the benefits should be used to cover the costs of his foster care the county has declined to use them to make the mortgage payments county court judge ruled that the county must pay the mortgage and in november 2007 the court of appeals affirmed this ruling 2 about 512000 children were in foster care on the last day of fy2006 due to incidents of abuse neglect or other reasons that prevented them from remaining with their parents of these youth approximately 30000 received supplemental security income ssi or other social security benefits under titles ii and xvi of the social security act 3 the social security administration ssa may designate government entity as the representative payee of foster child if the childs custodial or noncustodial parents guardians relatives stepparents or close friend are not available to serve in that role as the representative payee the state like any other representative payee is required to manage the childs benefits and to use the benefits for the current maintenance food clothing shelter medical care and personal comfort items of the child nearly all states use ssi andor other social security benefits to pay for foster care among 31 states that were able to report on their use of these benefits in state fy2002 these benefits totaled 95 million in recent years some child welfare advocates have legally challenged the practice of using foster childrens ssi and other social security benefits to reimburse states for the cost of providing their foster care the most prominent case washington state department of social and health services v guardianship estate of keffeler reached the us supreme court which in 2003 upheld this practice 4 nonetheless the keffeler decision did raise some questions about the federal governments role in regulating the use of social security and ssi payments to fund foster care and some advocates remain concerned about

the federal government has established certain requirements related to state provision of foster care that are applicable to all children in foster care these include that state has written case plan detailing among other things where the child is placed and what services are to be provided to ensure that permanent home is reestablished for the child further for each child in foster care this plan must be reviewed on regular basis including review by judge less often than every 12 months for many children who enter foster care returning to their parents is the way permanence is reestablished for some children however it is not safe or possible to reunite with their parents in those cases states must work to find adoptive parents or legal guardians who can provide permanent home and family

although some states do pay lesser amounts to relatives who provide foster care for nontitle ive eligible children 16 in most cases maintenance payments to support foster children who are not title ive eligible must be supplied by the state or local government and cannot be supported by other federal programs or those programs authorized under title ivb of the social security act17 states may

and mental health and developmental needs recent data from the national survey of child and adolescent wellbeing nscaw found that more th an onequarter of children in foster care for one year were reported by their caregivers to have recurring physical or mental health problem the same study also found that the vast majority of children who have spent one year in outof home care have substantial social and cognitive impairments49 given their health and mental health needsand the fact that most foster children would be expected to meet the income and resources requirements for ssi receiptit is possible that at least some foster children who would be eligible for ssi are not receiving benefits this may be attributable to two factors first not all children in foster care may have been screened for ssi eligibility among the 25 states that responded to recent american public human services association aphsa survey of state child welfare agencies regarding their ssi screening practices 18 reported routinely screening foster children for ssi eligibility while the remaining seven indicated that screening might be done but was not routine 50 an agency may also decide not to pursue ssi eligibility for given foster child if the agency determines receipt of title ive federal foster care benefit better serves the child on the other hand ssi eligibility once determined may be

including law regulations and policies on the title ive foster care program states that there is prohibition against claiming both an ssi benefit and title ive supported foster care maintenance payment51 however the policy manual notes that the amount of the foster care maintenance payment received will reduce childs ssi benefit dollar for dollar thus if childs total monthly foster care maintenance payment is 500and that mainte nance payment is in part paid with federal title ive dollarsthen the childs ssi benefit would be reduced by 500 52 for children in foster care who do not qualify for title ive foster care support states must find other sources of funding to pay for that child most nontitle ive eligible children in foster care must be supported with state or local dollars such payments generally do not reduce an ssieligible foster childs federal ssi benefit because they are not counted as income 53 typically however state acting as the childs representative payee uses ssi or social security benefits to provide foster care maintenance payment to the child or to reimburse itself for that payment addressing the question about whether to apply for either or both title ive and ssi benefits the child welfare policy manual counsels careful review of benefits available under each program so that an informed choice can be made in the childs best interest it adds that to achieve this goal title ive agencies should exchange information regarding eligibility requirements and benefits with local social security district offices and establish formal procedures to refer clients and their representative to the local social security district office for consultation andor application when appropriate 54 the dollar value of the respective benefit is often consideration55 the eligibility for and amount of title ii benefits are not affected by receipt of foster care social security benefits are paid under title ii to the children of workers who

state was acting in the best interest of the child entitled to benefits the washington state supreme court stated that child in foster care is better off with any payee other than the state because

expenditure is in all cases or even some in the best interests of the beneficiary

the washington state department of social and health services and overturned the decision of the washington supreme court the us supreme court stated that the state could not be foster childs creditor since the foster child did not have an obligation to pay for his or her foster care 63 instead the question raised by the case the court stated was whether the departments efforts to become representative payee or its use of respondents social security benefits when it acts in that capacity amounts to employing an execution levy attachment garnishment or other legal process to gain control of the childrens social security benefits64 on the question of this alleged violation of what is commonly called theantiattachment clausethe court held that neither the process used by washington state to become representative payee for children in foster care who were recipients of ssi or social security benefits nor its use of those benefits to reimburse the cost of their foster care violated the antiattachment clause 65 the court further noted that the use of funds to reimburse the washington state department of social and health services for foster care was consistent with the regulatory requirement that such funds be spent for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and with the regulatory definition of current maintenance that includes costs incurred in obtaining food shelter clothing medical care and personal comfort items 66 the us supreme court further asserted that the real basis of the respondents objection in the case and the previous washington state supreme courts holding in the case was the view that allowing state agency to reimburse itself for the costs of foster care is antithetical to the best interest of the beneficiary foster child67 responding to this issue the court first relied on the settled principle of administrative law that an openended and potentially vague term such as best interest is highly susceptible to administrative interpretation subject to judicial deference68 thus it noted that ssa has the authority to determine through regulation how it will interpret this part of the law the court then concluded that ssas regulations on this issue are consistent with the basic objectives of the law authorizing the ssi and social security programs specifically those are to provide minimum level of income and the basic objective of the social security program is to provide income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses 69 the social security commissioner the court wrote has decided that 63 keffeler 537

recipients of federal social security and ssi benefits and further to use those benefits to reimburse the cost of foster care state child welfare agencies and many child welfare advocates applauded the decision other advocates remain concerned that the practice of states using foster childrens ssi or social security benefits to pay for foster care does not serve these childrens best interests 71

the state agency is more interested in gaining federal funds than it is in ensuring that childs benefits serve hisher best interests and that childs benefits are not necessarily used to benefit just the child but may simply defray child welfare or foster care expenses for the state generally72 further they argue that even the practice of applying the benefits solely for the beneficiaries foster care costs amounts to asking children to pay for their own stay in foster care while other children in care including those with assets or income other than social security or those who receive social security benefits but have representative payee other than the child welfare agency are not required to repay the costs 73 additionally some advocates are concerned that child welfare agencies may be automatically assigned as the representative payee for children in foster care even though under ssas own regulations the continued for people who are age 65 or over or who are blind or disabled and who do not have sufficient income and resources to maintain standard of living at the established federal minimum income level 20 cfr 416110 the stated purpose of the social security benefit programs

failing to exercise disc retion in how it uses benef its periodically sweeping beneficiaries accounts to pay for past care and double dipping by using benefits to reimburse the state for costs previously recouped from other sources these charges the court noted were far afield of the issue on which it had agreed to hear the case it noted however that these alleged improper uses of payments were concerns that could be brought to the commissioner on social security who bears responsibility for overseeing representative payees or elsewhere as appropriate subsequently the washington state

to this concern some advocates suggest that ssa does not perform adequate investigations to determine whether more suitable payee is available74 further according to some legal advocates agencies that receive poor review by ssa or fail to submit payee accounting reports to ssa continue to serve as payees75 rather than paying for childs foster care these advocates argue that any ssi and other social security benefits that child is eligible to rece ive should be invested or otherwise saved for the childs future use eg education housing youth who leave foster care without permanent home typically at age 18 often have difficult time securing housing and income sufficient to shelter and support themselves ssieligible foster care youth who exit foster care would arguably have an even more difficult time and thus may need additional resources that ssi provides albeit some youth may continue to be eligible for ssi at age 18 and beyond 76 providing benefits to eligible youth upon leaving care would ease the transition to adulthood for these youth at time when they are expected to become financially independent

welfare advocates however assert that these federal funds are critical for child welfare agencies operating on tight budgets and that use of ssi and title ii benefits to pay for the cost of current maintenance is consistent with the federal purpose for providing those funds further the use of these childspecific funds to reimburse foster care costs is consistent with federal policy for use of child support paid on behalf of the child by the noncustodial parents some child welfare advocates argue that states have expended benefits for these provisions in good faith just as parent serving as representative payee would thus states should not be held to different standard than parents or other representative payees 77 in addition state child welfare agencies and advocates argue that returning benefits to children that were already used to pay for their maintenance could cost states up to hundreds of millions of dollars78 in keffeler the supreme court cited the amici curiae briefs filed by the childrens defense fund along with catholic charities usa the child welfare league of america and the alliance for children and families the state of florida along with 38 additional states puerto rico and the territories of american samoa and the virgin islands and the united states which claimed that without the ability to use social security and ssi benefits to reimburse the costs of foster care states would be discouraged from serving as representative payees because of the administrative costs involved 79 74 jim moye get your hands out of their pockets the case against

were not able to use ssi or title ii benefits to pay for childs foster care room and board then states would simply stop screening children to determine their eligibility for these programs screenings by child welfare staff can help to determine an individual childs needs and to secure extra benefits and services not normally available in foster care such as housing modifications80 eliminating these screenings would do disservice to potentially qualified children these advocates argue because childs eligibility for ssi or another title ii social security benefit may extend beyond hisher stay in foster care and the benefit could provide crucial support for the child outside the system for instance the benefit could offset the cost of therapeutic care to the families of children who leave care due to adoption or reunification 81 the keffeler court relied on this argument in its decision asserting that absent this state assistance many eligible children would either obtain social security benefits or need some very good luck to get them 82 in addition these advocates argue that if child ssi beneficiaries were given all of their benefits while in foster care they might accumulate assets in the form of savings and could soon find themselves above the maximum ssi resource level of 200083 this might also be the case if another type of representative payee preserved some of the childs benefits for nonmaintenance expenses not paid for out of dedicated account including the future costs associated with the transition to adulthood ie rent deposit vocational training educational expenses etc g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561 the decision of the supreme court in 2003 upholds states use

representative payees to pass through some or all of the ssi and title ii benefits to eligible foster children and those children could receive portion of the benefits while in care andor upon leaving care such proposal might include maximum amount of money available to eligible youth for example maximum level could be established at 2000 because children receiving ssi are not permitted under current law to accumulate more than that amount legislation passed by california discussed below in 2005 requires the state to consider the feasibility and costeffectiveness of reserving an amount up to 2000 to assist youth as they age out of foster care 87 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program provides an example of how federal legislation could make more social security and ssi benefits available to beneficiaries in foster care88 under current law as amended by the child support provision of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 families that participate in tanf must assign their child support rights to the state child support payments collected by the state from noncustodial parents on behalf of these tanf families are used by the state and federal governments as partial reimbursement for the welfare benefits that are provided to the family in much the same way as social security and ssi benefits are used to reimburse state governments for child welfare spending 89 with respect to tanf families states may choose to pass through some of their share of child support payments collected on behalf of the families up to 100 per family per month or 200 per month if the family has two or more children to the family currently 24 states provide some sort of pass through of child support payments this type of federal initiative used for social security and ssi benefits could result in children in foster care receiving part of these 87 2005 cal stat 641 copy of the legislation ab 1633 can be found on the website of the california assembly at

some child advocates have proposed changes to the selection of representative payees because of the perceived automatic process by which child welfare agencies are named as the payees for foster care children first they suggest that the current practice of providing advance notice in the selection of representative payee for child should be clarified because improved notice can assist ssa s efforts to name payee other than the state 90 social security regulations currently do not list the child or the childs attorney or guardian ad litem an attorney appointed by the judge on behalf of the child as recipients of the advance notice according to advocates the notice should be sent to individuals who represent the child in judicial proceedings as well as the childs parents current and past foster care or relative caretakers other parties in the juvenile proceedings and the juvenile court judge 91 as discussed above hr 1104 would require ssa to send this notice to foster childs attorney or guardian ad litem second advocates argue that alternative payees not listed in the ssa preference list92 should be considered as possible payees these alternative payees include volunteer representative payee programs developed by nonprofit organizations and local government agencies for adult beneficiaries requiring the service 93 court appointed special advocates casa could also serve as payees94 casa volunteers are sworn in by local court systems to provide advocacy services on behalf of abused and neglected children these volunteers may be in the optimal position to report to the court the childs needs because they advocate for the child regardless of changes in their placement goal ie family preservation family reunification or adoption or where the child is placed ie kin andor foster families californias recent legislation ab 1633 see below requires counties to apply to become the representative payee if other appropriate party is available to serve while the child is in foster care although appropriate party includes only those individuals currently permitted by ssa similarly hr 1104 would require states to apply to become the foster childs representative payee if there is other suitable candidate available although the california bill did not provide any further requirement to the counties or the state about the procedures for notifying interested parties about the representative payee selection process the federal bill hr 1104 would require notification to foster childs attorney or guardian ad litem proposals to expand the list of representative payees or to provide advance notice of selecting representative payee to additional parties may burden ssa auditing individuals or nonprofit organizations that serve as representative payeesrather than large organization such as state child welfare agencycould also strain the administrative capacity of the agency 90 hearing to review proposals to improve child protective service s

fixed since 1989 and is not indexed for inflation95 some child advocates argue that increasing the asset level for children receiving ssi would aid those youth as they left foster care96 as proposed hr 1104 would exempt assets accumulated by foster child under an approved plan from the ssi eligibility determination changes to the asset limit for certain children in the child welfare system would not be new the chafee foster care independence act pl 106169 increased the asset limit for children eligible to receive title ive foster care maintenance payments as discussed previously eligibility for these payments is based on whether the childrens original families would qualify for afdc as it was in effect on july 16 1996 under those rules childrenbefore the amendment by pl 106 169could not remain eligible for title ive services if they accumulated assets of more than 1000 in its report recommending this change the house ways and means committee noted children in foster care have special need for resources unlike children reared in families these children often have little or support from relatives thus when they turn age 18 and are longer eligible for government foster care payments they are on their own under current law these adolescents cannot accumulate more than 1000 in assets and still remain eligible for federal foster care payments the committee believes children in foster care should be allowed to accumulate much higher level of assets to prepare for the day when they must support themselves thus we are increasing the asset limit to 10000 97 by contrast under the ssi program individuals are generally longer eligible once they attain 2000 in countable resources however two initiatives allow eligible recipients to accumulate assets above that limit these are the ssi initiative plans for achieving self support pass and separately individual development accounts idas either one of these might be modified to include provisions that target recipients in

california appears to be the only state that has passed legislation assembly bill 1633 2005 to change its procedures for screening foster care children and funding child welfare through social security and ssi benefits since the keffeler decision 102 new mexico has also proposed legislation to screen youth in care but the bill was not reported out of committee

1633 this new law created the foster care social security and supplemental security income assistance program like the current pending federal legislation hr 1104 the california enacted bill requires the state to screen youth for ssi or social security benefits and provides that they are to act as the childs representative payee only if other appropriate party is available to serve while the child is in foster care however unlike the federal proposal hr 1104 the state enacted bill allows california counties to continue using those benefits received by foster children to pay for the childrens

youth in foster care for federal ssi and social security benefits as well as the state supplementary payment ssp the counties are to apply to become the representative payee for qualified youth only if only if other appropriate party is available to serve while the child is in foster care103 the new law requires that counties serving as representative payees establish two types of accounts for foster care youth receiving ssi and social security benefits one is nocost interestbearing maintenance account with the county maintaining an itemized current account of all income and expense items this type of account is not required under federal law and some california counties established such an account or similar type of account prior to the passage of ab 1633 the county must establish procedures for dispensing money from the account to pay for expenditures that are used by and for the benefit of the child and for purposes determined by the county to be in the childs best interests 104 procedures must also be established for disbursing any balance when the youth is released from care the other accounta dedicated accountis depository for ssi payments that are past due for at least six months and is required under federa l law as discussed above allowable expenses from this account include those for medical treatment education or job skills training personal needs assistance special equipment housing m odification therapy or rehabilitation or other items or services deemed appropriate by the social security administration pursuant to federal law funds may not be disbursed for basic maintenance costs the county is also required to provide information to ssi beneficiaries in foster care who are approaching their 18 th birthday about 1 establishing continuing eligibility for receipt of ssi as an adult if necessary 2 the process of becoming their own payees or designating an appropriate payee if benefits continue beyond their 18th birthday and 3 any ssi benefits that have accumulated in their accounts g4g142g156g157g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g561g9g158g146g141g142g149g146g151g142g156g561 ab 1633 provides that the california department of social services convene work group to develop nonbinding best practice guidelines for county welfare departments that will assist children in custody who are eligible for social security or ssi benefits and to ensure that eligible youth receive benefits before exiting care the work group comprised of state and county child welfare officials advocacy organizations and current and former foster youth was convened in 2006 recommendations made in the guidelines were issued an all county letter acl in february 2007 105 first the guidelines establish procedures for screening all youth in foster care for ssi and other social security benefits for children who may be eligible for title ii benefits an application should be made to ssa on their behalf the counties should apply to become the representative 103 california law requires that counties be selected as the representative payee only if other appropriate person is available see cal welf and inst code 13754 this is consistent with federal regulations about the order of selecting representative payees see 20 cfr 4042021 and 416521 104 the definition of best interests is consistent with the soci security acts regulations that define the best interest of the beneficiary payments as those used for current maintenance or the costs incurred in obtaining food shelter clothing medical care and personal comfort items see 20 cfr 416635 and 416640 105 the guidelines are available at httpwwwpilpcaorgdocsacl20070920 20implementing20ab201633pdf

benefits separately the guidelines advise that within three months of tering care social worker or other individual familiar with the child evaluates the childs physical or mental impairments to determine eligibility for ssi if youth are screened by the county and the results indicate that the child would not be eligible for ssi due date is to be set for the childs next annual screening the guidelines establish procedures for rescreening youth at least annually or whenever there is change in circumstances eg change of placement change in physical or emotional condition the guidelines further specify that if the results of the initial screening are affirmative that the child would likely be eligible for ssi benefits the child is to be referred to the countydesignated ssi liaison for determining whether the application to ssa should be made the guidelines recommend that liaison be established in each county to conduct disability assessment comprised of referrals to various medical and psychological evaluations and that documentation be made to substantiate any disability the assessment should be completed within nine months however youth who are age 16½ or older or meet other criteria eg children with presumptive disabilities children who will exit foster care in less than year receive expedited consideration due to ssas sometimes lengthy application review process 106 the ssi liaison also determines whether the ssi application would be financially advantageous for the child family andor county figure a1 in the appendix shows the decision points that counties should consider when determining whether to make the application for children these are based on the countys share of cost for child eligible for social security and ssi the childs eligibility for title ive foster care maintenance payments and calworks the states cash aid program for lowincome families and the childs permanency plan ie emancipation reunification adoption and guardianship according to the guidelines the childs best interests are paramount to any financial considerations for the county and state upon determining that the county should apply for ssi on behalf of the youth the county is advised to contact ssa for an appointment and file for the benefit within 60 days of the initial contact the liaison should be responsible for coordinating all appeals to ssa for rejected applications g27g152g158g157g145g561g7g150g138g151g140g146g153g138g157g146g151g144g561g8g155g152g150g561g5g138g155g142g561 the work group is tasked with making recommendations about reserving portion of ssi benefits for youth to be used upon leaving care rather than for their foster care and current maintenance the guidelines provided suggestions to counties to assist emancipating youth the guidelines suggest how counties can assist youth in applying for benefits to continue beyond his or her 18th birthday as well as to provide information at that time about the process for the youth to become his or her own payee or to designate representative the guidelines encourage counties to determine whether to apply for ssi benefits on behalf of title ive eligible youth aging out of foster care ssa will not accept applications for these youth until one month prior to the termination of title ive benefits this time frame may preclude youth from securing 106 pending legislation in the california legislatureab1331would require counties to screen all youth in foster ages 165 or older for ssi eligibility and to apply on behalf of eligible youth for ssi benefits it would also require counties to set aside up to 2000 in maintenance account for all youth r eceiving ssi benefits while they are in care to meet their needs upon emancipation

generally exceeds one month the california department of social services and the working group are continuing to identify solutions to resolve this timing issue for youth who have transitioned out of foster care without ssi benefits in place the guidelines advise that counties attempt to maintain contact with the youth and track their progress toward gaining ssi benefits they also suggest how the counties can inform parents and caretakers about filing for ssi upon leaving care the california department of social services is developing brochures for youth and parents that outline how the ssi program works according to the guidelines counties may cons ider providing the following services to potentially ssieligible youth who have aged out of care postfoster care or independent living program workers could assist with the ssi application process including appeals involve responsible adult in the childs application process make arrangements with local legal service agencies to provide counsel to emancipated youth on ssi application matters and refer youth to appropriate adult social services

benefits on behalf for children likely to be eligible107 senate bill 273 did not pass committee senate bill 273 would have required the state to request reconsideration and timely appeal of adverse decisions when appropriate like ab 1633 the legislation would have established cost interestbearing accounts for youth in care for whom the state served as representative payee ssi or other social security benefits could have been applied for the use and benefit of the child for purposes determined to be in the childs best interest and in accordance with written assessment of the childs individual needs provided that each child receive personal allowance of at least 30 each month for his or her personal use in addition eligible youth emancipating from care would have received ssi or other social security payments disbursed to the state on behalf of the youth beginning ninety days prior to their eighteenth birthday 107 copy of senate bill 273 can be found on the website of the new
