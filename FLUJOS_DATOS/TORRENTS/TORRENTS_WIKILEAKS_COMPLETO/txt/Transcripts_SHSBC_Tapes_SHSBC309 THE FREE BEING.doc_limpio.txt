the free being lecture given on 9 july 1963 thank you well im glad to see you too the horizon is lookingwider open all youve got to get is good well let melet put it little more mildly im afraid i might have frightened you there all youve got to get is perfect thats all this is what this is the 9th of july audience the 9th all right 9 july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now this is the place youve been coming to the last few trillion trillion years thats right thats rightbeen heading down the track right for the saint hill special briefing course last time you were on that pole you said there must be someplace and here you arehere you are and its my job to make something vaguely resembling successful auditor and make it possible for that auditor to do good job of clearing clearing up the track and straightening up and if we hadnt waited so long wed find it much easierquantitative proposition if we just hadnt waited quite so long wed find it much easier but the state of civilizations and the general combat that has occurred here and there and every place has rather put things in abeyance i cant imagine us doing anything practical in the middle of the roman civilization can you and about the only psychotherapy they had in medieval times was the rack or the lead boot and general attitudes have been pretty poor furthermore i dont think any of us have been brought to point that we realized we had failed and that there had been failure thats sometimes necessary for somebody to do something about something and what were doing actually so you wont be in the dark is were closing out very long cycle of long losing cycletremendous lengthof the ot the cycle of loss of the ot and being now had come to point where he believedand couldnt do otherwisethe only safe place to be was in one of these meatbody civilizations complete with airplanes and that that was the more or less winning side of the ledger and there was real possibility of being free of that economic duress be these twobit games these accelerated aberrative conditions as they march forward there was going and sitting on mountaintop quietly for few thousand years and catching your breath the fight had been lost in other words in other words strata and quality and character of life had been lost that is defeat you dont see any ots walking around right now well its very peculiar that they reach almost to modern timesalmost to modern times as you audit pcs youll be quite surprised now and then to find one that was ot five hundred years ago you look on this normally as something that occurred on the very very far backtrack something that occurred in the dimmest beginnings of history but in actual fact this is not true at all these reach right up practically to present time but losing all the way there was method of retaining and maintaining stability the condition of ot in this universe became looked upon as highly dangerous and highly unstable you could stand around an airfield batting the airplanes down as fast as they rose you know and so they couldnt serve as theta traps and all this sort of thingand walking all over the buildings and that sort of thing and the next thing you know sleep light was going and somebody was saying sleep sleep sleep create be solid and it was losing war and very interestingly losing war because it was lost by the most powerful thats whats peculiar about this war any one of you within relatively few hundred trillion years probably could have taken this planet and touched the north pole lightly and that would have been that youd probably even show the proper stance you would use to slow planet down as well as to take one throw it out into the freezing dark and put it back on its orbit again without any meat bodies to clutter it up interesting study how do you knock off all life on planet but trees and plants just how do you pull an air cover well these are studies of the greatest magnitudethe greatest magnitude possible of force there has not been any force wanting at all and eventually here you sit and what are you doing here well what you are doing here is youre in meat body and you see the airplanes flying around overhead and you realize that the continuous association with meat body is just continuous concatenation of collecting engrams like mad and keying in things like crazy and it is the downward spiral with accelerated jets behind it what made that condition how come this took place well all battles are won by combination of two elements and these are force and intelligence and given enough force of course there is opposing sideeverybody hopes the united states in world war ii eventually got up to the idea of small task force had to practically raise the level of water of the pacific ocean before they would make an attack tremendoustremendous force tremendous force and of course you take something like an atomic bomb that can obliterate an entire country that is tremendous tremendous force and it succeeds in shortterm winsshortterm wins and that is all you ever get from tremendous force is shortterm win never longterm win never the longterm win is achieved by balance between force and intelligence now intelligence alone in active action is not enough the wise men of tibet were just few years ago driven out of their mountain fortresses by the dumbest infantrymen the world has known for some time isnt that interesting they were infinitely wise and their infinite wisdom brought them total defeat so when you take these two elements if you are sometime trying to solve the problem of whether you did right or whether you did wrong take these two elements and look them over in relationship to what you did and youll find out that there is an imbalance in any defeat there was an imbalance of intelligence and force and these two things were out of gear youre either using all force and practically grasshopperintelligence or youre using monumental intelligence and saying god will protect forgetting at the same time that you were the only go d around to do any protecting it is sort of pathetic this ot sitting down on the vatican steps saying god will protect when he may very well have started the whole myth where does he think he still is now all of your losses were contributed to by these two elements out of balance and any coordinated civilization plowing forward using technology combining that technology with force keeping some sort of balance between these two things can make monkey out of an ot literally there was an implant four galaxies over that taught you you came from apes darwinthats the whole of the darwinian theory is implanted there in the course of about day and everybody bought it you know you come up through the mollusk and sloth and ape and all this sort of thing and theres not damn word of truth in it see it has nothing to do with it you want to know what happened to these intermediate forms well thetans have different tastes and there are fads of one kind or another and some ot he sort of liked this idea of cavemen society and you get these hugejaws you see and hairy bodies and women being hauled around by the hair of their head and all that sort of thing its rather barbaric taste but exotic you know exotic they get whole civilization moving forward like this you want to call it civilization you know you want to know about the evolution of man from treetop to cave well there was atheres one form of that civilization in treetops and theres another form in caves theres evolution between the two although you can draw these things very carefully it all depends who was here and who was putting the bodies in the place thats your evolution therefore these things would baffle an archaeologist if he suddenly started comparing it all and if the carbonatom deteriorization factor had anything to do with time which it doesnt im watching this with the greatestwith the greatest of interest how they have made up some kind of an artificial winging gimmick by which they can measure nonexistent time and this planet you see is brandnew and its only few million years old and you know that aint old thats lie you know thats lie used to run the biological survey in here 612 million years ago and you know get reports on this place but that was the style then see and they start digging these things up and looking for this and that the deterioration of matter is not as fast as they think it is nowhere near as fast as they think it is you can sit for trillion trillion years and watch the ebb and flow of seas and geological formations and various things happening one kind or another and when you scan through it very rapidly why theres sea theres desert theres sea theres desert theres mountain range you see theres canyon that goes through the mountain range now theres canyon going through the mountain range see get the idea flickflickflickflickflickflick flickflick but that matter is still there and it is still the same sand we havent got deterioration of matter and the vanishments of suns and thethese suns up here have been burning sincewow i know they have been burning to my own personal knowledge theyve been burning for the last two hundred trillion the existing collection of suns in this immediate vicinity two hundred trillion years is looked upon as fantastic length of time but i remember in grade school in this lifetime they used to teach us that the sun was full of hydrogen and sooner or later the hydrogen would burn out and the sun would go out you see well this thing about the sun going out is just way to scare kids to get them to go to sleep see its lot of nonsense they say well look over there theres sun that did go out it was never lit or whoever made it got distracted that day or was working on union hours or something he just never finished it he went offhe went off to pick up new bank of magellanic radioactive particles to throw at it and ignite it and got distracted by butterfly or something you know and never came back and turned it on these things dont go out in other words were looking at awere looking at tremendous number of misconceptions and were looking at vast number of unintelligences see these are pure stupidities but these stupidities themselves form kind of trap and theyre intelligent in their application in cohesing society if everybody remains ignorant in the society nobody can get out of it can they so theres nothing left for them but to cooperate somehow or another or keep that society going one way or the other so ignorance itself is used as an intelligent mechanism of entrapment and to this is added force and you get all sorts of odd combinations so we have sort of medium structure floating along through this particular universe and that medium structure is balance of intelligence if very warped intelligenceand balance of mediocre forces and these two are sort of mean level and they make these meatbody societies and the automobile and the airplane and they get up as high as the spaceship and they dont progress any further than that they go right to there and thats it if they progress much further than that they disintegrate and if they fail to progress at all they disintegrate and youve got various factors influencing it but the societies repeat themselves over and over continuously you have roman societies and medieval societies and elizabethanengland societies and these pattern societies thetans get on kick of one way or the other and they build these things up theres arabian societiesi was on kick on arabian societies one time or another never build anything without minarets and turbans you know you got to have the minarets turbans and harems then you got it all set you see oh marvelous and those thingsthose things appear in sequence or theyjust one sits there and it lasts for long time but beware of planet in which there is as much progress as you find this particular planet this planet has gone through the phase of the prop aircraft in something like twentyfive or thirty years see its gone all the way through the era of locomotives until they are now in terrible decline various forces are at work on this particular planet which are unusual in the extreme they are very unusual and that makes this planet very restive one of the reasons for thisand i wont say its the only reason for this but the only reason i can lay my hands on at the momentis this planet is being used as dumping ground ifyoull find this sun 12 is very distant its way out on the rim of galaxy and its very handy to other galaxies and its very handy to the center of this galaxy nothing against anyones character and its nothing really that anybody did he just happened to get picked up in that scoop that day and that was it and its been used as dumping grounda rather consistent continual dumping groundand its being used as dumping ground right up to this minute now this of course gives you very heterogeneous type of society you have enormous elements of one kind or anotherall of them running relatively uncontrolled there is master hand guiding all this but everybody feels that there must be master hand guiding all this because theres so much trouble when master hand is guiding things there isnt any trouble things are calm its only when the master hand doesnt guide things that there is trouble and for instance society normally has some thetan around someplace and hes kicking some mockups together one way or the other and hes kind of figuring on things and hes playing game one way or the other and it keeps going for long time and he gives it some indifferent attention and it never changes he doesnt see any reason to change it particularly some other thetan comes along and he says well well have fight so he makes up some mockups and he makes up some diseases to feed to the mockups that the thetan has already mocked up and so on and they get these two in collision one way or the other and they have some wars and battles and so forth its rather mildly interesting and they dont pay too much attention to it eventually they both go off and forget about it and the whole thing goes to pieces thats the normal crudest look you could say theyre very dedicated earnest severe looks but i am afraid the attitude has been quite comparable to childs making up little play townattitude quite similar to that meat bodies and mockups well when you take bodies which have been mocked up and thetans who have been indoctrinated in very definite linesto fight to do this to have certain types of societies to do this to do that to do the other thingand then they get scooped up from this galaxy and that system and this star and here and there and the other place and are dumped in on one system as unwanted merchandise you have these tremendous impulses which are at work one against another and it works up lot of heat of friction you have such society here at this particular time this society belongs nominally to the espinol united stars this is sun 12 and it is one little tiny pinpoint their whole title is espinol united stars pardon espinol united moons planets and asteroids this part of the universe is ours hup but this yeah this quarter of the universe is ours it translates better this quarter of the universe is ours and its so much quarter of the universe and this is so lost in the middle of it that theres been command post occupied for this system now since 1150 ad at the time when group on mars was finally abolished and vanished and so forth and nobody took any interest in this system this system has been running wild since that time you notice at that time we had sudden resurgence in quote science we had sudden resurgence in this that or the other thing it became an uncontrolled civilization and since that time has been used and was used before this of course consistently as dumping ground because nobody pays any attention to it you dont have scout ships coming out to meet your transport that is dumping ice cubes in the pacific ocean you see thereits very handy placeits like the city garbage dump with cop to tell you you cant dump there see and theres nobody alert theres nobody doing anything on this planet to debar this sort of thing and its quite interesting that you have represented here samples of many societies in many times and places and impulses which are quite fantastic probably the most basic impulse on the planet is simply the basic impulse of thetans who have been reduced to more or less meatbody level which is total cooperationtotal cooperation with one another total as you see in the communist thing as you see in democracy we are all equal you see we are all equal there must be personalities of any kind the cult of the personality must be banished what we really are is equal and theyve sort of come back to this because that is common denominator of their indoctrination they are indoctrinated to the idea that they have teammates and from this you see you get this other equality factor you might not agree with that particularly but im just giving you some kind of sketch here of things as they are now why did you arrive in the condition you are in this is all this leads up to it wasnt actually thatanything specific that you did yes you have overts yes these overts combined into certain motivators being more forceful upon you than otherwise but even if you hadnt had overts you still would have gotten the motivators you would have dreamed up something as an overt dont you see the oddity here is simply that if all this has happened to you and youve been punished then you must have hadbeen punished for some reason see youre still trying to be reasonable and intelligent about it and this doesnt happen to be true at all the only reasons you were ever punished was for being you for being powerful and for not being quite intelligent enough and thatsthats the only reasons you were ever done the exact crimes were to be there and to communicate those were the two crimes now what happenswhat happens you can look way back on the backtrack and you can find that some ot came along and decided that hed put together civilization of some kind or another figured it all out to the last notch you know and had total curbstones and the hairdo and everything else he had this perfect you see and some other thetan came along and started chipping away at him or something like this or started talking to him or started putting up mockups on the other side of the planet see so this would go on and to get evento get even with the other thetan who was attacking his pet society something like this he would indoctrinate his pet society in how to trap big thetan so this became the most accomplished skill that meatbody society has is how to trap spirit ot was so ever out of his mind as to depend upon any of his men or troops to untrap him he never indoctrinated them to do that because at the time he was doing this he never thought he would be caught i consider this as huh singularly unintelligent for instance frankie the limper over there during the 30s he wrote out big check he wrote out big check he only thought in terms of billions and things and he wrote out this three billion dollar check and he handed it over and he says build an atom bomb and there you are wipe out cities and so on well the knucklehead he had congress under his thumb he had everything under his thumb it was all set and roaring to go he could have written out another check for three billion dollars and given it to another group and said build defense for an atom bomb but you notice he didnt do that see what i mean he said build an atom bomb heres three billion dollars he didnt say at the same time heres three billion dollars build defense for an atom bomb so you lay into meatbody society the skill to trap thetan why dont you teach him how to free one see it isnt this universe it isnt that you have atoms it isnt that this has happened and that happened and the other happened or that you werent right thinking and didnt join the ots ymca when you had chance thats all irresponsible thinking you were just knuckleheaded i mean lets face it you had unlimited force but there was not as much intelligence invested as there was force invested now you say its very intelligent thing to be able to put together an atom be able to make matter being able to make almost everburning radioactive fire for suns and all this sort of thing to be able to erect tremendous space to be able to figure out the biological cell perpetuation on the second dynamicall of thisseeds how do you make them all that see this is terribly complex you had to figure out how to make the various things the various enzymes and things like that that cells convert to become thisand very complicated very well then you say all right thats fantastic amount of intelligencethe intelligence of doing things that is usually assigned on this planet to god theres film film shows you the vastness of the universe and the miraculous works of god and the greatest things and the smallest things and that sort of thing simply tribute to the workings of an ot nothing else not sacrilegious fact now yeah you say well that was very intelligent very intelligent completely knuckleheaded you never worked out how to unbuild anything do you get theget the unbalanced action how do you pull the plug on this complicated made atom how do you pull the plug on it see how do you say proton negatron nuncus see and it goes boom it ceases to exist well the whole thing was an insistence on enduring matterenduring matter that was to endure forever well thats not smart eventually some of that stuff was made into theta pole thats the pole youve been on confounded things last forever you know its possible i can tell you that its possible to be trapped for over thirteen and half trilliontrillion years thats interesting isnt it well all the technology of entrapmentmy god the technology of entrapment is just oh vast catalog i could tell you ways of trapping thetans and oh and so onjust taken off the track you know technology oooo you run into it running the whole track its quite technology how do you fool thetan how do you make him curious how do you do this how do you do that you know how do you soften him up how do you do all these things vast amount of work put in on this subject and workno work put in at all on how do you free one see total technology of freeing one you reach over on the trap and pull the guy off of it and throw him out in space to cool off that requires what that requires an ot what if there isnt any thats an interesting question isnt it so here you had the atom bomb with defense for the atom bomb which was continuous matter and continuous technology of entrapment and teaching civilizations to entrap and so forth on and on and on endlessly teachteachteach forceforceforce more matter made more endurance to the matter more lasting qualities to the matter some space opera societies make any metal that appears here on this planet look pale even the society has worked on the refinement of elements to point where well spaceshiptrying to dent spaceship it might have an almost paper thin looking hull and the stuff sheds asteroids and so forthlittle meteorites and space dust and so forth it just sheds them space wagon travels in the terms of the trillions of lightyears in day einsteins nonsense is just some more of the ignorance by which you get trapped you cant go faster than the speed of light i dont know im never in contest with photon myself the teleportation is pipe dream too its usuallyits the way you mock something up here and then make it disappear there and then mock it up over there and say see ive teleported it from here to here see without going through the air and its marvelous you see very clever except it never happened the reassembly of atoms at some distant place and that sort of thing thats an ot skill it can be done rather easily but its not the same atoms so aside from vanishments of that particular character to carry out stunt for teleportation and baffle everybody the skill of making matter disappear and so forth has been grievously neglected the technology of how do you free thetan has been grievously neglected these are all neglected technologies the failure to teach meatbody society equally to be able to free or to trap that was just unintelligent it was stupidleave out half of the equation now if you ever want to see society get into rich trouble trouble that is just blooming in all directions and so forth go on one of these all flows see dont ever run the other side see dont ever touch the other side you see it in processing you can make the guy flow flow flow flow actually you run motivators just so long on somebody hell give you an overt unless you prevent him actively from giving you an overt you keep you keep running outflowoutflowoutflow on somebody and he eventually will jam and he wont run any further youve got to run some inflow for while thats all youve got to balance up these flows now thats quite important to you thats quite important to you because it says where you sit both as being at this exact moment and why your interest in the technology which is before you and why strangely enough this technology is appearing really for the first time in this universe its impossible thateverybody will tell you the technology is impossible it isnt impossible its just totally neglected they think its impossible because theyve outflowed the reverse technology now its very embarrassing it isnt that it didnt cause societies trouble it caused them lots of trouble the galactic confederation right now is in trouble because of this it has this problem on its front platter all the time the galactic confederation operates on limited ot basis its hierarchy of command is that of limited level of ot and it goes down to the doll body as the ship captain and the post captain and that sort of thing and that goes down to the meat body and its one of the few civilizations which has ever endured over any great span of timejust for the reason that it uses limited ot doll body and meat body and works out the hierarchies of cooperation in that and their space wagons are very stylized i dont think theyve changed inoh they havent changed in fiftytrillion years they havent moved bolt theyevery time you say you ought to increase your firepower or do something intelligent about it and these things blow back every once in while and wreck the ship why dont you increase the thickness on those jets little bit oh well weve done that before theyll prove it too theyll take out an ancient file cabinet you know and here will be plans that were submitted you know trillions of years before by the most learned architects and they built this at vast expense and they tested it and it crashed you know the weariness with which they defend their nochange is quite remarkable but they do have change they cannot maintain nochange society either goes up even if only slowly or goes down it never stays completely static thats something for you to remember when youve got this society and you say well weve reached state of perfection now were not going to change anything were not going to change thing from here on out oh how dangerous can you get because if you dont improve you decline there is staying exactly that way thats quite interesting because the galactic confederation is up against problem of great magnitude its run out of ots their basic technology says that the problem of conquestthe problem of conquest the problem of maintaining our position the problem of maintaining our commitments the problem of power and the cohesion of the galactic confederation does not depend on ships does not depend on fuel does not depend on size of armies does not depend on organization technical know howdoesnt depend on any of these things its the availability of ots to command units and that is the limiting factor of how much and how broad and how big the galactic confederation can be and this is taught taught taught this is pounded into everybodys head and not once in eighty trillion years has anybody ever said well if that is the case why dont you repair some of your limited ots and keep them patched up and up to snuff why dont you know something about it see they know this is pressing problem but they have such technology it doesnt exist theres technology like that ots get peculiar they get fitful they get moody i remember one time about twelve trillion years ago it was some comedian on stage vast theater pulled gag about create and that sort of thing and made wisecrack of one kind or another an ot had to be subduedhe was up in the box alongside the royal box and he had to be subdued one way or the other but not till after he had torn down all the curtains and knocked down four or five hundredton chandelier on the assembled meatbody multitude why it just keyed him in what could they do about it turn sleep light on him and tell him to get solid and take him down to the hospital that was their totaltotal ability to put this boy back together again i consider it fascinating i knowi was there i was the guy they did it to but the crux of the situation hereim not talking through my hat on this material although it might sound very strange to some people i think it would sound hauntingly horrifying to great many people if they were to listen to it theyd feel quite overwhelmed they wouldnt understand it they would be trying to say well it probably isnt true he seems to be making sense but were not quite sure and this or my reality on this is very bad but it fills full of slight chills whats this somatic in the back of my neck you know all right if the technology is that vital of how do you untrap somebody how do you push somebody back to battery after horrifying experienceif its that vital why hasnt somebody worked on it basically theyre afraid of the technology for instance if i were to go back to the galactic confederation in any kind of mood of punitive sneer and they would listen raptly as i talked to them about gunnery you know youve got to improve the ability of gun to penetrate the hide of spaceship you see theyve got some new data on this you know listen man that all ears see they would just listen with their tongues out where it came to anything that had to do with this strata of action they would listen probably to means of preventing blowbacks id probably even shatter them and move them over on that particular point tips on political interference learned out amongst the colonies you know that kind of thing listen man and id say well also got way to put ots back together again brother i would meet probably the greatest silenceyou could drop space fleet into and it would just vanish and it wouldnt be fear and it wouldnt be ridicule being meitd be horror because theyd instantly think how are we going to hold the society together how do you maintain the strata of the society how do you maintain this fixed organization which we have if every janitor can be an oryou realize that you say this is just going to be applied to ots thats all right if you kept it buttoned up ah but the next thing you know you are going to take sergeants amongst the dollbody class i can see it now and those guys are going to start hauling people out of meat bodies they are going to destroy this social organization which we have built up here with such care and which has gone so long and they would say to oh youve gone too far we know you took course in scientific improvisation some years ago but we never thought you would put it to this use and then would ensue minor revolution of one kind or another where some were all for it and some were all against it and that sort of thing but there wouldnt be much of fuss about it but everybody would still be saying keep it reasonable take it easy youd have to give them political solution which was as great as the political threat you cannot give them technology without taking responsibility for the technology or nobody would listen to it the people on earth here dont think that scientology doesnt work theyve been trained however against the vectors of it theyve been trained to destroy to set something upa fixed status of somethingand then work destructive means with it and to work out techniques of entrapment so people cannot leave certain social strata and economic strata of the society this is the whole level of training and youre not up against pavlov freud or any mental technology youre up against the social structure of the organization in which we exist at this moment and you pose tremendous threat to that social structure you could tear it to pieces in two different ways one by the rehabilitation of tremendous power and force thats one way thats pretty easy you make somebody ot and hes good and mad on account of what they did to him in chicago and he pulls the air cover and thats the end of this planet dont think it hasnt happened those mammoths that are up in the frozen tundra with quickfrozen vegetables in their stomachs must have been reduced down to about two hundred degrees minus in split second because to freeze vegetables they have to be frozen in something like sixty seconds for them to preserve it and here these millions of years later the explorers club serves those things with fresh mammoth steak at its annual dinners they serve them as vegetablesdeepfreezequickfreeze theyve been packed up there in the ice ever since theyre tropical what are they doing under all that ice man it must have been done in sixty seconds can you think of any natural cataclysm that could take place in sixty seconds they couldnt have been transported from point to point b somebody was good and mad and they pulled the air cover and gave the planet reverse spin they changed its axis just like thatbang bang there was justsomebody got mad thats all so that is the most direct force that is posed to this civilization by any technology such as we have see that is real factor people dont even have to get mad we just get together and say well i guess its best for the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics that this planet be deaircovered pfsst thats it frozen vegetables well now then there must be greata factor involved here in intelligence thats just the use of total force isnt it all right now if we admix intelligence into this total force what do we get we get some other solution we get solution like the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics and that is an optimum solution always the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics in fact that is the definition of an overt act most of you think an overt is harming something brother that is the most unlimited piece of nonsense ever doing something damaging destroying something you think that is an overt act that is not an overt act it is sometimes an overt act but that is just an unintelligent look at what an overt act is let give you mucha very very lowlevel thing baby keeps going over turning on the gas jets you see on the stove all right what is the damage they blow themselves up and kill themselves dead and knock themselves out and mess up the whole house and spoil that thats the end of that if they are permitted to do this so if persuasion doesnt work you paddle their britches well that is damaging child you cant reason with the child and you paddle his britches just hard enough to make him realize that he mustnt turn on those gas jets now that of course can unintelligently be carried too far but you immediately have departed from the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics it is actually an overt not to spank the child in that particular characteristic an overt act is flaunting the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics and if you start working on the equation of the greatest bad for the greatest number of dynamics youve got real series of overts now its very hard to adjudicate something like this itd take solomon then to figure out what an overt act is well thats why youre so puzzled you never can quite figure out what an overt act is well youd have to look on it from the various angles and youd have to have usually more data than you have but youll find the real overt actswas maliciously and viciously setting out to damage for good reason some beings or people or start trend or something of the sort it was lie or piece of nonsense you knew very well it was lie and piece of nonsense and keep going anyhow sometimes you get an unintentional overt ill give you an overt that works out this waythe greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics there was very shabby thetan hanging around and there were some new theta traps that had been built in the neighborhood well they wouldnt trigger you know i mean they just werent running all the time they had to have thetan in them so i took this guy and threw him in intending to reach over and pull him out yeah well we got that was quite something he sure made guilty on this thing and so on but that wouldnt really have amounted to much as an overt act when i pulled him off the pole the fact that i put beam into the place activated the trap it wasnt necessary to throw him in all i had to do was kind of stick my finger down there and it would have gone off automatically and fired itself straight on through see now he says youre guilty and you shouldnt have done this and look how youve ruined and all of this sort of thingwhich wasnt the case i could agree with him yes it was an overt act it was an omission on my part not to be able to predict the fact i was stupid see i didnt realize that it wasnt necessary to kick him off into that particular glade to activate the trap so we could find out what it was why it wasnt necessary at all in fact that was mean thing to do and we never would have done that if he hadnt gotten on everybodys nerves but it was mean thing to do but then to find out that it was quite unnecessarythat made it an overt act so overt actan overt act can occur almost unintentionally by the realization that you havent been very smart about it an overt act is often realized after the fact by the realization that you could have done it some entirely different way that would have been much smarter and then you get regret and so forth and then you get hungup overt act but somebody who sets out to do things which are definitely against the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics wind up committing lot of overts and somebody who simply goes out here in battle and shoots somebody through the coco or throws doll out the window as commander of the ship because the doll is starting to mutiny or something like this those are not overt acts they dont even classify you see yet they come under the heading of damaging something theyre not overt acts theits not any specious figuring itsyoull find out it works out and when you hit real overt on the trackthat the pc is going oh my god why did i do ityoull find these other elements are present lot of elements now it has lot to do with sec checking your lack of success in sec checking is misdefinition of the overt act youre looking for something he did that was irresponsible or damaging or something like this youre not looking for the very harmful action to the greatest number of dynamics somebody took very completely wrong course on something and do you know you almost never find one in this lifetime people havent been big enough or tough enough in this lifetime to have committed one sometimes you see some thetan bragging see some pc is bragging about all the overt acts hes committed and you assess them out and you find out he stepped on an ant and he spanked baby and he betrayed girl andthat was asking to be betrayedand you assess this whole thing out and you cant find any overt acts you see he just wasnt tough enough but hes sort of bragging about these tremendous overt acts he has committed and youll find this combination actually he hasnt committed an overt for probably long time you run off long chain of engrams in three hours and all of sudden one of these overt acts will suddenly show upbang in very strategic locale that meant great deal to one and all in all directions and youll see that thing all grouped up and that thing followed by chain of motivators like mad and if that overt hadnt been present those motivators might never have followed at all and then youll know what an overt act is and you can analyze it and youll find outit was the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics was violatedwittingly or unwittingly was violatedeither because the guy was complete knucklehead at the time or just because he had gone clean vicious this is somebody that is an american citizen has been an american for long time and he hasnt got anything else and all of sudden hands everything out lock stock and barrelthe code books and so forthto the russians well knowing that the russians will also be destroyed when they destroy america well you say well thats very interesting and youll once in while get thetan smelling around the edges in processing thinking he has committed something like this and hell take upon his shoulders far more than he did commit he was thehe was the unwitting cause of whole concatenation of destruction somehow or another and sometimes his feeling for that will cause dub and he will hold himself responsible for the confoundedest things and you say well its dub but hell hold himself responsible oh god hes the fellow who did this and did that and so forth but you notice as you run these his case doesnt get any better you havent got the real overt but there is one there there is one there see theres real rough one lying back there someplace hes just trying to run it out but he cant confront it or come up to it see and running out bunch of false ones isnt going to get the real one now whats this all amount to the intelligent use of intelligence and force youve got to have force and youve got to have intelligence if you dont have these two things you havent got anything and imbalances along that line have occurred over such long period of time that we find ourselves reduced to rather static civilization and the free powerful being at war with the organized society as an adventure and an action can be looked upon as lost war youve lost youre here arent you youve got meat body havent you so you might say with this point that phasenot of us but phase of this universehas taken place and has ended the phase of the free being and the free being lost and he lost to solid unintelligent but mediumly lying not totally forceful but not unforceful meanlevel societies he lost just few trillion years ago the whole confounded place was all blown up the suns were disorganized planets all thrown to hell and everything else well the little guys with the airplanes showed up again and they still could put up theta traps for this boy well that was because war had occurredwar of magnitude and you could work out how this has been occurring and over the long period of time that it has been occurring but here you arehere you are your fight as free being of total force and power and so forth has finally ended and that fight in this universe is ended its more its over done and that cycle is lost but another cycle opens up an old mystic friend of mine would say when wooden door closes an iron door opens its been very unlovely and to large degree very unpleasant phase over this vast and long period of time the free being losing more and more to guile and treachery losing more and more to medium force and organization in spite of his ability to knock everything kickinghes nevertheless lost what sort of society opens up toward the future well in the first place you wont have that kind of free being again you will never be never be the same as you were you cant be the same as you were because you are now an experienced you oh yes you can be as strong as you ever were but i dont think you could ever be that stupid again you see you come out at the other end of the cornucopia knowing what the score is furthermoreyou probably never before had any political or social contact internally to many of these meatbody societies youve been in and out of them from time to time but youve never taken look at them with wormseye view in one of these things to amount to anything you realize that they have sociological frailties they have political frailties of one kind or another and that the total destruction of them amounts to nothing because guys totally dedicated to starting up another one and so forth appear elsewhere and do start up another one you always get this phenomenon occurring they cannot be obliterated and i dont think youll ever again just try to just obliterate because weve learned it cant be done but they can be managed they can be handled it takes intelligence and force they can be managed they can be handled they can be helped and they can be thrown on reverse vector now you say what does this mean for the future does this mean that there will be more free beings oh id hate to think of that man i reserve my right to go sit on mountaintop for few trillennia and take long breath you understand particularly after these last thirteen years anyway the point i am making herethe point i am making here is the use of intelligence with force can maintain freedom of action and so on without racking up new bank without racking up new overts without the war again turning entirely against one theres never been lasting or intelligent society of free beings you say how could you have society of free beings well in the first place you cant do without society of free beings that is to say its all very well for everybody to be totally on his own but look where this gets everybody it gets everybody downscale in the long run so that it doesnt work and if you mean totally irresponsible freedomif thats the definition of freedom see total irresponsibility all up and down the line well youre not talking about freedom youre talking about catastrophe what it takeswhat it takes is knowhow and forcenot knowhow in how to play the force you probably know how to mock up body you probably know how to do this that the other thing these tricks are pretty easy that isnt the missing intelligence the missing intelligence is balanced technology if you know how to enslave people everybody knows how to enslave people then they equally should know how to free people if they are going to make up matter matter matter and so forth well fine lets not be quite so insistent on the matter being totally indestructible and lets also specialize in being able to asis matter as easily as we make it in other words lets bring the thing back into little bit better balance when these meatbody societies start whizzing along well dont just disorganize the whole thing like stirring into an anthill thats silly thing to do why why is it silly well the laws of life are against it these ants kicking the bucket go over and make society over there look while theyre there in the anthill you canyou still got them you can do something with them you understand but every time you just totally disperse them boom you see oh theyre just going to make another anthill and its going to be mad as hell at anything like you you see so the war is begun right there itthe universe can do lot of growing up it can do lot of growing up at this end of the line we have technology we have technology that can make an ot the technology has to be very skillfully applied thats mostly because everybody has skidded so low they are rough to handle as cases we neednt have let it go this long but it had to go this long because opportunity offered itself now the war of everybody on his own everybody responsible everybody total force and everybody with the brains of peanut that cycle has ended that cycles got to be ended its not because i say itll be ended but because youll think twice before you start it rolling again i think wei thinkas free beings that any freedom to be maintained has to be maintained freedom is something you work at and freedom is something you work at intelligently if you think you are going to stay clear or ot simply by never destroying anything again youre nuts youre going to destroy lots of things from time to time and so forth how do you build up building unless you take down the building that is sitting in the place where youre going to put up the building you cant do it you see well theres always inevitably bit of destruction and let assure you that total mental treatment of criminals in society doesnt work the only way to handle criminal is to give him mental treatmentyou never do anything but give him mental treatment well you neednt hang him or burn him or do other things of this particular character but just turn him over to the psychiatrists as his total punishment who turn him loose in three daysgives you nothing but criminal society you got your hands on the boy why dont you use it there are limited technologies for straightening the kinks out on somebody without making an ot out of him theres lot of technology lying around one way or the other but for sure if somebody robbed store id be very likely to tell him well as soon as you can pay the storekeeper for his loss of goods and trouble why you can go free boy you know theres compensation you see freedom without barriers of any kind whatsoever is an insupportable freedom in the first place theres nothing for you to push against nothing to be free of so it makes very interesting problem its an interesting philosophic problem which im not in this lecture in any way intending to solve for you i am just pointing out that long cycle of this universe has come to an end not because youre here particularly it happens to be at an end all over the free ferocious being versus the meatbody society thats over and the battle was lost and that free being doesnt exist anymore all right so at this point of the line were shifting gears on the whole game of the universe thats an adventurous thing to do this is noteworthy time and the only way were doing it is quite simply were just putting some intelligence along with the force weve got the knowhow and the technology necessary to handle the problem which has never before been handled indoctrination in how to make things that always last forever inevitably and never go away and indoctrination in making things disappear painlessly and without chaos these two points are singularly unintelligent and i just thought i had better say something about them point them out and so on with regard to this from here on out you will find that your attitude toward being who is getting up in power and whos acting lope as the devil will very definitely be different than it was before you normally would say to that bird well just get away from here and dont bother us anymore i rather think sometime in the future youll say hey you huhhuh well im reminded of an engram i ran out of my pc she saw this black thetan sitting there and she decided to do something for him and help him so she poured him all over with white energy to wash off all the black energy and that didnt work and he wouldnt get white and she got very mad and stamped him into the ground now thats processing lose and that wasnt my engram to give you but i think my pc will forgive but thats an exasperation isnt it thetan has always had the impulse to help but not the technology to do so this is all highly esoteric and theoretical but the composition of what is an overt act contains omissionseldom looked at its omission not to do things for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics that becomes an overt act and one cannot maintain his freedom in the face of an overt act of that magnitude all intelligence and force are not good by long ways but it requires combination of force and intelligence to continue any position or status in this universe it requires both of them unbalanced why it all goes to pieces total force without intelligence total intelligence without force are equally myths they do not make for anything but disaster when youre getting up along the line you will ask yourself these things and you will say well now does this person deserve to be free do i dare push this personhes been bad boydo i dare push him any closer to ot youll find out oddly enough that you cant push him any closer to ot than he can accept the definition of an overt and his responsibility its very limiting factor now technologically aside from your skill in doing very few things and doing them very well i know now of other barrier to ot i dont know of any barrier hence im talking about this subject to you not on the basis of well what you ought to do is get yourself all freed up and take the top off the empire state building or pick your teeth with the chrysler building im not talking to you along that line whatsoever im talking to you quite in another way now the goal is quite assuredthe goal is quite assured on the exact technology which you are using at this moment and your skilled application and intelligent application of it will make you arrive there somebe quite time on the way and some will be shorter time on the way and so forth thats all taken for granted some are worse off than others and so forth thats taken for granted when you finally get down to the final action of ot well just what are you making this will occupy your minds in the very near future just what is the end product of all this and if i could tellif i could tell you that yes each person just irresponsibly by all of us is just let free to go and wander and do anything he pleases anyplacenot that we would discipline him particularly but just let free to go anyplace and do anything he wants and its all up to him and that sort of thing im telling you that this is shortsighted irresponsibility which will again almost immediately wind us up in the soup we have to continue to take our responsibility for our fellows we have to go on with that and we cant continue to exist on an irresponsible line of just forgetting and abandoning everybody and anybody and leave them on the theta pole so what you know this kind of an attitude because that kind of an attitude breeds for each one of us entrapment in the long run we have to learn to take care of our own because we will have made that own with our own lilywhite emeters thank you very much
