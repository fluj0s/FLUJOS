funded by pl 1105 the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 the law continues funds at the fy2006 account level unless ot herwise specified the law enacted on february 15 2007 required that agencies and departments submit an allocation of funds below the account level within 30 days of enactment the submissions are to be sent to the house and senate appropriations committees introduction the annual interior environment and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate fe deral departments as well as numerous related agencies and bureau s it provides funding for department of the interior doi agencies except for the bureau of reclamation funded in energy and water developmen t appropriations laws ma ny of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs the bill also provides funds for agencies in two other departments th forest service in the department of agriculture and the indian health service in the department of health and human services as well as funds for the envir onmental protection agency further the annual bill includes funding for arts and cu ltural agencies such as the smithsonian institution national gallery of art national endowment for the arts and national endowment for the humanities and fo r numerous other entities and agencies in recent years the appropriations laws for interior and related agencies provided funds for several activities within the department of energy doe including research development and c onservation programs the naval petroleum reserves and the strategic petroleum reserve however at the outset of the 109th congress these doe programs were transferred to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water to consolidate jurisdiction over doe1 at the same time jurisdiction over the environmental protection agency epa and several smaller entities was moved to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering interior and related agencies2 this changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs2 2 continued agencies the senate panel is entitled the subcommittee on interior and related agenciesresulted from the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs housin g and urban development and independent agencies which previously had jurisdiction over epa the fy2006 interior environment and related agencies appropriations law contained three primary titles providing funding the regula r annua l fy2007 legislation hr 5386 followed similar or ganization and this report is organized along these lines accordingly the first section title i provides information on interior agencies the second section title ii discusses epa and the third section title iii addresses other agencies programs and tities fourth section of this report discusses crosscutting topics that encompass more than one agency the report does not contain fy2007 enacted levels for agencies programs and activities because these funding levels ar being determined by the agencies as provided under pl 1105 in gene ral in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available incl uding regular annual and supplemental appropriations as well as rescissions transfers and deferrals but excludes permanent budget authorities increases and decreases generally are calculated on comparisons between fy2007 funding leve ls for the most recent action on hr 5386 and those requested by the presid ent for fy2007 and appropriated for fy2006 the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report other sour ces of information include the senate committee on appropriations agency budget justifications and the congressional record in the tables throughout this report some columns of funding figures do not add to the precise totals provided due to rounding fy2007 budget and appropriations current overview funds for interior environment and related agencies for fy2007 are contained in pl 1105 the revised c ontinuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 continuing funding is needed to fund agency operations and activities because congress did not enact regula r fy2007 appropriations bill for interior environment and related agencies p l 1105 provides funds though september 30 2007 which is the rest of the fiscal year it continues funds at the fy2006 account level except where otherwise specifi ed the law requires that agencies and departments submit an alloca tion of funds below the account level for example for programs and activities to the house and senate appropriations committees the submissions are due within 30 days of enactment which occurred on february 15 2007 prior to the enactment of pl 1105 tinuing funds were pr ovided to interior environment and related agencies through series of laws to continue funds at the lower of either the fy2006 level or th housepassed level for fy2007 howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs3 projects and activities that were included in the fy2006 appropriations law but not in the fy2007 housepassed bill

certain nonfederal land for the blm for fy2007 the house approved 179 billion and the senate appropriations committee repor ted 180 billion the house bill would have been an increase of 312 million 2 from the fy2006 enacted level of 175 billion while the senate committee bill would ve been an increase of 502 million 3 see table 3 below the administrations fy2007 budget suggested amending the

array of blm land pr ograms including protection recreational use improvement development dispos and general blm administration the house and the senate appropr iations committee agreed with the administrations approach to decreas funds for some programs from fy2006 including deferred maintenance and management of soil ai r and water the house and the senate appropriations committee so agreed with the administrations approach to increase funds for some programs over fy2006 for instance for cultural resources the request and th senate committee vel were 181 million up 31 million 21 from the fy2006 enacted level of 150 million while the house approved 166 million the increas was for longterm initiative to inventory monitor stabilize and protect cultural resources for energy and minerals the request was 1347 million an increase of 243 million 22 over fy2006 1104 million including alaska minerals the house supported 1330 million and the senate appropriations committee reported 1380 million the overall increase was intended to foster acce ss to energy resources on federal lands portion was to process the growing numbe r of applications for permits to drill and for related inspection enforcement and monitoring another portion was tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs8 accelerate implementation of an oil shale velopment program further the budget assumed that congress would enact legisl ation in 2006 to open the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to development thus an increase was sought for preparing and implementing an anwr leasing program and for management of energy development activities in the national petroleum reserve alaska in other cases the house senate appropriations committee and administration took differing approaches relative to fy2006 levels for instance the house approved 670 million for recrea tion management 3 increase over fy2006 while the administration proposed 2 cut and the senate appropriations committee recommended nearly level funding the house also included 201 million for resource protection and law forcement 6 increase over fy2006 in part for law enforcement along the southwest border by contrast the administration and the senate ppropriations committee supported 186 million 2 cut from fy2006 for conveyance of nds in alaska the administration and house sought 352 million 12 cut but the senate appr opriations committee recommended level f unding at 400 million both the housepassed and senate committeereported bills continued to bar funds from being used for energy leasing activities within the boundaries of national monuments as they were on january 20 2001 except where allowed by the presidential proclamations that created the monuments the bills also continued the moratorium on accepting and processing applications for patents for mining and mill site claims on federal lands however applications meeting certain requirements that were filed on or before septembe r 30 1994 would be allowed to proceed and third party contractors would be authorized to process the mineral examinations on those applications the house agreed to an amendment to prohibit funds in the bill from being used for the sale or slaughter of wild horses and burros as fined in pl 92195 amendment proponents seek to prevent blm from selling during fy2007 excess wild horses and burros under authority enact ed in pl 108447 according to blm 41 animals that were sold under that author ity were subsequently resold or traded and then sent to slaughterhouses by the new owners advocates of the amendment assert that there are alternatives for c ontrolling populations of wild horses on federal lands such as fertility control opponent s of similar amendment to the previous years appropriations bill contended that blms changes to the sale procedure would prevent animals from being slaughtered they maintained that sale authority was needed because adoptions and other efforts to reduce herd sizes have been insufficient further they asserted that significant funds used for caring for animals in holding facilities could be redirected to other govern ment priorities although the house passed similar amendment to the fy2006 interior appropriations bill the provision was not enacted wildland fire management for wildland fire management for fy2007 the house approved 7693 million 140 million increase

housepassed bill would pr ovide 1137 million fo r this program and the senate appropriations committeereported bill would provide 1060 million the increase in funds is due to proposed reorganiza tion of the usgs budg et see introduction above the senate appr opriations committee did not provide an additional 46 million for the federal geographic data committee because rationale for the increase in funds was given national mapping program the national mapping program aims to provide public access to high quality geos patial information the administration requested 766 million for this program

the fy2006 enacted level the senate appropriations committeereported bill also would change the program name and recommends 786 million for the program the primary reduction in requested funds for

resource assessments and research that benefit federal land management programs as opposed to both federal and nonfe deral needs as in previous years the administration expects that universities or other entities will undertake assessments and research that support nonfederal n eeds the reduction will result in the discontinuation of most res earch and data collection pr ojects including those

however the house appropriations committee disagreed that f unding for new schools should be reduced while current school construction projects are finished and expressed concern about large amounts

cleanup of hazardous waste sites within the superfund account sc ientific research and air quality programs have received the most attention thus far in the second session of the 109th congress other areas of interest include funding for epas homeland security activities and congre ssional funding priorities for individual research and water infrastructure projects often referred to as earmarks26 the house allocated 2700 million to congressional prio rity projects for fy2007 the senate appropriations committee set aside 2800 million the same as the fy2006 congressional setaside as in past

project earmarks in epa appropriations trends and policy implications by claudia copelandcontentious as there is disagreement over the adequacy of funding to meet local needs such as municipal sewage treatme nt plant upgrades although appropriations for these grants have declined in recent years congress has appropriated significantly more funding than the president has request ed to meet these n eeds the proposals of the house and the senate appropriati ons committee to approve the presidents requested decrease for fy2007 depart from this trend the house and the senate appropriati ons committee approved the presidents request of 8415 million for drinking water srf grants an increase above the fy2006 appropriation of 8375 million the pr oposal to fund drinking water srf grants at the requested level is consistent with past years as there generally has been less disagreement between congress and th administration bout the appropriate funding level for these grants however some members support higher funding to meet local drinking water needs such as assistance to help communities comply with new standards for drinking water cont aminants eg arsenic and radium in addition to funding for drinki ng water srf grants the senate appropriations committee r ecommended 110 million to assi st small public water systems in complying with safe drinking water regulations of this amount 55 million w ould be provided within the science and technology account for alternative technology projects to help small water systems comp ly with the disinfection byproducts dbp rules and related regulations th remaining 55 million would be provided within the environmental programs and management account for competitive grant program to provide technical assistance to small drinking water systems for complying with the arsenic and dbp regulations27 congress also has provided specific funds in past appropriations for water infrastructure projects in certain communities whether these needs should be met with srf loan monies or earmarked grant assistance has become controversial due in part to such concerns and the competing needs of many epa activities in general the amount of funding earmarked for water infrastructure projects has declined since fy200428 the house set aside 2000 m illion for congressional priority water infrastructure projects within the stag account for fy2007 the senate appropriations committee r ecommended 2100 million for these types of projects both amounts are more th an the 1 971 milli on congress set aside in the fy2006 appropriation the house and senate appr opriations co mmittees identified the recipients of these funds in their respective reports on hr 5386 as in past years the presidents fy2007 budget did not include any funding for congressional priority water infrastructure projects superfund and brownfields another prominent issue is the adequacy of funding for the superfund program to clean up the nations most hazardous waste sites some members stat and environmental organi zations have contended that more funds than have been appropriated are necessary to speed the pace of cleanuphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs48 at contaminated sites the house th senate appropriations committee and the president proposed roughly similar am ounts of 126 billion for the superfund account prior to transfers to ot her accounts as indicated in table 16 these amounts vary somewhat but all are in creases above the fy2006 ppropriation of 124 billion this account funds many activ ities related to the cleanup of hazardous substances including administration enfo rcement and certain homeland security functions however only portion of th funding is for actual ie physical cleanup of contaminated sites the house approved 8329 million for site cleanup and the senate appr opriations committee r ecommended 8331 million both slightly less than the fy2006 appropria tion of 8339 million the president had requested larger decrease propos ing 8229 million for site cleanup some members had questioned the presidents requested decrease during budget oversight hearings in light of public concerns about the pace of cleanup to ensure protection of human health and the environment the source of funding for the superf und program also has been an ongoing issue nearly all the funding for the program in the superfund account that the house the senate appr opriations committee and th president have proposed would be provided from general us treasur revenues three dedicated taxes on petroleum chemical feedstocks and cor porate income historically provided the majority of funding for the superfund prog ram these taxes expired at the end of 1995 and the remaining revenue s were essentially used up by the end of fy2003 since then congress has funded the progra m almost entirely w ith general revenues although cost recoveries from responsible parties fines and pe nalties and interest on the unexpended balance of the trust fund continue to contribute revenue to the superfund program these sources continue to be relatively small compared to general revenues some members of congress advocate reinsta ting the superfund taxes and assert that the use of ge neral revenues undermines the polluter pays principle other members and the adminis tration counter that viable parties are still required to pay for the cleanup of contamination nd that polluters are not escaping their responsibility according to epa respons ible parties pay for the cleanup at more than 70 of superfund sites there also has been ongoing interest in the adequacy of funding to clean up other contaminated sites re ferred to as brownfields the cleanup of these sites is funded separately from supe rfund typically brownfie lds are abandoned idled or underutilized commercial and indus trial properties w ith levels of c ontamination less hazardous than superfund site but that still warrant cleanup before the land can be safe for reuse the house and the senate appropriations committee recommended the presidents request of 1633 million for epas brownfields program to assist states and tribes in the cleanup of thes properties slight increase

homeland secur ity activities as well as for certain programs authorized by the energy po licy act of 2005 becau of limited funding available for the bill as whole and comp eting funding needs for activities that the committee viewed as essential to the agencys mission and as having higher priority hrept 109465 p93 in its report on hr 5386 the sena appropriations committee did not explain its

among five of the agencys accounts st epm superfund building and facilities and stag f unding within these accounts would support various activities including critical water infrast ructure protection boratory preparedness decontamination protection of epa pe rsonnel and operations and communication among these five accounts the st account would include the largest portion of funding for epas homeland security activities the house approved 618 million within this account for these activities and the senate ppropriations committee recommended 682 million both amounts are an increase above the fy2006 appropriation of 502 million the increas above fy2006 are intended for one additional project for water quality surveillance and monitoring pilot project referred to as the water sentinel initiative which epa began in fy200629 the presidents fy2007 request had included 918 million within the st account for homeland security activities large portion of whic h would have funded four additional pilot project s under the above initiative some members of congress and scientists had expresse d concerns that the increase requested for homeland security funding within the st account for activities such as these pilot projects was competing with epas core research programs for which funding has been declining in recent years see related disc ussion below in its report on hr 5386

congress had set aside 329 million for these types of projects for fy2006 as in past years the presidents fy2007 request did not include any funding for congressional priority research projects within epas budget significant portion of the house nd the senate appropriations committee increases above fy2006 for the st account is in the form of an accounting adjustment as the presidents fy2007 budget proposed this adjustment would transfer 610 million into the st account for facilities infrastructure and operations these activities have been funded within the epm account through fy2006 the net effect is that the total nate appropriations committee amount of 8212 million for the st account without the 610 million adjustment would be decrease relative to the fy2006 appropriation the total house amount of 8380 million without the adjustment would be significantly smaller increase relative to the fy2006 appropriation among individual research activities as opposed to the account level the house and the senate appropriations committee approved both increases and decreases within the st account relative to each other as well as the fy2006 appropriation and the fy2007 request for example the house approved 2380 million for the human health and ecosystems research program area slightly more than the fy2006 appropriation but greater increas relative to the presidents fy2007 request of 2282 million the senate appropriations committee recommended 2303 million research fellowships are funde d within this program area including science to achieve results star fello wships in

appropriation but significantly more th an the presidents fy2007 request of 84 million with the increase devoted to star fellowships homeland security funding within the st account is another exampl

the reductions in funding that it requested for some scien tific research activ ities in fy2007 would not impair the quality of science citing that less funding is needed in certain areas because of

the specifi c services vary from site to site and may include direct clinical care alcohol and substance abus care referrals and health information the administration contends th at ihs must target funding and services towards indians on reservations and that ur ban indians can be served through other federal health and local h ealth programs for instance the administration proposed increased funding for the health centers pr ogram in hhs opponents assert that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs63 administration has not provided evidence that these alternative programs can replace the urban indian health program and has not studied the impact of the loss of ihs funding on health care for the approx imately 71000 urban i ndians who annually receive services through this program they further believe that only the urban indian health program will provide cult urally appropriate care the house appropriations committee r ecommended funding for the urban indian health program at its fy2006 level asserting that the program had good assessment rating and that the program has attracted add itional nonihs funding the house agreed with the committees recommendation th senate appropr

relocation the office of navajo and hopi indian relocation onhir and its predecessor were created pursuant to 1974 act pl 93531 as amended to resolve lengthy dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving lands originally set aside by the federal government for reservation in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act the lands were partitioned between the two tribes members of one tribe living on land

acquisition or construction infrastructure construction and postmove support all for families being relocated as well as certification of families eligibility for relocation benefits for fy2007 the administration proposed 59 million in new appropriations for onhir 30 reduction from th fy2006 appropriation of 85 milli on the house and the senate appropriations committee approved the administrations proposed amount onhir estimated it would also spend about 120 million in unobligated carryover funds during fy2006 thereby reducing its large unobligated balance from 190 million at the beginning of fy2005 to 30 million by the end of fy2006 navajohopi relocation began in 1977 nd is now nearing completion onhir still has backlog of relocatees who ar approved for replacement homes but have not yet received them most families subject to relocation were na vajo originally an estimated 3400 eligible na vajo families reside d on land partitioned or judicially confirmed to the hopi while only 26 eligible hopi families lived on navajo partitioned land according to onhir data by the end of fy2004 according to onhir 96 of the navajo families and 100 of the h opi families had completed relocation in addition however about lf of the roughly 250 navajo families only some of them among the 3400 eligib families who signed accommodation agreements under pl 104301 that allo wed them to stay on hopi land under hopi law may wish to opt out of these agr eements and relocate using onhir benefits according to onhirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33399crs65 onhir estimated that as of the nd of fy2004 130 navajo families were awaiting relocation eleven of these familie s were still residing on hopi partitioned land with three of them having homes bu ilt or seeking homes and eight refusing to relocate or sign an accomm odation agreement onhir and the us department of justice are negotiating with the hopi tribe to allow the eight families to stay on hopi land as autonomous families in return fo r onhirs relocating off hopi land those families who signed agreements but wish to opt out in its fy2006 budget justification onhir had estimated that relocation moves for currently eligible families would be completed by the end of fy2006 the addition of navajo families who have opted out of accommodation agreements and of navajo families w ho filed late appli cations or appeals but whom onhir proposes to accommodate to avoid litigation to gether estimated at 210 families would mean that all relocation moves would not be completed until the end of fy2008 according to onhir this schedule w ould depend on infrastructure needs and relocatees decisions in ddition required postmove assi stance to relocatees would necessitate another two years of expenditures after the last relocation move whether in fy2006 or fy2008 congress has been concerned at times bout the speed of the relocation process and about avoiding forced relocations or evictions pending legislation s 1003 would sunset onhir in 2008 and transfer an remaining duties to the secretary of the interior further longstanding proviso in onhir appr opriations language retained for fy2006 and approved by th house and the senate appropriations committee for fy2007 prohibits onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home were provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families in the near future because of onhirs backlog of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes as the backlog is reduced however forced eviction may become an issue if any remaining navajo families were to refuse relocation and if the hopi tribe were to exercise right under pl 104301 to be gin legal action against the united states for failure to give the hopi tribe quiet possession of all hopi partitioned lands the agreement that onhir reported it was negotiating with the justice department and the hopi tribe seeks to avoid this smithsonian institution the smithsonian in stitution si is museum and education and research complex consisting of 19 museums and ga lleries the national zoo and 9 research facilities

and other details for their land acquisition activities second the lwcf funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through grant program administered by the nps sometimes referred to as stateside funding third administrations have requested and congress has appropriate d money from the lwcf to fund some related ac tivities this third use is relatively recent starting w ith the fy1998 appropriati on programs funded have varied from year to year most of the appropriations fo r federal acquisitions generally are specified for management units such as specific national wildlife refuge while the state grant program and appropriations for other related activities rarely are earmarked from fy1965 through fy2006 about 29 billion has been credited to the lwcf about half that amount 143 billion has been appropriated throughout history annual appropriations from lw cf have fluctuated considerably until fy1998 lwcf funding did not exceed 400 million

everglades p hosphorus is one of the primary water pollutants in the everglades and pr imary cause for ecosystem degradation in its report for fy2007 the house appropriations committee contends that good water quality is essentia l for restoring the everglades and opposes any changes to the consent decree which establishes goal of lowering phosphorus levels to 10 ppb parts per billion in fe deral lands in the everglades to support this position the housepassed bill would condition funds for implementing mod waters based on the state of florida meeting water quality standards this condition also applies if the terms of the consent decree are termin ated prior to its mandate of achieving low levels of phosphorus also in the housepassed bill and in the senate appropriations committee reported bill funds for m od waters would also be unavailable unless funds for implementing mod waters and engineering and design documents for the tamiami trail component of the project are appr opriated to the corps the condition on funding mod waters stems from provision in the law pl 106541 that authorizes the implementation of cerp this provi sion states that mod waters must be completed
