the tax benefits particularly the exclusion for em ployerpaid insurance by their effect on the cost and allocation of health care resources and by interest in comprehensive tax and health care reform president bush has proposed taxing the insurance that workers receive from employers and providi ng new standard deduction for health insurance regardless of whether coverage is obtained through employment or in the individual or small group markets tax c ode changes also figure prominently in many comprehensive health care reform proposals current law contains significant tax bene fits for health insurance and expenses 1 employerpaid coverage is excluded fro m the determination of both income and employment taxes this exclusion also applies to health benefits in cafeteria plans 2 selfemployed taxpayers ma deduct 100 of their health insurance even if they do not itemize deductions 3 taxpay ers who itemize may deduct insurance payments and other unreimbur sed medical expenses to the extent they exceed 75 of adjusted gross income while not widely used this deduction benefits those who purchase individual market policies or who have catastrophic costs 4 some workers eligible for trade adjustment assistance or receiving pension paid by the pension benefit guarantee corporation can receive an advanceable refundable tax credit the health coverage tax credit hctc to purchase certain types of insurance 5 four taxadvantaged accounts are availabl to help taxpayers pay their health care expenses flexible spending accounts health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts and medi cal savings accounts 6 voluntary employees beneficiary association veba plans often called vebas are vehicles for prefunding retiree health benefits on ta xadvantaged basis for certain groups of workers particularly unionized workers 7 coverage under medicare medicaid schip and military and veterans health care programs is not considered taxable income 8 with exceptions benefits recei ved from private or public insurance are not taxable by lowering the aftertax cost of insurance these tax benefits generally help extend coverage to more people they also lead some people to obtain more coverage than they otherwise would the incentives influence how coverage is acquired the uncapped exclusion for employerpaid insu rance which can benefit nearly all workers and is easy to administer is pa rtly responsible for the predominance of employmentbased insurance in the unite d states in addition the tax benefits increase the demand for health care by enabling insured people to obtain services at discounted prices this in turn contributes to rising health care costs because many people would likely obtain insurance without tax benefits they can be an inefficient use of public dollars when insurance is viewed as form of personal consumption the tax benefits appear inequitable because taxpayers savings depend on marginal tax rates when viewed as spreading catastrophic economic risk over multiple years however basing those savings on marginal rates might be justified as the proper treatment for losses under progressive tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505contents most recent developments 1 t x b n f i t s i n c u r r n t l w 1 m p l r p i d i n s u r n c 2 u n r i m b u r s d m d i c l x p n s s 3 i n d i v i d u l

signifi cant tax benefits for health insurance and expenses the tax subsidies mostly federal income tax exclusions and deductions are widely available though not everyone can take advantage of them they reward some people more than others raising questions of equity they influence the amount and type of coverage that peopl obtain which affects their ability to choose doctors and other providers in addition th tax benefits affect the di stribution and cost of health care this section of the report summarizes the current tax treatment of the principal ways that people obtain health insurance and pay their health care expenses it describes general rules but does not discuss all limitations qualifications or exceptions to understand possible effects on tax liability readers may want to refer to the appendix for an outline of the federal income tax formula for example exclusions are omitted from gross income whereas deductions are subtracted from gross income in order to arrive at taxabl income section number references are to the internal revenue c ode of 1986 as amended this section also includes joint committee on taxation jct estimates of tax expenditures where available

employer health benefits 2006 summary of findings by the kaiser family foundation and the health research and educational trust much of the employers cost for this insurance is probably passed on to employees through reductions in wages and other forms of compensation 3 sections 106 and 3121 respectively 4 sections 104 and 105 5 about 70 of these employers purchase stoploss insurance to cover major liabilitiesmost of the tax rules discu ssed here have also been dopted by states that have income taxes employerpaid insurance more than 60 of the noninstitutionaliz ed population under age 65 is insured under an employmentbased plan in the average plan employers pay about 84 of the cost of single coverage and 73 of the cost of fa mily coverage though some pay all and others pay none2 health insurance paid by employers generally is excluded from employees gross income in determining their income tax liability it also is not considered for either the employees or the employers share of employment taxes ie social security medicare and unemployment taxes3 the income and employment tax exclusions apply to both single and family coverage which includes the employees spouse and dependents pre miums paid by employees may be subject to premium conversion arrangemen t under cafeteria plan or counted towards the itemized medical expense deduction both of which are discussed below insurance benefits paid from employme ntbased plans are excluded from gross income if they are reimbursements for medical expenses or payments for permanent physical injuries benefits not meeting these tests are taxable in proportion to the share of the insurance costs paid by the employer that were previously excluded from gross income 4 benefits are also taxable to the extent that taxpayers received tax benefit from deducting expens in prior year eg if taxpayers claimed deduction for medical expenditures in 2006 and then r eceived an insurance reimbursement for them in 2007 in addition benefits received by highly compensated employees under discriminatory selfinsured plans are partly taxable selfinsured plan is one in which the employer assumes the risk for health care plan and does not shift it to third party5 employers may deduct their insurance pa yments as business expense the deduction is not tax benefit but calcula tion necessary for the proper measurement of the net income that is subject to ta xation revenue loss attributable to this deduction is not consider ed tax expenditurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs3 6 the jct estimate includes payments of prem iums through cafeteria plans the fy2007 tax expenditure estimate from the administration is considerably higher 1468 b illion analytical perspectives budget of the ited states governme nt fiscal year 2007 p 289 the difference is attributable to several fact ors the most important of which is the jct assumption that without the exclusion the itemized deduction for medical care would be higher 7 section 213 if the taxpayer is subject to the alternative minimu m tax amt this is limited to expenses that exceed 10 of agi section 56b1b 8 section 213d1a 9 michael parisi and scott hollenbeck individual income tax returns 2003 statistics of income bulletin vol 25 2 fall 2005 us internal revenue service table 3the joint committee on taxation jct estimated that the fy 2007 tax expenditure attributable to the exclusion fo r employer payments for health insurance and health care for selfinsured plans will be 997 billion the estimate does not include the effect of the ex clusion on employment taxes6 unreimbursed medical expenses taxpayers who itemize their deducti ons may deduct unr eimbursed medical expenses that exceed 75 of adjusted gross income agi7 medical expenses include health insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer principally premiums for individual market policies and the employ ees share of premiums for employment based coverage aside from those subject to premium conversion arrangement more generally medical expenses include amounts paid for the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or preven tion of disease or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body8 they also include certain transportation and lodging expenditures qualified longterm care costs and longterm care insurance premiums that do not exceed certain amounts the deduction is intended to help only people with catastrophic expenses so by design it is not widely used for most taxp ayers the standard deduction is larger than the sum of their itemized deductions mo reover most do not have unreimbursed expenses that exceed 75 agi in 2003 just under 34 of all individual income tax returns had itemized deduc tions of these returns less than 20 about 67 of all returns claimed medical expense deduction9 the jct estimated that the fy2007 tax expe nditure attributable to the medical expense deduction including longterm care expenses will be about 82 billion individual market policies about 6 of the noninstitutionalized population under age 65 is insured through priv ate individual market policies likely purchasers include early retirees young adults employees without access to employmentbased insurance and the selfemployed all of these people can claim the medical expense deduction just descri bed provided they qualify ie they must itemize and then can deduct only unreim bursed expenses that exceed 75 agi many selfemployed taxpayers can cla im more generous deduction described belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs4 10 corporations may elect scor poration status if they meet number of internal revenue code requirements among other things they cannot have more than 100 shareholders or more than one class of stock scorpora tions are taxreporting rather than taxpaying entities in contrast to ccorporations whic h are subject to the corporate income tax 11 section 162lpremiums for certain types of individual market insurance are not deductible including policies for loss of life limb and sight policies that pay guaranteed amounts each week for stated number of weeks for hospitalization policies to provide payment for loss of earnings and the part of car insurance that provides medical coverage for persons injured in or by the policyholders car benefits paid under accident and hea lth insurance policies purchased by individuals are excluded from gross income even if they exceed medical expenses selfemployed individuals selfemployed individuals include sole proprietors single owners of unincorpor ated businesses general partners limited partners who receive guaranteed payments and individuals who receive wages from scorporations in which they ar more than 2 shareholders10 selfemployed taxpayers may deduct payments for health insurance in determining their agi ie as an abovetheline deduction11 the abovethe line deduction for the selfemployed is not restricted to itemizers or subject to floor as is the medical expense deduction described above cu rrently 100 of the insurance cost may be taken into cons ideration however the deduction cannot exceed the net profit and any other earned income from the business under which the plan is established less deduc tions taken for certain retir ement plans and for onehalf the selfemployment tax it is not available for any month in which the taxpayer or the taxpayers spouse is eligible to participate in subsidized employmentbased health plan ie one in which the employer pays part of the cost these restrictions prevent taxpayers with little net income from their business which is not uncommon for new business from deducting much if any of their insurance payments the portion not deductible under these rules ma be treated as an itemized medical expense deduction selfemployed individuals may not duct their health insurance costs in determining the employment taxes they pay the selfemployment tax in 2003 about 38 million tax returns about 29 of all return s claimed the selfemployed health insurance deducti on for fy2007 the jct estimated that the tax expenditure attributable to the deduc tion including the selfemployed deduction for longterm care insurance will be 42 billion cafeteria plans cafeteria plans are employerestablis hed benefit plans under which employees may choose between receiving cash typica lly additional take

taxationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs5 12 section 125 cash in this context includes any taxable benefit 13 rev rul 200362 14 the jct estimate for health insurance receive d through cafeteria plans is also included in the exclusion for employerpaid insurance discussed aboveis that taxpayers given these options w ill be taxed on whichever they choose because they are deemed to be in constructive receipt of the cash the cafeteria plan provisions of the code provide an express ex ception to this rule when the plan meets various reporting and nondis crimination requirements12 nontaxable benefits received under cafeteria plan are exempt from both income and employment taxes cafeteria plans may be simple or complex simple plans might allow employees to c hoose be tween cash and one nontaxable benefit such as additional health insurance complex plans might give employees pot of money to allocate among health insurance and reimburseme nt accounts dependent care assistance group term life insurance commuter be nefits and cash as they see fit premium conversion under cafeteria plan option known as premium conversion employees may ect to reduce their taxable wages in exchange for having their share of health insurance premiums paid on pretax basis the arrangement reduces both income and empl oyment taxes federal employees who participate in the federal employees health benefits program fehbp have been able to elect this option since octobe r 2000 private sector and state or local government employees may so elect premium conversion if their employers permit in general premium conversion is not av ailable to retirees the barrier is not the cafeteria plan rules but an internal revenue service irs determination that distributions from qualified retirement plans are always subject to taxes aside from several minor exceptions13 the irs ruling precludes former employees from recasting pension payments as pretax in come as active workers can recast their wages however employer payments fo r retiree health insurance are excluded from taxes just as they are for active workers for many retirees the employer pays much of the premium the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 allows certain retired public safety officers to pay up to 3000 of qualified health insu rance premiums from their pensions on pretax basis the premiums do not have to be for plan sponsored by the former employer however the exclusion does not apply to premiums paid by the retiree and then reimbursed with pe nsion distributions for fy2007 the jct estimated that the tax expenditure attributable to cafeteria plans will be 306 billion the estimate in cludes the tax expenditures attributable to dependent care flexible spending accounts14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs6 15 some fsas are linked to employers health insurance plans so provider payments can be made directly from the accounts these arrangements avoid the need for employees to pay first and then seek reimbursement 16 for additional information see crs report rl32656 health care flexible spending accounts by bob lyke 17 the tax relief and health care act of 2006

all cafeteria plans have fsas and not all fsas are part of cafeteria plans fsa reimbursements funded through salary reduc tion agreements the most common arrangement are exempt from income and employment taxes under cafeteria plan provisions because employees have choice between cash their regular salary and nontaxab benefit in contrast fsa reimbursements funded by nonelective employer

end of the year must be forfeited to the employer the use it or lose it rule thoug h employers may allow 2½month grace period17 fsas cannot be used to purchase insurance however they can be combined with premium conve rsion arrangements under cafeteria plans to achieve the same tax effect in 2004 about 20 of privatesector blishments offered health care fsa to their workers18 they are more common

utility industries some consequences of the tax benefits increases in coverage by lowering the aftertax cost of insurance some of the tax benefits described above help extend coverage to more people this is of course the intention congress has long been concerned about whether people have access to health care the public subsidy implicit in the incentives the foregone tax revenue usually is justified on grounds that people would othe rwise underinsure that is they would delay purchasing coverage in the hope that they will not become ill or have an accident uninsured people are an indicati on of what economists call market failure they impose spillover costs on society in the form of public health risks and uncompensated charity care if insuran ce were purchased only by people who most need health care its cost would become prohibitive for others tax benefits also lead some people to obtain more coverage than they might otherwise choose they purchase insurance that covers more than hospitalization and other catastrophic expenses such as routine doctor visits prescription drugs and dental care they obtain coverage with smaller deductibles and copayments than are necessary however many people are riskaverse with respect to health care so thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs14 tax benefits are only one factor influe ncing the amount of insurance purchased some people contend that comprehensive c overage and lower costsharing lead to better preventive care and possibly longter m savings for certain medical conditions tax benefits associated with heat h savings accounts are an attempt to encourage people to purchase less coverage by having higher deductibles in this respect they appear to differ from the tax benefits usually associated with health insurance however the accounts themse lves might be viewed as form of insurance particularly as they grow in size so it is not clear what their impact will be in reducing ove rall coverage the source of insurance coverage tax benefits influence the way in whic h insurance coverage is acquired the uncapped exclusion for employerpaid insu rance which can benefit nearly all workers and is easy to administer is pa rtly responsible for the predominance of employmentbased insurance in the united st ates in contrast restrictions on the itemized deduction allowed fo r individual private market insurance may be one reason this insurance covers only about 6 of the noninstitutionalized population under age 65 employmentbased insuran ce carries both advantages and disadvantages for the typical worker the principal advantage is that coverage is base d on larger and often more stable risk pools this generally lowe rs the cost for people who need more care usually employee premiums do not vary by age or risk although young and healthy workers sometimes pay more than they would for identical individual market coverage they are protected from cost increas as they get older or need additional care however plans chosen by employer s may not meet individual workers needs particularly if there is only one available health plan and changing jobs may require both new insurance and doctors increases in health care use and cost tax benefits increase the demand for health care by enabling insured people to obtain services at discounted prices this induced demand can be beneficial to the extent that it reflects needed health care that which so ciety deems everyone should have that financial constrai nts otherwise would have prev ented it can be wasteful to the extent it results in less essential or ineffective care in any case increasing use of health care contributes to rising health care costs whether insurance coverage could be encouraged without increasing the cost of health care has long been matter of debate comprehensiv reforms that might accomplish this goal include capping the exclusion for employerpaid insurance and replacing both the exclusion and the deduction with limited tax credit but substantial changes along these lines could be difficult to implement and might create serious inequities consumerdriven health care most commonly associated with high deductible insurance plans coupled with health reimbur sement accounts and health savings accounts is recent atte mpt to help people obtain coverage without driving up costs as much the congressional budget office analyzed this approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs15 40 horizontal equity is tax principle which in the case of an income tax holds that people who have essentially equal economic income should be treated the same 41 vertical equity is tax principle which in th case of an income tax holds that people who have higher economic income should have higher tax liabilitiesin december 2006 publication consumerdirected health plans potential effects on health care and spending outcomes many people probably would obtain some h ealth insurance even without the tax benefits the cost of subsidizing peopl for what they would otherwise do is an inefficient use of public dollars one impor tant goal of the tax incentives is for insurance to be purchased only to the extent it results in better health care for society as whole but how the incentives could be revised to accomplish this goal is difficult question given the different ways insurance is provided the various ways it is regulated and the voluntary natu re of decisions to purchase it equity questions might be raised about the di stribution of the tax incentives because as practical matter they are not available to everyone problems of horizontal equity arise40 workers without employmentbased insurance generally cannot benefit from them nor can many early retirees peopl under 65 the age of medicare eligibility even if these individuals itemize their deductions they may deduct health insurance premiums only to the extent that they and other health care expenditures exceed 75 of agi in contrast the exclusi on for employerpaid insurance is unlimited even if everyone could benefit from th tax incentives there would be questions of vertical equity41 tax savings from the exclusi ons and deductions described above generally are determined by taxpayers marginal tax rate thus taxpayers in the 15 tax bracket would save 600 in income taxes from 4000 exclusion ie 4000 x 015 for an employerpaid premium wher eas taxpayers in the 35 bracket would save 1400 ie 4000 x 035 if health insura nce is considered form of personal consumption like food or clothing this patte rn of benefits woul d strike many people as unfair it is unlikely that governme nt grant program would be designed in this manner however to the extent that health insurance is considered way of spreading an individuals catastrophic economic risk over multiple years basing tax savings on marginal tax rates might be justified under progressive income tax system economic losses ought to be deducted at applicable marginal rates just as economic gains are taxed at those rates assessing the equity of tax incentives for health insurance is complicated by uncertainty as to who pays for employer subs idies in the long run the cost of these subsidies presumably is passed on to the wo rkers in the form of reductions to wages and other benefits but whether these reduc tions are shared equally by all workers is unclear given differences in their preferences for insurance their attachment to particular employers and br oader labor market forces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs16 42 for information

of one provision could differ substan tially depending on the scope of these other changes some changes might occur through legislation that ostensibly has little to do with particular topic for example tax credit for health insurance could increase the number of health savings accounts by enabling currently uninsured people to purchase qualifying high deductible insurance similarly capping the exclusion for employerpaid insurance could increase th number of people who claim the medical expense deduction because they would have more unreimbursed expenses the presidents proposal the presidents fy2009 budget proposes re placing several longstanding tax benefits for health insurance and medical expenses with new standard deductions for health insurance the new deductions 7500 for

congressional budget office an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2008 p 62 cbo cautions that estimated effects on coverage are highly continuedwith some minor exceptions the proposal is similar to what was proposed in the fy2008 budget it would terminate these existing tax benefits the exclusion for employer paid health insurance the exclusion for employer paid health care the exclusion for flexible spending accounts fsas and health reimbursement accounts hras the exclusion for premium conversion arrangements the health insurance deduction available to selfemployed taxpayers and the itemized deduction for medical expenses except after 2013 forthose who are not eligible fo r the new standard deduction the proposal would also affect employme nt taxes ie social security and medicare taxes however employers w ould be allowed to exclude prorated portion of these taxes and prior to 2013 em ployees could claim refund of employer payments when they file their own retu rns these rules are different from the fy2008 proposal the proposal would not affect the excl usion for employer contributions to health savings accounts nor the deduction individuals ma take for their own hsa contributions employers would be required to report the value of health insurance coverage to their employees on their annual w2 fo rms the amounts would be subject to regular withholding rules businesses would continue to deduct employerpaid health insurance as business expense just as they do other taxable forms of compensation jct and cbo estimates for the fy2008 proposal the joint committee on taxation jct estimated that repealing the provisions of existing law and providing the new standard health insurance deduction w ould reduce net revenue by 228 billion from fy2009 to fy2012 the president proposed that the changes would be effective for tax years beginni ng after december 31 2008 however for the fy2009fy2017 period there would be an estimated net reve nue increase of 3336 billion 43 the congressional budget office cbo estimated that under current law there would be about 51 million people both adults and children without health insurance on any given day in 2010 if the presiden ts proposal were enacted and individuals and firms had fully adjusted to the new policy cbo estimated that the number of uninsured would decline by about 68 million44 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs18 44 continued uncertainsome observations the presidents proposal would increase tax equity for those who purchase health insurance outside of employer plans in particular the proposed standard deduction w ould allow individuals who buy coverage with their own funds to receive tax savings comparab to those who have the same amount of employerpaid insurance the proposal would also increase the transparency of employee compensation by showing workers on their w2 statements the nominal amounts employers were payi ng for their insurance however the proposed standard deduc tion may unfairly limit tax savings for individuals who live where health care is expensive or who receive health insurance from an employer with an older less he althy risk pool the more favorable tax treatment of individual health insurance mig ht spur some employ ers to drop coverage if the healthiest and youngest workers opt for individual insurance the proposal would decrease the incentives for employers to build and maintain large risk pools pushing some workers into the uncertain individual market the cbo estimates cited above show that the proposal might reduce the number of uninsured by about 13 not insubs tantial amount however many analysts argue that larger reductions could be ach ieved by replacing the proposed standard deduction with refundable tax credit exclusion for employerpaid insurance the presidents proposal to terminate the exclusion for employerpaid health insurance is discussed above s 334 wyden s 1019 coburn s 1783 enzi and s 1875

forfeited to the employer though th employer may allow 2½month grace period46 one rationale for this requirement is that cafeteria plans under which most health care fsas are funded cannot incl ude

balances and permitting more modifications to the accounts within pl an year hr 3363 pomeroy would allow longterm care insurance to be offe red under cafeteria plans and fsas the principal argument for allowing rollovers is that taxpayers might be more willing to participate in fsas if unused balances at the end of the year were not lost allowing carryovers or rollovers might so discourage participants from spending remaining balances carelessly just to use them up however fsas provide tax be nefits for the first dollars of health care spending which is just the opposite of the restri ction limiting the medical expense deduction to catastrophic expenses ie those exceeding 75 of agi fsas also conflicthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs21 with the rationale for high deductible insura nce which is not to provide thirdparty assistance for expenditures that are customary and routine some argue that expansion of fsas may inhibit the spread of health savings accounts allowing unused balances to be carried over or ro lled over would also in crease revenue losses associated with fsas health savings accounts on april 15 2008 the house approved the taxpayer assistance and simplification act of 2008 hr 5719 among other things the legislation would require that amounts paid or distributed for qualified medical expenses out of health savings account after december 31 2010 be substan tiated in manner similar to the substantiation required for fl exible spending accounts supporters of the hsa provision argue that it is needed to ensure accountability for withdrawals opponents claim that the provision would unreasonably increase administrative costs and inhibit the use of debit cards whic h are both popular and convenient the administration opposes the provision the presidents fy2009 budget includes several measures that would make them more attractive these include allowing health plans with 50 coinsurance to qualify as high deductible health plans allowing any medical expense incurred on or after the first day ofhsa eligibility to be considered qualified expense even if incurred before the hsa is established allowing larger contributions from employers for chronically ill persons allowing family coverage to incl ude coverage where each individual can receive benefits once they have reached the minimum deductible for an individual allowing both

their eligibility in other circumstances httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs23 47 it is also possible to place limits on re fundability for example the credit might be limited to the taxpayers regular tax liability plus payments for social security taxes credit might be refundable for purposes of the regular income tax but not the alternative minimum tax the narrow eligibility requirements are one reason why not many people use the hctc the requirements appear unfair with respect to people who are in similar circumstances such as service workers whose jobs have been shifted overseas or lost due to foreign trade although the bills remove this inequity for the groups mentioned above they are small fraction of the many who now are ineligible some 110th congress bills s 1652 s 17 39 hr 172 9 hr 910 s 1848 hr 3920 nd hr 3801 would also increase the credit rate and expanded insurance options these steps would likely help cashstrapped families that now cannot afford to pay the remaining 35 of the insurance cost or that cannot find qualifying insurance however some mig ht question whether additional subsidies should be provided to narrowly target ed groups while others get nothing refundable individual tax credit in recent years there has been much discussion of refundable income tax credit for health insurance refundability allows taxpayers to receive the full amount of credit even if it exceeds their regular tax liability47 the hctc described above is one example of refundable tax credit unlike that credit however most of the recent proposals would not be re stricted to narrow eligibility groups an individual tax credit for health insurance could be claimed through the normal taxfiling process taxpayers would include the credit when they file their tax returns normally by april 15 of the following year and then use it either to offset additional amounts they owe or to obtain larger refund it would also be possible for taxpayers to adjust their wit hholding in order to benefit from the credit earlier but experience with the earned income tax credit suggests few would do so most proposals would allow taxpayers to claim refundable health insurance tax credit in advance based on their prior years income in this case the insurer would be reimbursed for the credit directly from the us treasury partment advance payments now occur for some who receive

avoiding vertical equity problems associ ated with exclusions and deductions credit could also provide lowerincome taxpayers with sufficient resources to purchase insurance likely reducin g the number of the uninsured the effects of tax credits however can vary widely depending on the legislation one important question is wh ether credit would supplement or replace existing tax benefits particularly the exclus ion for employerpaid insurance if the credit replaced the exclusion it probably woul d have to be made available to people with high as well as low income gene rous individual credit may lead employers to drop coverage or to not start it in the first place possibly increasing the number of the uninsured credit that is not generous would not enable lowerincome families to purchase insurance advance payments would be essential for many families but might not work well on large scale the most difficult questions about tax cred its have to do with health policy if credit were generous enoug h to provide meaningful help to lower income people it is likely that the legislation would have to specify what is qualifying insurance otherwise there would be assurance th at public funds would be used efficiently and effectively defining qualifying insurance would involve decisions about minimum benefits deductible and copayment limits guaranteed issue and pre existing

who have obtained the social security retirement age employer tax credit under current law employers may deduct the expenses they incur for employees health insurance and health care and the contributions they make to their taxadvantaged health care savings accounts depending on the employers marginal tax rate tax credit might result in greater tax savings thereby providing an additional incentive to start and maintain health insurance plans tax credits could also be useful for governme nt and nonprofit employers that are not subject to income taxes the credits would offset some of the employment taxes they pay httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33505crs25 compared with the individual tax credits discussed above an employer credit could be targeted to industr ies or localities that have greater need they can be linked to employer contributions an em ployer credit might not require advance payments though if necessary these probably would be easier to provide than in the case of individual taxpayers on th other hand employer credits cannot be accurately varied by employee income b ecause employers know only what they pay workers not their total income and they would not be
