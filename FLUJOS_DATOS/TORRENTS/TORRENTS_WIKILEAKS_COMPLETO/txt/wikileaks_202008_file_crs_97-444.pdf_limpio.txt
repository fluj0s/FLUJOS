consider three draft treaties in the field of intellectual property delegates representing more than 125 countries participated in the confer ence which ultimately adopted two new intellectual property treaties and postponed consideration of third draft treaty one treaty the wipo copyright treat covers copyright protection for computer programs database s as intellectual works and digital

sound recordings under copyright law may continue to use c opyright law to satisfy the obligations of the performancesphonograms treaty consideration of the third draft treat the database treaty was postponed to another diplomatic conf erence both because of insuffi cient time at the december 1996 conference and because of objections from many countries that sufficient time had not been expended

this report highlights the key provisions of the wipo copyright treaty summarizes the proposed implementing gislation s 2037 and hr 2281 and discusses the main implementation issues that have arisen during congressional consideration of the implementing bills most recent developments the president of the united states in july 1997 submitted the wipo copyright treaty to the senate for its advice and cons ent to ratification of the treaty by the united states accompanied by recommendations for implementing legislation based on this request s 1121 and hr 2281 were introduced at the end of july 1997 to make the changes in united states copyright law which the clinton administration concluded were the minimal changes that must be made in us law to comply with the new obligations of the treaty s 1121 and hr 2281 as introduced were virtually identical bills that were based on the interpretative position that existing us copyright law is consistent with the obligations of the treaty except for two substantive matters and technical amendments concerning primarily the defi nition of foreignorigin works and their eligibility for us copyright protection the bills proposed new legal protection i against circumvention of anticopyin g technology and ii against knowing performance of prohibited acts relating to removal or alteration of copyright management information cmi on

recordings members can opt for copyright related rights unfair competition criminal law or sui generis form of protection 8phonograms is the international term commonly used to refer to protection of sound recordingsbackground the wipo copyright treaty originated in wipo work program to update the major international copyright treaty the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works berne conven tion this work program started in 1989 and included discussion of the releva nt copyright issues by seven committees of experts this process was known as the berne protocol since it was conceived as mechanism to modernize the berne convention last revised in 1971 without engaging in full revision of the c onvention the original purpose was to make explicit in the berne convention that com puter programs and da tabases are protected as copyright subject matter and generally to update th convention concerning use of copyrighted works in dig ital electronic environments initially the united states sought to have updated protection for sound recordings included in the berne protocol process the european union and many other countries strenuously resisted incl usion of sound recording protection since sound recordings are not copyright subject matter under their laws nor they insisted under the berne convention the majority of countries protect sound recordings under socalled neighboring or related rights the principal neighboring rights convention is the interna tional convention for the protection of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations7 known as the 1961 rome convention or the nei ghboring rights convention the european unions viewpoint preva iled the berne convention could not be the vehicle for improved internationa l protection for sound recordings since majority of berne states do not protect s ound recordings under copyright law these countries were unwilling to change thei r theoretical basis for protecting sound recordings or agree to an optional interp retation that sound recordings are copyright subject matter under the berne convention consequently in 1992 decision was take n to split the berne protocol process into two phases an update of copyright provisions and preparation of possible new instrument ie treaty on the prot ection of the rights of performers and producers of phonograms8 the issues relating to the new instrument were considered by six committees of experts this dual copyright and new instrument work program culminated in adoption of two new treaties at wi po diplomatic conference in geneva switzerland which met from december 220 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs5 9although the wipo copyright treaty was prepared as special agreement within the meaning of article 20 of the berne convention ra ther than complete revision of the treaty the ratification and implementation process in th united states is the same as for any other treaty that is this is not an executive agreement it is treaty which requires approval by twothirds vote of the senatethe wipo copyright treaty is special copyright agreement9 updating the berne convention the second treaty the wipo performances and phonograms treaty is new treaty dealing with th protection of performers and producers of phonograms ie sound recordings the latter treaty does not specify under which intellectual property law protec tion must be extended count ries are free to legislate protection under copyright neighboring rights or possibly misappropriation theories of law the major policy issues that arose at the 1996 diplomatic conference in the case of the copyright treaty were 1 the liability of online service providers and other communications entities that provide acce ss to the internet and 2 the scope of the reproduction right as applied to copying of data transmitted over the internet in the case of the performances and phonogra ms treaty the major policy issue was whether or not performances in audiovisu works eg motion pictures would be covered by the treaty the copyright treaty issues were resolved by two separate agreed statements of the participating states 1 that mere provision of co mmunicationsinternet physical facilities ie wire s telephone lines modems and other communications devices does not constitute infringement and 2 that existing article 9 of the berne convention the reproduction right applie s to the use of works in digital form and that storage of protected work in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes reproduction howe ver as part of compromise the actual article on the reproduction right was droppe d from the copyright treaty in the case of the performances and p honograms treaty the audiovisual issue was resolved by excluding audiovisual performances from the treaty the possibility of extending new rights to audiovisual performances will be pursued in future meetings within the wipo in the copyright field mu ltilateral treatie s or conventions ge nerally establish few basic principles concerning the scope of protection eligibility of foreigners to enjoy protection permissible range of limitations and exceptions to the rights granted and duration of protection copy right treaties like the berne convention and the new wipo copyright treaty do not govern protection for nationals of member country do not govern who is liable for any infringement of rights and do not regulate in any detail the enforcement of rights an international copyright treaty generally establishes its basic principles in language that is less explicit than statutory language this level of generality and flexibility of language is ordinarily essential in order to achieve an international consensus among so many countries with widely differing national legal systems the details of copyright policy ar left to national legislatureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs6 10suits alleging infringement of copyright treaty rights by individuals are not brought before any international forum such as wipo or the international court of justice under article 33 of the berne convention di sputes about treaty interpretation between two or more member countries not between private litigants may be brought before the international court of justice unless one of th countries in the dispute has declared itself not bound by article 331 11the wipo copyright treaty will not come into force for any country until 3 months after the 30th country to accede or ratify has deposited its instruments of accession or ratification with the director general of wipo each c ountry follows its own treaty approval process in accordance with national lawthere is usually some flexibility in carrying out even relatively explicit treaty obligations very commonly the treaty will specifically provide that certain issues are left entirely to national legislation if however imp lementing legislation is not adopted the treaty ob ligation may be interpreted by the courts of country depending upon its system of jurisprudence international copyright treaties establish general principles or framework within which national copyright laws are enacted and enforced the treaties operate primarily to harmonize national laws concerning minimum rights and duration of rights national copyright laws usually do not have extraterritorial effect suits for copyright violations are ordinarily brought in the place where the infringement occurs the court of the count ry where suit is file d applies its own law which includes both the national copyright law and any treaty to which the country adheres10 choiceoflaw issues ar resolved under the national law subject in the case of the berne and wipo copyright treaties to the principle of national treatment ie the foreigner enjoys the same rights as national of the country treaty ratification and implementation united states adherence to one or both of the new wipo tr eaties requires senate consent to ratification of the treaty by twothirds vote11 in general ratification of intellectual property treaties requires implementing legislation to conform united states domestic law to the treaty obligations for this reason the senates consent to treaty ratification usually occurs after or concurrently with enactment of any necessary implementing legislation unless the existing united states law is consistent with the obligations of an intellectual property treaty implementing legislation is necessary to avoid situation in which the united states would fail to meet its commitments to international law intellectual property ip law treaties have not been considered selfexecuting under us law even though the supremacy clause of the us constitution makes ratified treaty the law of the land if it is later in time than statute ip treaties have not been considered selfexecuting primarily because they represent private international law rather than public international law copyright treaty for example creates personal pr operty rights in authors and perhaps otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs7 12as noted earlier international copyright treatie s to date have not specified who is liable but they fix the major parameters for assessing liability by specifying rights and permissible limitations on rights 13in introducing s

the wipo copyright treaty is new treaty but it also effec tively updates the 1971 paris version of the berne convention by providing strong links to the berne convention and by incorporatin g berne articles by reference for countries already bound by the bern convention the new copyright treaty is in the nature of special agreement within the meaning of article 20 of berne under article 20 such special agreemen ts are permitted provided they improve protection for authors of copyrighted work s or contain provisions not inconsistent with berne obligations the wipo copy right treaty clearly improves protection for authors nonberne countries may adhere to the new treaty only by agreeing to comply with the substantive articles of the 1971 pari s version of berne ie articles 121 and the appendix for developing countries in effect the wipo copyright treaty legally binds nonberne adhering countries to apply the berne convention but such countries do not become duespaying voting members of the berne unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs9 17art 3 of the wipo copyright treaty berne article 2 specifies the subject matter protected literary and artistic works in general specific categories of works are listed berne article 2bis allows national legislation to exclude protection for political and legal speeches and to allow fair use of lectures addresses and similar works by the press and media subject to the right of the author to copyright collection of these works berne article 3 establishes the highly important rules concerning eligibility to claim protection under the convention usually based on nationality of the author or place of first publication socalled points of attachment berne artic 4 establishes special eligibility rules for cinematographic works usually the place where the authors pr oduction facilities are headquartered or the authors habitual residence in member country and works of architecture the berne country where the bu ilding is located berne article 5 prohibits formalities on the enjoyment or exercise of rights establishes that protection must be extended to eligible foreigners based on the principle of national treatment and establishes rules defining the country of origin and provid that protection in the country of origin is ordinarily governed by national law ie the rights granted authors by the berne convention do not have to be applied in the country of origin berne article 6 permits members to retaliate against ie deny prot ection for works of nationals of nonmembers who fail to provide adequate protection for wo rks of berne member nationals even though the work is first published in berne member country and would otherwise be eligible for protection under the convention 18art 13 of the wipo copyright treaty be rne article 18 essentially requires some form of retroactive protection perhaps pursuant to bilateral agreement for works that entered the public domain of new member before adherence to the berne convention but remain under copyright in the country of origin 19art 4 of the wipo copyright treaty the diplomatic conference also adopted an agreed statement concerning the relationship be tween the treaty article 2 of the berne convention and the provision on computer pr ogram protection in the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property sta ndards trips agreement of the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994 signed april 15 1994 the statement reads as follows the scope of protection for computer programs under article 4 of this treaty read with article 2 is consistent with article 2 of the berne convention and on par with the relevant provisions of the trips agreementin addition to requiring the adherents to comply with bernes substantive articles the new treaty explicitly incorporates berne articles 2617 and requires application of article 1818 subject matter provisions computer programs the treaty makes clear that computer programs are protected as literary works under article 2 of the berne convention whatever may be the mode or form of their expression19 databases the treaty makes clear that the parties must accord copyright protection to databases that constitute intellectual creations ie works in which the selection or arrangement of the content is the result of intellectual effort the compilation of the content or data is protected as copyright subject matter buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs10 20art 5 of the wipo copyright treaty the diplomatic conference adopted an agreed statement concerning the relationship be tween the treaty article 2 of the berne convention and the provision c oncerning protection of databa ses in the trips agreement the statement reads as follows the scope of protection for compilations of data databases under article 5 of this treaty read with article 2 is consistent with article 2 of the berne convention and on par with the relevant provisions of the trips agreement 21in the draft treaty article 7 scope of the right of reproduction read as follows 1 the exclusive right accorded to authors of literary and artistic works in article 91 of the berne convention of authorizing the reproduction of their works shall include direct and indirect reproduction of their works whether permanent or temporary in any manner or form 2 subject to the provisions of article 92 of the berne convention it shall be matter for legislation in contracting parties to limit the right of reproduction in cases where temporary reproduction has the sole purpose of making the work perceptible or where the reproduction is of transient or incidental nature provided that such reproduction takes place in the course of use of the work that is authorized by the author or permitted by lawprotection does not extend to the content its elf unless the content is independently work of the intellect in which case it enjoys separate copyright20 new or clarified exclusive rights reproduction right new treaty article the most contentious copyright issue at the wipo diplomatic conference re lated to draft article dealing with the reproduction right and its application to digital or electronic formats21 internet service providers telephone companies and other telecommunications entities generally objected to application of the re production right to indirect or temporary copying by computers transferring files on the internet and other computer networks in the end draft article 7 on the repr oduction right was dropped entirely from the text of the copyright treaty the di plomatic conference however adopted anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs11 22the agreed statement on the reproduction right is tied to article 14 of the copyright treaty which requires contracting parties to comply with articles 1 to 21 and the appendix of the berne convention the statement reads as follows the reproduction right as set out in ar ticle 9 of the berne convention and the exceptions permitted thereunder fully pply in the digital environment in particular to the use of works in digital form it is understood that the storage of protected work in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes reproduction within the meaning of article 9 of the berne convention this agreed statement interpretive device is highly unusual in international copyright treaties the weight as well as the meaning of the statement will be debated in legislative fora and argued in court cases its weight hinges upon the significance of the obligation in the wipo copyright treaty to comply with articles 121 of the berne convention given that these articles were originally adopted by preceding diplomatic conferences article 9 of berne was adopted by diplomatic conf erence at stockholm sweden in 1967 the stockholm substantive revision never came into force because developed countries rejected the version of the protocol for developing c ountries attached to it article 9 of berne therefore became effective only when the 1971 paris revision came into force in 1974 ordinarily an interpretation of an existing ar ticle by subsequent diplomatic conference would be analogous to comment in comm ittee report on statutory provision enacted by preceding congress the incorporation in the wipo copyright treaty of general obligation to comply with articles 121 of bern arguably authenticates the weight of the agreed statement but does not resolve the issue of the meaning of the statement 23art 61 of the wipo copyright treaty the diplomatic conference adopted an agreed statement concerning articles 6 right of distribution and 7 right of rental of the treaty to confirm that these rights appl to fixed copies embodied in tangible objects the statement reads as follows as used in these articles the expressions copies and original and copies being subject to the right of distribution and the right of rental under the said articles refer exclusively to fixed copi that can be put into circulation as tangible objects 24art 62 of the wipo copyright treaty th doctrines are applied usually to limit the public distribution right to the first sale au thorized by the copyright owner ie the purchaser of copy of book may resell or otherwise redist ribute the book without obtaining permission from the copyright owner see for example section 109 of the us copyright act title 17 usc in recent years commercial rental rights have been granted to copyright owners of computer programs and sound recordings by qualifying the application of the first sale doctrine to these wo rks at the international level major issue exists concerning national regional or inte rnational exhaustion of the public distribution right ie assuming the exhaustion doctrine is legislated does the first sale in given continuedagreed statement concerning the existing article 9 of berne22 the meaning of this agreed statement is now sharply contested among interests in the united states public distribution right authors enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the making available to the pub lic of copies of their works23 the treaty permits but does not obligate the parties to limit the public distribution right by the first sale or exhaustion of rights doctrines24httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs12 24continued country exhaust the distribution right only in the country of origin or does exhaustion also occur throughout given region of ffiliated states andor worldwide 25art 71 of the wipo copyright treaty the diplomatic conference adopted an agreed statement concerning rental of works in phonograms if the contracting party does not grant authors rights in phonograms then ther is obligation under the copyright treaty to grant authors rental right in phonograms this statement interprets the provision in article 71 allowing national law to dete rmine whether or not copyright protection is accorded to phonograms it reflects the fact th at most countries unlike the united states do not accord copyright protection to s ound recordings note that these noncopyright states would presumably extend rights to performers and producers of phonograms analogous to the rights conferred on authors of other works under the copyright law these related rights are covered by the separate performances and phonograms treaty the statement reads as follows it is understood that the obligation under article 71 does not require contracting party to provide an exclusive right of commercial rental to authors who under that contracting partys law are not granted rights in respect of phonograms it is understood that this obligation is consistent with article 144 of the trips agreement 26art 8 of the wipo copyright treaty th diplomatic conference adopted an agreed statement to the effect that mere provisi on of physical facilities to enable communications is not itself an act of communication ie does not infringe the public communication right the statement reads as follows it is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making communication does not in itsel f amount to communication within the meaning of this treaty of the berne convention it is further understood that nothing in article 8 precludes cont racting party from applying article continuedrental right authors of computer programs cinematographic works and works embodied in phonograms which works are determined by national law in the case of phonograms enjoy generally exclus ive right of authorizing the commercial rental of these works25 there are three exceptions to the exclusive right i in the case of computer programs the right does not apply where th program itself is not the essential object of the commercial rental ii in the case of cinematographic works the right does not apply unless commercial rental in given country has led to widespread unauthorized reproduction of copies wh ich materially impairs the right of reproduction iii as conce ssion to japan if countrys law in effect on april 15 1994 the date the gatt agreement was adopt ed provides only right of equitable remuneration for rental of works in phonograms that remuneration right satisfies the treaty obligation as long as there is material impairment of the exclusive right of reproduction public communication right authors enjoy the exclusive right generally of authorizing any communication to the public by wire or wireless means if the public can access the communication at different times and places26 in effect this amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs13 26continued 11bis2 article 11bis2 of the berne convention permits compulsory licensing of broadcasts and communications to the public at one stage of the berne protocol process the wipo staff had proposed elimination of this compulsory license option in updating the berne convention that proposal was abandoned earlie r and was not presented to the diplomatic conference 27for example article 7 applies the rental right only to specified categories of works computer programs cinematographic works and if specified in national law works in phonograms also the rental right for works in phonograms can be limited to right of remuneration 28this general limitation is drawn almost verbatim from article 92 of the berne convention which has been part of the berne convention only since 1974 to transmission right which extends to digital online and interactive communications as well as analog comm unications the reference to individual choice of reception is intended to exclude broadcasting right which remains governed by the existing berne conventi on also the public communication right of the new treaty explicitly cannot prejudice the existing public performance broadcasting and communication rights of authors as set out in berne articles 111ii 11 bis1i and ii 11 ter1ii 141ii and 14 bis1 limitations on rights in addition to the limitations to the exclusive rights expressed in the grant of the right27 the copyright treaty permits two general limitations on the rights article 2 provides that copyight prot ection extends to expressions and not to ideas procedures methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such this limitation on the scope of copyright reflect s the wellsettled principle known as the ideaexpression dichotomy copyrigh t protects against copying of original expressions but does not inhibit copying of the ideas concepts methods etc embodied in the expression of the idea concept or method article 10 allows each cont racting party to legislate limitations or exceptions to the treaty rights in certain special cases that do not conflict with normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author28 this general limitation would presumably justify the limitations and exceptions of existing united states law and would permit additional limitations or exceptions that do not conflict with th normal market for work and do not unreasonably harm the in terests of the author the diplomatic conference also adopted an agreed statement concerning article 10 that has three main points cont racting parties may extend into the digital environment any existing limitations and exceptions that have been considered acceptable under the berne convention they may also devise new exceptions and limitations that are appropriate in the dig ital network environment finally the conference expressed an understanding that article 102 of the copyright treatyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs14 29the term of copyright for works other than photographs would remain controlled by article 7 of the berne convention the standard term is life of the author plus 50 years after his or her death 30article 36 of the berne convention obligates its adherents to undertake to adoptthe measures necessary to ensure the application of the convention and also requires that at the time of joining the convention country should have domestic law in place to give effect to the provisions of the convention berne article 15 establishes legal presumption that an author is entitled to br ing an infringement action if his or her name appears on the work berne article 16 provides that infringing copies shall be subject to seizure in any member country except for these articles the berne convention does not deal with enforcement of rights traditionally the convention has been concerned with the grant of rights to authors outside the country in which the work originated until the recent diplomatic conference there had been rious attempt to include detailed enforcement provisions in the berne convention 31articles 41 to 61 of the trips agreementneither reduces nor extends the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the berne convention term of protection for photographs only one article of the copyright tr eaty deals with duration of protection article 9 obligates contracting party generally to apply the standard term of life of the author plus 50 years to protection for photographic works29 this provision improves the protection accorded photogra phs under the berne convention which permits term as short as 25 years enforcement of rights the berne copyright convention trad itionally has not included detailed provisions regarding enforcement of rights30 the 1996 diplomatic conference considered proposals to incl ude detailed enforcement provisions in the copyright treaty either as an annex to the treaty or by reference to the enforcement articles of the trips agreement31 in the end the diplomatic conference rejected both proposals in favor of brief enforcement article that makes reference to the provisions of the trips agreement article 14 requires treaty adhe rents to ensure that enforcement procedures exist under domestic law to permit effective action against an act of infringement of rights covered by this treaty including expeditious remedies to deter future infringements paragraph 1 of artic 14 expresses the general obligation of contracting parties to undertake to adopt the measures necessary to ensure the application of this

anticopying systems protection against removal or alterati on of copyright management information and technical amendments concerning the eligibility for works of foreignorigin to claim copyright in the united states those who held this viewpoint argued that the wipo copyright treaty mainly clarifies certain rights and subject matter issues and that to the extent the treaty grants new rights it tracks changes that have already been legislated in the united states copyright law also some have ar gued that the courts could deal with the few if any remaining issues concerning the consistency of us law with the treaty which were not covered by the original implementation bills the opposing viewpoint is that united stat law relating to use of copyrighted works on the internet and other electronic or computer networks is not settled some argued that existing us law is inconsistent with certain treaty obligations others argued that at minimum legislation would be needed to achieve higher degree of certainty on number of c ontroversial legal issues judicial resolution of these issues they argued takes too long is too fraught with uncertainty for conducting internet business and

copyright liability in digital electronic environments finally it was argued if the treaty were ratified without amending united states law on issues such as the scope of rights and limitations on the rights the treaty language might be cited in court to determine the outcome of cases and in future legislative fora as barrier to enac tment of certain legisl ation the treaty will shape the interpretation of us law and future legislative debate certain positions and interpretations will arguably be foreclosed by the treaty unless the treaty content is shaped by us implementing

by the clinton administration and suppor ted by most copyrightcontent owners assumed that existing united states law is already in compliance with the minimum obligations of the wipo copyright treaty except for two articles which require i legal protection against circumvention of anticopying technology article 11 and ii legal remedies against knowing performance of prohibited acts relating to removal or alteration of electronic rights management information article 1242 the only other amendments proposed in th original implementation bills were technical in nature and related primarily to consequential adjustments to those definitions of the copyright act that affect treaty relationships and the eligibility of foreigners to claim copyright in the united states technical amendments are proposed for the same reasons in three s ubstantive sections of the copyright act section 104 which governs ligibility of foreign author s to claim copyright under united states law section 104a which c oncerns restoration of copyright in certain foreignorigin works and section 411 which makes copyright registration in the united states copyright office jurisdicti onal prerequisite to suit for

devicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97444crs19 43since the bills do not contain any defin ition of commercial advantage or private financial gain it seems likely that the mens rea standard of existing copyright law as developed by court d ecisions would apply component or part thereof that is primarily designed or produced to circumvent an anticopying system proposed civil penalties include injunctions impoundment of infringing material or equipment act ual damages and any additional profits of the violator or statutory damages ranging from 2002500 per act of circumvention product or performance of service or at the plain tiffs option total award bertween 2500 25000 for repeated violations within th ree years the court may triple the damages the court also has the discretion to

databases that constitute intellectual creations are literary works the diplomatic conference adopted an agreed statement confirming th at these categories of works are eligible for copyright
