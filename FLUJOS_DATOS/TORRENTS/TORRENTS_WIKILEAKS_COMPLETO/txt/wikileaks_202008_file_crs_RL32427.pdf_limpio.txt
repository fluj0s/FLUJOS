delivers economic assistance the mca is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principles and policies and where governments are committed to implementing reform measures in order to achieve such goals the mca concept differs in several fundamental respects from past and current us aid practices the competitive process that rewards countries for past actions measured by 17 objective performance indicators the pledge to segregate the funds from us strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influence where us aid is spent and the requirement to solicit program proposals developed solely by qualifying countries with broadbased civil society involvement the proposal also differed in the size of the original 5 billion commitment an aim never even approximately met congress authorized the new initiative in january 2004 division d of pl 108199 and has closely followed its implementation as the program evolves the 111 th congress like its predecessor will continue to debate mca funding issues and conduct oversight hearings on operations of the corporation

millennium challenge account mca managed by new millennium challenge corporation mcc provides assistance through competitive selection process to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas ruling justlypromoting good governance fighting corruption respecting human rights and adhering to the rule of law investing in peopleproviding adequate health care education and other opportunities promoting an educated and healthy population economic freedomfostering enterprise and entrepreneurship and promoting open markets and sustainable budgets country selection is based largely but not exclusively on nations record measured by 17 performance indicators related to the three categories or baskets countries that score above the median on half of the indicators in each of the three areas qualify emphasizing the importance of fighting corruption the indicator for corruption is passfail test should country fall below the median on the corruption indicator it will be disqualified from consideration unless other more recent trends suggest otherwise see table 6 below for complete list of the 17 performance indicators administration officials since announcing the mca initiative in 2002 have said that the selection process would be guided by but not necessarily bound to the outcomes of the performance indicators missing or old data general trends and recent steps taken by governments might also be taken into account when annual decisions are made eligibility to receive mca assistance however does not necessarily result in an aid grant once selected countries are required to submit program proposalsreferred to as mca compacts that have been developed through broadbased national discussion that includes input from civil society the focus of program submissions may vary among countries in size purpose and degree of specificity and are evaluated by the corporation for among other things how well the compact supports nations economic growth and poverty reduction goals only those compacts that meet the mca criteria will be funded it is expected that successful compacts will support programs lasting three to five years providing level of resources roughly equivalent to the largest providers of assistance in the country in most cases this will likely result in significant increase of us economic assistance to mca participant countries to manage the new initiative the administration proposed and congress authorized the creation of millennium challenge corporation mcc an independent government entity separate from the departments of state and the treasury and from the us agency for international development usaid the mcc plans for an eventual staff of about 300 it is led by ceo confirmed by the senate the

private sector drawn from lists of proposed nominees submitted by congressional leaders3 the decision to house the mca in new organization was one of the most debated issues during early congressional deliberations of the presidents foreign aid initiative the administration argued that because the mca represents new concept in aid delivery it should have fresh organizational structure unencumbered by bureaucratic authorities and regulations that would interfere in effective management critics however contended that if the mca was placed outside the formal us government foreign aid structure it would lead to further fragmentation of policy development and consistency some believed that usaid the principal us aid agency should manage the mca while others sa id that the mca should reside in the state department where more us foreign policy entities have been integrated in recent years at least some argued the usaid administrator should be member of the mcc board which had not been proposed in the initial administration request it appears that the mccs status will remain unchanged under secretary rices realignment of foreign aid authorities announced on january 19 2006 henrietta holsman fore the usaid administrator also serves concurrently in the newly created state department position of director of foreign assistance while gaining policy and budget authority over nearly all usaid and state department foreign aid programs the director plays more limited role in other agency activities by developing an overall us government development strategy and providing guidance to foreign aid programs delivered through other agencies like the mcc g15g5g5g561g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 from the time the mcc board of directors held its initial

mca assistance in any year in addition to the income ceiling countries may be candidates only if they are not statutorily prohibited from receiving us economic assistance in fy2009 11 countries were

to base the eligibility of countries for threshold and compact programs is one of the most important elements in mcc operations see table 6 for performance indicators they are key statement of mcc development priorities and ultimately determine which countries will receive us assistance perhaps of equal significance the current indicators themselves have become prominent objectives of some developing countries in what board ceo danilovich has called the mcc effect 5 countries seeking eligibility are moving on their own to enact reforms and take measures that would enable them to meet mcc criteria the criteria and the methodology for applying them have evolved over time pursuant to reporting requirements set in the mcc legislation each year the corporation sends to congress an overview of the criteria and met hodology that would be used to determine the eligibility of the candidate countries in that fiscal year the criteria have been altered and refined sometimes dramatically over time while the mcc legislative authorities broadly match criteria proposed by the administration lawmakers included four additional matters on which to evaluate countrys performance these relate to the degree to which country recognizes the rights of people with disabilities respects worker rights 4 various types of aid restrictions applied to these countries for

investments especially in women and girls for each of these the mcc has sought to use s upplemental data and qualitative information to inform its decisions on compact eligibility the latter two factors have led to the development of new indicators with regard to the requirement added by congress regarding social investments in women and girls at first the mcc reported it would draw on girls primary enrollment rates to supplement the four social investment performance indicators but in fy2005 an indicator measuring girls primary education completion rates replaced broader measure used in fy2004 that did not disaggregate primary education graduation by gender beginning with the fy2005 selection process the mcc lowered the inflation rate threshold from 20 to 15 making it somewhat more difficult to pass this test only 6 of the 63 candidate countries failed this test for fy2004 for fy2006 the corporation added new indicatorthe cost of starting businessthat replaced the country credit rating measure that was used in the fy2004 and fy2005 evaluation process the corporation believed that not only did the new indicator have strong correlation with economic growth but that it was measurement that might encourage governments to take action in order to improve their scores since the initial use of the indicator days to start business mca candidate countries had introduced many business startup reforms the results of which were reflected in lowered median for this category mcc officials hoped that adding an indicator for the cost of starting business would stimulate additional policy improvements they believed that the country credit rating indicator was not as well linked to policy reforms and that it had greater income bias than other mcc indicators efforts to develop measurement to assess countrys commitment to policies that promote sustainable management of natural resources as required by congress led to the adoption of two new indicators first used as supplemental in formation in determining fy2007 mca eligibility and then integrated with all the other indicator s beginning with the fy2008 eligibility process the natural resources management index is composite of indicators whether the country is protecting at least 10 of its biomes the percen tage of population with access to sanitation and clean water and child mortality levels it has been placed in the investing in people basket raising the number of those indicators to five the land rights and access index looks at whether land tenure is secure and access to land is equitable and the number of days and cost of registering property it has been placed in the economic freedom basket that basket remains at six indicators because beginning in fy2008 the mcc collapsed the days to start business and cost of starting business indicators into one business startup indicator in addition to adding or refining indicators the co rporation has also modified its principal that in selected cases countries must score above the median in order to pass hurdle with rule that scores at the median will represent passing grade this comes into play especially for those indicators civil liberties political rights and trade policy where performance is measured on relatively narrow scale of 15 or 17 number of countries fall exactly on the median of these indicators and the methodology change allowed the mcc to make more refined determination of whether country passes or fails these hurdles in december 2006 ambassador danilovich announced that the mcc would apply gender analysis to all aspects of the mcc program including country selection and compact development and implementation

showing where each candidate countrys performance falls in relation to the other candidate countries in its peer group ie lower income countries compete with other lower income countries and lower middle income countries with other lowermiddle income countries some time later the mcc board meets to select its list of countries eligible to apply for compact assistance review of the history of mcc selections suggests that the board is guided by but not entirely bound to the outcome of the performance indicator review process board members can apply discretion in their selection performance trends missing or old data and recent policy actions might come into play during selection deliberations for example in its first year fy2004 the mcc selected 16 countries the selection reflected decisions that both strictly followed the performance indicator outcomes and applied board discretion to take into account other factors ten of the countries complied with the stated criteria performing above the median in relation to their peers on at least half of the indicators in each of the three policy baskets and performing above the median on corruption the board also examined whether country performed substantially below average on any single indicator and whether their selection was supported by supplemental information each of the 10 countries also passed these additional tests for 10 other countries however some discretion was applied by the board in three cases countries which met the criteria but fell significantly below average on one indicator were still selected by the board due to recent policy changes or positive trend lines cape verde for example scored poorly on the trade policy indicator but the board took into account the countrys progress towards joining the world trade organization and implementing value added tax that will reduce reliance on import tariffs lesotho did not score well on the measurement for days to start business the mcc board however took note of lesothos creation of central office to facilitate new business formation and saw positive performance on other factors related to business startups sri lanka scored far below the median on fiscal policy but the most recent trends suggested that the government was making progress in reducing its budget deficit for three other countriesbolivia georgia

median as opposed to above the median on the corruption indicator something that would eliminate it from consideration the board however noted that president mesa who took office in october 2003 had created cabinet position to coordinate anticorruption activities and an office to investigate police corruption georgia with newly elected governme nt that had created an anticorruption bureau and taken other steps to fight corruption was also selected despite scoring below the median on corruption and three other ruling justly indicators mozambique which failed on corruption and each of the four investing in people indicators was chosen based on supplemental data that was more current than information available from the primary data sources this evidence the board felt demonstrated mozambiques commitment to fighting corruption and improving its performance on health and education on the other hand the mcc board chose not to select four countries that technically met the

corruption hurdle and half of the ruling justly indicators they scored very low on the measurements for political rights and civil liberties and in vietnams case on the v oice and accountability indicator fourth countryguyanawas also not selected despite passing the necessary hurdles it scored particularly low on the fiscal policy measurement6 as the candidate pool has expanded in succeeding years while funding levels failed to meet expectations the board has become increasingly more selective many outside the mcc support the approach of keeping the number of new participants to few so that future compacts can be larger and emphasize transformational development opportunities as the mca program originally envisioned for fy2005 the board did not select 10 countries that met the criteria including bhutan vietnam guyana burkina faso china djibouti egypt nepal the philippines and swaziland the corporation offered little explanation as to why these countries were not chosen7 it appeared however that scoring substantially belowperhaps in the lowest 25th percentileon an indicator had become defacto criteria for exclusion for example the corporations ceo paul applegarth commented that the philippines country that passed 13 of the 16 indicators did not qualify because manilla scored substantially below the median on tests for health expenditures and fiscal policy and that more recent trends indicated the fiscal policy situation was deteriorating further 8 each of the other nine nations that met the minimum qualifications but were not selected also had one score in the 25th percentile although the corporation has not commented on whether this was the reason for not choosing them another board departure in the fy2005 selection process was to avoid using its discretionary authority to qualify countries that did not meet the minimum performance indicators for fy2004 the board chose three nationsbolivia georgia and mozambiquethat did not pass the socalled hardhurdle of corruption the latter two again qualified despite falling below the median on corruption while bolivia did not require an exemption after the median dropped below its score with the addition of new countries for fy2005 five nationsmalawi moldova paraguay tanzania and ukrainepassed the required number of performance indicators except corruption although malawi paraguay and tanzania are threshold countries none of the five were chosen for full mca status in fy2006 the board did not choose eight countries in the lowincome group that qualified and did not use its discretionary powers to select any new nations that failed to meet the minimum requirements 9 bhutan china and vietnam passed enough hurdles but did not qualify as was the case the previous two years based on very low scores on political rights and civil liberties kiribati the philippines and india were not selected most likely because some of their scores were substantially below the median india also presents challenging case for the board in that 6 for complete statement regarding the boards rationale see report on the selection of mca eligible countries for fy2004 found at httpwwwmccgov congressional reports 7 the mccs authorizing legislation section 608d requires the corporations ceo to provide justification to congress regarding only those countries declared as eligible for mca assistance and for those selected for compact negotiation otherwise there is statutory requirement for the mcc to comment on its decisionmaking process including the rationale for not selecting specific countries 8 comments by paul applegarth at state department foreign press center briefing november 9 2004 9 georgia and senegal were selected despite not passing the necessary hurdles but

population which would require sizable mca compact in order to produce reasonable degree of impact on poverty reduction it is also nation with the means to attract capital and investment from other sources egypt also not selected falls into somewhat different category as the second largest recipient of annual us assistance based on strategic rationale the reason for not selecting uganda despite having passed 12 of the 16 indicators and not falling significantly below the median on the other 4 is less obvious in its first year of choosing among lowermiddleincome countries the boards approach was less clear number of analysts had argued that especially given the lessthananticipated budget available to the mcc the board should refrain from selecting any lowermiddleincome countries lmics at least in the fy2006 round 10 of the eight lmics out of 32 total that passed sufficient performance hurdles the board chose two to participate in fy2006 in addition the board also selected cape verde country that passed only two of the six economic performance indicators and therefore did not technically qualify11 it appears however that the board could have decided to select none of the lowermiddleincome nations by using criteria it had applied consistently in the two previous rounds moreover it was not clear why the board chose the two that did qualify and excluded others all eight lmics that passed the performance indicator test fell significantly below the median on at least one of the indicators salvador and namibia the two that were selected both had low scores on fiscal policy salvador also scored well below the median on the costs of starting business while namibia also did poorly on days to start business and immunization rates the other six that were not chosenbrazil bulgaria jordan samoa thailand and tunisiaalso performed substantially below the median in at least one area although jordan was selected to participate in the threshold program what separated these latter six from salvador and namibia however was not explained by the board although the gambia was selected in fy2006 its eligibility for mca assistance was suspended by the mcc board on june 16 2006 because of disturbing pattern of deteriorating conditions in half of the 16 conditions that are used to determine candidate countries among the problems cited in this case were human rights abuses restrictions on civil liberties and press freedom and worsened anticorruption efforts on november 8 2006 the mcc board added three new countries to the list of those eligible for fy2007 mca grantsmoldova jordan and ukraine even prior to the selection the possible choice of jordan had come in for severe criticism freedom house the organization whose annual index of freedom is drawn upon for two of the ruling justly indicators had urged the mcc board to bypass countries that had low scores on political rights and civil liberties it argued that countries like jordan that fall below 4 out of possible 7 on its index should be automatically disqualified jordan however did well on three of the other indicators in this category several development analysts further argued that jordan should not be selected because the mca is not an appropriate funding source they assert that jordan already is one of the largest recipients of 10 see for example steve radelet kaysie brown and bilal siddiqi round three of the mca which countries are most likely to qualify in fy 2006 center for global development october 27 2005 11 cape verde had been classified as an eligible lowincome country in fy2004 and signed compact in july 2005 the cape verde case however also points out limitation in using the system of 16 performance indicators for two of the economic categories data are available for cape verde resulting in failing score on those hurdles

selecting jordan the mcc board appears not to have been swayed by these arguments another concern expressed by observers regarding the fy2007 selection process was that four of eleven current compact

compact it joins 24 countries previously selected on december 12 2007 of these malawi is the only other new entry two countries that had appeared in the past were absent in the 2008 list sri lanka is left out because of the resurgent civil strife that would make compact problematic and cape verde for more complicated reasons under the recent changes in the qualifying indicators cape verde would not have been eligible for the third year in row and as lowermiddle income country is more strictly judged nonetheless according to the mcc 12 of the 24 countries that made the cut did not meet the fy2008 criteria five of them failing the control of corruption indicator one reason that the mcc has reselected these countries is that they are viewed as maintaining or improving their performance rather than adopting policies contrary to the criteria this approach is taken because countries following reasonable policies may fall behind the performance criteria when other countries are improving fasterthereby raising the bar they may also fail when new criteria are introduced which countries have not had 12 freedom house millennium challenge corporation should hold countries to

the mcc provided burkina faso with precompact development grant of 94 million not counted as part of the final compact once proposal is submitted the mcc conducts an initial assessment then on the basis of that assessment launches due diligence review that closely examines all aspects of the proposal including costs and impacts at the same time mcc staff work with the country to refine program

corporations ceo to coordinate and consult with usaid and directs the agency to ensure that its programs play primary role in helping candidate countries pr epare for mca consideration usaid maintains missions in most of the eligible countries and might be expected to support mcc programs through contracting procurement and monitoring tasks although usaid is the chief implementor on behalf of the mcc of threshold programs its role in other aspects of mcc activities is not clear another question is how usaid will adjust its own programs in mca countries thenusaid administrator natsios told the house appropriations committee on may 13 2004 that the agency would not withdraw from or cut programs in mca countries but would not increase spending either he said however that usaid would work to

focusing on agriculture and transportation infrastructure projects while these activities are well justified the similarity across compacts surprised some observers given the wide diversity of conditions in each of the countries plus the corporations willingness to support all types of programs many had expected to see greater degree of variation among the compacts some believe that social sectors including those in health and education should be receiving greater attention in compact design others had expected greater variety in aid delivery mechanisms and are concerned that the mcc is reluctant to approve sector grants and other types of budget support assistance while there can be greater accountability risks associated with this kind of aid countries that qualify for mca support are selected because they have already demonstrated stronger performance in managing resources and fighting corruption 17 as more compacts are signed some diversity in programs is creeping inthree of the more recent ones in lesotho mozambique and tanzan ia feature water and sanitation component the morocco compact includes microcredit and artisan crafts support among its projects burkina faso and namibia have education components g5g152g150g153g138g140g157g561g21g146g163g142g561 second closely examined characteristic of the early compacts was the dollar size of the grants or more specifically the lowerthananticipated funding level for the first several compacts while administration officials said repeatedly that compacts would be funded at various levels depending on the nature and potential impact of the proposal the presumption was that the mca grant would represent sizable increase in us assistance to the eligible country in order to realize its potential as transformational aid program and to provide sufficient incentives to countries requesting breakthrough projects the mcc said that the size of its grants must place mca assistance among the top aid donors in country 18 some had estimated that once the corporations budget reached 5 billion each compact would be supported with annual resources in the 150200 million range19 these levels could vary up or down depending

economy and the scope of the proposed projects most of the first several compacts however did not meet the anticipated financial allocation thresholds madagascars fouryear 110 million compact roughly doubled us assistance to the country but did not place mca assistance among the top donors france was the largest bilateral donor disbursing on average 189 million per year 20012004 the european commissions aid program 20012004 averaged 82 million per year while the world banks international development association was madagascars largest source of concessional assistance of about 209 million lent in each of 2001 through 2004 20 the 110 million compact for madagascar is also not very large relative to the countrys population of the 16 qualified countries for fy2004 madagascar had the fourth largest population 164 million and might have been expected to receive one of the larger mca grants given its population size and its per capita income 230 second lowest among the 16 mca countries for honduras 215 million mca program over five years georgia 295 million over five years and armenia 236 million over five years the united states was the top bilateral donor without the mca program and will likely remain in that position as mca are disbursed but the mca compact for honduras called for only slightly higher annual amount 43 million than us economic assistance provided 34 million at the time while georgias compact will average only about threefourths and the armenia compact only about twothirds of the annual level of recent american aid while these are not insignificant amounts of new resources they are far less than administration officials had suggested previously 21 in contrast the early fiveyear compacts with cape verde 110 million benin 307 million and vanuatu 66 million represented substantial investment by the united states relative to the size of recent american aid and the size of their economies usaid which last provided direct bilateral assistance to cape verde in the mid1990s does not maintain mission presence allocating small amounts of aid through regional programs the compacts 22 million annual average places the united states second to portugal cape verdes former colonial power as the leading donor and represents more than quarter of total bilateral development aid grants from all sources compared with figures for 2003 and 2004 likewise the united states does not maintain bilateral program with vanuatu limiting direct aid through the peace corps the 13 million annual average of the vanuatu program places the united states as the countrys top aid donor along with australia in benin usaid manages an annual bilateral economic aid program of about 15 million compared with the 61 million annual size of the mcc compact the compact likely places the mcc as the top aid donor together with france for benin 22 this issue has been priority of ambassador danilovich since his september 27 2005 confirmation hearing

largely by the limited amount of disbursements made to date as perhaps the leading cause of cuts in mcc funding from the administration request and of threatened rescissions from amounts already appropriated this view has had severe consequences for the mcc see below as of the end of june 2008 of the 75 billion appropriated for the mcc only 727 million or 10 has been disbursed more than 65 billion however had been obligated by midseptember 2008 there are some good reasons for this spending rate the mcc is new experiment and it has taken considerable time to develop methods of operation including settling on the rules of eligibility and the requirements of compact proposals further the countries themselves are responsible for developing proposals and they have problems common to most developing countries in managing complex programs to meet donor requirements of accountability the gao found that for five signed compacts in africawith madagascar cape verde benin ghana and malithe process of going from eligibility to compact signature took between 12 and 31 months four of these compacts entered into force about five months after compact signature 24 once launched compacts may be slow to get underway for two in their third yearmadagascar and cape verdedisbursements have been slow only 27 and 16 respectively of planned disbursements had been made by end of march 2008 among the causes are delays by these compact countries in filling managerial positions the nature of many of the compacts is also responsible for the delays typically infrastructure projects are slow to disburse funds the majority of activity in the first few years being the design and planning of projects rather than actual construction whatever the causes the mcc has responded to the criticisms by arguing that projected annual compact disbursements by 2009 will top 1 billion the mcc is also attempting to shift its organizational focus from the early emphasis on compact development to compact implementation in october 2007 it announced reorganization aimed at facilitating implementation g5g152g150g153g138g140g157g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561 the purpose of the mca is to reduce poverty by supporting economic growth but some observers have complained about the lack of measurable results to date there are some possible reasons for this most prominently the slow speed of compact implementation noted above as result it will likely be some time before serious analysis of actual impacts can be undertaken 23 prepared statement of john j danilovich before the senate committee on

vanuatu projected impacts have been overstated the gao noted that the mcc estimated rise from 2005 per capita income in vanuatu of about 15 200 by 2015 when in fact the data suggest it would rise by 46 although the mcc states that the compact would benefit 65000 poor rural inhabitants the data according to the gao do not establish the extent of benefit to the rural poor further the mcc projections assume continued maintenance of projects following completion whereas the experience of previous donors is that such maintenance has been poor 25 the mcc response is that although there may be varying views on the degree of benefit both agencies agree that the underlying data show that the compact will help vanuatu address poverty reduction26 in lieu of results from the compacts mcc officials have pointed to the impact made by the mcc process itself under the socalled mcc effect many countries are said to be establishing reforms in an effort to qualify under the 17 indicators yemen has been cited in this regard because following its suspension from the threshold program in 2005 it approved number of reforms to address indicators where its performance had lapsed and subsequently was reinstated both the house and senate approved resolutions in 2007 hres 294 and sres 103 noting the role the mcc played in encouraging lesotho to adopt legislation improving the rights of married women g20g146g156g146g151g144g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 the majority of compact projects support construction of economic infrastructure primarily roads and water and sanitation systems in the past year costs for the machines and material necessary for these activities have been rising worldwide at the same time the us dollar has depreciated significantly as result mcc projects are faced with having less funding than envisioned to meet the agreedon objectives the mcc reports that at least six projects are expected to be scaledback from the original plans or may be supplemented by financing from other sources g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 in each year since the mca was established the mcc proposal was by far the largest increase sought by the administration in the foreign operations appropriations bill and viewed by many observers as one of the most vulnerable items in an increasingly difficult budget environment in each year as well its enacted appropriation has been well below the presidents request supporters of the mcc are disturbed by this trend reflected again in the congressional funding level for fy2008 well below the administration request they argue that countries that have gone through the whole process of seeking eligibility and designing and refining proposal are likely to seek funding elsewhere if they have to wait long for mcc funding to become available further the socalled mcc effect which encourages countries to reform on their own in order to meet eligibility requirements is likely to be lost if fewer compacts are offered annually 25 government accountability office millennium challenge corporation va nuatu compact ove rstates projected program impact july 2007 gao07909 26 testimony of rodney
