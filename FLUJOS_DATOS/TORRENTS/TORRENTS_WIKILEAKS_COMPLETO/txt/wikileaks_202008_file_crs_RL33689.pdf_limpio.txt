insurance reform analysis and comparison of 109th congress bills hr 4973 and s 3589 summary in 1968 congress established the nationa l flood insurance program nfip as response to mounting flood losses escalating costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers and as an alternative to ad hoc federal disaster assistance in the wake of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in 2005 the nfip faces unprecedented financial and regulatory strains the nations ttention has now focused on disaster impacts and costs as well as both the strengths nd weaknesses of the nfip in managing and financing the nations flood risk those concerned about prog ram weaknesses cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury substantial premium cross subsidies among classes of policyholde rs outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with ma ndatory purchase requirements questions as to the performance and efficiency of the write your own program and need to put the nfip on sounder financial footing at the behest of the congress fema has from time to time examined the programs contingent liabilities and recommended ways to provide financial stability to the flood insurance program for example the nfips borrowing authority is currently the exclusive financing arrang ement for potential catastrophic losses in recent years fema has identified alterna tive financing arrangements but congress has yet to act on any proposal members of the 109th congress are considering hr 4973 and s 3589 the flood insurance reform and modernizati on act of 2006 which seek to enhance the nfips effectiveness and limit taxpayer liability for claims the main thrust of the reform effort is to have the prog ram satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by eliminating some or all of the premium subsidy provided to certain properties insured under the nfip th congressional budget office cbo estimates the nfip provides 13 billion nnual premium subsidy cbo suggests that eliminating the subsidies on all pr operties including nonresidential and non primary ie vacation or second home would result in generating sufficient premiums to cover the longterm future ob ligations of the nfip but not necessarily enough to cover past losses or future catastrophic loss years some stakeholder groups have expressed concer ns about making abrupt changes to the nfip without full knowledge of potential unint ended adverse effects others argue however that the nfip must be reauthorized by cong ress in 2008 so any reforms to the program approved now could be revisited during the 110th congress this report provides an ove rview of the nfip focusing on factors that may affect the nfips actuarial soundness or th at may inhibit its ability to provide flood

is the result of climate change while othe rs say population growth nd development and federal policy are to blame organization and structure the nfip consists of threepronged strategy flood risk assessment and mapping financing flood risk through insurance and land use and building construction measures that constrict th development of land exposed to flood hazard taken together this strategy allows for resi dential construction in known floodplains but with the proviso that the property must be cons tructed according to building code regulation that incorporat floodproofing requirements the nfip was broadened and modified with the passage of the fl ood disaster protection act of 197316 and other major refo rm legislation in 197717 199418 and 200419 today federal flood insurance is cu rrently available in 20118 participating communities to help individuals and sm all businesses recover following flood fema officials point out that the nfip has realized significant savings both to itself and property owners by reducing the cost of disaster relief the basic requirement of the flood management pr ogram and access to federal flood insurance is that communities adopt and enforce minimum nd use and building code regulation to prevent new development from increasing the flood threat and to protect new and existing buildings from anticipated flood events in practical terms new residential construction in special flood hazard areas s fha must be elevated to or above the level water would reach in flood that occu rs with 1 annual chance this water level is called the base flood elevation bfe the nfip also requires that existing residential structures that are below bfe be raised to that level if they are substantially damaged or imp roved ie cost of the imp rovement or damage equals or exceeds 50 of the market value of the building before construction starts on the improvement the nfips standard flood insurance policy sfip which includes the general property and dwelling forms covers 1 di rect physical losses caused by flood 2 losses resulting from floodrelated erosion caused by waves or currents of water activity exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or 3

under section 13071127 about 12 million of the 49 million policy holders 244 pay premiums that do not cover the full risk of insuring th eir properties the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the policy of subsidizing prefirm properties produces revenue shortfall of about 13 billion each year28 fema would have to raise annual average premiums from about 710 to 1800 to cover the revenue shortfall29 even with this higher pricing the nfip would still not generate premium income sufficient to build reserves for potential catastrophic losses actuarial soundness by design the nfip doe s not conform to traditional insurance industry criteria fo r actuarial soundness in that the program does not collect sufficient premium income to build reserves fully to meet longterm future expected losses femas flood insurance pricing strategy and financial goal are instead designed to generate premiums sufficient at least to cover expected losses and expenses relative to what is called the historical average loss year which approximates the average annua l losses experienced since 197830 the nfip typically generates premium surpluses in lessthanaverage loss years and uses this surplus to pay claims in higher loss years according to fema between 1978 and july 2006 the nfip experienced many heavyloss years but catastrophic flood event until hurrican katrina rita and wilma31

1000 over rolling 10year period although rlps comprise only about 1 of ll insured properties they account for 25 of all claims paid32 fema reports that properties that have received multiple insurance claim payments account for an average of 200 milli on in claims each year additionally some 25 of all current nfip policies do not pay actuarial rates for their coverage and thus are subsidized by th 75 of other policyholders33 most insurance market experts agree that repetitive flood claims nd very large claims payouts will likely result in increased cost of flood insurance for everyone and accounts for significant factor affecting the stability of the nfip the 2004 fl ood reform act tablished pilot program requiring owners of rlps to elevate relocate or demolish houses34 the repetitive

hydrologic and hydraulic analyses purchase and voluntary purchase36 currently property owners who obtain loans from federally regulated nding institutions or who receive federal financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes in special flood hazard areas sfhas in communities that participate in the nfip are required to purchase flood insurance for their outstanding mortgage balance up to maximum of 250000 in coverage for single family homes37 in order to increase the policyholder base some observers have gone as far as to suggest that all homes and businesses in designated flood pl ains purchase federal flood insurance and not just homes with mo rtgages owned or serviced by federally regulated institutions fema estimates that such an effort could add an estimated 4 to 6 million properties located in areas of lower risk of flooding ie 250year or 500year floodplain including properties protected by stru ctural flood controls like dams and levees curren tly the

engineers and disaster and emergency response officials to determin the flood risk of individual properties or to make local land use decisions in th wake of the 2005 hurricanes some disaster experts and policymakers have expressed concerns about the accuracy of flood maps that might not incorporate the latest engineering analyses or reflect changes caused by development and natural fact ors that

nfip for prefirm structures to the full actuarial risk based premium39 this study of the impact of imposing actua rial rate for prefi rm structures was performed by pri cewaterhouse coopers40 there were three major findings first flood insurance premiums would rise substa ntially for prefirm structures exposed to considerable fl ood risk as result of subsidy elimination second national participation rates for all sfha structures would grow from 28 in 1997 to 40 in 2022 in the absence of subsidy eliminati on but if the subs idy were eliminated immediately the participa tion rate would drop from 26 in 1997 to about 20 in 1998 therefore the subsidy should be pha sed out over time third the property values of prefirm structures would decline by 4 in 1998 if there were an immediate subsidy elimi nation it would appear th at these findings might have influenced policy shift in congress and the administration towards reducing or eliminating the subsidy on nonprima ry and nonresiden tial properties several years ago fema began the fi rst major evaluation of the programs performance and goals since its inception41 according to fema the purpose of the overall program
