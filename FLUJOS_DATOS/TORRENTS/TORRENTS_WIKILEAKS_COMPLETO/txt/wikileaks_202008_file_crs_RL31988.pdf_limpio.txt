of polygraph testing9 particularly when used for personnel security screening hereafter referre d to as the nas report or nas study10 the nas report published in 2003 concl uded that the accuracy of polygraph tests is questionable and that polygraph sc reening tests are particularly problematic because generic questions are generally posed during such polygraph eg did you ever reveal classified informati on to an unauthorized person and thus examinee and examiner may have difficulty knowing whether an answer to such question is truthful unless there are clear and consistent criteria that specify what activities justify yes answer11 such testing according to nas is made even more complicated by the fact that it involve s inferences about fu ture behavior on the basis of information about pa st behaviors that may be qu ite different eg whether past use of illegal drugs or lying about such use on polygraph test predicts future spying12 nas thus concluded polygraph testing yields

only as trigger for detailed follo wup investigation rather than as basis for personnel action14 while questioning the polygraphs scientific validity nas recognized the polygraph screening had utility as screening tool and could be useful for achieving such objectives as terring security violations increasing the frequency of admissions of such violations deterring employment applications from potentially poor security risks and increas ing public confidence in national security organizations15 after some members of congress criticized does initial efforts to revamp its polygraph program to reflect nass findings including its criticism of screening polygraphs the department in october 2006 eliminated the use of polygraph testing for screening applicants for employment and employees wit

the role of variables such as culture gender language geography and individual variation in security evaluation polygraphy has preventative value as deterrent and given that scientific approach to security evaluations requires high quality data access to additi onal data on actual security compromises would be exceptionally useful in the design and testing of new approaches although nsf and

series of comparison or contro l questions it is believed that stronger reactions indicate deception on the part of the individual being tested it is these physiological responses which are at the heart of the ong oing debate over the validity of polygraph testing23 the polygraph examination attempts to serve two purposes to detect deception and to reveal truth the test itself represents an attempt to capture accurate psychophysiological indicator s of deception the polygra ph examinati on however includes both the test and the interrogation rrounding it and is intended to be tool for revealing truth24 the polygraph is used in three circumstan ces event specific or exculpatory eg when crime has been committed preemployment screening and current employee screening the intelligence community uses the polygraph both as an investigative tool and as screening device the depa rtment of defense dod uses the device almost exclusively as an investigative tool although dod also uses it to screen certain employees but only in cases i nvolving requirement for exceptional clearances for highly sensitive programs25 doe adopts first use of polygraph for screening although doe has had longstanding po licy of using the polygraph as tool to investigate specific even ts such as particular crime until 1999 it had never utilized the polygraph to screen prospective and current employees as discussed above the department bega n to employ polygraph screening after intelligence information surfaced indicating that china may have stolen secrets from does weapons labs and following presidents c linton pdd61 directive to strengthen its counterintelligence program specifically doe was directed to adopt several organizational changes as well to consider several improvements to its

screening program in 1999 first this program would serve as means to deter unauthorized disclosures of classified info rmation as well as provide early warning of such disclosures allowing doe to r eact faster to possible damage to national security second polygraph testing could c ontinue to be used to provide interim personnel security clearances on an expedite d basis and third the polygraph would provide employees confronting unresolved ci issues an option that could lead to quick resolution of such issues27 doe was prohibited by statute from taki ng adverse personnel action solely on the basis of polygraph test result indi cating deception unless reasonable efforts were made to indepe ndently verify through alterna tive means the veracity of the individuals response28 scientific evidence indicating polygraph screening accuracy is limited supporters and critics agree that scientific evidence supporting the validity of polygraph screening is extremely limited the nas report

acknowledging that there is little available research pertaining to the accuracy of screening polygraphs nas said its examination of evidence derived from studies of specificincident polygraph testing lead it to conclude that polygraph screening accuracy is insufficient to justify using polygraph screening in federal agencies32 in examining 57 specific incident polygraph studies nas found that such pol ygraph tests can discriminate lying from truth telling at rates well above chance though well below perfection because polygraph screening tests involve considerably more ambiguity in determining truth than arises in specificincident polygraphs nas said polygraph screening accuracy is almost certainly lower than that of specificincident polygraph testing as result nas concluded that when polygraphs are used to screen employees they yield an unacceptable choice between too many loyal employees falsely judged deceptive and too many major security threats left undetected research indicates countermeasu res pose potential threat to accuracy nas also found that basic scie nce and polygraph research point to countermeasures as posing potentia l threat to the polygraphs accuracy according to nas it is entirely possible that an individual undergoing polygraph test can consciously alter responses thr ough cognitive or physical means since the physiological indicators meas ured by the polygraph can be altered by such activity nas also concluded that it is possi ble for individuals to learn certain countermeasures33 screening polygraphs for doe use nas found that polygraph screening is particularly illsuited for use at an agency like doe where the proportion of spies terrorist s and other major national security threats among the employees subject to polygraph testing presumably is very low34 in such cases according to nas polygraph screening shoul d not be counted on for detection in populations in which very small proporti on of individuals could be expected to pose major security risks since doing so would require high accuracy screening in populations with very low rates of the target transgressions eg less than 1 in 1000 requires diagnostics of extremely high accuracy well beyond what can be expected from polygraph testing nas stated in its report35 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31988crs9 36 office of technology assessment scientific validity of polygraph

ng polygraph validity nass findings essentially tracked the results of similar research review conducted by the congressional office of technology assessment ota in 198336 in its study ota concluded that the available evidence was insufficient to conclusively establish the scientific validity of polygraph screening ota cited two reasons why it would be impossible to establish the polygraphs overall validity first the polygraph examination encompasses process that is far more complex than the instrument itself the types of individuals tested the examiners training the purpose of the test and the types of questions asked among other factors can differ substantially one test from the next according to the ota study second the research on polygraph validity varies widely in terms of results and the quality of the research design and methodology c onclusions about scie ntific validity can be made only in the context of specific applications and even then must be tempered by the limitations of available research evidence ota concluded37 polygraph supporters say polygraph 8090 percent accurate supporters of polygraph testing such as the apa point to 80 research projects conducted since 1980 that it says show polygraph accuracy ranging from 80 to 98 percent38 while conceding that most of the these research projects have studied eventspecific polygraph testing rather than preemployment or employment screening apa contends that real worl d conditions are difficult if not impossible to replicate in mock crime or laborat ory environment for the purpose of assessing effectiveness39 the apa further asserts that the same physiological measures are recorded and the same basic psychological principles may apply in both eventspecific pre employment and employment screening pol ygraph examinations as result says apa there is reason to believe that there is substantial decrease in the validity rate when the polygraph is used for screening purposes40 proponents also argue that accuracy ra tes have improved as handscoring by examiners has been replaced by computeriz ed algorithms that proponents say filter out human errors and biases examiner s reportedly

september 4 20034 2003 that he had recommended to secret ary abraham that doe sharply curtail polygraph screening61 mr mcslarrow said doe s hould retain mandatory polygraph screening only for employees having regular access to does most sensitive information adopting such an approach according to mr mcslarrow would reduce the number of individuals affected from well in excess of potentially 20000 to approximately 450062 although he recommended that doe continue its polygraph screening program albeit on sm aller scale mr mcslarrow said the departments polygraph tes ting conformed with nass recommendation that such testing at most should be used only to trigger further testing investigation and collection of other inform ation about the individual63 mr mcslarrow also said doe wanted to include random polygraph testing as part of its overall counterin telligence evaluation program citing the nas finding that polygraph screening may be useful fo r achieving such objectives as deterring security violations increasing the frequenc of admissions of such violations and deterring employment applications from pot entially poor security risks and that predictable polygraph testing ie fixedinterval testin g of people in specific job classifications probably has less deterrent value than random testing64 senator domenici commended mr mcslarrow for does apparent willingness to revise its polygraph testing policy i have been appalled by does continued massive use of polygraph tests in the wa ke of national study condemning the reliability of these tests i

whet her the departments polygraph testing is sufficiently focused on small enough number of individuals occupying only the most sensitive positions doe has tightened programs focus by establishing for cause examination policy remaining question is whether there is rationale for doe to further focus its program or whet her the current structure of the program is the most effective and thus reduce the number of individuals subject to polygraph examinations alternatively congress could explore the issue of whether the current structure of the program is too constrained thus incurring the risk of failing to minimize the potential for release or disclosure of cla ssified data material or information as required by statute additional research polygraph critics and supporte rs alike agree that furt her research into the scientific basis for psychophysiological detection of deception by any technique is warranted74 the nas report suggested that if the federal government continues to rely heavily on the polygraph research shoul d be conducted that might result in the development of firmer scientific foundation for the polygraph the nas study cautioned however that the inherent am biguity of the polygraphs physiological measurements suggests that investment s in improving polygraph technique and interpretation will bring only m odest improvements in accuracy75 the nas report recommended that the g overnment broaden its research into alternatives to the polygraph76 while nas reported that alternative techniques such as measurements from brain activity and other physiological indicators facial expressions voice quality and other aspects of demeanor show some promise it cautioned that none of these techniques has yet been shown to outperform the polygraph none

issue for congress could be whet her to discontinue polygraph screening altogether critics characterize polygraph screening as misguided and suggest that it be replaced by more thorough examination of financial and travel records and more frequent reinvestigation by more traditional means they further argue that the results of polygraph screening can produce dangerously false sense of confidence with regard to identifying spies such misplaced confidence could lead authorities to relax efforts to obtain ci information through other channels such as periodic security reinvestigations and close monitoring of security violations in certain government facilities84 finally critics caution that the accuracy of polygraphs notwithstanding such tests can be def eated through certain
