d15 report on the interpretation of palaeodata using climate simulations j guiot nicault s brewer and s alleaume udesam test of the mediterranean drought fluctuation recontruction summer pdsi based on treering data nicault et in prep the climatic reconstruction was done over 25 grid covering the whole mediterranean region 325475n 10w50e the period extends from 1350 to 2000 with calibration period from 1901 to 2000 the pdsi was reconstructed using combination of an analogue technique which is able to deal with missing data coupled to an artificial neural network technique for an optimal nonlinear calibration guiot et 2005 bootstrap technique for calculating error bars of the reconstruction the proxy data are 136 sites over the mediterranean basin from the dendrodb relational european treering database httpservpalceregefrwebdbdendro only series longer than 300 years ie starting before 1700 were retained treering measurements used in this study were the total ring width rw the final or late width lw and the maximal density md as they are more related to the summer drought conditions this gives 165 treerings series figure 1 shows the mean series for the whole mediterranean region the first test follows zorita et 2003 the objective is to test the weakness of the reconstructions when the number of proxies is low in particular in the early times before 1700 ad we used the simulation echogall forcings erik the red the outputs of echogall are transformed into summer pdsi to be comparable with the reconstructions we attributed to each treering series the closest simulated pdsi pseudo proxy the predictors are then model gridpoints assigned to treering sites and predictands are model gridpoints interpolated at the 25x25 grid we have established reconstruction using all the 165 predictors available from 1700 ad another one with the 68 predictors available from 1600 ad another one with the 25 predictors available from 1500 ad and the last one with the 7 series available from 1350 ad figure 2 shows the calibration correlation which is above 09 at locations where pseudoproxies are available but falls below 05 when now ones are the error bars strongly increase when the number of proxies decreases figure 3 but for the mean pdsi calculated on the whole regions the calibration correlation varies only from 092 165 proxies to 078 7 proxies this figure shows also that it seems to have enough proxies until to 1600 ad but before large part of the region has not enough information figure 3 shows that the four reconstructions are quite similar in mean on the whole period the main effect of the rarefaction of the predictors is then on the error bars and on regions with low information but is relatively limited on the mean reconstruction the previous test considers that the signal of the proxies is perfect in the second test von storch et 2004 we consider the situation when the signal is degraded for each set of pseudo proxies noise of variance equal to pseudoproxy variance multiplied by coefficient of 05 1 2 and 3 is added to them these reconstructions are compared to the perfect echog pdsi fig 4 as expected the correlations between the reconstructions and perfect curve decrease with the noise variance from r086 to r073 but they remain highly significant moreover the variance of noisy reconstructions is always lower then the perfect curve variance fig4 shows that the noisy curves are flater than the echog series the same figure shows however that the intermediate frequencies are relatively well preserved the same type of fluctuations is recognised for all the curves high correlations proves that the high frequencies are also well reconstructed the question now is to understand if the low frequency component of our series have an underestimated variance or not the comparison of fig1 based on treerings and fig 4 based on pseudo proxies shows that at the exception of the last 50 years very sensitive to the co2 increase the ranges of variation are comparable from 1 to 12 with echogall fig4 and from 12 to 12 with treering data fig1 this tends to proves good longterm behaviour at least from the statistical point of view the important conclusion of these tests is that white noise which is by definition high frequency component has major effect on the low frequencies of the signal and then climatic reconstructions from much noisy proxies may lead to underestimate the longterm variations of the climate the pseudoproxy approach is good way to understand the effect of the imperfections and biases of our proxy series on the final reconstructions if we except the recent changes where model is likely too sensitive to co2 forcing we can tell that our reconstruction has an acceptable behaviour in
