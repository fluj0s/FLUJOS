911 commission an i ndependent bipartis an commission was created on november 27 2002 by p l 1073061 it was directed to make full and complete accounting of the circum stances surrounding the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the extent of the united states preparedness for and immediate response to the attacks as part of this charge the 911 commission released its final report on july 22 2004 which included recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent acts of terrorism2 in its report the 911 commission proposed fivepart plan to build unity of effort across the us government in fighting terrorism th plan includes recommendations for centralizing and strengthening congressional oversight of intelligence and homeland security issues3 tinkering with the existing structure of congresss system of intelligence oversight is not sufficient the report asserted either congress should create joint committee for intelligence using the joint atomic energy committee as its model or it should create house and sena committees with combined authorizing and appropriations powers4 the commission report further opined that the system of congressional oversight for intellig ence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional congress s hould address this problem the members of the 911 commission have considered various alternatives joint committee on the old model of the joint committee on atomic energy is one5 this report focuses on that portion of the 911 commission recommendation that urges congress to consider the model of the joint committee

green and rosenthalthe suitability of the jcae as possible model when crafting congressional oversight mechanisms for intelligence while the 911 commission report does not give additional specifics supporting this recommendation one can imagine the r easons why it was advanced during its 30year life the jcae was universally regarded as one of the most effective committees in congressional history on behalf of the two chambers of congress that it served the jcae exercised strong overs ight coordinated and shaped policy in its field and played an enormous role in the development of atomic power and the nuclear arsenal of the united states among other accomplishments one observer noted the jcae has been credited with the decision to develop the thermonuclear bomb saving the nautilus submarine project from the hostility of the navy brass and almost all of the developments in the domestic atomic power program6 in short what may have attracted the 911 commission to the jcae model is the fact that the jcae was established with extraordinary powers to deal with what was perceived as an extraordinary challe nge facing the nation the commission may view this situation as analogous to that of counter terrorism today following the explosion of the atomic bomb over hiroshima japan in august 1945 congressional intere st was extremely high regard ing the international security challenges posed by atomic power as we ll as its potential for providing valuable source of energy for civilian purposes the issues posed by the advent of the nuclear age precipitated power struggle between the legislative and executive branches as well as between civilian and commercial interests and the military over the appropriate alloca tion of power and responsibility fo r overseeing nuclear power the ultimate outcome of that struggle was the creation of fivemember civilian atomic energy commission aec located in the executive branch and empowered to oversee all aspects of atomic energy and an 18member congressional joint committee on atomic energy located in the legislative branch that was empowered with jurisdiction over the agency and th subject of nuclear power generally the jcae has been described by those who have studied it as one of the most powerful if not the most powerful congressional committee in the history of the nation7 while the jcae was certainly committee of congress in many ways it did not resemble congressional committee or at least few other congressional committees before or since serving as lmost unicameral legislature within the bicameral congress the joint committee on atomic energy was powerful in part because it enjoyed exclusive jurisdiction and had unique struct ure congress gave the jcae exclusivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs3 8 42 usc 2251 9 few temporary joint committees have had legislative authority for example the joint committee on reorganization which was crea ted on dec 29

all bills resolutions and other matters8 relating to civilian and military aspects of nuclear power and made it the only permanent joint committee in modern times to have legislative authority9 the jcae coupled these legislative powers with exclusive access to the information upon which its highly secretive deliberations were based simply put the jcae had access to restricted data not available to other committees of the house or senate the joint committee jealously guarded that information and this gave the committee tremendous power in its area of expertise as overseer of the atomic energy commission the joint committee was also entitled by statute to be kept fully and currently informed of all commission activities it vigorously exercised that statutory right demanding information and attention from the executive branch in fashion that arguably has equivalent today creation of the jcae against the backdrop of the dawning atomic age congress faced the question as scholars harold p green and allen ro senthal observed in their 1961 study of the jcae of how to maintain its position in relation to the executive branch and deal effectively with vital nati onal security program requiring secrecy involving highly esoteric technical data at the frontiers of scientif ic knowledge and necessitating considerable urgency and flexibility10 following world war ii congress was f acing not only the challenges posed by the atom but also coming to terms with its own authority and position in relation to the executive branch of government in the summer of 1946 congress had fina lly passed after nearly two years of study the landmark legislative reorgani zation act of 1946 which was motivated in part by congresss desire to have mo re power and resources in relation to the president the act which gave birth to the modern congressional committee system made improvements in such house and senate organi zation and operation with view toward strengthening the congress simplifying its operations and improving its relationships with the other branch of the united states government11 the motivation for the creation of the jcae shoul d be considered in the context of

joint economic committee charged with providing independent facts and analyses to congress on veloping economic trends one of congresss apparent motivations in creating the jcae was to have uniquely

informed about atomic energy developments the senate committees report on the legislation described the provision relating to the joint committee primarily in terms of keeping congress fully acquainted at all times with the work of the commission the report also suggested that the joint committee would be in position to give substantial aid to the appropriations committee and could consider supplementary and amendatory atomic energy legislation as the need might arise14 less than month after the explosi on of the atomic bomb senator brien mcmahon dct introduced gislation in congress to establish board composed of executive officials to deal with the subject of atomic power15 this was the first bill on atomic energy in the senate16 it was reportedly rudimentary proposal that received little notice on that same day september 6 1945 senator arthur h vandenberg rmi introduced concurrent resolution to create joint congressional committee which would study the issues associated with the development control and use of atomic energy and report recommendations to congress17 the senate adopted senator vandenbergs reso lution calling for joint committee without debate on september 27 194518 allies of the truman administration in the house however opposed the vandenberg measure preferring instead to keep the subject of atomic energy within the orbit of existing and

governing the security handling nd development of atomic energy20 t h i s legislation was drafted by the war depa rtment and would have placed control of atomic energy squarely in the orbit of the military by having it overseen by powerful atomic energy commission that would control all sources of atomic energy and conduct all necessary researc h experimentation nd operations for the further development and use of atomic ergy for military industr ial scientific or medical purposes21 the mayjohnson legislation was introduced in conjunction with congresss reception of special message from president truman urging the congress to create such structure to oversee atomic energy the truman administration intended to drive for passage of the may johnson bill with the aid of the smooth working relationships which the war department had established with the military affairs committees of both houses22 when the measure was introduced in th house it was promptly referred to the committee on military affairs in the senate however jurisdictional battle erupted over the referral of the legislation with several senators expressing concern that the referral of the bill to the senate military affairs committee would send the message that atomic energy is to be used only as war instrument23 on october 22 1945 senator mcmahon in troduced new resolution sres 179 providing for the establishment of special senate committee on atomic energy in light of the houses failure to act on senator va ndenbergs concurrent resolution establishing joint congression committee the senate promptly adopted the mcmahon resolution to set up committee of its own24 senator mcmahon had laid the groundwork for the success of his pr oposal by seeking the support of senator vandenberg vandenberg kne w his previously introduced resolution for joint committee was dead in the house of representatives the next best approach would be to create special committee in the senate alone25

senate committee on atomic energy after fending off an attempt by senators from the mayjohnson camp to cap ture control of the new special committee by arguing for appointment of the chair on the basis of seniority26 the debate on the creation of the senate special committee reveals some of the thinking by members that would later influence the structure of the jcae for example the special committee had legisl ative power an unusual addition to temporary panel most of which were quite limited in their power and mission in addition during consideration of sres 179 senators rej ected an attempt to expand the special committee from 9 to 18 members deciding instead to compromise on an 11member panel senator vandenberg argued for smaller atomic committee stating special committee is created because of the fact that there is special job to be done it must be done in conc entrated way as rapidly as it can be done with full justice to the subject i fe that if there were to be larger committee there would be scattering of responsibility and the result we desire would not be achieved we all know what the experience is with large committees27 senator vandenberg further argued that smaller committee would also be more likely to be trusted by the executive branch and the military with secret atomic information observing that smaller num bers of members could better handle information that involved certain element of secrecy28 b t h f t h s considerations would influence the size of the jcae during debate senator barkley as nate majority lead er expressed his preference that members appointed to th senate special committee be made up of senators from the important senate committees which might claim jurisdiction over legislation affecting atomic energy such as the committees on commerce foreign relations naval ffairs and appropriations29 while never codified it would later become the practice to ppoint members regularly from the armed services and foreign relations committees to the jcae at the same time that senators mcmahon and vandenberg were joining forces to create special senate committee on atomic energy that would examine atomic energy in its broadest sense the house military affairs committee was doing its best to expedite the mayjohnson bill that would place atomic energy squarelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs7 30 hewlett and anderson

views of the administration as well as the war department32 the drive for quick passage of the ma yjohnson legislation began to slow in november 1945 when the white house had second thoughts about the legislation the administration feared the measure gave too much power over atomic technology to the military at the expense of the pres idents executive authority particularly of concern to the white house were provisions of the mayjohnson bill that gave to the administrator of the atomic energy commission broad aut hority and severely limited the presidents power to remove either him or other commissioners from office as result shortly after the legislation was reported from the house military affairs committee the president privately withdrew his endorse ment of the bill33 in the meantime senator mcmahons ne w panel was holding wide ranging hearings on various issues relating to th atomic bomb and atomic energy those hearings began on november 27 1945 during which time senator mcmahon developed new bill that was in troduced on december 20 1945 as s 171734 this measure called for placing cont rol of nuclear technology in newly created civilian agency similar to that requested by president truman and overseen by joint congressional committee similar in power to the senate special committee on atomic energy unlike the mayjohnson proposal this measure made the aec commissioners subject to the removal authority of the president after the mcmahon special committee conc luded its hearings the following spring it unanimously reported s 1717 in an amended form with provisions for ninemember joint committee on atomic energy equipped with legislative power to oversee all matters relating to atomic power the bill was passed by the senate on june 1 194635 senate floor debate on s 1717 focused primarily on the issue of patents and commercial uses of nuclear technology36 and touched very little on the merits of or necessity for joint committee however lengthy explanation by senator mcmahon of the bill that appeared in the congressional record provided the rationale for establishing the joint panelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs8 37 ibid p 6097 38 congressional record

the congress should have the means of watching over the new atomic ergy commission to assist it with new laws when new laws are required to assess its operations and alter its powers and structure when necessary to be read to adapt it continuously to changing circumstances37 following senate passage s 1717 wa s debated in the house on july 20 194638 again the provisions of the bill establishing joint committee were not touched upon in debate most of the house floor debate focused instead on concerns raised by members that the atomic energy commission would keep private enterprise from benefitting from atomic t echnology by closely holding control of nuclear technology and the ability to pate nt it in additi on several members expressed concern about whether the pr oposed atomic energy commission could be trusted to safely keep the nations atomic secrets it is clear from the debate however that some members were uneasy about the broad grant of power that was be ing given to the new atomic energy commission by congress representative clare booth luce rct pointed out that many members were torn between distaste for the vast dictatorial domestic powers the legislation confers on the fiveman commission and our fears that without it we shall endanger our national security in troubled world39 this sentiment might go long way toward explaining why ma ny members embraced joint committee with extraordinary power to oversee the aec s 1717 was passed by vote of 256 to 79 on july 20 after motion by supporters of the mayjohnson approach to recommit the bill to the house military affairs committee for further study was rejected40 conference report on s 1717 was adopted by voice vote in the house on july 26 1946 the senate passed the re port with debate that same day41 the conference report was substantially similar in content to the measure as reported from the mcmahon committee42 so much so in fact that one house conferee was heard to complain that in the

the aec and the joint committee on atomic energy because of the central role senator mcmahon played in the legislation some observers refe r to the statute as the mcmahon act of 194645 structure of the joint committee the provisions of the atomic energy act of 1946 establishing the structure of the jcae were relatively brief and nons pecific the committee was to have nine members from each house more than five of whom would come from one political party in fact as green and rosenthal point out in crafting the jcae provisions of the atomic energy act there is indication that congress considered potentially difficu lt mechanical problems such as the technique to be employed in consid eration of presidential appointments to the commission requiring senate confir mation and the question of whether senator or representative would chair the committee even the basic question of how bills would be reported out to the house and senate seems to have been unresolved46 in retrospect it may seem strange that the joint committees structure was so loosely and informally defined green and rosenthal provided the following hypothesis as to one possible reason for this one possible precedent for the structure of the joint committee may be found in the informal practice that prevailed during the second world war during that time the entire atomic energy program developed by the manhattan engineer district was kept from general congressional scrutiny requests for appropriations were hi dden in the budgets of number of executive agencies and were passed on by the chairmen of the senate and house appropriations and military affairs committees who constituted an informal joint committee at the same time these four men were necessarily privy to secret developments in the program the proven feasibility of this arrangement and its success in preserving security during the war may have influenced the draftsmen of the 1946 atomic energy act47 membership of the joint committee senate members of the jcae were appointed by the president pro mpore of the senate and house members were appointed by the speaker of the house httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs10 48 edward

the informal practice to choose more senior senators and representatives to serve on the panel over time the jcae became associated with the names of seve ral members of congress who were to be perceived as giants48 original appointees to the 18memb er joint committee included democratic senators tom connally of xas and richard b russell of georgia republicans on the panel included senator arthur h vandenberg house democrats chet holifield dca and melvin price dil were also appointed to the jcae and served on it for number of years49 texas democrat and future president lyndon b johnson

in each house was to appoint members who were statesmen who were old hands in the congress and therefore accustomed to its traditions and mores who were judicious and restrained51 committee balance the atomic energy ac t of 1946 made provision for appointing specific members to the jcae however it early became the practice to assure that members from the committees on foreign relations and armed services of the two houses were always among those serving on the joint committee52 the participation of members from these committees made sense not only had the members of these panels been most active on the issues relating to atomic energy but the jcaes predominant concern was with atomic weapons53 and having members with experience in these subjects was only logical in 1951 senate rules were amended so that up to three senate members of the jcae served as exofficio members of the senate committee on appropriations when the panel was considering its annua l appropriations for the

jcae members as green and rosenthal point out rela tions between the house members on the jcae and the chambers spending panel were simply not as cordial as the one their senate counterparts enjoyed observers claimed that the house committee on appropriations viewed the joint committee as an irresponsible newcomer and green and rosenthal characterized the relationship between the two as stormy55 regional balance likewise without any stat utory requirement to do so the custom developed to provide for regi onal representation by members on the joint committee of this regional represen tation green and ro senthal observed state and regional balance has reduced the chances of strong contesting constituency blocs an individual member w ill of course try to ensure that his state or district is not discriminated against when contracts are let by the aec however internal divisions on the committee are seldom provoked by geographical factors56 for the period 1947 through 1960 this re gional balance found an assortment of members 8 from the northeast 6 fro m the midwest 8 from the south 7 from the mountain region and 8 from the p acific states serving on the jcae limit on service as green and rosentha l point out there were term limits on service on the jcae and membership on the panel did not count against senate limits on service on major and minor committee assignments they write perhaps critical advantage the jcae possessed in recruiting members one which assured buyers market is that it is an extra committee in other words members in taking on jcae assignment have to give up other committee position in return57 this freedom to be on the joint pane l without having to give up other assignments led to high degree of continuity in panel membership with comparatively slight turnover 58 selection of the chair provision was made in the atomic energy act of 1946 for the rotation of the panels chai r between the house and the senate the act simply provided that the joint committee would select chair and vice chair from among their members with specificity as to the political party or chamber from which the chair should come starting with the appointment of the initial

of the departments and establishments of the government60 to put this staffing authorization in perspective the legislative reorganization act of 1946 laid out limit of 4 professional staff and 6

the report was filed in the house or senate by the ranking member of the appropriate half of the joint committee in considering the measure on the floor the second chamber would ordinarily adopt the first acting chambers measure as referred or differences would be resolved through brief exchange of amendments be tween the houses issues were rarely so much in disagreement that conference committee was required to resolve them from 1958 until 1977 only four annual ae c authorization bills required committee of conference to resolve legislative differences in various aspects of atomic energy policy the fiscal years 1958 1959 1962 and 1963 annual authorizations69 this institutional lack of disagreement was unique feature of the jcae that arguably added to its efficacy simply put the jcae tried whenever possible to present unified work produc t to the congress representative craig hosmer rca member of the jcae observed of this tendency every effort is made to write report that is acceptable to all members only when somewhat fundamental divergence of philosophical opinion arises do we issue report containing separate or supplemental views to those expressed by the majority of members70 duties and powers of the jcae unlike most joint committees which ar most frequently temporary bodies with limited oversight power and legislative authority congress assigned to the joint committee on atomic energy an unusua l and formidable arsenal of powers the committee combined both legislative and oversight functions which for most of the life of the committee essentially preempted all other congressional committees except the committee on appropriations from having any say whatever over the items in the jcaes jurisdiction proba bly other joint committee has ever been given comparable range of extraordinary authorities71 the principal powers and duties of the joint committee under the 1946 atomic energy act were contained in section 15 b which provided that b the joint committee shall make c ontinuing studies of the activities of the atomic energy commission and of problems relating to the development use and control of atomic energy the commission shall keep the joint committee fully and curre ntly informed with respect to the commissions activities all bills resolutions and other matters in the senate or the house of representatives relating primarily to

their recommendations with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of their respective houses which are 1 referred to the joint committee or 2 otherwise within th jurisdiction of the joint committee72 significant to the joint committees power was the provision contained in section 15b of the act requiring that the commission shall keep the joint committee fully and currently informed73 of its activities the import of the jcaes power contained in the fully and currently informed language is exemplified by the experience of senator stuart symington dmo senator symington was senior member of both the senate armed services and foreign relations committees when he joined the jcae in 1971 symington sought place on the joint pane l because despite his seniority and powerful committee assignments he reportedly was unable to obtain certain restricted information from the executive branch it was just this secrecy and the way it was being used by the jcae to enhance its power that prompted nator symington to obtain assignment to the committee after the military had refused to tell his foreign relations subcommittee where atomic weapons were situated overseas although he served on the armed services committee for eighteen years senator symington was not aware until he went to the jcae of how many atomic weapons the military had where they were or even how they were purchased by the pentagon74 section 15b of the 1946 atomic ergy act directed the committee to make continuing studies of the activities of the atomic energy commission and of problems relating to the development use and control of atomic energy the committees mandate was substantially more direct and explicit than the oversight responsibilities generally c onferred on committees of the house or senate75 in another significant grant of power to the joint committee the provisions in section 15e authorized the jcae t utilize the services information facilities and personnel of the federa l agency it oversaw observers have stated that this section in particular had th effect of blurring the line between the jcae and the executive agency it was tasked with overseeing making the panel in

where the doctrine of executive privilege came to be almost meaningless76 the fact that the jcae was created by statute rather than by concurrent resolution gave it stronger position when dealing with the executive while others have suggested that this distinction is not significant with respect to the actual operations of the committee it bears notice that the charge to the atomic energy commission to keep the committee fully and currently informed might have been ignored if it had simply been included in resolution of the congress and did not have the force of law77 in 1954 the joint committee gained add itional power when congress passed legislation to amend the original ato mic energy act of 1946 the fully and currently informed provision of the 1946 ac t which gave the jcae full power over the aec was extended to the department of defense insofar as the development utilization or application of atomic energy was concerned the 1954 amendment78 also added directive to all other govern ment agencies stating any government agency shall furnish any information requested by the joint committee with respect to the activities or responsib ilities of that agency in the field of atomic energy79 in addition to assuring the joint committ ee access to more restricted data the 1954 amendments empowered the jcae to cl assify information originating within the committee in accordance with standards used generally by the executive branch for classifying restricted da ta or defense information80 this ability to classify information contributed to the power of the joint committee by ensuring that it and other congressional committee could access such classified information confirmation procedure like other senate committees the senate members of the jcae conducted executive business holding hearings on the nominations of aec commissioners these hearings were more than perfunc tory the jcae used its power over confirmation as leverage over the executiv branch for example following the contentious term of lewis strauss as aec commissioner the jcae agreed to confirm his successor john mccone onl after public and executive hearings in which mccone gave assura nces that he adhered81 to the jcaes vision of how the aec should be run having made this pledge mccone was to demonstrate repeatedly his readiness to join the jcae in developing and in managing

have been intangible rather than statutory scholars have obs erved that one fundamental characteristic of the jcae aside from its unique nature as joint pane l and its considerable statutory power was its unswerving dedication to the devel opment of nuclear power as green and rosenthal observed unicameralism is not the major departure from tradition represented by the jcae the essence of the joint committee on atomic energy is its positive sense of mission84 in that sense one important source of the jcaes power and effectiveness was the fact that all its members were working toward common goal the members of the jcae had pronuclear power ph ilosophy definite objectives which they believed should be achieved and specific policies which they worked to have implemented evolution of joint committee powers while the jcae was by all accounts one of the most powerful committees in congressional history obs ervers have pointed out th at this power was achieved through an evolution in essence the jcae grew into its substantial statutory powers as green and rosenthal pointed out the panels activities during its first 15 years fall neatly into separate eras the years 1947 1948 and 1949 may aptly be characterized by period in which the joint committee played relatively passive role commencing in late 1949 the committees role appears to have changed markedly it also began to assume role of vigorous leadership in this role it generally encouraged and xhorted the willing but cautious aec to expand programs in 1955 the joint committee sought to accelerate the nati ons civilian power program the years 19551958 were marked by sharp controversy with the executive branch during this period the jcae became policyforging institution greatly expanding the exercise of its

position with little opposition from the executive85 over time the jcae came to have unique relationship with both congress and the executive branch entities it oversaw authorizing legislation under the 1946 act the aec had permanent authorization as result it was not necessary for the joint committee to hold numerous hearings or initiate legislati on other than in the general context of oversight or to promote issues that it viewed as policy priorities86 the jcaes power over the aec was not challenged in congress by any committees other than the appropriations panels according to green and rosenthal the jcae during the early years gene rally defended the aec and its programs against congressional criticism particularly from the house committee on appropriations87 during one fight with th appropriations committee the jcae succeeded in achieving compromis on budget issues acceptable to the aec88 only by holding the senate in session until dawn day before scheduled adjournment the 1954 atomic energy act required for the first time authorization legislation for new construction projects nd real estate acqui sition in 1957 the scope of this authoriza tion broadened and in 1963 c ongress further expanded the scope of the authorization process to cover all activities of the aec89 from 1955 until the jcae was disbanded in 1977 the joint committee authored an annual authorization bill fo r certain commission programs as well as several supplemental authorization b ills there were few occasions when amendments were made to the joint committees recommendations either on the floor of the house or the senate that situation resulted largely from the legislations consideration by the joint committee instead of two separate committees and the close relationship between the aec and th jcae established by the 1946 act which allowed the executive branch and the joint committee to work out most policy differences before reaching the legislative stage in the few instances when jcae measure was amended and conference committee needed to be appointed to re solve differences in house and senate measures the conference was drawn from

the jcaes legislative power significantly of th authorizing process the joint committee stated the requirement for authorizing legislation has proven of value in many ways the joint committee receives testimony in both executive and open hearings the hearings give meaningful opportunity for detailed examination of program needs and furnish needed information to members of congress in their consideration of the appropriation bills91 legislative veto another important power wielded by the jcae was its use of the legislative veto scholars have observed that one of the primary reasons that the jcae was effective in shaping policy was that it insisted on access to information from the agencies it oversaw while matters were pending in this regard the jcae often acted as codecision maker with the executive not simply an observer of actions or decisions th at had already occurred one of the mechanisms that enabled the jcae to play this role effectively was its extensive use beginning in 1951 of the legislative veto subsequently the legislative veto was found to be unconstitutional by the supreme court the legislative veto is defined as procedure that allowed congress or one of its houses to nullify certain actions of the president executive branch agencies or independent agencies legislative vetoes were also sometimes called congressional vetoes or congressional disapprovals concurrent resolutions were required for vetoes involving both houses and simple resolutions we re required for action by one house these procedures reversed the usual roles of the two branches permitting the executive in effect to make law subject to veto by the legislature92 in 1951 congress implemented legislative veto provisions stating that before the aec exchanged restricted atomic data with other nations the proposed action would have to lie before the joint committee for period of thirty days in which congress was in session93 later amendments to the atomic energy act stipulated that decisions related to the classification of information bout nuclear materials agreements of cooperation letting of long rm contracts for electric utility service and certain payments

changes in panel could alter aweapons the new york times may 29 1973 p 23the obvious purpose of these provisions is to give the joint committee an opportunity to block the contemplated executive action the legislative veto power of the jcae is not unique as an inroad on executive discretion other congressional committees have the authority but the joint committees legislative veto power stands alone in its breadth encompassing several key areas of administration of the atomic energy program94 in many instances the legislative veto served only as threat due to the close relationship between the jcae and th aec and their roles as codecision makers the joint panel often got its way without resorting to the veto the supreme court case of ins v chadha 1983 declared unconstitutional congressional veto of certain actions of the executive by simple or concurrent resolution relations with the executive branch some viewed the close relationship that the jcae had with the executive branch as not positive for example when senator symington joined the jcae he was admittedly shocked by the jcaes arrangements and relationships particularly its seemingly seamless relationship with th aec and the pentagon in particular the jcae staff seemed to be closely allied with forces in the navy promoting nuclear powered submarines one press account said that senator symington was particularly disturbed over the mo st unbelie vable influence exerted by vice admiral hyman g ric kover within the joint committeeand his programs for nuclear powered ships and submarines costing billions of dollars95 if the jcae had unique relationship with the rest of congress it had an equally unique relationship with the executiv branch for the most part the jcae and the aec were closely allied with the aec deferring to and consulting with the joint committee to an unprecedented degree in the form ulation of policy for example joint committee member representative craig hosmer rca expressed in 1960 speech that was reprinted in the congressional record particular misgivings about the relationship between the joint committee and the agency it oversaw saying i sometimes feel that as between members of the joint committee and members of the atomic energy commi ssion there exists only shadowy and blurred understanding of which policy matters are to be decided by the committee and which by the commission even sometimes as to what are matters of policy and what are matters of administration this needs clarification by force of law rather than force of personalities and

eisenhower administration in 1953 retired admiral lewis l strauss became the atomic energy commissions chair strauss served not only as aec chair but as an advisor to the president on issues relating to atomic energy strauss won measure of increased autonomy for the aec through the 84th congress 19551957 but then ran into strong oppos ition from jcae members when he insisted on keeping certain information from them because he fe lt it would violate his ability to offer confidential counsel to the president lead ing the charge against strauss was senator clinton p anderson of new mexico senate hi storian richard baker described the relationship in this way relations between the admiral and the senator had been strained since 1953 when strauss had opposed plans to have the tennessee valley authority sell power to aec installati ons in the area and refused to support j robert oppenheimer against senator joseph r mccarthys charges of disloyalty at the heart of andersons bitter and unyielding attitude toward strauss lay his determination that congress must take part in the work of executive branch agencies accordingly he reacted angrily at strausss efforts to withhold inform ation from the joint comm ittee on atomic energy97 in late 1958 strauss declined presiden t eisenhowers offer of reappointment for another term as chair of the aec after strausss appointment expired

beginning of the 1970s members of congress evidenced increasing concern about the safety and public health questions asso ciated with nuclear power this concern began to emerge among some members of the jcae itself for the first time the panels commitment to the promotion of nuclear power came into question some members of the joint committee want ed to convert the committee to joint committee on

is one114 policymakers examining this recommendation might examine lessons from the jcae model the lessons hold numbe r of pros and cons as well as raise questions for consideration green and ro senthal summarize the work of the jcae panel to the year 1961 saying the joint committee on atomic energy is in terms of sustained influence within the congress its impact and influence on the executive and its accomplishments probably the most powerful congressional committee in the history of the nation there can be little doubt that had congress chosen to deal with atomic energy through conventional congressional committees the history of our atom ic energy program would have been quite different almost certainly the national investment in atomic energy would have been substantially less and our present level of technology considerably less advanced115 few of green and rosenthals most significant observations about the jcae are paraphrased here because of their relevance to the question of the jcaes suitability as model when crafting oversight mechanisms for the intelligence agencies and for homeland security issues generally these observations included by its skillful employment of its statutory powers the jcae made unprecedented inroads in the doctrine of executive privilege the jcaes comprehensive access to information and its insistence on obtaining information while matters were pending gave it the opportunity to participate in the executives formulation and implementation of policies the jcae exerted influence largel by continuously participating in the executive decisionmaking deliberations rather than by legislatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs26 116 ibid 117 ibidthe jcae steadfastly disregarded the patterns and procedures for coordination and control employed by the executive branch in its support for programs which it deemed vital to the national interest the jcae refused to recognize the validity of budgetary ceilings which otherwise rule out programs it desired 116 green and rosenthal also identified number of significant elements that characterized the behavior of the jcae in its relationship within congress these include members of congress were somewhat more inclined to rely upon the judgement of the jcae than on the judgement of other committees members of congress frequently have broad knowledge and interest in issues in the case of the jcae however relatively few members of congress d either high degree of knowledge about or strong interest in th atomic energy program congressional information about atomic energy was much more closely held than in the case of other subjects and other committees the joint committee arrangement resulted in congress being presented with less opportunity fo r choice among alternative ideas instead of choice from two or more measures the house and senate were faced with one legi slative product presented to them from the start of the process there was tendency for many im portant policy questions to be decided in effect by negotiations between jcae and the executive rather than through the pro cesses of public discussion or congressional debate from 1957 the jcae made use of authorizing legislation to initiate projects that the executive opposed when the joint committee was substantially united the congress almost invariably followed its lead even when the administration was strongly opposed on most occasions the jcae relied on means other than legislation to influence policy was largely autonomous exempt from congressional control and from di rect accountability to congress117 in examining the 911 commissions suggestion of the jcae as desirable model for current congressional intelligence oversight policymakers might

question of whether it is possible to recreate jcae in the modern congressional climate while congress certainly has the ability to establish similar panel with similar statutory and legislative powers one might question whether the totality of factors that made the jcae for midable could be reproduced today for example policymakers examining the jcae model might ask whether currently accepted ideas about executive privilege and relations between the branches as well as the change in the interests and roles of individual members of congress might result in joint committee that behaved quite differently than the jcae even if it had the same statutory powers as one scholar observed of the relationship between the jcae and the executive from practical standpoint the success achieved by the joint committee over the years in asserting claim to policymaking authority has been due to the inability or the unwillingness of the executive branch to assert an effective counter claim118 another factor to be weighed in this regard is the evidence that shows that the jcae was not created to be one of the most powerful committees in congressional history it evolved into one as result of the personalities of its members and circumstances as much as the enormous powers it was given the 911 commissions use of the jcae as an oversight model present lawmakers with unprecedented questions du ring its 30year life the jcae never encountered period in which the house and senate were c ontrolled by different political parties how such split party control of congress if it were to occur today would affect the oversight and legislative workload of such joint committee is simply unknown policymakers might also wish to explor how many of the types of oversight function performed by the jcae are now already being performed in the homeland security arena by the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on homeland security and other spending subpanels while the committees on appropriations have always conducted importa nt oversight of spending it might be argued that increasingly that oversight is not just focused on spending but on the structure progress and efficacy of programs in ssence the policy contributing factor in this trend might be the tendency to pa ss large omnibus appropriations measures in lieu of individual bills regarding the homeland security arena for example the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on homeland security have made wide use of reporting requirements in ma naging the department of homeland security dhs one estimate cited 60 separate add itional reporting requirements on the administration stemming just from the fy2004 department of homeland securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs28 119 erik floden congress

from activities of the department that affect privacy rights to how well emergency procurement policies have worked for dhs in addition the jcaes wide and effec tive use of the legislative veto would not be possible today and policymaker s considering the 911 commissions suggestion of the jcae as model might ex plore the implications of that fact the supreme court decision in the case of ins vs chadha 462 us 919 1983 which placed limits on congresss ability to invalid ate certain decisions of the executive branch presumably would deny modern joint congressional committee one of the most powerful tools in the jcaes arsena l on the other hand policymakers might discern that similar authority can be achieved through the use of another mechanism for example through the aggressive use of appropriations report language while weighing policy options it ma also be useful to question how analogous the issue of atomic energy is to the issues related to the failures in intelligence oversight that apparently were the basis of the 911 commissions recommendation in many ways the issues ar similar both are issues of sweeping importance and national attention both require action and high level of expertise coordination secrecy and speci alized knowledge from members in other ways the situations are not analogous the jcae benefitted from the fact that most members of congress we re not all that inte rested or knowledgeable about the highlytechnical issues in its juri sdiction and largely ferred to the panels judgements and recommendations it is unlikely that would be the case with the issues of intelligence and counter terrori sm where many members have specialized knowledge and virtually ll members have str ong interest this is particularly true if policymakers were to expand the jcae m odel to include oversight of the dhs and counter terrorism generally subject field that includes the work of nearly every authorizing committee of the house and senate lawmakers might also consider wh ether any contemporary congressional panel could operate w ith the level of secrecy and w ith the monopoly over information that the jcae enjoyed in its prime it is worth noting that the fully and currently informed language which the jcae used to its full advantage during its years overseeing the aec and dod on atomic energy issues was exactly replicated in the language creating both the house permanent select committee on intelligence and in the senate select committee in intelligence120 in other words both congressional intelligence committees already possess the same authority in this regard that the jcae enjoyed and have since their creati on in the 1970s policymakers examining the 911 commissions recommendations might question if that power is being appropriately used by the intelligence oversight panels or if perhaps the power simply does not hold the same force it did during the life of the jcae these questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs29 121 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report washington gpo 2004 p 103 122 ibid p 416might all be considered in the context of concerns raised by some including the 911 commission itself that secrecy and complexity in intelligence functions are part of the problem in its final report the commission expressed its view that secrecy while necessary can also harm oversight121 and called on cong ress to make public the overall amount of money being appropriated for nati onal intelligence functions122 barring the question of whether such joint entity could be recreated policymakers still face the question of whether such model is desirable one lawmakers who have expressed concern about the iron triangle nature of congressional oversight or the tendency toward organi zation group think may not find it desirable to have single small congressional pa nel invested with the power to authorize agencies programs weigh in on the appropriations for budgets confirm officials and act as its own conference committee in crafting governing legislation others might argue that the advantag of the jcae model outweigh these concerns offering the advantages of s ecrecy increased coordination of oversight certainty and timeline ss of action and reduction of duplication in energy and administrative function they might furthe r argue that the extraordinary challenges of intelligence oversight merit panel with extraordinary powers another consideration for policymak ers examining the 911 commissions recommendation of the jcae as possibl model is the question of whether something similar but not identical to the jcae might be utilized to improve intelligence oversight in essence taking the best of the jcae model and leaving out those portions of the jcae experien ce lawmakers find undesirable or politically infeasible for example the congressional intelligence committees responded to the 911 attacks in part by launching an unprecedented joint inquiry in february 2002 to investigate the intelligence communitys record and make recommendations for further legislative action during these two months of hearings the panels met together one option might be to combine the jcae and joint inquiry models the two intelligence committees could remain separate but come together as powerful joint panel during certain times of the year or to accomplish certain specific functions possibly when marking up the nnual intelligence authorizing measure or to conduct budget hearings another option might be to restore the idea of permitting members of such joint panel to serve as exofficio members of their chambers committee on appropriations when the panel considers its annual appropriations for the intelligence budget such change might help in institutionalizing c ooperative relationships between appropriators and authorizers in each chamber and present unified face to the agencies congress oversees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs30 another option might be to populate joint committee with key members of the relevant appropriations subcommittees and authorizing committees establishing in essence leadership panel to oversee the operations of the intelligence agencies another option might be to reject the jcae model altogether and try to establish mechanisms that motivate th current intelligence committees to conduct more rigorous oversight within the existing structurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32538crs31 123 us congress joint
