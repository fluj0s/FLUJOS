negotiations summary in november 2003 the administration notified congress that it intended to begin negotiations on freetrade agreement fta with four andean countries colombia peru ecuador and bolivia the notification said that an fta would reduce and eliminate foreign barriers to trade and investment and would support democracy and fight drug activity in the andean region the andean governments wanted to ensure access to the us market especially since their current trade preferences will terminate at the end of 2006 in the united states the business community indicated strong support for the trade agreement with labor opposing it as the case for many ftas and the agriculture community was split the andeanus fta negotiations began in may 2004 when the united states colombia peru and ecuador participated in the first round of talks bolivia participated as an observer after thirteen rounds of talks however negotiators failed to reach an agreement after the last set of talks peru decided to continue negotiating without colombia or ecuador and concluded bilateral agreement with the united states in december 2005 colombia later continued negotiations with the united states and this agreement was successfully concluded on february 27 2006 negotiations with ecuador are stalemated senior us trade official recently stated that the peru and colombian ftas are likely to be submitted to congress as separate agreements thereby constraining the possibility of an andeanus fta the united states currently extends dutyfree treatment to imports from the four andean countries under regional preference program the andean trade preference act atpa authorized the president to grant dutyfree treatment to certain products and the andean trade promotion and drug eradication act atpdea reauthorized the atpa program and added products that had been previously excluded over half of all us imports in 2005 from the andean countries entered under these preferences in 2005 the united states imported 201 billion from the four andean countries and exported 99 billion colombia accounted for about half of us trade with the region peru and ecuador almost evenly split the other half and bolivia represented very small share the leading us import from the region in 2005 was crude petroleum oil which accounted for 35 of imports leading us exports to the region were petroleum products mining equipment and broadcasting equipment there were several important issues in the fta negotiations the trade negotiators stated that the main obstacles to concluding an overall agreement were in agriculture and intellectual property rights another major concern was the issue of labor standards under the notification procedures founded in the trade promotion authority act the trade agreements with peru and colombia could be voted on by the congress sometime this summer the narrow passage of cafta dr had been viewed as an indicator that any usandean fta might also face

million people6 the letter of notification also stated that an andean fta would add momentum to the broader negotiations on an ftaa those negotiations were still stalled primarily because of

took office in the december 2005 elections bolivians elected evo morales as their president when morales was inaugurated on january 22 2006 he started fiveyear term as bolivias fourth president since august 2002 ecuador experienced political change as well during the negotiations on april 20 2005 during the ninth round of fta negotiations the congress in ecuador impeached ecuadors president lucio gutierrez and replaced him with the vice president alfredo palacio physician and political independent palacio is the countrys seventh president in nine years the thirteenth round of negotiations in washington was expected to be the last but negotiators failed to conclude the talks over disagreements in intellectual property rights and agriculture colombian and ecuadorian negotiators said they pulled out because they could not accept us demands for stricter patent protections and reductions in agricultural barriers while peruvian negotiators appeared to be more flexible the peruvian negotiators decided that they would continue talks with the united states without the other countries the two countries arrived at an agreement in the first week of december 200513 on december 7 2005

concluded their work on free trade agreement ambassador portman announced that the agreement is an essential component of the us regional trade strategy and that it would generate export opportunities for us agriculture industry and service providers and help create jobs in the united states he also stated that the agreement would help foster economic development in colombia and contribute to efforts to counter narcoterrorism which threatens democracy and regional stability16 the government of ecuador has stated that it too would like to continue negotiations with the united states and arrive at an agreement but these talks have been postponed several times andean perspective the andean governments are pursuing ftas with the united states to assure access to the immense us market they have preferential access now under unilateral us programs see following section but that access is scheduled to expire at the end of december 2006 an fta would lock in those preferences and additional dutyfree treatment the andean governments also want to attract foreign investment and see an fta with the united states as way to establish more secure economic environment and increase foreign investment within the andean countries however there is broad grassroots opposition to free trade with the united states opponents argue that any economic benefits from increased trade under an fta will be realized by only small segment of the economy worsening the separation of the classes they also argue that large part of the andean population is poor farmers who are especially vulnerable and cannot compete against increased agricultural imports from the united states which some andean officials claim are heavily subsidized the development group for alternative policies states that one of the few remaining mechanisms protecting family farmers in the andean region is the andean communitys price band system which they argue has served to cushion farmers from the vagaries of international commodity prices17 further argument is that an fta would mean reduced revenues for the andean governments and some opponents state that revenue losses will have to be replaced with regressive domestic taxes18 16 ustr press release united states and colombia conclude free trade agreement february 27 2006 17 hansenkuhn karen the development gap andean fta threats to

andean countries have faced considerable opposition in their countries over trade agreement with the united states news accounts reported that during the cartagena round in september 2005 an estimated 7000 antifree trade activists gathered in cartagena and bogota while protesters in peru erected roadblocks19 these protests may have influenced the governments to delay entry into an agreement but after the successful completion of perus agreement with the united states there likely was more pressure for colombia and ecuador to continue negotiations ecuadors chief trade negotiator manuel chiriboga stated in january 2006 that if colombia concluded an agreement ecuador cannot fail to conclude due to the risk that ecuador would be left out of the agreement to be voted on in the us congress20 perspective of us industry and other groups in the united states much of the business community supported an andean fta the national association of manufacturers nam for example states in its trade agenda that one of its key objectives is the congressional approval of the andean fta and other ftas now being negotiated the nam has written comments on its position in various aspects of the negotiations some of which include the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers transparency and accountability in technical regulations enforcement of national customs laws protection of us investment abroad and strengthening and enforcement of intellectual property rights laws 21 nams trade agenda states the nam supports ftas because us manufacturers face much higher barriers in foreign markets than foreign producers face here number of other groups however oppose an andean fta coalition of 51 labor religious and environmental groups wrote to the ustr on september 9 2004 urging him to suspend the negotiations they argued that the negotiations have been conducted in secret there has been meaningful dialogue with the public and the andean negotiations are modeled on failed trade

peru under regional trade preference program this program accounted for over half of all us imports from the four countries in 2005 the program began under the andean trade preference act atpa title ii of pl 102182 enacted on december 4 1991 atpa authorized the president to grant dutyfree treatment to certain products from the four andean countries that met domestic content and other requirements it was intended to promote economic growth in the andean region and to encourage shift away from dependence on illegal drugs by supporting legitimate economic activities atpa was originally authorized for 10 years and lapsed on december 4 2001 after atpa had lapsed for months the andean trade promotion and drug eradication act atpdea title xxxi of pl 107210 was enacted on august 6 2002 atpdea reauthorized the atpa preference program and expanded trade preferences to include additional products that were excluded under atpa the additional products under atpdea included petroleum and petroleum products certain footwear tuna in flexible containers and certain watches and leather products atpdea also authorized the president to grant dutyfree treatment to us imports of certain apparel articles if the articles met domestic content rules duty free benefits under atpdea end on december 31 2006 in 2005 considerable share 46 of all us imports from the four andean countries entered dutyfree under atpdea and smaller share 11 entered duty free under atpa23 very small share 2 entered dutyfree under the us generalized system of preferences which applies to most developing countries throughout the world of the remaining 41 of imports most entered dutyfree under normal trade relations which applies on nondiscriminatory basis to almost all us trading partners only 7 of the value of us imports from the four countries was dutiable in 2005 thus compared to the status quo only relatively small share of us imports would become dutyfree under an fta that small share however might include products that are relatively importsensitive in the united states or disproportionately important to the andean countries in 2005 the united states imported 201 billion or 1 of total us imports from the four countries the same year the united states exported 99 billion or 1 of all us exports to the four countries colombia accounted for 44 of those us imports and 55 of the us

manufacturers nam andean fta in the nam website httpwwwnamorg crs9 agriculture us negotiators refused to talk about rules for agricultural subsidies saying that subsidies should be dealt with in the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations in the world trade organization nevertheless an important goal for the united states in the fta talks was the elimination of practice called the priceband mechanism under this mechanism fluctuating tariff is imposed on an import for the purpose of keeping the imports price within specific range the band addresses changes in world commodity prices colombia and ecuador have these variable duties on over 150 items including corn rice soybeans and powdered milk26 andean negotiators said that the priceband mechanism is necessary to protect their farmers especially small farmers against subsidized imports spokesperson for small farmers in colombia said that there is large rural population and high unemployment in colombia and without protected alternative crops the people will produce drugs27 some specific products were especially important to the trading partners for example access to the us market is critical for andean producers of cut flowers colombia and ecuador and asparagus peru these products however have the largest potential displacement effects on us producers under atpdea28 so they are worrisome to us growers also us sugar producers are concerned about increased imports from the andean countries conversely andean farmers see some us products such as corn and chicken parts as threatening intellectual property rights ipr major area of disagreement was the socalled data exclusivity this term refers to an additional period of patent protection that is given to test data especially data on pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals the united states wanted rules on data exclusivity in an fta to protect the results of research by pharmaceutical companies for five years29 in related action the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma petitioned the us government to withdraw atpdea benefits for peru and ecuador because they have data exclusivity laws30 26 ustr 2004 national trade estimate

issued decrees in 2002 and in 2003 that gave protection of data for drugs and for agricultural chemicals respectively see ustr 2004 national continued crs10 oxfam development and relief organization argued guaranteeing exclusive rights over pharmaceutical data will result in delays and limit generic competition in cases where the patent has expired or compulsory license has been granted31 the andean countries opposed rules on data exclusivity arguing that the additional period keeps generic pharmaceuticals from entering the market and thus hurts poor people another ipr issue was the socalled biopiracy andean negotiators wanted ipr provisions to go beyond those contained in the wto they wanted protection against the use of traditional knowledge and genetic resources without fair compensation the united states wanted second use protection where product gets additional protection if it is found to serve use other than the original one under the patent it also wanted protection against parallel imports which are products legitimately made in one foreign country but imported into another country without the approval of the ipr holder the andean countries opposed these us positions worker protections and human rights some unions and labor rights groups protested against trade negotiations with ecuador and colombia because they claimed that these countries have unacceptable records on worker rights and permit violence against trade unionists for example an official with the international confederation of free trade unionists icftu criticized colombias president for negotiating with paramilitary forces who are the killers of trade unionists according to the icftu official and said that the more union protests the presidents economic policy the more the union is persecuted32 the colombian government responded that through several programs it instituted it clearly demonstrated its commitment to the protection of human rights and has given special priority to the protection of union members33 the us state department country report on human rights for colombia identifies many legal rights for unions but recognizes problems with protecting those rights34 for example the report states that in colombia the constitution provides right for most workers to organize unions but in practice violence against union members and antiunion discrimination were obstacles to joining unions and engaging in trade union activities another point of controversy was ecuadors record on human rights on february 1 2005 38 house members 37 democrats 1 independent

not considered major supplier but free trade could cause some increase in imports in addition the rule of origin for textiles and apparel was an important issue in the negotiations investorstate disputes one of the most important issues in the negotiations was the unresolved disputes involving us investments in andean countries on october 6 2004 the house committee on international relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere held hearing on us investment disputes in peru and ecuador at the hearing anthony wayne assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs testified nearly every us company doing business in ecuador has faced problems with ecuadorian government entities from regulatory bodies to the courts and the customs agency he said that the situation in peru was considerably better although there still were problems he stated that both countries had been cautioned that left unresolved these disputes are stumbling block to achieving an fta few months later in october 2004 deputy ustr peter allgeier warned that peru and ecuador could be dropped from the fta if outstanding investor disputes were seen as endangering congressional approval of an fta with colombia37 on april 13 2005 the house committee on international relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere held hearing on us trade agreements with latin america at the hearing john murphy vice president for western hemisphere affairs of the us chamber of commerce said that the situation regarding investment disputes with peru and ecuador was difficult and that persistent disputes could stand as substantial obstacle that could block the participation of these countries in an fta these disputes were discussed at the negotiations 35 letter from world trade online at

provisions in letter dated september 13 2004 number of environmental groups including friends of the earth natural resources defense council and sierra club expressed concern about the possible inclusion in an andean fta of an investment chapter similar to chapter 11 of the north american freetrade agreement38 that chapter allowed private investors from one signatory country to seek binding arbitration against the government of another signatory such provisions environmental groups argued in their letter could allow foreign companies to completely bypass domestic courts to challenge public interest safeguards on the other hand us negotiators sought such provisions in trade agreements since us companies wanted such protections for their foreign investments prospects the last round of negotiations in which the united states and the three andean countries all participated was held in washington on november 1422 2005 subsequently peru and colombia concluded bilateral ftas with the united states and talks with ecuador have been postponed several times due to number of differences the main outstanding issues are related to agriculture ecuadorian president alfredo palacio has said that he would like to see trade agreement with the united states but would not sign deal that is unfair to ecuador he is facing considerable pressure from indigenous groups not to enter into an agreement thousands of ecuadorean indians have been protesting the free trade talks saying that they cannot compete with farm products from the united states they believe trade agreement would put them at disadvantage with us farmers and disrupt their ancestral culture39 there has been some speculation that the united states will not renew the atpdea in the absence of ptpa in september 2005 the
