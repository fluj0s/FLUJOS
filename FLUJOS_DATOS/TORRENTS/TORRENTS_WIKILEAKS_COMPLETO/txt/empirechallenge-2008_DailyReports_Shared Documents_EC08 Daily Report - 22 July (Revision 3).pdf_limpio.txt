conduct dib federation testing with other nodes continue to collect data from the sensor systems attempt to receive sigint from cgs attempt to build an sa overlay using mti and sigint data attempt to conduct fire mission threads with afatds significant issue high speed guards are still not working and therefore we cannot federate with the cfblnet imagery products products collected mti from both jstars and astor sigint from rj imagery from raptor summary successes we were able to access sensor data from veral different systems via the metadata catalog and then we were able to build an sa overlay we were able to conduct several fire missions from echo with afatds at ft monmouth additional comments status of dcgsa node connections there are total of 16 external nodes dcgsa v30 status is

search our dib via the fleet enterprise search and return the correct results this includes verifying the expected return from the portal web proxy which will be used during inbound nces keyword query searches which will be conducted with the gsil significant issue we continue to work to re solve minor issues affecting search web service of our ipl we believe the problem may be related to ipl 60 implementation our enterprise engineering team is trying to re create the issue at vendor sites to see if they can create fix to the iplws application summary successes completed all planned objectives able to see 13 portals access 6 and get metadata results from one unable to pull any products search of our dib via the fleet enterprise search returned the expectedcorrected results this means the nces adapter to the dib is working properly and talking to our 13 federated search aggregator received the expected return from the portal web proxy based on this we believe gsil personnel will return results from our dip during ncs keyword query tests planned for tomorrow the ipl search web service is experiencing problem that may be related to the ipl 60 implementation working to recreate the issue on their side to see if we can create fix to the iplws application we expect to begin our work with personnel at the gsil tomorrow at 0830 where help is needed would like charles

still has issues with software and sim chip lesson learned the configuration issue to view mivg on the coi through sensorweb is now understood and is significant lesson and plus to interoperability throughout network where help is needed need admin permission on ddte to install geoviewer software to view mivg data need to socialize our plan to broadcast nearrealtime mivg data from moving

web services software significant issues all platforms flew today operational che ckouts of aws jadocs and chat were mostly successful operators used chat to pass e3 esm tracks to jstars which initiated sar maps of the area xhawk accomplished bda and isr threads with fa18s passing sharp imagery to jadocs imagery products products collected jstars collected sar imagery of suspected emitter

planned activities motion imagery standards board personnel are starting to wrap up their collection efforts the next two days are key as there are new sy stems that are just now coming up such as china lakes hsi sensor and hopefully the ga king air and tigershark todays flight schedule was robust yet in the end very little collection was done significant issues the scan eagle was only able to accomplish short 15minute test flight at the end of the day the flight was successful and bodes well for tomorrow but useful was collected from it hsi had successful collection day yet t heir imagery was made available on the cfe net their engineer said that is being worked also being worked in the tigershark imagery that is only viewable by the system operator at this point the ba king air is on the air schedule for tomorrow and their imagery releaseability will be addressed summary success few successes today with regards to motion imagery save for the data collection efforts by the misb personnel lesson learned we just dont have the robust number of sensors required to push all the systems imagery is sporadically being saved and can be pl ayed back to fulfill testing requirements but there isnt really much that affects the actual scenario more systems should be coming online tomorrow and friday where help is needed short of calling for an adhoc mq1 deployment we are attempting to maximize the use of the limited sensors available
