eric fischer resources science and industry division february 22 2005 abstract even before the terrorist attacks of september 2001 concerns had been rising among security experts about the vulnerabilities to attack of computer systems and associated infrastructure there were several reasons for those rising concerns first computer systems were becoming increasingly powerful and increasingly interconnected with many enterprises in the public and private sectors coming to rely on them for fundamental business functions second the size and reach of the internet was growing dramatically not only were more and more businesses and households in the united states using the internet but the same phenomenon was happening worldwide third the number and sophistication of attacks by criminals and vandals was growing and many experts thought that terrorists and other adversaries were preparing to launch attacks on computer systems via the internet or other means those trends have generally continued over the last several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777creating national framework for cybersecurity an analysis of issues and options summary even before the terrorist attacks of september 2001 concerns had been rising among security experts about the vulnerab ilities to attack of computer systems and associated infrastructure yet despite increasing attention from federal and state governments and internationa l organizations the defense against attacks on these systems has appeared to be generally fragm ented and varying widely in effectiveness concerns have grown that what is needed is national cybersecurity framework coordinated coherent set of public and privatesector efforts required to ensure an acceptable level of cybersecurity for the nation as commonly used cybersecurity refers to three things measures to protect information technology the information it contains processes and transmits and associated physical and virtual elements which together comprise cyberspace the degree of protection resulting from application of those measures and the associated field of professional endeavor virtually any element of cyberspace can be at risk and the degree of interconnection of those elements can make it difficult to determine the extent of the cybersecurity framework that is needed identifying the major weaknesses in us cybersecurity is an area of some controversy however some components appear to be sources of potentia lly significant risk because either major vulnerabilities have been identified or substantial impacts could result from successful attack in partic ular components that play cr itical roles in elements of critical infrastructure widely used commercial software organizational governance and the level of public knowledge nd perception about cybersecurity there are several options for broadly ddressing weaknesses in cybersecurity they include adopting standards and certif ication promulgating best practices and guidelines using benchmarks and checklists use of auditing improving training and education building security into enterprise architecture using risk management and using metrics these different appro aches all have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to how they mig ht contribute to the development of national framework for cybersecurity none of them are likely to be widely adopted in the absence of sufficient econo mic incentives for cybersecurity many observers believe that cyberspace has too many of the properties of commons for market forces alone to provide those incentives also current federal laws regulations and publicp rivate partnerships appear to be much narrower in scope than the policies called for in the national strategy to secure cyberspace and similar documents some recent laws do provi regulatory incentives for corporate management to address cybersecurity issues potential models for additional action include the response to the year2000 com puter problem and fe deral safety and environmental regulations congress might consider encouraging the widespread adoption of cybersecurity standards and best practices procuremen t leveraging by the federal government mandatory reporting of incident s the use of product liability actions the development of cybersecurity insurance and strengthened federal cybersecurity programs in the department of

attacks of september 2001 concerns had been rising among security experts about the vulnerab ilities to attack of computer systems and associated infrastructure there were severa l reasons for those rising concerns first computer systems were becoming increasingly powerful and increasingly interconnected with many enterprises in the public and private sectors coming to rely on them for fundamental business functions second the size and reach of the internet was growing dramatically not only were more and more businesses and households in the united states using th internet but the same phenomenon was happening worldwide third the number nd sophistication of attacks by criminals and vandals was growing and many expe rts thought that terrorists and other adversaries were preparing to launch attacks on computer systems via the internet or other means those trends have genera lly continued over the last several years yet despite increasing attention from federal and state governments and international organizations the defense ag ainst attacks on these systems has appeared to be generally fragmented and varying widely in effectiveness even with the establishment of the department of ho meland security by the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 with its consolid ation of several cybersecurity efforts within the information assurance and infrastructure protection directorate and the subsequent publication of the national strategy to secure cyberspace nssc1 concerns grew that more coordinated c oherent approach what might be called national cybersecurity framework2 was needed what such framework should consist of whom it should apply to and how it should be developed and implemented have remained uncertain several processes are underway that may contribute to the development of such framework ranging from some sector specific activities to proposals fo r federal legislation the i ssues associated with that development can be difficult to understand and address for seve ral reasons perhaps most notably because of the sheer size complexity and inte rconnectedness of the information infrastructure nd associated technology and applications the purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs2 of this report is to lend structure to the debate about those issues by examining some fundamental concepts and questi ons relating to framework national cybersecurity framework can be thought of as the essential set of public and privatesector efforts required to ensure an acceptable level of cybersecurity for the nation to be eff ective such framework would need to operate in at least four dimensions one perhaps the most obvious consists of the elements of cybersecurity it includes bot h the general approach eg goals best practices benchmarks standa rds and specific areas of focus such as technology process and people second dimensi on is the components of cyberspace what would be covered by the framework that includes both specific elements such as computer operating systems and internet servers and the sectors which would be involved third dimension is the method of application for example should the framework be required voluntary or ad hoc the fourth dimension is the functions and goals of the framework is its purpos to defend against crime to improve the environment for electronic commerce to protect critical infrastructure or some combination of those consensus proposal for cybersecurity framework has yet emerged and suggestions tend to focus on different appr oaches and components some of those emphasize cybersecurity policies and goals others procedures still others technology some stress standards others best practices or benchmarks and still others focus on guidelines this divers ity of possible approaches can complicate examination of the issues further complication may arise from the lack of consensus meanings for terms used to denote different approaches to examine what kind of framework may be needed and how it might be implemented it may be helpful to address three questions 1 where are the major cybersecurity weaknesses curren tly and where might weaknesses be anticipated in the future the term weaknesses as used here includes vulnerabilities and associated risks as those terms are usually understood but also other factors that mig ht negatively impact cybersecurity but might not usually be considered vulnerabilities or risks for example misperceptions about risks might be weakness weakness is major if failure to address it could realistically have significant national impact on the economy public safety or other cr itical services the assessment of weaknesses will also determine the goals of framework to significant extent 2 what are the major means of leverage for addressing those weaknesses these could include such approaches as the adoption of standards or best practices improvements in software engi neering investment in training and education or correcti on of market failures 3 what roles should government and the privat sector play in the use of those means of leverage to address curre nt and potential future weaknesses it might be for example that market forces are sufficient to address the concerns alternatively incentives might be needed to promote voluntary measures or regulation might be required among th policy options that congress could consider are encouraging broader use of cybersecurity standards and besthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs3 3 committee on national security systems cnss national security agency national information assurance ia glossary cnss instruction 4009 may 2003 httpwwwnstisscgovassetspdf4009pdf p 32 the glossary defines the 5 elements of ia as follows authentication security measure

the private sector using fe deral procurement pr actices to leverage general improvements in products and services encouraging mandatory reporting of security inci dents facilitating productliability acti ons in response to inadequate cybersecurity practi ces encouraging the development of cybersecurity insurance and strength ening federal cybersecurity programs this report addresses each of those ques tions in turn however before doing so it may be useful to discuss exactly wh at the term cybersecurity refers to what is cybersecurity one of the prerequisites for devel oping common national framework for cybersecurity is common understanding of what this and related terms mean achieving that can be difficult for several reasons perhaps the major one is complexity there are many compone nts of cyberspace and many potential components of framework variety of stakeholders will be involved with exposed to and in some cases predisposed to focus on different parts of cyberspace different elements of framework nd different approaches to security consequently attempts to create c oordinated national framework could be challenging another problem is that there appears to be generally accepted definition of cybersecurity and several diffe rent terms are in use that have related meanings for example information security is defined in some subsecti ons of federal copyright law to mean activities carried out in order to identify and address the vulnerabilities of government computer computer system or computer network 17 usc 1201e 1202d and in the federal information security management act fisma pl 107296 title x 44 usc 3532 as pro tecting information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction the term information assurance ia is also used one section of federal military law defines it to include computer and network security as well as any other information technology so designated by the secretary of defense 10 usc 2200e the national security agency nsa defines information assurance as measures that protect and defend in formation and information systems by ensuring their availability integrity authentication confidentiality and non repudiation these measures include providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection detection and reaction capabilities3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs4 3 continued availability timely reliable access to data and information services for authorized users p 5 confidentiality assurance that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals processes or devices p 15 integrity quality of an is information system reflecting the logical correctness and reliability of the operating system the logica l completeness of the hardware and software implementing the protection mechanisms and the consistency of the data structures and occurrence of the stored data note that in formal security mode integrity is interpreted more narrowly to mean protection against unauthorized modification or destruction of information p 34 nonrepudiation assurance the sender of data is pr ovided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the senders identity so neither can later deny having processed the data p 44 4 cnss ia glossary defines assurance as measure of confidence that the security features practices procedures and architecture of an is information system accurately mediates and enforces the security policy p 3 5 thomas c glaessner and others electronic safety and soundne ss securing finance in new age world bank working paper 26 washington dc the world bank february 2004 p 9 6 cyberspace is composed of hundreds of thous ands of interconnected computers servers routers switches and fiber optic cables that allow our critical infrastructures to work nssc p vii the nssc also says that cyberspace refers to an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures p 13 these are somewhat narrower meanings than used in this report assurance more generally refers to the level of confidence in the effectiveness of security4 also both information security and information assurance may not be limited to electronic systems but may refer more broadly to the protection of information or data in whatever format or medium it exists in the context of financial services electronic security or esecurity has been defined as follows esecurity can be described on the one hand as those policies guidelines processes and actions needed to enable electronic transactions to be carried out with minimum risk of breach intrusion or theft on the other hand esecurity is any tool technique or process used to protect systems information assetsesecurity enhances or adds value to an unprotected network and is composed of both soft and hard infrastructure soft infrastructure components are those policies processes protocols and guidelines that create the protective environment to keep the system and the data from compromise the hard infrastructure consists of the actual hardware and software needed to protect the system and its data from exte rnal and internal threats to security5 neither federal law nor the nssc define cybersecurity and the latter uses the term interchangeably with cyberspace s ecurity the implication presumably is that the former term is shorthand for the latter which is also not defined however in general usage cyberspace is more of metaphor than precise concept and it has different meanings in di fferent contexts the nssc uses it to refer to computers and the hardware connecting them6 in common parlance it is often used somewhat differently referring to kind of virtual space created by computer networks withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs5 7 one online definition is metaphor for describing the nonphysical terrain created by computer systems online systems for exampl create

different modes of transportation and delivery webopedia httpwwwwebopediacom termccyberspacehtml 21 march 2002 the term was coined in 1984 by sciencefiction writer william gibson who apparently intended it in his novel neuromancer to mean form of virtual reality created by worldwi set of interconnected computers and those who operated them 8 the term virtual structure as used here refers to the apparent or perceived organization or architecture created by or with inform ation technology hardware and software 9 the bipartisan bill which r eceived committee or floor action in the 108th congress further states i each of the terms damage and computer has the meaning that term has in section 1030 of title 18 united states code and ii each of the terms electronic communications system electronic communi cation service wire communication and electronic communication has the meaning th at term has in section 2510 of title 18 united states code 10 this difference can be seen in the ia glo ssary definition of an information system as set of information resources organized for th collection storage processing maintenance use sharing dissemination disposition displa or transmission of information cnss ia glossary p 33 which people and computers perform various activities such as email financial transactions data proce ssing and system control7 in this report cyberspace means the combination of the virtual structure8 the physical components that support it the information it contains and the flow of that information within it cybersecurity bill introduced in the 108th congress the department of homeland security cybersecurity enha ncement act hr 5068thornberry reintroduced in the 109th congress as hr 285 defines cybersecurity as the prevention of damage to the protection of and the restoration of computers electronic communications systems electronic communication services wire communication and electronic communication including information contained therein to ensure its availability integrity authentication confidentiality and nonrepudiation9 this proposed legislative definition is s imilar to the nsa definition of information assurance described above but with greater stress on communications systems10 also this definition emphasizes outcomes prevention protecti on and restoration rather than processes to achieve those outcomes the potential fuzziness of the term cybersecurity could be problem in the context of developing national framework to the extent that it impacts the ability of different stakeholders to reach agreement on elements of the framework however because information technology and cyberspace itself continue to evolve rapidly rigid definition would likely lose its utility quickly keeping the concept as flexible as possibl may be beneficial as it is commonly used cybersecurity appears to refer to three thingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs6 11 an example of this usage is cybersecurity plan can be impervious to concerted and intelligent attacks nssc p 3 12 patch is piece of software code inserted in to computer program to fix problem or bug in the program 13 for example increase the level of cybersecurity nationwide nssc p 2 this also appears to be the usage in hr 285 14 for example programs to advance th training of cybersecurity professionals nssc p 41 15 the government of the united kingdom is concerned enough about this issue that it has launched research program to discover ways to avoid catastrophic failures resulting from continued1 set of activities and other measures intended to protect from attack disruption or other threats computers computer networks related hardware and devices software and the inform ation they contain and communicate including software and data as well as other elements of cyberspace11 the activities can include security audits patch management12 authentication procedures access management and so forth they can involve for example examining and evaluating the strengths and vulnerabilities of the hardware and software used in the countrys political and economic electr onic infrastructure they also involve detection and reac tion to security events mitigation of impacts and recovery of affected co mponents other measures can include such things as hardware and software firewalls physical security such as hardened facilities nd personnel training and responsibilities 2 the state or quality of being protected from such threats13 3 the broad field of endeavor incl uding research and analysis aimed at implementing and improving those activities and quality14 the kinds of attack or disruption contempl ated are generally those originating with humans vandals criminals terrorists nationstates but other sources are possible such as accidents major weather events or earthquakes this threepart sense is how cybersecurity is used in this report in this usage information security information assurance esecurity and even cyberspace security as used in the nssc are aspects of but not synonymous with cybersecurity where are the major weaknesses in cybersecurity cyberspace is large somewhat amorphous and growing it is interconnected in ways that can be difficult to characterize or even identify it is also global and most of it is in the private sector theref ore thorough determin ation of what parts of and activities in cyberspace should nd even can be involved in national framework for cybersecurity is difficult to do the complexity of cyberspace and its components even within organizations make s it both difficult to test and to predict how systems will behave unde r unusual circumstances such as might arise from an unanticipated cyberattack15 however the issue can be made more tractable by firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs7 15 continued such emergent properties duncan grahamrowe sprawling systems teeter on it chaos new scientist 24 november 2004 httpwwwnewscientistcomnews newsjspidns99996706 16 see national research council information technology for counterterrorism washington dc national academy press 2003 p 1213 for related discussion the report characterizes attacks as potentially making system or network unavailable corrupted or compromised 17 malware contracted elision of malicious software includes viruses trojan horses worms logic bombs and any other computer code that has or is intended to have harmful effects identifying those components which if ccessfully attacked would yield damage that would be considered unacceptable to government andor the public from this perspective there appear to be th ree classes of attack to consider service disruption those which cause loss of service such as by making unavailable part of cybe rspace or activities that depend on it this could include for example loss of emergency or transportation communication systems or an extended unavailability of electronic financial transactions or utilities such as electricity this unavailability could result from disabling of networks through variety of attacks such as denial of service dos corruption or destruction of information such as financial records or destruction of physical infrastructure such as components of the internet backbone disruptions may be limite d to particular organization region or sector or they could be broader and even global in scope theft of assets those which involve th eft or other appropriation and subsequent misuse of critical information on large enough scale to have major impact such as on financial markets capture and control those which involve taking control of components of cyberspace and using them as weapons against other critical activities or elements of infrastructure such as using compromised home computers to launch dos attacks against one or more targets16 three main channels of attack also exist through cyberspace such as via worms or other malware17 by direct destruction or alteration of physical structure such as buildings or telecommunications lin or through inten tional or inadvertent actions by trusted insider these channels are not mutually exclusive and combination attacks are also possible b ecause cyberspace is constantly under attack albeit most often at low level and largely through the first channel and because most attacks produce damage which is either minimal or considered acceptable eg as cost of doing business by those ttacked higher threshold of impact might need to be reached before significant efforts at developing national cybersecurity framework would be considered worthwhile by many determining that threshold in particular the threshold for government action is not straightforward especially given that most publicly known cyberattacks to date fall into either nuisance orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs8 18 see crs report rl32331 the economic impact of cyberattacks 19 see crs report rl31534 critical infrastructure control systems and the terrorist threat the acronym scada is derived from the term supervisory control and data acquisition which refers to the function of those sy stems which are often used to control processes in industrial facilities and to log in formation about status and conditions they often communicate electronically with central computer systems that are connected to the internet 20 for example martin dodge and rob kitchin atlas of cyberspace boston addison wesley 2001 or martin dodge an atlas of cyberspaces httpwww cybergeographyorgatlasatlashtmlvandal category such as defacing websites or financial crime such as stolen credit card or personal identity information add itionally the costs of cyberattacks may be difficult to quantify further complicating the determination of that threshold18 in the absence of significant terro rist cyberattack the role th at government should play in ensuring specified national level of cybe rsecurity has been somewhat controversial yet policymakers are also keenly aware that before september 2001 most observers regarded major attack by foreign terrorists inside the united states an unlikely event in that context to identify areas worthy of particular attention it could be useful to discuss what parts of cyberspace might be in particular need of protection what components of cyberspace are at risk cyberspace as used in this report comprises huge range of elements arrayed worldwide given its size and comple xity reasonable question is whether cybersecurity framework is needed for all of cyberspace potentially daunting task or only for certain critical com ponents that are especially important or especially at risk cyberspace consists not only of the internet and computers connected to it but also any electronic system or device that is or can be connected either directly to the internet or indirectly through some other device or system as well as the mechanisms that connect th em these may include such things as automatic teller machines industria l control systems known as scadas19 and even telephone and other telecommunications systems these connections may be obvious or they may not thus not only is webenabled cellula r telephone part of cyberspace but so is desktop phone not only because it is part of the same worldwide telephone system as the cellu lar phone but also because that telephone system increasingly relies on computers and the internet to help manage traffic and for other purposes even computer with connection to the internet is part of cyberspace if it has way of communicating with other computers such as through floppy disks or other removable media cyberspace also includes the software that runs computers and their connections it includes the data stored on or generated by those computers and other devices and the transmission of those da ta to other computers and devices it includes cables routers serv ers networks the internet backbone and even satellites used in internet transmissions it even has its own atlases20 and sophisticated electronic mapping techniques to he lp manage networks and internethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs9 21 see

counterterrorism p 12 13 23 for example one definition of risk used by the national institute of standards and technology nist is combination of i the likelihood that particular vulnerability in an agency information system will be eith er intentionally or unintentionally exploited by particular threat resulting in loss of confid entiality integrity or availability and ii the potential impact or magnitude of harm that loss of confidentiality integrity or availability will have on agency operations including ssion functions and public confidence in the agency an agencys assets or individuals

mapping types of information and information syst ems to security categories nist special publication 800 60 version 10 december 2003 p 5 the same publication defines threat as any circumstance or event with the potential to inte ntionally or unintentionally exploit specific vulnerability in an information system resu lting in loss of confidentiality integrity or availability and vulnerability as flaw or weakness in the design or implementation of an information system including security procedures and security controls associated with the system that could be intentionally or unintentionally exploited to adversely affect an agencys operations including missions f unctions and public confidence in the agency an agencys assets or individuals includi ng privacy through loss of confidentiality integrity or availability p 5communications these show that even the virtual dimension of cyberspace is highly structured and often in wa ys that may not be obvious21 in addition to the components of cybe rspace per there are supplementary elements that can be critical with respect to cybersecurity perhaps most notable are buildings and other structures within wh ich the physical components of cyberspace are contained and people w ith access to cy berspace an effective cybersecurity framework needs to take such elements into account it might be useful to consider the va rious physical components associated with cyberspace as cyberspace infrastructure this can be conveniently categorized into four segments internet hardware lecommunications infra structure embedded computing devices such as control system s and dedicated computing devices such as desktop computers22 virtual cyberspace the electronic information that is stored in and flows through the phy sical components could be called cyberspace superstructure virtually any element of cyberspace can at least in theory pose some level of cybersecurity risk which is generally thought of as combined assessment of threat vulnerability and impact23 that gives measure of the overall potential for harm from vulnerability if corrective action is taken threat can have several different meanings but in this report it refers to possible attack for example the threat of denialofservice attack desc riptions of threats often in clude both the nature of the possible attack and those who might perpetrate it as well as the capabilities of potential attackers and may include some description of the possible consequences if the attack is successful vulnerability usually refers to weakness that an attack might exploit how an attack could be accomplished analysis of threats andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs10 24 see for example national institute of standards and technology risk management guide for information technology systems nist special pub lication 80030 october 2001 p 25 25 cybercrime is usually distinguished from cyberterrorism just as crime is usually distinguished from terrorism although the distinction is sometimes muddled in usage generally they are distinguished based on the aim of the activity cybercrimes generally refers to crimes committed using informati on technology especially the internet for personal gain and cyberterrorism refers to crimes involving information technology that are performed for political ends 26 an increased reliance on technology calates the potential for and the likelihood of esecurity threats furthermore attack s occur more often and with polymorphic approach due largely in part to organized crim and terrorism the speed and tenacity of the hacking community is growing at rapid rat the world bank integrator group global continuedvulnerabilities when combined can lead to an assessment of risk statements of risk often combine both the probability of ccessful attack and some measure of its likely impact the nature and magnitude of economic and other outcomes of successful attack managing risks may involve veral kinds of activities defense refers to how system is protected from attack nd is often discu ssed in terms of countermeasures or controls elements may include prevention 2 which involves reducing vulnerabilities and implementing other measures to deter attacks detection which involves identifying and characterizing an attempted att ack either as it occurs or afterward and countering sometimes also called res ponse which involves taking corrective measures in response to an attack to stop it or reduce its impact response and recovery refer to how and how well damage is mitigated and repaired and information and functionality are recovered in the event of successful attack risks are often characterized qualitatively as high medium or low24 the level of risk varies among diffe rent components of cyberspace and some may therefore deserve more attention than others in th development of an effective framework some components are considered to be par ticularly vulnerable some are viewed by different groups of attackers as particularly tempting targets and some would if compromised have particularly large impacts these may not however all translate into high risk for exampl target could be highly vulnerable but under little threat and with very limited impact resulting from any successful attack in contrast moderately vulnerable target under moderate threat w ith moderate impact from successful attack could eas ily be assessed as being at much higher risk identifying what are the major weaknesses in us cybersecurity is an area of some controversy while there seems to be general agreement on some problems such as software vulnerability and the increasing levels of cybercrime others have in fact remained controversial even the question of how much of concern cyberterrorism as opposed to cybercrime25 should be has been matter of some dispute however terrorists may also engage in cybercrime such as theft fraud extortion or money laundering to finance their efforts there also appear to be increasing concerns among some observers about the possibility of growing nexus among hackers organized crime and terrorists26 therefore separating considerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs11 26 continued dialogue electronic safety and s oundness september 10 2003 summary p 2 of those activities in discussions of cybersecurity might not be appropriate at least in some cases there appear to be certain candidate components of cybers pace and associated activities that are sources of potentially significant risk because either major vulnerabilities have been identified or substantial impacts could result from successful attack they are components that play critical roles in elements of cr itical infrastructure this could include for example computer control systems such as scadas used in the chemical and energy industries and the internet infra structure another example is information held by fina ncial services industrie s that could be stolen electronically or otherwise compromised software in particular widely used computer programs such as operating systems can be vulnerable to various forms of compromise resulting for example in information theft or use of the compromised system as weapon of attack this kind of vulnerability has perhaps received more public attention than any other given that it affects virtually all owners and users of desktop systems cybersecurity governance many observers have expressed concerns that corporations and other organizations including some involved in critical infrastructur sectors see below have not developed governance mechanis ms sufficiently responsive to cybersecurity needs weaknesses have been cited with respect to several aspects of cybersecurity governance including policies procedures and pers onnel management public knowledge and perception observers who have expressed concern about the risk of major cy berattacks from terrorists or other criminals have in many cases pointed to lack of public awareness about the risk as weakness both with respect to lack of knowledge about the steps individuals need to take to defend against attacks and the need for national public nd privatesector effort while other potential weakne sses could be identified for example security of current internet protocols emergenc communications or buildings housing key internet servers or central exchanges know n as peering points discussion here will be limited to the four cases bove because of their relevan ce to the issue of national framework

is probably impossible and certainly impractical to secure all of it if for other reason than its global nature but even within the united states the complexities are daunting one of the fundamental tenets of cybersecurity is that simple system is much easier to secure than complex one and cyberspace is extraordinarily complex determining the elements of cyberspace that should be the focus of

hackers hoping to find vulnerab ilities or to continuedemergency services were apparently not anticipated by security experts nor probably by the authors of the worms42 the design of software can have significant effect on its vulnerability to malware43 both the complexity of the code and the way it is designed can have an impact it is general principle of computer security that the more complex piece of software is the more vulnerable it is to attack that is because more complex code will have more places that malw are can be hidden and more potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited and is more difficult to analyze for security problems in fact attackers often discover and exploit vulnerabilities that were unknown to the developer software code that is not welldesigned from security perspective is more likely than welldesigned code to have weaknesses that could be exploited as well as places for malware to be hidden fu rthermore many experts argue that it is impossible with current engineering methods to anticipate all possible weaknesses and points of attack for complex software however code can be designed so as to minimize such vulnerabilities and welldeveloped procedures have been established to accomplish this goal44 some of those procedures can even be applied to older legacy systems good security design invol ves not only the code itself but also the process by which it is veloped and evaluated until recently widely used software was not for the most part developed with security as major goal that was at least in part because it was not clear that in the absence of significant breaches consumers would pay for the extra cost that can be involved in developing mo re secure software some experts believe that publicly disclosed or opensource

june 2001 availa ble at httpnsa2 wwwconxionc omsupport guidessd1pdf sometimes these three elements are referred to as people process and technologyopensource software is more secure because the open review process is more thorough and can identify more potential security flaws than is possible with proprietary code advocates of closedsource code argue in cont rast that proprietary code makes potential flaws more difficult to discover and therefore to exploit and that it improves security by providing mo re control over the personnel technology and processes involved in velopment and maintenance of the code since malware has been created for opensource as well as closedsource systems and since hackers are generally expected to focus on more popul ar systems which are currently closed source the relative security strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches have not been firmly established however appro aches to improving security that could be applied broadly to different kinds of software woul d likely be beneficial problems with organizational governance many observers have expressed cerns that corporations and other organizations have not developed suffici ently responsive governance mechanisms to address cybersecurity needs it is generally accepted that sound cybersecurity involves focus on three elements technology operati ons and personnel46 successful implementation of all three elem ents requires active involvement by those involved in the governance of an organization the technology component focuses on the development acquisition and implementation of hardware and software organizations have often been criticized for focusing too heavily on this component the perfect technology like the pe rfect lock is an attractive but elusive security goal the operations component focuses on po licies and procedures including such processes as certification access controls management and assessments the personnel component focuses on clear commitment to security by an organizations leadership ssignment of appr opriate roles and responsibilities impleme ntation of physical and personnel security measures to control and monitor access training that is appropriate for the level of access and responsibility and accountability focus that is not properly balanced among the three elements may create vulnerabilities thus even an excelle nt security technology will be minimally effective if it is not properly implement ed and used which requires appropriate governance mechanisms throughout the organization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs17 47 these are defined in fism 44 usc 3542 as follows integrity guarding against improper information modification or dest ruction including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity confidentiality preserving authorized restricti ons on access and disclosure including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information availability ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information others define these terms somewhat differe ntly see for example national research council trust in cyberspace washington dc nationa l academy press 1999 p 301303307 and footnote 3 above but the meaning is similar 48 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 45 in reference to isoiec 13335 information tec hnology security techniques guidelines for the management of it security gmits key aspects of governance weaknesses have been cited with respect to several aspects of cybersecurity governan ce generally effective governance for cybersecurity would be expected to involve establishing clear and measurable goals strategies for achieving those goals and policies and procedures to implement those strategies these would involve not only operations but pe rsonnel management including the establishment of appr opriate roles and responsibilities and accountability for them throughout the orga nization as well as recruitment and training these aspects of governance are discussed in some detail below because governance is considered by many to be among the most important and complex weaknesses to address goals any meaningful framework for cy bersecurity should arguably include clear description of its goals the desired results or state di fferent kinds of goals might be set and some would likely be more useful than others for example goal might focus only on limiting the number and kinds of attacks that occur this would have the benefit of being hi ghly tangible and is clearly desired state but the relationship between this goal and the other components of the framework may be difficult to determine since the number of attempted attacks is determined to significant extent by the attackers low rate of attack does not necessarily reflect effective security in addition this kind of goal could create perverse incentives since for example attacks might be re duced by limiting connectivity or computing power which would often be c ounterproductive that is not to say that such goal is not valuable but rather that it must be properly developed and characterized one wellestablished approach is to identify functional goals such as those that relate to maintenance of particular level of operation or performance as opposed to those that focus on prevention of attacks or protection of systems three functional goals are commonly described for information security integrity availability and confidentiality47 additional goals such as accountability authenticity reliability and nonrepudiation may be added to these basic ones for some applications48 broader functional goal co mmonly discussed is trustw orthiness which has been defined as assurance

2002 p 8they will continue to produce expected behavior and will not be susceptible to subversion49 such functional goals have the benefit of being appli cable not only with respect to cyberattacks but also to other sources of potential disruption such as weather events however the goals are complex and it may be difficult to find ways to map them on to other elements of framework50 it is useful to distinguish goals at di fferent levels nati onal sectoral and organizationspecific the nssc outlines three strategic objectives for the nation prevent cyber attacks against americas critical infrastructures reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks and minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur51 those objectives while clearly desirable in concept may be criticized as somewhat vague and it is not clear how to determine whether they have been successfully met measuring prevention of cyberattacks suffers from the difficulties mentioned in the previous paragraph it is not clear how much of reduction in vulnerability would indicate success or what it means to minimize damage and recovery time the nssc recommends set of actions but doe s not provide roadmap or other mechanism for assessing those actions agains t the goals presumably such linkages would be made through subse quent work by federal agencies and the private sector in general however national goals and objec tives will of necessity be broad in nature and might best be considered concepts th at individual sectors and organizations can use to help them develop more specific goals and objectives sectorspecific goals will necessarily vary depending on the mission and focus of the sector for example federal goal s must be responsive to unique governmental security needs and requirements chemi calsector goals would address security of process controls and physical plants among other things52 organizationspecific goals would be expected to be more clos ely tailored to the i ndividual requirements of each organization whatever focus they take set of ef fective goals should arguably have the following characteristics among others progress toward the goals should be

responding to results of those measurements provide for flexibility and adaptation to changing conditions principles many discussions of cybersecur ity include statements or lists of principles which

this and subsequent policy levels are after nist generally accepted principles p 13 15 61 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 59 policies policy is essentially set of rules governing how cybersecurity strategies will be app lied policies can usefully be thoug ht of in terms of levels missionlevel policy lays out broad direction nd guidance for an enterprise for example the nssc states it is the policy of the united states to prevent or minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructures and thereb protect the people the economy the essential human and government services and the national security of the united states disruptions that do occur should be infrequent of minimal duration and manageable and cause the least damage possible the policy requires continuous effort to secure informati on systems for critical infrastructure and includes voluntary publicprivate part nerships involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations59 programlevel policy provides rules for specific program or set of activities60 such policies often include th assets to be protected goals organizational respons ibilities and complian ce parameters includi ng penalties systemlevel policy provides rules for securing particular system or subsystem these policies often are base d on technical and risk anal yses and vary from system to system depending on requirements an issuelevel policy provides rules for particular issue or area of concern such as how to handle email attachments such policies often cover obj ectives responsibilities and comp liance this kind of policy is likely to require frequent updating in re sponse to changes in technology and other factors the cybersecurity policies of an organization serve to provide guidance in meeting stated goals and can also provide incentives or remove disincentives for certain behavior for example wh ether or not employees report suspected security breaches may depend in part on the kind of policy the organization has with respect to them if the policy does not encourage reporting then employees may be reluctant to do so because of concerns bout potential repercussi ons also policies often set expectations with respect to res ource allocation if cybersecurity is high policy priority then it would ordinarily be expected to be high budget priority as well mismatch between an organization s policy and its behavi or may have legal ramifications61 procedures procedures can be thought of as specifications of how to perform specific actions methodologies or processes ideally cybersecurity procedures would be designed to impleme nt cybersecurity policies and strategies they may include for example steps to take in configuring networks to minimize the risk of successful intrusions actions to take when an intrusion occurs including how to report it and methods for evaluating potential security risks of prospective employees although many procedur may be common across different organizations or even sectors they will lik ely in general be the most customized and organizationspecific of governance components httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs22 62 for example one kind of attack involves sending victims email purportedly from legitimate financial or software company and urging them to visit website also purportedly of this company where they are requested to enter information such as usernames and passwords for accounts the hacker can then use this information to take control of the victims computer or to steal funds 63 karen fogerty chief

66 nssc p 41personnel the components of cybersecu rity governance discussed above apply to personnel as well as operations according to some observers people are the most important of the three fundamental ements of cybersecurity it is they who must implement security policies and proce dures and defend against any attacks if they are not adequately skilled and trained they may be unable to prevent detect and react to security breaches and they may themselves be more vulnerable to social engineering attack which involves finding and exploiting weaknesses in how people interact with computer systems62 in addition it can be par ticularly difficult to defend against attack by an insider so back ground checks and other controls to minimize that risk are especially important these considerations may be even more critical for services that are outsourced in wh ich case direct control over personnel is substantially reduced according to some observers such trust ed insiders pose the most significant threat to an organizations cybersecurity63 it is generally held that effective governance for cybersecurity requires strong commitment from an organizations leadership at the level of the chief executive officer the board of directors or the equi valent this may be especially important because returns on investment in security may be difficult to measure64 the lack of clear return on investment may create pressures to underinvest some evidence suggests that such underinvestment is an issue for many organizations65 this may be especially true for small to midsized privatesector entities and for state and local government agencies if roles responsibilities and accountab ility are not clear and appropriate which might be the case if for example an organization has overall cybersecurity policy structure that can create significant vulnerabilities classic case is where responsibilities are too widely distributed work ers may assume that an issue is being addressed by others who share the responsib ilities with the result being that the issue is not properly addr essed by anyone another area of concern with respect to personnel is training development

public knowledge and perception given widespread publicity about cybera ttacks and the repeated revelations of new threats and vulnerabilities much of the public appears to be aware of and concerned

not well prepared to take necessary defensive measures there are several possible reasons for this lack of preparedness including the following cybersecurity currently involve s greater level of technical proficiency than many peopl feel comfortable with cyberattacks are comparatively easy to hide73 many victims may be unaware of an intrus ion unless it results in financial fraud or theft and that would likely be disc overed well after the intrusion occurred74 both technology and threats evolve and user training and education may not keep pace many organizations underreport cy berattacks and other security incidents for several reasons in cluding concerns about negative impacts on public confidence in the organization75 there are significant economic disincentives for investing in cybersecurity most notably cybersecurity is preventive not profit making cyberattacks are comparatively rare and effects may be distributed for example co mpromised computer may be used as means of launching an attack against targets rather than being target itself in addition the degree to which cybera ttacks pose serious homeland security risk is matter of some dispute while many experts believe that major cyberattack by terrorists or other adversar ies is substantial risk othe rs believe that those risks are exaggerated and that the major concern is cybercrime as with other terrorist incidents public perception will probably continue to be shaped to significant degree by the extent of public knowledge bout any major attacks that do occur what are the major means of leverage the above discussion illustra tes the depth of the cha llenge faced in developing effective cybersecurity it also show s the diversity ubiquity and importance of cyberspace components and demonstrates

soundness p 26and complexity one approach would be to restrict ttention to those components associated with particularly high levels of risk two limits to such an approach are first focus solely on those com ponents known currently to be at high risk could quickly become obsolete while there are currently many known vulne rabilities which if addre ssed would substantially improve cybersecurity future or curre ntly undiscovered vul nerabilities may come from unexpected places cybercr iminals and cyberterrorists would likely seek out new vulnerabilities as current ones are eliminated write rs of nuisance viruses have been doing that for several years in many ways cybersecurity involves kind of arms race with adversaries and defe nders each adapting successively to actions by the other this arms race is likely to continue as long as information technology and cyberspace continue to evolve at current and expected rates second some would argue that such fo cus would simply be an extension of the current fragmented approach which is largely reactive as each new vulnerability is discovered new fix is developed and increasingly costly and ineffective what is needed they say is strategic approach that is more preventive or even preemptive in nature rather than largely reactive and defensive76 some argue that the best approach is to redu ce the incentives for catastrophic attack77 rather than focusing on preventing all attacks if ex perience with cyberspace so far is any indication this may be impossi ble or certainly impractical such an approach would suggest focus on 1 limiting damage and 2 recovery to be effective any preventive appro ach should probably be broadly applicable to different organizations and systems the interconnectedness of cyberspace gives it some of the characteristics of commons kind of public resource for which in the absence of appropriate controls co sts of use by any i ndividual are distributed broadly to the community of users classically using limited resource such as pastureland or fishery as commons promotes overuse and degradation of the resource it pays each individual to ma ximize his or her use of the resource to graze as many cattle or catch as many fish as possible matter the consequences to the resource as whole this effect has been called the tragedy of the commons78 in cyberspace costs of poor s ecurity are often distributed because compromised systems may be used in attacks on others with little impact on the compromised system see above in addition however those costs may be amplified naive user may compromise the integrity of an entire network79 there are several options for broadly addressing weaknesse s in cybersecurity such as those discussed in the previous section the following options

definition of standards is prescribed set of rules conditions or requirements concerning definitions of terms classification of components specification of materials performance or operations delineation of procedures or measurement of quantity and quality in describing ma terials products systems services or practices80 as this rather eclectic definition illustrates there are many different kinds of standards81 they may be classified according to purpos eg product process testing or interface standards they can also be classified according to their focus commonly distinction is made between performance standards which focus on function and design standards which speci fy features dimensions or other such characteristics third classification is based on how standard s are developed and implemented they may be developed through consensu s or some other process they may be implemented voluntarily or th ey may also be imposed for example by law and therefore mandatory volunt ary consensus standards are common and federal law encourages their use by federal agencies including dhs82 standards may also be open or proprietary but diffe rent observers defi ne open standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs27 83 some appear to consider the term to be essentially synonymous with voluntary consensus standards others believe that it should embrace such additional concepts as open use which essentially means use without royalties or licensing restrictions see ken krechmer the principles of open standards standards engineering 506novemberdecember 1998 p 16

referred to as st andards there are aspects of them that are not easily characterized as standards at least according to some observers the notion of criteria is broader than that of standards because it generally includes things such as statements on how syst em should be designed and operated that cannot be directly assesse d by examining the product105 also protection profiles are not written into the cc but are veloped and updated as needed code of practice several standards have been developed rela ting to overall information security practices they might be used in conjunction with other guides such as the cc as elements of an overall framework for cybersecurity there appears to be at least some agreement that good security management standard should cover all important security issues be comprehensive and uptodate be clear unambiguous and easy to understand and use be practical and achievable be scalable to any organization and provide basis for measurement of performance106

the standard was issued in 2000 and revision began in 2001 it is based on and virtually identical to the 1999 update of the british standard in information security bs 7799 part 1 which wa s initially published in 1995112 while called standard isoiec 17799 has been desc ribed as more similar to set of guidelines in that it is not written in such way that conformance can be certified113 the standard contains 127 major controls and thousands of bits of guidance but they are not presented as imperatives114 thus organizations may adapt the standard to their needs modifying the application of some sections to fit their management structure or discar ding sections that do not apply115 this flexibility has been both praised and criticized on th one hand it means that organizations can use the standard without compromising ot her key business requirements on the other hand it makes conformance more difficult to assess116 while isoiec 17799 does not itself in clude certification scheme some

standards the widespread use of well established and welldesigned cybersecurity standards would have potential benefits such standards would provide common nguage and criteria for determining how well organizations are adhering to recogniz ed security needs and requirements in addition as the use of the standards incr eased the overall level of security would arguably rise as well also the standards would presumably provide common baseline from which continuous improvement in cybersecurity could be implemented through the evolution of the standards however the use of standards in cybersecurity has also been criticized by some some common criticisms are described below they are not sufficiently flexible and cannot track changes in the technology international standards are of ten updated on three to fiveyear cycle given the rate of evolution of cyberspace some obs ervers have complained that standards become outdated too quickly to be useful for cybersecurity proponents counter that properly developed standards are in fact sufficiently flexible that they can accommodate the technological improveme nts that are likely to occur between revisions international st andards such as iso 17799 are often revised on three to fiveyear cycle both c obit and the isf standard are updated on twoyear cycle the common criteria development board is charged with issuing updates and corrections to the cc137httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs35 137 continued httpniapnistgovccschemeinterpsprocesshtml 138 see for example subcommittee on technol ogy information policy

september 2003 httpreformhousegovtiprchearingseventsingleaspx eventid527 they can be expensive to conform to if certification is available as with bs 7799 part 2 the process of becoming certifie d may be expensive especially for smaller enterprises even without certifi cation organizations adopting standards may find they need to significantly alter business practices possibly at considerable expense and sometimes in ways that are not in keeping with the optimum business model for the particular enterprise proponents counter that while return on investment may be difficult to measure directly the process of coming into compliance can help organizations iden tify and correct serious cybersecurity deficiencies and protect them from large expenditures to recover from success attack or from loss of reputation that can be very difficult to regain they are too much like regulation if adherence to par ticular set of standards becomes expected then certification bodies might take on some of the characteristics of regulators with the ttendant benefits nd disadvantages proponents may counter that such need not be the case especially if the standards and certification are well designed there are sufficient alternative paths to certification to avoid the development of effective m onopolies and compliance is voluntary as it is with most standards the mixed success of the common criteria illustrates some of these reported pitfalls these include lack of flexibility despite attempts to build flexibility into the cc the inability to keep pace with evolving tec hnology and cost and time required for certification138 measuring success may be difficu lt for codeofpractice standards high level codeofpractice sta ndards such as isoiec 17799 have been criticized for not being specific enough to provide sufficient guidance or sufficient common basis for measuring and comparing practices among different organizations at the same time bs 7799 part 2 has been criticized for being too much of checklist and insufficiently adaptable to different kinds of enterpri ses proponents counter that such critics misunderstand the application of the standards that comparable metrics can be developed nd that certification can readily be adapted to the requirements of particul ar enterprise cc c obit and other standards have been criticized for being difficult to scale especially to the needs of smaller organizations that may not have primary it focus attempts have been made to compensate for this problem for example itgi has developed form of c obit specifically designed for smaller enterpri ses despite such concerns the advantages of codeof practice and other cybersecurity standards appear to be sufficient that their use is increasing see below

force rfc 3160 au gust 2001 http www ietforgtaohtmlthe development process may be cumbersome some of the criticisms associated with standards result from the pa rticular methods by which most standards are developed for example the ansi process includes consensus on proposed standard by group or consensus body that includes representa tives from materially affected and interested pa rties broadbase d public review and comment on draft standards consideration of and response to comments submitted by voting members of the relevant consensus body and by pub lic review commenter s incorporation of approved changes into draft standard and right to appeal by any participant that believes that due process pr inciples were not sufficiently respected during the standards development in accordance with the ansiaccredited procedures of the standards developer139 the designated consensus body is required to be balanced with regard to different interests consensus does not require unanimity but does require substantial agreementby directly and materially affected interestsand that all views and objections be considered and that an ffort be made toward their resolution140 this process which may require several meetings ensures that the interests of all involved pa rties are taken into account but it can be slow and may require compromises that can lead to more complex standards in contrast the internet engineering task force ietf develops standards through process that is performed largely online interested parties form working group to identify the scope of the standard and begin developing it participation in the working group is completely open to an yone interested but there is active attempt to guarantee balance among different interests drafts of the standard are posted online and comments incorporated once the group reaches rough consensus defined as agreement by v ery large majority of the working group141 the draft is sent to the internet engi neering steering group iesg for independent review by experts after successfully passing review the draft may become standard through some additi onal steps according to some observers the use of fully open online process rough consensu s and independent review results in cleaner standards and more rapid process than the more traditional approach taken by most standards bodies certification certification usually refers to formal approval by some entity such as laboratory that product pr ocess or person meets speci fied set of criteria for example an elect rical product may be certified as meeting safety standards physician may be certified as meeting particular level of competency in an area of specialization the certifying entity may be accredited by recognized authority such as

of practice standards for example products can be certified under the cc as discussed above other product evaluation certifi cations have also been developed for instance the technology group for the financial services roundtable bits runs security certification program for products used by the financial services industry144 the criteria used follow the general scheme laid out in the cc for code of practice certification is available in many countries including the united states under bs7799 part 2 the number of those certifica tions has been increasing substantially especially in asia145 with more than 800 organizati ons certified worldwide although only few in the united states146 professional certification is also ava ilable from some organizations for example the information systems udit and control association isaca147 offers certification for information security auditors and managers and the international information systems security certification consortium148 offers certification for information security professionals such certifications usually require several years of relevant profe ssional experience successful completion of an examination process adherence to c ode of conduct and continui ng education in the field strengths and weakn esses of certification certification can be an important component of any atte mpt to adhere to set of established standards that is because it provides means of independent verification that criteria set by the standards have been met many of the criticisms of standard s discussed above and counters to them can be applie d to certification as well the strengths and weaknesses of certification can be illustrated by isoiec 17799 and the cc if certification were available for isoiec 17799 companies that claim to have adopted it could demonstrate that they have been assessed by an independent accredited body as conforming to its require ments however they would not be free to adapt the standards however they wished to their particularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs38 149 see also the section below on measuring success 150 national survey on computer crime and security conducted for the last several years has found little change in reporting of incidents by organizations experiencing intrusions with about half of all participating organiza tions responding that they did not report them with most of those citing concerns about reput ation risk as primary reason for not reporting gordon 2004 csifbi survey p 13 151 see for example nist generally accepted principles and practicesoperating situations and needs produc t certified under the cc can be used with confidence in the kinds of environments to which the certification applies however the certification process is expensive and timeconsuming increasing the costs of the products and potentially impeding the adoption of newer technologies there also does not appear to have b een any systematic assessment of the effectiveness of certificati on under standards such as bs7799 part 2 with respect to improving cybersecurity that may be in part because the certification has been available for only few years there are at least two ways that success could be measured and that differe nt standards and methods of compliance could be compared149 first the incidence of security problems including but not limited to attacks would be expected to be lower for organizations using the most effective standard and compliance method that m easure may be hard to use as long as organizations are reluctant to reveal secur ity breaches or other problems as has been reported150 another more indirect metric w ould be the relative success of different certifications presumably an organization that finds particular certification to be effective would be more likely to rene w it or to purchase additional products certified under it than switch to another or discontinue use however other factors such as cost can also influence the relative success of different certification regimes best practices best practices often refers to strategies polic ies procedures and other action related elements of cybersecurity that are generally accepted as being the most successful or costeffective such practices can be identified for virtually any of the elements of cybersecurity framework from goals to specific procedures or specifications unfortunately there does not appear to be any overall agreement on what constitutes best practice the term implies that the practice in question has been assessed as being superior to all others but the basis of such assessments if provided usually appears at best to be consensus among experts rather than rigorous empirical comparison of alternativ in fact it is not uncommon in the literature for set of best practices to be asserted with description of what criteria were used to identify them as best given the vagueness associated with the use of this term it might be more appropriate to refer instead to commonly accepted or generally accepted practices at least where there is evidence to that effect151 what is called set of best practices can vary greatly in content and method of development at one extreme are standa rds developed throug h wellestablishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs39 152 see nric nric best practices http wwwbelllabscomuserkrauschernric 13 september 2004

the code of pr actices contained in isoiec 17799 or c obit at the other extreme set of best practices might simply be recommendations from one person published in newsletter article best pr actices may be developed specifically for one sector or industry for example the network reliability and interoperability counc il nric has devel oped set of more than 150 cybersecurity best practices for the communications industry152 most of these are fairly general such as disable unnecessary services but some are much more specific however they are intended to address classes of problems rather than providing detailed fixes to specific problems nric us ed an industry consensus approach to develop them stressing that practice is included only after sufficient rigor and deliberation including discussions among experts and stakeholders about whether the practice is implemented widely enough its effectiv eness and feasibility the risk associated with failing to implement it and alternatives nric proposes that these practices be used as recommendations and not as requirements and that they be adapted to the individual needs of the orga nization using them in another example the asp industry consortium produced t of white papers prepared by the consortiums security subcommittee that in clude about 25 best practices for network and platform security153 the practices described are fairly general such as use remote access sparingly the methodology by which they were developed is not described another group of best practices with relevance to cybersecurity is known as capability maturity models cmm essentially these are practices arranged along hierarchy of maturity levels designed to help organizations identify the level at which they operate processes for the development of soft ware and other products and to improve those processes by successively improving to higher levels of maturity154 the system has been developed as joint publicprivate partnership initiated by the department of defense in the 1980s one example is cleanroom software engineering procedures based on math ematical verification of designs and statistical testing of systems that are designed to produce highly reliable software that has minimum of errors and vulnerabilities for applications where security considerations are priority techniques have been devel oped to engineer systems to the appropriate level of security corre sponding to the specific needs for the application such systems are designed w ith carefully specified requirements and are thoroughly reviewed and test ed before implementation155httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs40 156 information systems security association generally accepted information security principles version 30 2004 p 2 gaisp is ccessor to an earlier effort called generally accepted system security principles 157 see for example federal accounting st andards advisory board generally accepted accounting principles httpwwwfasabgovacceptedhtmlbest practices would not necessarily be associated with certification or audit process so it can be difficult to determine if an organization is in fact conforming to them effectively however they generally provide degree of flexibility and adaptability that may not be available with more formal approaches furthermore they may be easier to update in respons to the rapid evolution of technology cyberspace and the threat environment guidelines guidelines may be thought of as general recommendations relating to elements of cybersecurity they are not necessarily associated with any particular methodology or criteria in cont rast to standards and at leas t in theory best practices other than the authority of those making the recommendations one commonly cited set of guidelines is the guidelines for the security of information systems and networks of the organization for economic cooperation and development first adopted in 1992 and most recently revised in 2002 the nine basic principles contained in the guidelines are intended to provide foundation for the development of culture of security the principles focus on the importance of awareness of and responsibility for security the importa nce of timely responsiveness to security incidents the role of ethical considerati ons and democratic values the need for risk assessments security as an essential design element for information systems the need for comprehensive security manage ment and the importance of continual review and reassessment many of these principles are also reflected in other documents including isoiec 17799 generally accepted information security principles gaisp is an attempt to draw together hierarchical set of principles that have been reviewed by experts in information security and that meet specified criteria the project was initiated by the information systems security association an international nonprofit association of information security professionals gai sp consists of pri nciples standards conventions and mechanisms that informa tion security practitioners should employ that information processing products s hould provide and that information owners and organizational governance should ac knowledge to ensure the security of information and information systems156 it is intended to provide basis for self regulation for the profession analogous to the generally accepted accounting principles gaap used by ce rtified public accountants157 the hierarchical approach aims to provide guidance that can be applied at various levels within an organization from executive governance to da ily management of security risks basel principles the financial services sector has been among the leaders in developing and implementing components of cybersecurity framework the basel committee on banking supervision has released set of guidelines called riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs41 158 the document was released in july 2003 and is available at httpwwwbisorgpubl bcbs98htm 159 among them are authentication nonrepudia tion segregation of duties authorization data access controls encryption recovery intrus ion detection protection of data

pcigcightml for the federal governmentmanagement principles for electronic banking 158 while seven of the fourteen principles and practices scribed in the document relate to security controls159 the basel principles are particularly notable for the degree to which they stress the importance of institutional leadership and the management of legal and reputational risk in the context of cybersecurity for example the first three principles place responsibility for active oversight of cybe rsecurity management directly on boards of directors and senior mana gement the principles rela ting to legal and reputational risk focus on information disclosure protec tion of customer data including privacy and continuity of service the difference between guidelines and best practices is not perhaps as distinct as the difference between either of those and standards while guidelines may provide even greater flexibility and adaptability than best practices their general lack of specificity may make effective implementation more challenging as with best practices guidelines would not necessarily be associated with certification or audit process so it might be difficult to determin if an organization is in fact conforming to them effectively benchmarks and checklists fundamentally benchmark is simply reference point against which performance is measured it might be used as goal or it might be considered level of minimum acceptable performance the latter might also be called baseline with respect to computers benchmark of ten refers to test used to compare one or more aspects of performance of system such as processing speed with other systems or with specified level of function with respect to cybersecurity the terms benchmarks and checklists are more often used to denote sets of security configurations and settings that are recommended to achieve specified level of security one wellknown set provides minimum security configurations for th microsoft windows 2000

organizations that have participated benchmarks and checklists can be an important element of cybersecurity framework but are by their nature very specific and limited in scope also some confusion may result from the occasional use of the term as synonym for standards auditing auditing is often thought of as formal examination of fi nancial or accounting records but it is also used in broa der sense such as to denote independent examination of an organizati ons adherence to established controls policies or legal requirements166 an organization may undergo for example security audit of its information systems that may involve an examination of hardware software procedures configurations environment and user pr actices an audit may be performed by the organization itself or it may be performe d by an independent auditor usually firm that specializes in accounting and auditing audits usually follow set of established practices nd procedures such as the statement on auditing standards 70 known as sas 70 issued by the auditing standards board of the american institute of certified public ccountants aicpa167 information security audit guides have also been developed for government agencies168 an audit usually involves testing of controls and results in report that includes the opinion of the auditor about the adequacy of the controls examined with recommendations for

percent of electronic security intrusions are carried out by insiders an uneducated or undereducated workforce is inherently more vulnerable to this type of incident or attack in contrast welltrained

uditors may be expected to conform to established standards in the conduct of an audit169 auditing methods and requirements are most well develope d with respect to financial and accounting processes as result some audits might tend to underemphasize aspects of cybersecurity that are not related to those processes the results of audits might also vary sign ificantly among different auditors the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 re quires audits of financial controls including information security controls for publicly traded companies training and education if as some observers believe people are the most important element of effective cybersecurity then training and education should be an important means of leverage to improve cybersecurity inadequate cybe rsecurity practices by users it personnel and even corporate leadership have been widely cited as major vulnerability170 the nssc lists national cyberspace security awareness and training as one of its top five priorities elements include comprehensive national awareness program and support for training education and professiona l certification171 the national cyber security alliance ncsa has been estab lished as publicprivate partnership of government agencies corporations and nongovernmental organizations to promote cybersecurity education and awareness172 many factors can influence the effec tiveness of training and education to enhance cybersecurity for example prog rams and materials vary in quality and poorly designed program is unlikely to provide significant improvements in cybersecurity in

cybersecurity needs to focus not only on the individual elements of an organizations information technology but also how they interact the term enterprise architecture ea has become increasingly used to refer to the components of an organization and how they work together to achieve the organizations objectives specific definitions and usage vary ea is often used specifically to refer to the information technology component of the architecture and especially to the interoperability of those components it is also used to denote blueprint of an organizations business opera tions and the technology re quired to perform those operations173 the federal government is deve loping businessdriven ea to improve interoperability and services174 an organization can characterize its ea to assist in planning and development of its information technology such ch aracterization can provide an opportunity to make security an integral part of ea this component of ea is sometimes called the security architecture175 however even the initial characterization of an organizations ea can be timeconsuming and expensive and the costs of reengineering to build in security may be prohibitive for many organizations in addition the need to build business case to justify it investme nts which is often considered important to the ea approach may create barriers to improving security given the traditional difficulties of demonstrating financial return on investments in security risk management the approach embodied in defenseindep th recognizes that security cannot be perfect but rather reduces the risk and impact of successful attack or other breach such reduction can be captured throug h risk management which involves identifying controlling and mitigating threats vulnerabilities and the impacts of security breaches the steps in effective ri sk management include assessment of risk steps to mitigate them and continuous ev aluation and adjustment the approach often involves costbenefit analysis to help determine op timal mitigation steps mitigation may involve accepting the risk as cost of business avoiding risk associated with particular activity for example by not engaging in it limiting the risk through effective use of controls and transferring the risk for example through insurance176 some insurance companies have begun to offer cybersecurity policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs45 176 continued risk_managementpdf 177 this is because costbenefit analyses do not usually take externalities into account of course even in the absence of direct impact accepting such risks might nevertheless involve reputation costs 178 of course the incidence of viruses tr ojan horses and other kinds of malware has increased steadily as have attempts to comp romise computers with them nevertheless relatively simple measures can guard against most such attacks 179 ronda henning and others workshop on information system security scoring and ranking 21 23 may 2001 proceedings silver sp ring md applied computer security associates 2002under which companies can transfer some of their risks in the event of successful attack carriers may require clients to implement specified security practices to qualify for insurance however in the ab sence of reliable actua rial data about the risks and costs of cyberattacks it may be difficult for carriers to set appropriate insurance rates to be effective risk management requi res accurate risk assessment however many cybersecurity risks may be difficult to assess for reasons discussed earlier in addition risk management approach may lead an organization to accept risks for which the potential impacts of security events are low regardless of external impacts177 thus risk management is not likel to sufficiently address cybersecurity problems associated with the commons properties of cyberspace discussed earlier in this report metrics whatever approaches are used to imp rove cybersecurity measuring their success would appear to be essential to determining how effective they are and to making improvements ho wever fundamental problem s exist with measuring success in security seemingly the most appropriate measure is the number of successful attacks but in fact attacks especially the kind of major attack for which effective defense is critical may be comparatively uncommon so that absence of successful attack may not indicate effective security178 in addition attackers often take steps to avoid detection so an absen ce of detected attacks may in fact be measure of poor rather than good security this conceptual problem might be addressed through the use of proxy measures such as how well technology policy and activities conform to certain accepted benc hmarks as well as the use of proficiency testing such as blind red team attacks or other penetration testing not only is it difficult to identify appropriate metrics for cybersecurity there are also risks of distortions that may be associated with any particular metric virtually any given metric will measure only one or limited number of aspects of goal if however the limitations of the metric are not understood attempts to use it to optimize security can lead to distortions as the above example illustrates this appears to be general concern179 however some argue that using even distorted metrics can be beneficial if the proce ss of measuring them focuses attention on problems or deficiencies and leads to correction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs46 180 marianne swanson and others security

cybersecurity see crs report rl32331 the economic impact of cyberattacks 184 for example computer failure was sign ificant factor in the august 2003 electrical blackout in the northeastern united

httpsreportsenergygovblackoutfinalwebpd f the continuedmetrics relating to the effects of security events are called impact metrics those relating to the delivery of security services are called effectiveness or efficiency metrics and those relating to the execution of security policies are called implementation metrics nist has published guidelines on such metrics to assist agencies in complying with federal requirements180 the document does not urge the adoption of any specific set of metrics although it does provide examples instead it recommends that the metrics chosen use data that can be realistically obtained that measure existing stable processes and th at facilitate the improvement of security implementation the kinds of metrics that can be eff ectively gathered will depend on the level of maturity of the security prog ram programs at low levels of maturity will of necessity be limited to using implementati on metrics impact metrics can be effective for organizations that have mature security programs with fully integrated procedures and controls181 economic incentives implementation of cybersecurity measures may involve substa ntial costs and is therefore sensitive to market forces and other economic factors if sufficient economic incentives exist for improving cybersecurity then organizations are likely to make the investments needed in the ab sence of government regulation or other drivers one concern often raised is that economic incentives are often insufficient and that in fact significant counterincentives exist the perceived inadequacy of incentives fo r cybersecurity can be seen as form of market failure kind of economic inefficiency182 there are several lines of evidence supporting this view for example it can be difficult for law enforcement officials to arrest and prosecute hackers if companies are unwilling to provide information on cyberattacks yet company risks suffering significant reputation costs if that information leads customers to conclude that the companys information systems are not sufficiently secure in addition investments in cybersecurity cannot easily be analyzed in terms of return on investment since they do not contribute to income in measurable way183 therefore companies may be reluctant to make the necessary investments also impacts of compromised systems may reach far beyond the system where the compromise occurred184 the interconnectedness ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs47 184 continued economic cost of that blackout has been estimated at several billion dollars with most of that loss occurring outside the electric utility sector electricity consumers resource council the economic impacts of th august 2003 blackout 9 february 2004 http wwwelconorgdocument seconomicimpactsofaugust2003blackoutpdf 185 for example collective concern regarding reputation risk or the potential for government intervention might lead organizations within sector to agree on minimum standard of cybersecurity practice 186 nssc p ixcyberspace has made it to significant ex tent commons with associated economic externalities the widespread adoption of the kinds of leverage to improve cybersecurity discussed above may be doubtfu l without changes in the current incentive structure such changes could arise from several sour ces among them are increases in public demand for cybersecurity changes in expect ed behavior within sector regarding investment in cybersecurity185 publicprivate partnerships and regulation or other action by governments while not all such factors are themselves economic in nature they can clearly affect the economic incentive structure for example company that does not respond to exp ectations from its peers for improved cybersecurity may suffer significant reputation cost similarly company that is found to violate government requirements may suffer both reputation costs and direct punitive action or may be held financially liable for damages what roles should government and the private sector play the above discussion shows that 1 th ere is currently unified national framework for improving cybersecurity 2 there are several areas of weakness where such framework could be useful in generating improvement s and 3 several means of leverage exist that could be us ed in the development and implementation of such framework questions remain however about whethe r additional federal efforts would be needed or sirable according to the nssc government role in cybersecurity is warranted in nongovernmental cases where high transaction costs or legal ba rriers lead to significant coordination problems cases in which governments operate in the absence of private sector forces resolution of incentive problems that lead to under provisioning of critical shared resources and raising awareness186 are market forces along with current g overnment and private sector policies and practices sufficient to put in place the necessary components if not will additional voluntary efforts be sufficient or is further government ac tion required this section discusses whether current efforts are ade quate and what policy options exist

inadequate overall substantial evidence of improvements can be found they range from steady increases in the number of organizations dopting cybersecurity st andards of practice see discussion above to efforts to increas public awareness about cybersecurity to new federal and state require ments for government and pr ivatesector information systems the legal framework for cybers ecurity continues to evolve with new federal and state laws being implemented and new publicprivate partnerships have been developed laws and regulations according to the nssc it is the policy of the united states to prevent or minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructur and thereby protect the people the economy the essential human and government services and the national security of the united st ates disruptions that do occur should be infrequent of minimal dur ation and manageable and cause the least damage possible the policy requires continuous effort to secure information systems for cr

framework for security despite remaining weaknesses and cerns these federal programs and requirements can be important not only dir ectly by improving fe deral cybersecurity but also by providing information oppor tunities and incentives for improving cybersecurity in the private sector nists fisma standards and guidelines are publicly available as are some informa tion assurance documents produced by the national security agency192 even though they apply only to government agencies and contractors federal cybersecurity requirements can also potentially stimulate market for more secure products for ex ample if companys product must meet certain security specifications for federal agencies it may be more costeffective for the company to make those specifications available in general rather than customizing the product for the federal g overnment nevertheless privatesector organizations are not required to implement fisma and its impact on nongovernmental cybersecurity does not appear to be wellcharacterized some federal laws do place security requirements on certain classes of private sector information and controls193 these include protections for personal information for

the question of framework for cybersecurity their major influence on the development of such framework may be the regulatory incentives that they provide for corporate management to address cybersecurity issues the homeland security act of 2002 h sa gives dhs some authority and resources relating to cybersecurity the national cybersecurity division ncsd was established in june 2003 within the di rectorate for inform ation assurance and infrastructure protection iaip of the partment according to dhs the divisions mission includes the following 1 identifying analyzing and reducing cyber threats and vulnerabilities 2 disseminating cyber threat warning information 3 coordinating cyber incident response nd 4 providing tec hnical assistance in continuity of operations and re covery from cyber incidents198 ncsd has created computer emergency response team uscert199 in cooperation with carnegie mellon university to coordinate cybersecur ity efforts and established new alert system it has also engaged in effort s to facilitate publicp rivate cybersecurity partnerships notably by sponsoring the national cybersecurity summit to that end in december 2003 and followup efforts dhs also sponsors cybersecurity research and development within its science and technology directorate state laws can also have impacts both w ithin and beyond the states that enact them for example the california data base protection act ca sb1386 which went into effect july 1 2003 requires any government or private entity doing business in california to reveal to affected residents of the state any security breach that results in unauthorized acquisition of personal information such as social security numbers or information that could permit access to financial accounts while the law requires only notification it is expected to impact cybersecurity because organizations are believed likely to prefer instituting improved security to disclosing breaches with the latters attendant reputation costs it is also expected to have impacts beyond the states borders since interstate businesses are unlikely to institute separate cybersecurity procedures for different states laws and regulations in other countries may also impact cybersecurity measures taken by organizations in the united states especially if those organizations also engage in relevant activities in those countries one example comes from the european union eu which has adopted tw directives that require organizations to implement cybersecurity measures eu directives 9546ec on data protection and 200258ec on privacy and

business times 2 december 2002 available at httpsanfranciscobizj ournalscomsanfranciscostories20021202 editorial3htmlparticular supporters of stronger govern ment efforts including regulation argue that they are necessary to improve secu rity and will have positive economic impact by reducing uncertainties concerning ec onomic loss from cyberattacks opponents point to costs the difficulty of determin ing what requirements are necessary and how to measure compliance and problems in dealing with boundaries between networks and between nations209 some specific arguments that might favor legislative action are as follows most critical infrastructure is in private hands210 yet problems in these sectors arising from inade quate cybersecurity could have implications well beyond the sectors themselves some experts argue that cybers ecurity is fundamentally public good and therefore requires government involvement211 there are aspects of cyberspace that resemble those of commons an asset such as public road that is generally available to the public rather than being in private hands unregulated commons can be susceptible to exploitation degr adation and other problems as the role of cyberspace in th us and world economy continues to increase its protection and reliability will become more clearly in the national interest as is the case for example with commercial aviation and product safety212 the growing amount of personal in formation including financial information that is communi cated via cyberspace makes it increasingly attractive to thieves and other criminals making the lawenforcement function of g overnment more relevant to cybersecurity the apparent failure of market incentives to stimulate adequate cybersecurity efforts means that governments may be

software had been designed to handle dates much software code was designed when computer memory was at premium and therefore was coded to process only the last 2 digits of the year therefore the program could not distinguish an entry for the year 2000 from one for the year 1900 this could be particularly concern for programs that used clocks for core processes predictions about the impacts of this discrepa ncy ranged from trivial to disastrous effects because of the risks of disastrous impact substantial effort was launched to modify or replace computer code both programmable nd hardwired to correct the problem 215 payne regulation and information security p 35failure an oftencited example is the underreporting of security incidents by an organization despite the fact that timely and sufficiently complete reporting is important for effective response as well as planning among the disincentives for reporting are damage to reputation213 that can result in loss of customers or revenue in the case of company or political repercussions in the case of government agency laws such as the california da tabase protection ac t discussed above can help to correct such market failures although they can themselves create market distortions or other problems however many other observe rs believe that legislative action is unnecessary or inappropriate arguments against such action include the belief by many that regulation would be too intr usive and would stifle innova tion that voluntary efforts are sufficient that time should be allowe d for current laws and voluntary efforts to have impact before further gislative action is considered and that the threat from cyberattack is not great enough to warrant further government action models two models have sometimes b een cited as providing possible avenues for federal efforts to develop cybersecurity framework the year2000 y2k computer problem and environmen tal and safety regulations each is discussed below response to the year2000 computer problem government involvement in the efforts to re solve the year2000 computer problem214 is sometimes cited as possible model for government involvement in cybersecurity key element in that approach was the use of evolving and increasing requirements for publicly traded companies via actions by the securities and exchange commission sec the sec promulgated rules to re quire companies to respond to the y2k problem congress passed laws to facilitate information sharing and to reduce liability if the company had complied this appeared to demonstrate that 1 the sec can be effective in promoting change s such as those required for improved cybersecurity 2 congress can be an eff ective enabler of solutions for example by removing barriers to effective information sharing and 3 gradual incremental approach can be effective215 however critics respond that the model is inappropriate for three reasons first th y2k problem is thought by many to have been much less serious than feared so that the effectiveness of response may be questionable as reason for the low number of significant incidents second the problem was fundament ally much simpler than cybe rsecurity which may require much more complex set of responses third it was onetime problem whereas cybersecurity needs are continuous nevert heless the lessons learned from the y2khttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs54 216 for more detail about thes statutes see crs report rl30798 environmental laws summaries of statut administered by the vironmental protection agency 217 42 usc 13103 218 sec 201d5 219 also the nssc was not developed pursuant to any specific legislative mandate and federal agency has been given statutory authority to implement it 220 specifically the act defines protected class of nonpublic critical infrastructure information relating to secur ity for example instances of attacks or known vulnerabilities and prohibits public disclosure and certain other use by dhs of such information if voluntarily submitted to the federal government problem may usefully inform the cybersecur ity response in fact the sarbanesoxley act uses the sec to promote cybersecur ity although the act does not directly provide for gradual improvement the evolution of auditing standards could have that effect safety and environm ental regulations whether cybersecurity standardization can be approached using safety or environmental regulation or similar efforts as model might also be considere d for example the analogy of cyberspace with the highway system the informati on superhighway raises the question of whether governments might consider secu rity regulations analogous to safety regulations that apply to road s vehicles and drivers environment the environmental protection agency epa administers several laws aimed at reducing nd preventing environmental problems216 f r example the pollution prevention act of 1990 required epa to develop and implement strategy for reducing pollution at the source217 in comparison the hsa requires dhs to develop comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the unite d states including power production generation and distribution systems information technology and telecommunications systems including satellites electronic financial and property record storage and transmissi on systems emergency preparedness communications systems and the physical and technological assets that support such systems218 the plan would therefore include several key elements of cyberspace however the act does not explicitly provide dhs with authority to implement the plan219 the emergency planning and community righttoknow act of 1986 requires many industrial facilitie s to report release of toxic chemicals annually submission of information on cybersecurity problems such as attacks remains voluntary under hsa but the act contains provisions to facilitate such submissions for certain kinds of information220 the clean air act and related legislation requires epa to set and enforce national standards for ambient air quality and assigns major responsibility for compliance to the states it also requires standards for vehicle emissions that havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs55 221 see crs 9891 food safety agencies and authorities primer

to modify technologies to meet those standa rds the hsa does not provide dhs with authority to set or enforce national standards for cybersecurity food and product safety several federal agenci share responsibility for regulating food safety in the united states primarily the food and drug administration of the department of h ealth and human services and the food safety and inspection service of the department of agriculture221 both agencies set regulations with input from industry and ot her interested partie s and use monitoring by inspectors to ensure conformance with the regulations the consumer product safety commission is an inde pendent regulatory agency established to protect the public from unreasonable risk of injury or death from consumer products the agency sets voluntary and mandatory product sa fety standards has the power to recall or even ban hazardous products222 also under state product liability laws plaintiffs may sue for damages for injury to person or property resulting from defective product223 the federal government does not re gulate or set manda tory or voluntary standards for cybersecurity except to some ex tent with respect to federal agencies and contractors the federal approaches to environmen tal protection and to food nd pr oduct safety could provide potential models should congress wish to use government regulation as way of improving cy bersecurity as some have proposed224 however the highly interconnected amorphous and cons tantly evolving nature of cyberspace might provide significant barriers to the creation of regulations that improve cybersecurity but do not impede technolog development and trepreneurship options for congress should congress consider taking action to facilitate the adoption of framework for cybersecur ity there are several options that might be considered with respect to both legislation and oversight some possibilities are described below to illustrate the range of options the examples are for illustration only225 therefore discussion of benefits and disadvantages is given among the legislative options are the following encourage the widespread adoption of cybersecurity standards and best practices there are several potential ways to achieve such goal perhaps the strongest measures would be for congress to provide the depa rtment of homeland security or another agency with regulato ry authority over cyberspace industries and direct the department to develop and enforce mandatory cybersecurity standards presumably through process that invol ved the industries and other interested parties as is the case for example with food safety modera approach might be to further codify and strengthen dhss role in working work with industry to develophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs56 226 see discussion of the california databa protection act under the section above on current efforts 227 for example in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks congress enacted the terrorism risk

cybersecurity for th homeland report of the activities and findings by the chairman and rankin g member december 2004 available at continuedvoluntary standards and best practices or to provide tax incentives for companies to adopt acceptable cybers ecurity measures leverage procurement congress could require that cybersecurity be high priority in all federa l acquisitions of information tec hnology it could further require that companies that operated under accepted levels of cybersecurity practices such as recognized international standards w ould receive preference for federal contracts encourage mandatory reporting to further counter disincentives for companies to report cybersecurity vul nerabilities and breach congress could require federal and private organizations to reveal certain kinds of security breaches as california has done226 it could also require companies to report specified classes of incidents and vulnerabilitie s to dhs under the protecti ons afforded by the hsa rather than relying on voluntary reporting facilitate product liability actions congress could direct dhs to identify classes of cybersecurity weaknesses for which states could permit plaintiffs to sue manufacturers under product lia bility laws or provide some other mechanism to facilitate such redress facilitate development of cybersecurity insurance to the extent that lack of reliable actuarial information or other barriers are impeding the development of cybersecurity insurance congress could f acilitate the developmen t of the industry by providing for reinsurance or other guaran tees as it does in certain other areas227 strengthen federal cy bersecurity programs hr 5068 introduced in the 108th congress and reintroduced in the 109th congress as hr 285 proposes establishing the position of assistant secretary for cy bersecurity within dhs with responsibility for among other things implementing priorities similar to those laid out in the nssc the 109th congress might enact legislation with such provisions and also could strengthen existing cybersecurity effo rts in other agencies such as nist and nsf and through the sec oversight and investigative hearings could also provide mechanisms for congress to facilitate the development of cybersecurity framework several hearings were held during the 108th congress most notably by the subcommittee on cybersecurity science and research and development of the house select committee on homeland security228 and the subcommittee on technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32777crs57 228 continued

held during the 109th congress on legislative options such as those described above or for example on implementation of the recommendations relating to vulnerability reduction in the nssc alternatively congress might decide that legislative action or targeted oversight would be appropriate at this time there remain considerable differences of opinion among experts about both the seriousness of cybersecurity threats especially with respect to terrorism and the potential benefits and disadvantages of any additional federal action to improve cy bersecurity in the private sector in addition ongoing and new gove rnment and private sector efforts such as those discussed above might result in suffici ent improvements to render additional congressional action unnecessary or of marginal benef it the question remains however whether those efforts will have sufficient impact quickly enough to meet national cybersecurity needs the answer to that question will likely depend to significant degree on the scale and immediacy of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities over which there is still considerable debate matter what actions congress might take to strengthen cybersecurity efforts there are several issues that may be influential in the debate in addition to the uncertainties discussed above one sign ificant issue is the degree to which cyberspace is in fact commons with the attendant characteristics that reduce the likelihood that market mechanisms alone can lead to appropriate security another is the difficulty of obtaining coordina tion and cooperation from the large number of interested and affected parties especially given the global nature of cyberspace third issue is whether the different appro aches advocated by different groups can be effectively harmonized so that there is common understanding of what the key elements of cybersecurity framewo rk should be and how they should be implemented related to that is the issue of how to ensure that the particular needs of different sectors are met while attempting to achieve harmonization finally there is the issue of lag time the degree to which the speed of evolution of cyberspace and its supporting technology outstrips attemp ts to develop eff ective standards and other elements of cybersecurity frame work those and other issues strongly suggest that the attempt to develop national framework for cybersecurity is likely to remain significant challenge for the nation during the 109th congress
