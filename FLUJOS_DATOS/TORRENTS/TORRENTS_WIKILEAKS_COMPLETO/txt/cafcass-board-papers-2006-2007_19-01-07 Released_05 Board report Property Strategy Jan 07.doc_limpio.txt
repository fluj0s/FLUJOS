most significantly every day matters the knowledge learning and development strategy and the it strategy had on the future use of cafcass offices 3 implementation of the strategy is supported by property board which is made up of board member corporate director the head of business development two business managers the national estates officer and regional business support officer 44 there is also sub group of the board which operates as working group and is chaired by the head of business support this group takes responsibility for developing the range of procedures necessary to support the regions in the devolved management of the estate and its day to day operation the group has this year reviewed simplified and revised the business case formats and the operating procedures the new business case format has received full approval and commendation from dfes 45 work has also been undertaken on detailed audit and appraisal of the estate on region by region basis evaluating each property for suitability using the criteria outlined in the property strategy each region has completed detailed accommodation plan and identified priorities for their accommodation needs over the next three years these are currently being drawn together to identify priorities for the estate and to inform the required replacements and repairs for the forthcoming year and future years as identified in the strategy it is likely that full implementation and replacement of all unsuitable premises will take five to seven years to complete 46 work completed this year has included replacement of an unsuitable property in wellington with new property in shrewsbury approval for capital spending totalling 550000 to modernise and upgrade three owned properties in plymouth stafford and peterborough work has started on one site and is due to start on the other two this month work needs to be completed by the end of the financial year and the agreed programmes of work will meet this timescale completion of all priority 1 repairs on properties on the estate identified for this year renegotiation of leases and rent reviews on number of properties that will remain longterm on the estate and meet or can be made to meet the specification of the strategy closure of brighton office on health and safety grounds marketing and subletting initially for 12 months and subject to completion of agreeable terms half of the national office floor space financial implications 1 there are substantial financial implications for the full implementation of the strategy the completion of the audit referred to in paragraph 45 above and the emerging property plan will enable us for the first time to form national picture of the number and cost of properties requiring replacement it has to be said however that implementing the necessary changes in planned way will take 3 to 5 years 2 further priority replacement and acquisitions will continue to be undertaken via our annual budget allocation process unless the opportunity presents itself to bid for additional funds as part of national change programme 53 capital was also made available for the it initiatives reported to the december board and these changes also facilitate implementation of the strategy through the mobile and flexible working initiatives and the upgrading of the telephone system that the new network will facilitate 6 staffing implications 1 there are considerable implications for staff in relation to changes in working practice and in some cases there will be changes in work location all these changes are being undertaken in line with the relevant cafcass policies and in full discussion with our union partners 62 we have now established sub group of the national partnership committee which meets quarterly to discuss it and property issues risks 71 the board policy and property strategy contribute to the reduction of risks associated with the cafcass estate providing as they do clear framework within which to operate 72 all risks identified as the strategy is implemented will be identified and included in the regional and the national risk registers 8 diversity 81 issues relating to range of diversity considerations including access to our service both practical and cultural are explicit in our policy and strategy and we will ensure that these are fully addressed as we continue to implement the strategy lamorna wooderson corporate director partnerships january 2007 pic
