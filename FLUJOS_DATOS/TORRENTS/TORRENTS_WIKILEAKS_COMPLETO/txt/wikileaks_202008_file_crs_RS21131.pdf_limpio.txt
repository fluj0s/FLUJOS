area is further restricted with additional barriers and access requirements the security force must comply with nrc requirements on prehiring investigations and training3 nrc published proposed rule on oct ober 26 2006 to impose additional reactor security requirements4 it would also codify in regu lation various nrc security orders issued since the 911 attacks and implement security provisions included in epact design basis threat the design basis threat is used by nrc licensees as the basis for implementing defensive strategies of specific nuclear plant site through security plans safeguards contingency plan s and guard training and qualification plans one of nrcs april 2003 regulatory orders ch anged the dbt to represent the largest reasonable threat against which regulated private guard force should be expected to defend under existing law according to the nrc announcement nrcs final rule for revising the dbt took effect april 18 2007 as directed by the energy policy act the final rule has the principal objective of making the security requirements imposed by the april 29 2003 dbt orders generically applicable although specific details of the revised dbt we re not released to the public in general the final rule clarifies that physical protection syst ems are required to protect against diversion and theft of fissile material expands the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more teams and attack from multiple entry points assumes that adversaries are willing to kill or be killed and areknowledgeable about specific target selection expands

the government accountability ffice gao reviewed the upgrades in nuclear plant security and found generally logical and welldefine d process gao found nrc staff trained in threat assessment who monitor information provided by intelligence agencies and screen the information to evaluate particular terrorist capabilities for inclusion in the dbt however the nrc produced revised dbt that generally but not always corresponded to the threat asse ssment staffs original recommendations5 the dbt final rule excluded aircraft attack s which raised cons iderable controversy in approving the rule nrc rejected petition from the union of concerned scientists to require that nuclear plants be surrounded by aircraft barriers made of steel beams and cables the socalled beamhenge concept critics of the rule charged that deliberate aircraft crashes were highly plausible mode of attack given the events of 911 however nrc contended that power plants were already required to mitigate the effects of aircraft crashes and that active protection ag ainst airborne threats is addressed by other federal organizations including the military6 additional nrc acti on on aircraft threats is discussed below forceonforce exercises epact codified an nrc requirement that each nuclear power plant conduct security exercise s every three years to test its ability to defend against the design basis threat in these forceonforce exercises monitored by nrc an adversary force from outside the plant attempts to penetrate the plants vital area and damage or destroy key safety components participants in the tightly controlled exercises carry weapons modified to fire only blanks and lase r bursts to simulate bullets and they wear laser sensors to indicate hits other weapons and explosives as well as destruction or breaching of physical security barriers may also be simulated while one squad of the plants guard force is participating in forceonforce exercise another squad is also on duty to maintain normal pl ant security plant defenders know that mock attack will take place sometime during specific peri od of several hours but they do not know what the attack scenario w ill be mu ltiple attack scenarios are c onducted over several days of exercises full implementation of the forceonforce program began in late 2004 standard procedures and other require ments have been developed for using the forceonforce exercises to evaluate plant security and as basis for taking regulatory enforcement action many tradeoffs are necessary to make the exercises as realis tic and consistent as possible without endangering participants or regular pl ant operations and securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131crs4 7 government accountability office nuclear regulatory commission preliminary observations on efforts to improve security at nuclear power plants statement of jim wells director natural resources and environment governme nt accountability office to the subcommittee on national security emerging threats nd international relations house committee on government reform september 14 2004 p 14nrc required the nuclear industry to velop and train composite adversary force comprising security officers from many plants to simulate terrorist attacks in the forceonforce exercises however in september 2004 testimony gao criticized the industrys selection of security company that guards about half of us nuclear plants wackenhut to also provide the adversary force in additi on to raising questions about the forces independence gao noted that wackenhut had been accused of cheating on previous forceonforce exercises by the department of energy7 epact requires nrc to mitigate any potential conflict of interest that could influence the results of forceonforce exercise as the commission dete rmines to be necessa ry and appropriate emergency response after the 1979 accident at the three mile island nuclear plant near harrisburg pa congress required th at all nuclear power plants be covered by emergency plans nrc requires that within an approximately 10mile emergency planning zone epz around each plant the ope rator must maintain warning sirens and regularly conduct evacuation exercises mon itored by nrc and th federal emergency management agency fema in light of the increased possibility of terrorist attacks that if successful could result in release of radioactive material critics have renewed calls for expanding the epz to include larger population centers the release of radioactive i odine during nuclear incident is particular concern because iodine tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland of persons exposed to it emergency plans in many states include di stribution of iodine pills to the population within the epz taking nonradioactive iodi ne before exposure would prevent absorption of radioactive iodine but would afford pr otection against other radioactive elements in 2002 nrc began providing iodine pills to states requesting them for populations within the 10mile epz nuclear plant vulnerability the major concerns in operating nuclear power plant are controlling the nuclear chain reaction and assuring that the reactor core does not lose its coolant and melt down from the heat produced by the radioactive fission products within the fuel rods us plants are designed and built to prevent dispersal of radioactivity in the event of an accident by surrounding the reactor in steel reinforced concrete containment structure which represents an intrinsic safety feature two major accidents have taken place in power reactors at three mile island tmi in 1979 and at chernobyl in the soviet union in 1986 although both accidents resulted fro m combination of operator error and design flaws tmis containment structure effectively prevented major release of radioactivity from fuel meltdown caused by the loss of coolant in the chernobyl accident the reactors protective barriers we re breached when an outofcontrol nuclear reaction led to fierce graphite fire that caused significant part of the radioactive core to be blown into the atmospherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131crs5 8 meserve

withstand hurricanes earthquakes and ot her extreme events but deliberate attacks by large airliners loaded with fuel such as those th at crashed into the world trade center and pentagon were not analyzed when design requirements for todays reactors were determined8 taped interview shown septem ber 10 2002 on arab tv station jazeera which contains statement that qaeda initially planned to include nuclear plant in its 2001 attack sites intens ified concern about aircraft crashes in light of the possibility that an air attack might penetrate the containment building of nuclear plant some interest groups ve suggested that such an event could be followed by meltdown and widespread radiation exposure nuclear industry spokespersons have countered by pointing out that relatively small lowlying nuclear power plants are difficult targets for attack and have argued that penetration of the containment is unlikely and that even if such penetration occu rred it probably would not reach the reactor vessel they suggest that sustained fire such as that which melted the steel support structures in th world trade center buildings would be impossible unless an attacking plane penetrated the containment completely including its fuelbearing wings according to former nrc chairman nils diaz nrc studies confirm that the likelihood of both damaging the reactor core nd releasing radioactivity that could affect public health and safety is low9 although nrcs final rule on the design basis threat discussed above excludes aircraft attacks nrc nnounced on april 24 2007 that it would issue proposed rule requiring license applicants for new reactor s to assess potential design improvements that would improve protection against impact by rge commercial aircraft the proposed rule would affect new reactor designs not previously certified by nrc10 westinghouse submitted changes in the design of its ap1000 r eactor to nrc on may 29 2007 proposing to line the inside and outside of th reactors concrete containment structure with steel plates to increase resistance to aircraft penetration11 spent fuel storage when longer capable of sustaining nuclear chain reaction spent nuclear fuel is removed from the reactor nd stored in pool of water in the reactor building and at some sites late r transferred to dry casks on the plant grounds because both types of storage are located outside the reactor containment structure particular concern has been rais ed about the vulnerability of spen t fuel to attack by aircraft or other means if terrorist s could breach spent fuel pools concrete walls and drain the cooling water the spent fuels zirconium cladding could overh eat and catch firehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131crs6 12 national academy of sciences boar d on

released report in april 2005 that found that successful terrorist attacks on spent fu pools though difficu lt are possible and that if an attack leads to propagating zirconium cladding fire it could result in the release of large amounts of radioactive ma terial nas recommended that the hottest spent fuel be interspersed with cooler spen t fuel to reduce the likelihood of fire and that waterspray systems be installed to cool spent fuel if pool wa ter were lost the report also called for nrc to conduct more analysis of the issue and consider earlier movement of spent fuel from pools into dry storage12 the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations act pl 109103 hre pt 109275 provided 21 million for nrc to carry out the sitespecific analyses recommended by nas nrc has long contended that the potential effects of terrorist attacks are too speculative to include in environmental studies for proposed spent fuel storage and other nuclear facilities however the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit ruled in june 2006 that terrorist attacks must be included in the environmental study of dry storage facility at californias diablo canyon nuclear plant nrc reissued the diablo canyon study may 29 2007 to comply with the court ruling but it did not include terrorism in other recent environmental studies13 regulatory and legislative proposals critics of nrcs security measures ve demanded both shortterm regulatory changes and legislative reforms fundame ntal concern was the nature of the dbt which critics contended should be increased to include number of separa coordinated attacks critics also pointed out that licensees are required to employ only minimum of five security personnel on duty per plant wh ich they argue is not enough for the job14 nuclear spokespersons responded that the actual security fo rce for the nations 65 nuclear plant sites numbers more than 5000 an aver age of about 75 per site covering multiple shifts nuclear plant security forces ar also supposed to be aided by local law enforcement officers if an attack occurs because of the growing emphasis on security nrc established the office of nuclear security and incident re
