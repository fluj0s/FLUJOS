become exhausted in 2041 according to the 2008 social security trustees report if congress does not act before then the trust funds would be unable to pay full social security benefits on time if full social security benefits could not be paid on time the lives of millions of people who rely on social security could be disrupted the consequences of waiting to act are also serious by 2041 the benefit cuts and tax increases required to achieve longrange solvency are projected to be about twice as large as those needed today the social security act does not specify what would happen to benefits if the trust funds became insolvent however it is clear that full social security benefits could not be paid on time because the antideficiency act prohibits government spending in excess of available funds after insolvency social security would continue to receive tax income from which some benefits could be paid either full benefit checks would be paid on delayed schedule or reduced benefits would be paid on time in either case social security beneficiaries and qualifying applicants would remain legally entitled to full benefits and could take legal action to claim the balance of their benefits the legal conflict between benefi t entitlement and the antideficiency act would need to be resolved either by congress or by the courts social security solvency could be restored by cutting social securitys spending increasing its income or some combination of the two over the long range ie over the next 75 years the social security trustees estimate that the trust funds have shortfall of 43 trillion in present value terms or 17 of taxable payroll the sooner congress acts to fill this gap the smaller the changes to social security need to be because earlier changes could be spread to larger number of workers and beneficiaries over longer period of time if congress waits until the moment of insolvency to act the trust funds annual deficits could be eliminated with benefit cuts of about 22 in 2041 that will gradually rise to about 25 by 2082 congress could also eliminate annual deficits by raising the social security payroll tax rate from 1240 to 1594 in 2041 then gradually increasing it to 1660 by 2082 to maintain annual balance after 2082 larger benefit reductions or tax increases would be required prompt action to restore social security solven cy would be advantageous the trustees project that the combined trust funds will begin to run annual cashflow deficits in 2017 requiring the redemption of government bonds accumulated in earlier years the disability insurance di trust fund is already running cashflow deficits cashflow deficits do not affect social security directly but the redemption of the trust fund bonds puts pressure on the overall federal budget which is in deficit earlier changes would allow workers and beneficiaries time to adjust their retirement plans finally if congress were to act today the benefit cuts or tax increases necessary to restore solvency until 2082 would be about half as large as those needed if congress waited until the trust funds became insolvent to act this report will be updated as events warrant

social security trustees release their annual report attention is focused on the trustees latest projections of when the soci security trust funds will become insolvent1 less attention is paid to what trust fund insolven cy would mean what would happen to benefits what options would congress have to restore solv ency how would policy changes at this point affect beneficiaries there are many misconceptions about what would happen if the social security trust funds ran out for example many americansparticularly younger americansbelieve that if the trust funds were exhausted social security will be co mpletely broke and unable to pay any benefits2 this is not the case in fact in 2041 the first year of projected insolvency the program is projected to have enough tax income to pay about 78 of scheduled benefits declining to about 75 in 2082 at the end of the trustees longterm projection period another myth is that the social security act includes specific failsafe provision in case of trust fund exhaustionfor example formula for cutting benefits or raising taxes to eliminate annual deficits this is also untrue in fact the act does not specify what would happen to benefits if the trust funds are exhausted the most likely scenario seems to be that benefit checks would be delayed this report explains what the social security trust funds are and how they work it describes the historical operations of the trust funds and the social security trustees projections of future operations it explains what could happen if congress allowed the trust funds to run out it also analyzes two scenarios that assume congress wa its until the moment of insolvency to act showing the magnitude of benefit cuts or tax increases needed and how such changes would affect beneficiaries

the merged operations of the oasi and di trust funds treating the two funds as if they were one collective oasdi fund

security payroll tax levied on wages and selfemployment income 3 social securitycovered employees and employers each pay 62 of wages up to the taxable maximum 102000 in 20084 by law about 85 of social security payroll taxes are credited to the oasi trust fund and about 15 are credited to the di trust fund5 the trust funds also receive income from interest on the trust funds assets and from the taxation of social security benefits in 2007 84 of the trust funds income was from payroll taxes 14 was from interest on trust fund assets and 2 was from taxation of benefits6 the proportion of income from each of these sources varies over time7 g17g158g157g144g152g561g143g155g152g150g561g157g145g142g561g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158g151g141g156g561 almost all of the trust funds spending is for benefit payments and small amount goes toward administrative expenses the oasi trust fund is also party to financial interchange with the railroad retirement board8 this annual exchange of funds places the social security trust funds in the same financial position in which they would have been if railroad service had been covered by social security in 2007 more than 98 of the trust funds spending was for social security benefits less than 1 was for administrative costs and less than 1 was transferred to the railroad retirement board rrb 9 the trust funds spend essentially the same proportion of funds on each of these items each year 3 payroll taxes are formally known as federal insurance contributions act fica and selfemployment contributions act seca taxes fica and seca taxes also include 145 payroll tax on each employee and employer for medicare hospital insurance 4 selfemployed individuals pay 124 of wages up to the taxable maximum the taxable maximum is indexed to the average wage index awi economists typically attribute both the employee and employer share of the payroll tax to workers since it is assumed that the employer portion of the tax is passed on to workers in the form of lower wages 5 42 usc 401 6 for the oasi trust fund 83 of income was from payroll taxes 14 was from interest on trust fund assets and 3 was from taxation of benefits in 2007 for the di trust fund 86 of income was from payroll taxes 12 was from interest on trust fund assets and 1 was from taxation of benefits in 2007 figures may not add to 100 due to rounding 7 the proportion of income from taxation of benefits is projected to increase over time as more people are subject to taxation of benefits see crs report rl32552 social security calculation and history of taxing benefits by janemarie mulvey and christine scott the proportion of in come from interest is projected to increase in the short term as social security continues to run surpluses then decrease as the balance of the trust funds are drawn down to pay benefits 8 see crs report rs22350 railroad retirement board retirement survivor disability unemployment and sickness benefits by kathleen romig 9 in 2007 about 99 of oasi trust fund spending was for benefits less than 1 was for administrative costs and less than 1 was transferred to the rrb in 2007 about 97 of di trust fund spending was for benefits and about 3 was for administrative costs figures may not add to 100 due to rounding

in given year the trust funds take in more tax income ie payroll taxes and taxation of benefits than they spend the trust funds have cashflow surplus by law surplus revenues are invested in interestbearing us government securitiesusually special issue treasury bonds10 in other words social securitys cash surpluses like proceeds from all government bonds are borrowed by the us treasury and can be used for tax cuts spending or repaying debt the treasury in turn incurs an obligation to repay the bonds with interest which is also credited to the trust funds if in given year the trust funds spend more than the tax income they receive they have cash flow deficit in deficit years social security can redeem any bonds including interest accumulated in previous years when the bonds are redeemed assets are transferred from the treasurys general fund to the social security trust funds in other words unless the treasurys general fund is running surplus congress would need to cut overall spending raise taxes or borrow during years in which social security has cashflow deficits g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158g151g141g561g21g152g149g159g142g151g140g162g561 if the trust funds are not able to pay all of current expenses out of current tax income and accumulated trust fund assets they are insolvent insolvency means that social securitys trust funds are unable to pay full benefits on time it does not mean that social security will be completely broke and unable to pay any benefits

established in 1957 neither of the social security trust funds has ever become insolvent in 2007 the combined trust funds had cashflow surplus of about 80 billion about 10 of the trust funds income for that year which was invested in treasury bonds 11 the di trust fund had cashflow deficit for the third year in row at the end of 2007 the combined trust funds held total of about 22 trillion in treasury bonds12 g5g138g156g145g556g8g149g152g160g561g21g158g155g153g149g158g156g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g6g142g143g146g140g146g157g156g561 the trust funds have run annual cashflow surpluses in most years these annual surpluses were typically small relative to the size of the trust funds expenditures after the 1983 amendments to the social security act which increased social securitys income and reduced its spending the oasi trust fund began to run larger surpluses13 the combined trust funds have run annual cash 10 see crs report rs20607 social security trust fu nd investment practices by dawn nuschler 11 in 2007 the oasi trust fund had cashflow surplus of 82 3 billion and the di trust fund had cashflow deficit of 21 billion 12 at the end of 2007 the oasi trust fund held 20 trillion and the di trust fund held 215 billion 13 there is little evidence to suggest that the 1983 amendments were intended to create surpluses or to advance fund future benefits records of congressional proceedings at the time show that the primary goal of the legislation was to assure that social security would not be threatened by insolvency if economic conditions were worse than expected

trust funds have never been exhausted however in the early 1980s solvency crisis loomed for the oasi trust fund the 1982 social security trustees report projected that in the absence of legislative changes the oasi trust fund would become insolvent by july 1983 15 to relieve the pressure on the oasi trust fund temporarily congress permitted the fund to borrow from the di and medicare hospital insurance hi trust funds16 money was transferred to the oasi fund in 1982 and repaid by 198617 this temporary measure allowed policymakers time to develop more sustainable solution to social securitys solvency problemthe 1983 amendments which increased tax income and reduced benefits 18 absent another act of congress the social security act does not permit further interfund borrowing19

longrange projections of trust fund financial operations 20 the trustees report describes range of possible outcomes using different sets of demographic and economic assumptions including intermediate assumptions high cost pessimistic assumptions and low cost optimistic assumptions each set of assumptions results in different projections of both when cashflow deficits will begin and when the trust funds will become insolvent 21 this crs report focuses on the trustees longrange projections under their in termediate assumptions which reflect their best estimates of future trends however it is important to note that the trustees projectionslike all longterm projectionsare uncertain other estimates differ from the trustees projections for 14 see crs report rl33028 social security the trust

the di trust fund has been running cashflow deficits since 2005 23 when cashflow deficits emerge the trust funds need to redeem the treasury bonds accumulated during earlier years redeeming the bonds requires transfers from the treasurys general fund to the social security trust funds these transfers create pressure on the overall federal budget

assets will allow the trust funds to pay full benefits on time until 2041 when the trust funds will become exhausted24 at that time the trust funds will continue to receive tax income ie payroll taxes and taxation of benefits the trustees project that tax income will be sufficient to cover about 78 of scheduled benefits during the first year of trust fund insolvency in 2041 gradually declining to

benefits to all those who are eligible for them as set forth in the statute28 if the government fails to pay the benefits stipulated by law beneficiaries could take legal action insolvency would not

the social security act does not stipulate what would happen to benefits if the trust funds ran out because the antideficiency act would effectively prohibit the government from paying full benefits on time and the social security act entitles beneficiaries and qualifying applicants to scheduled benefits the conflict between these two ws would need to be resolved by congress or by the courts in the meantime either full benefit checks would be paid on delayed schedule or reduced benefits would be paid on time according to trust fund experts in multiple federal agencies 29 to see how delay could affect beneficiaries consider the current social security benefit payment schedule shown in table 1 this schedule may be changed at the discretion of the social security commissioner new beneficiaries payment dates are generally based on their day of birthfor example if retired worker was born on the first of the month eg june 1 his or her benefit check is paid on the second wednesday in the month 30 if trust fund insolvency caused delays in the benefit payment schedule benefit checks could be paid in the usual order first to those who receive benefits on the third of the month then to those on the second wednesday of the month and so on until the balance of the trust funds balance reached zero at that point benefits could be paid until more tax receipts were credited to the trust funds then benefit payments could be picked up where they ft off when the trust funds ran out this cycle could continue indefinitely under these circumstances all beneficiaries would receive full benefit checks in about nine months of each year after the trust funds first became exhausted the timing of these checks would be unpredictable 28 however congress retains the right to modify provisions of the social security act at any time which could affect the benefits current and future beneficiaries may receive 42 usc 1304 for more details see crs report rl32822 social security reform legal analysis of social security benefit entitlement issues by kathleen s swendiman and thomas j nicola 29 it seems most likely that benefits would be delayed thus reducing the number of full benefit checks paid it is unclear whether the social security commissioner or the other trustees would have the authority to reduce the benefit amounts specified by law the 1982 trustees report which projected impending trust fund insolvency stated that unless legislative changes were made inability to pay some benefits on time would result 1982 trustees report p 2 emphasis added 30 for beneficiaries who receive social security benefits based on another persons work record eg s pouse benefits their payment date depends on the birth date of the worker on whose record they receive benefits the current benefit payment schedule was first implemented for new beneficiaries in may 1997 by 2041 the number of beneficiaries being paid each week of the month will be approximately equal

or targeted in variety of ways for example congress could decrease social security spending this essentially means cutting benefits since more than 98 of social security spending is on benefits benefit cuts could be applied proportionately to all beneficiaries or structured to protect certain beneficiaries eg disabled or lowincome beneficiaries congress could also increase social securitys income by raising tax revenue eg raising payroll tax rates or the amount of wages taxed boosting interest income eg investing surpluses in stocks or adding new source of revenue eg transferring funds from the treasurys general fund tax increases could be applied proportionately to all workers or targeted to certain workers eg those who earn more than the taxable maximum over the long range ie 75 years the social s ecurity trustees project shortfall of 43 trillion in present value terms or 17 of taxable payroll the next section presents two of the policy options congress could choose to fill this gap the benefit cut scenario assumes that congress covers the annual cashflow deficit by cutting benefits across the board the tax increase scenario assumes that congress covers the annual cashflow deficit by raising the payroll tax rate both scenarios assume that congress waits until the trust funds become insolvent to make changes if made sooner the changes could be smaller since earlier changes could be spread to larger number of workers and beneficiaries over longer period of time 31 either scenario would essentially convert social security to pure payasyougo system in which income and outgo 31 the trustees estimate that 75year solvency could be restored through an immediate payroll tax increase of 17 percentage points split between employers and employees or benefit reduction of about 115 for all current and future beneficiaries these changes are about half as large as those required in 2041 2008 social security trustees report

one way to illustrate the effect of acrosstheboard benefit cuts on beneficiaries is to use replacement rates replacement rate is comparison between persons income before and after retirement it is one way of measuring the adequacy of persons postretirement income replacement rates can be calculated in different ways this report uses the same methodology as ssas actuaries which is to calculate workers initial social security benefit as percentage of his or her average indexed monthly earnings thus showing the proportion of earnings replaced by benefits32 benefits tend to replace higher proportion of lower earners wages than of higher earners wages since the social security benefit formula is progressive in 2008 the estimated replacement rate for medium earner retiring at age 65 is 39 under current law beneficiaries replacement rates are gradually decreasing as the full retirement age gradually increases from 65 to 67 replacement rates are an important measure of the adequacy of social security benefits social security was established to replace income lost to family as result of the retirement death or disability of worker to ensure that benefit levels keep up with increases in wages over time thus providing steady replacement rate to beneficiariesinitial social security benefits are indexed to wage growth historically wages have generally risen faster than prices which has allowed the standard of living to rise from one generation to the next33 indexing initial social security benefits to wages has allowed beneficiaries to reap the benefits of rising living standards34 replacement rates show the extent to which initial social security benefits keep up with wage growth and with rising standards of living figure 2 shows projected initial replacement rates under the benefit cut scenario for hypothetical low medium and high earner35 the low earner is assumed to have earned 45 of the national average wage during each year of his or her career about 19000 in 2008 and to receive monthly social security benefit of about 795 in 200836 the medium earner is assumed to have earned the average wage during each year of his or her career about 42000 in 2008 and to receive monthly social security benefit of about 1310 in 2008 the high earner is assumed to have earned 160 of the average wage during each year of his or her career about 67000 in 2008 and to receive monthly social security benefit of about 1740 in 2008 each year in the graph shows the projected replacement ra for each beneficiary if he or she turned 65 and retired in january of that year 32 this formula uses the highest 35 years of earnings covered by social security indexed to wages using the average wage index awi 33 the standard of living is usually measured in terms of income and reflects the quality of life that people enjoy including factors such as the quality of housing medical care transportation and communication 34 for more information on how benefits are indexed see

payroll tax rate so that the trust funds tax income would equal spending each year the trustees project that taking such an action at the point of insolvency would require combined employee and employer payroll taxes to increase from their current rate of 1240 to 1594 in 2041 the year in which the trust funds are projected to be exhausted rising to 1660 by 2082 the last year for which the trustees have projections to maintain balance after 2082 the social security trustees project that the payroll tax rate would likely need to increase further this is because the cost of social security is expected to grow due to us population aging and the design of the social security system figure 4 shows the payroll tax rates needed to pay scheduled benefits each year from 2008 to 2082

payroll tax rate would increase most workers taxes by the same proportion however since covered wages are taxable only up to specified maximum 102000 in 2008 the effective increase in the payroll tax would be smaller for people who earn more than the taxable maximum than for other workers about 6 of workers currently earn more than the taxable maximum 42 unlike the federal income tax the social security payroll tax is levied at flat rate starting at the first dollar of wages as result of this flat structure and the cap on taxable wages 42 crs report rl32896 social security raising or

security the sooner congress acts the smaller the changes need to be if congress acted today the benefit cuts or tax increases necessary to restore solvency until 2082 would be about half as large as those needed if congress waited until the trust funds became insolvent prompt action would also allow congress to gradually phase in changes rather than abruptly cutting benefits or raising taxes thus allowing workers to plan in advance for their retirements another reason to act sooner rather than later is that the trustees project that the combined trust funds will begin to run annual cashflow deficits in 2017 requiring the trust funds to redeem the bonds that they have accumulated in surplus years cashflow deficits do not affect social security directly but the redemption of the trust fund bonds puts pressure on the overall federal budget which is in deficit g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 kathleen romig analyst in
