native fijians following the coups of 1987 rabuka served under two interim civilian governments 19881989 and 19901991 he became leader of the indigenous fijian political party svt and was elected prime minister in 1992 position that he held until 1999 in 1990 he backed constitutional revisions that established ethnicitybased seats in parliament allotted more seats to fijians than indians and barred indofijians from becoming prime minister however in 1997 relenting to foreign diplomatic pressures and confident of his hold on power rabuka consented to new constitution that raised the number of indianheld seats added open or nonethnicitybased positions and allowed indofijians to become prime minister the 1999 elections general elections described as peaceful and democratic were held in may 1999 multiethnic coalition of five political parties the peoples coalition garnered twothirds majority and defeated the ruling svt party mahendra chaudhry the head of the labor party became fijis

at prices that were too low furthermore they resented the governments financial assistance to indians whose leases were not being renewed5 chaud hrys leadership style despite proposing populist economic policies6 mehendra chaudhrys leadership style raised the ire of opposition groups and even members of his own coalition his opponents characterized him as arrogant confrontational and condescending to critic s furthermore the prime minister feuded with the press over unflattering news coverage shortly before the political crisis erupted an indigenous fijian activist warned that chaudhry was inviting coup his labor party was reportedly taking steps to replace him with an indigenous prime minister7 interfijian rivalries many analysts argue that the coup attempt while ostensibly carried out for indigenous rights was also product of conflicts between western and eastern confederacies of indigenous fijians rich and poor and urban and rural interests speight and many of his supporters are from the kubuna confederacy or are poor and uneducated by contrast president mara is fijian nobleman from the relatively wealthy tovata confederacy some members of the great council of chiefs gcc the body of tribal elders that elects the president reportedly supported speight and hoped to end the long reign of president mara and his european and indofijian political and business allies8 protest marches in aprilmay 2000 the taukei movement nationalist organization that had staged demonstrations against the elected labor government in 1987 organized three marches demanding the removal of the chaudhry government one of them reportedly involved several thousand protestors their grievances included the perceived government encroachment on the prerogatives of the gcc feared reduction of land ownership rights and laying off of native fijians from civil service posts9 however according to some analysts indigenous fijians in the capital city of suva had little sympathy for the coup many other fijians while agreeing with some of speights professed nationalist sentiments did not support his methods10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20690crs4 11 under the lome

late 1990s his fijianeuropean ancestry american and australian university degrees and lack of fluency in fijian would seem to make him an unlikely candidate for indigenous fijian leadership however speights business interests had clashed with those of the chaudhry government and propelled him to the side of fijian nationalists in 1998 the rabuka government had hired speight to manage fijis fledgling timber industry when chaudhry came to power he not only dismiss ed many government officials including speight but also rejected contract with an american timber company with whom speight was associated the company total resource management had been working with speight and fijian landowners since 1996 the fijian landowners charged chaudhry with favoring british company in order to curry favor with the european union which buys fijian sugar produced by indian cane growers11 the military although little detailed information is yet available about the militarys role in the hostagetaking and attempted coup reports indicate that rogue elements of the fiji army some members of the fiji special forces and former fijian members of the british special air service sas
