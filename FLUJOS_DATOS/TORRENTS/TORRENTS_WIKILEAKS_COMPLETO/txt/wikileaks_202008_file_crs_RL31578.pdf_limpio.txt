recommendations put forward in various child nutrition bills introduced in the 106th congress see footnotes below overall they were estimated to have net cost of about 80 million in budget authority or 100 million in outlays for fy2000 fy2005 the majority of costs were ssociated with the commodity purchase provisions of section 241 nd partially offsetting savi ngs were derived from the provisions of child and adult care f ood program amendments of section 243 section 241 required the agriculture departme nt to increase the purchase of food commodities for distribution through the school lunch program in fy2000 and fy20016 for fy2000 it directed the department to buy 34 million worth of commodities over and above the amount alr eady scheduled to be provided for fy2001 it 1 temporarily changed the law as revised by pl 106170 noted above to remove mandate that any bonus co mmodities acquired for agricultural support purposes and donated to sc hools be counted toward minimum requirement that 12 of all school lunch assistance be in the form of commodities thereby forcing the purchase of more entitlement commodities to meet the 12 requirement and 2 mandated that the department buy an additional 21 million worth of commodities for schools as result it was estimated that mandatory commodity purchases for the school lunch prog ram in fy2001 would be some 76 million more than previously scheduled section 242 made changes to child nutriti on law to allow schools and wic agencies to take more active role in helping to identify and enroll eligible children for medicaid or assistance under the state child health insurance program schip7 it allowed schools to share income and othe r relevant informati on they collect when determining eligibility for free or reduced price meals in the school lunch program with state medicaid and schip agencies as long as there is written agreement that limits use of the information to identifying and enrolling children in medicaid or schip and parents are tified and given chance to opt out section 242 also established onestate pilot project unde r which wic administrative funds could be used to help identify and enroll eligible children in medicaid and schip and provided small grant to fray some of the added costs to local wic agencies section 243 incorporated number of amendments aimed at improving the integrity

centers12 as noted above in the discussion of legislation enacted in the 106th congress provisions of pl 106554 an appropriations measure loosened rules governing participation of forprofit child care centers in the cacfp by making an eligibility rule used in iowa kentucky and delaware nati onally applicable this rule allows private forprofit centers to get subsidies under the cacfp if at least 25 of their enrolled children meet the income requireme nts for free or reduced price meals the alternate standard for the rest of the c ountry tied the eligibility of forprofit centers to their receipt of at least some funding under title xx of the social security act social services block grants this restofthecountry standard greatly limits participation by forprofit centers because the major funding sources for child care have shifted since its adoption to child care and developmen t block grants and temporary assistance for needy families block grants there has been relatively little controversy over revising the eligibility rules for forprofit child care centers in the cacfp recognizing that tying their eligibility to receipt of title xx money is out of date and that requi rement that they serve significant proportion of lower income children is more targeted but the cost of doing so has stalled attempts to change them over the last several years and policy allowing pooling of title xx money has mitigated the restrictive eff ect of the resto fcountry rule for information on the pooling policy s ee the description of the cacfp in crs report rl31577 child nutrition and wic

appropriations bill and reauthorizationreview of child nutrition programs child and adult care food program cacfp family day care homes in 1996 the law governing the cacfp was changed to establish 2tier system of subsidies for family day care homes15 under this system the federal subsidy rates for mealssnacks are higher for homes located in lowerincome areas or operated by lowerincome provider as this change has been implemented two issues have been raised by orga nizations sponsoring family day care homes these sponsoring organizations perform admin istrative and technical assistance tasks for the individual homes they sponsor nd receive federal payments for doing so based on the number of homes sponsored sponsors contend that with the change in subsidy rules for day care homes the ol d law had single subsidy rate for all homes and fewer administrative tasks for sponsors they should receive larger administrative subsidy they also main tain that day care home operators should be eligible for the higher subsidies paid in the case of lowerincome operators without having to go through special income test if they already participate in federal or state incometested program with an income eligibility limit higher than the cacfp standard this they argue woul d ease administrative burdens and may have been an oversight in the 1996 change in law16 title vi section 6003 of s 940hr 1990 would have significantly increased cacfp payments made to day care home sponsors who handle individual homes administrative tasks and section 6002 of the bill would have allowed day care homes operated by providers participating in an incometested benefit program for lowerincome persons that has an income eligibility limit higher than the cacfp limit to qualify for higher subsidies without going through sepa rate income testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31578crs9 17 see the description of commodity distribution in crs report rl31577 child nutrition and wic programs background and

added one state illinois to the six states previously permitted to allow their cacfp operators to offer and receive federal subsidies for free suppers in outsideofschool programs for atrisk children in poor areas the six states already included were delaware michigan missouri new york oregon and pennsylvania going step further title vi section 6004 of s 940hr 1990 would have provide d cacfp subsidies for suppers nationwide instead of th limited number of states now covered commodity support for schools the 12 rule17 as noted earlier in the discussion of legislation enacted in the 106th congress section 241 of pl 106224 temporarily removed mandate that any bonus commodities acquired for agricultural s upport purposes and d onated to schools be counted toward minimum requirement that 12 of all school lunch assistance be in the form of commodities this ensured that the agriculture department would have to continue to purchase more entitlement commodities to meet the 12 requirement and thus increased the tota l amount of commodity support provided to schools this change was to have expired september 30 2001 in response section 4301 of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 continued the bonus commodity provisions of pl 106224 through fy200318 this effectively increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31578crs10 18 continued senate

department commodity purchas for schools by at least an estimated 50 million year for fy2002 and fy2003 however whether to count bonus commodities for purposes of the 12 rule is likely to recur as an

discussion of the 12 rule above the 107th congress acted to expand the presence of fresh fruits and vegetables in schools res ponding to concerns over the quality of food served in school nutrition

hawaii competitive foods current school lunch and sc hool breakfast program ru prohibit the sale of foods of minimal nutritional va lue primarily sodas and candies in competition with school meals in school food service areas during meal periods other competitive foods may be sold in food service areas during mealtimes only if all the income accrues to the benefit of the school or st udent organizations states and schools can impose additional restrictions on the sale of competitive foods but there are federal standards governing th offering of competitive f oods outside of food service areas during mealtimes or re lating to competitive foods that are offered for free significant number of sch ools have chosen to enter into contracts with and be paid by companies that offer competitiv foods often through vending machines or sometimes for free the agreements can be structured so that only one companys products are allowed on school grounds sometimes called pouring rights agreements when they involve sodas these foods are generally offered outside school food service areas and can be of vari ous types ranging from sodas to juices candies to vitaminenr iched grain products opposition including among school food service operators has developed to allowing schools to enter into these type s of agreements and thereby sanction the offering of potentially nonnutritious foods in compe tition with sc hool meal programs schools are seen as making m oney from the sale of food items that may run counter to the focus on improving child rens eating habits and nutrition status opponents ask for some type of federal rule barring schools in the school meal programs from allowing the service of nonnutritious foods or those of minimal nutritional value however school administrators and food companies with these agreements argue that 1 tight local sc hool budgets need the extra money raised by these agreements 2 not all competitive f oods are lacking in nutritional value and 3 the decision should be local one not dictated by federal rules s 745 the better nutrition for school children act of 2001 would have expanded the current rule against the sale of competitive foods by barring the sale donation or service without charge of foods of minimal nutritional value on school grounds during mealtimes with regard to the school day between breakfast and

pilot initiatives underway in iowa and wisconsin offering milk through school vending machines paperwork reduction in school meal programs for number of years child nutriti on law has included two rules called provision 2 and provision 3 that llow schools with high proportions of needy students to avoid the paperwork and ad ministrative burdens associated with certifying children eligible for free and re ducedprice school meals at little or net cost see footnotes 3 and 5 earlier in th is report in 1998 grant program was established to encourage schools to make greater use of these rules under this initiative originally scheduled to expi re september 30 2001 12 states received grants under which they provide technical and other assistance to schools that enable them to determine whether they should take advantage of these rules and how to do it on july 25 2001 the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry reported s 1246 the emergency agricultura l assistance act of 2001 this version of the houseapproved hr 2213 would have extended the time that the 12 grantee states could provide assistance to sept ember 30 2003 however the senate did not pass the senate committees ve rsion of the 2001 emergency agricultural assistance legislation instead it appr oved the house version which has been enacted as pl 10725 the house version did not include provisions to extend the paperwork reduction initiative the issue was resolved in the fy2002 agriculture depar tment appropriations law pl 10776 section 766 of this law dopted proposal in the senates version to extend the time the grantee states can provide assistance to september 302003 and required report on the activities of state agencies receiving the grants eligibility for military families all housing allowances granted to military personnel and reported on their leave and earnings statements are c ounted as income in determining eligibility for free and reducedprice school meals onbase housing provided free inkind income is not counted the department of defense is impleme nting privatized military housing policy under which formerly free housing operated by military authorities is converted to privately operated housin g or military personnel are moved from free to privately operated housing in these p rivatization scenario s military personnel are given housing allowance that they pa ss on to the private operator the housing allowance is counted it is included on leave and earnings statements and military families formerly eligible fo r free or reducedprice school meals can lose eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31578crs13 20 it should be noted that implementing po licy disregarding some housing allowances but continuedadvocates for military families and schools with large populations of children from military families argued th at families in privatized military housing were being unfairly penalized losing eligibility for free or reducedprice school meals when their circumstances have not substantively changed schools also argued that they were penalized because they lose out on funding allocated according to how large population of children receiving freereduced price meals they have widely used proxy for how poor the schools student population is hr 3082 hr 3216 and s 1973 all responded to these arguments and proposed to require that in cases where military personnel live in privatized housing their housing allowance not be counted as income in determining eligibility for free or reducedprice school meals on december 11 2001 hr 3216 was approved by the house however this action was overt aken with the enactment of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 the farm security and rural investment ac t of 2002 section 4302 of this law enacted the provisions of hr 3216 effective through fy2003 it is expected that the issue will reappear for final resolution in the 2003 child nutrition reauthor ization debate privatization of military hous ing presents slightly different problem for the wic program in termining income eligibility for wic benefits states may choose to exclude any housing allowance rece ived by military personnel residing offbase regardless of whether they live in priva tized housing all states have taken this option onbase housing provided free in kind income is not counted however housing allowances provided for onbase privatized housing must be counted miliary family advocates make the case that the current wic rule was predicated on an understanding that all on base housing is provided fr ee and would not be counted when judging eligibility they argue that conversion of onbase housing to privately operated housing units using housing allo wances should not deny wic eligibility since the families circumstances have not materially changed in response section 4306 of the 2002 f arm bill pl 107 171 amended wic law by adding an option for states to ex clude any housing allowance in cases where military personnel live in pr ivatized onbase housing the above noted immediate concerns over the treatment of military families housing assistance highlight larger underlyi ng issue for school meal programs that may be addressed when child nutrition laws come up for review in 2003 should the value of housing provided free be treated differently than cash housing allowances included in military paychecks under cu rrent law the value of housing provided free most onbase housing is not consider ed in judging eligibility for freereduced price school meal s but housing allowances are counted thus two otherwise identical military families can be treated differently depending on the type of military housing s upport they r eceive under the legislation noted above free housing will continue to be disregarded but housing allowances will be treated differently allowances provided for privatized housing will be disregarded but counted in other cases20 finally the legislation will continue the practice of following differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31578crs14 20 continued not others may prove to be administratively difficult for schools and hard to understand for parents 21 refer to recent report by

represented by an ongoing pilot project testing the results of offering free breakfasts to all st udents in participating schools this pilot was authorized in the 1998 child nutrition r eauthorization

activity act s 2821 proposed grants studies and new national nutr ition foundation because child nutrition and wic programs play significant role in participating childrens health status they likely would be an important component in all three initiatives the b ill would have authorized grants to state and local tities for school health initiatives related to prevention of overweight and obesity incl uding education and training for school food service professi onals and activities to improve the nutritional status of schoolchildren the agriculture department would have been directed to contract for study of its food and nutrition assist ance programs to investigate whether they are based on the latest scientific evidence whether they contribute to either preventing or enhancing overweight and obe sity among children and adults and whether they can be changed to contribute to the prevention of overweight and obesity and new national nutrition f oundation would have been established in the department of agriculture the f oundation was to be charged with supporting and carrying out research on and dissemin ating information about nutrition and food assistance programs including the nutritional effects of readily available competing foods at schools w ith school meal programs
