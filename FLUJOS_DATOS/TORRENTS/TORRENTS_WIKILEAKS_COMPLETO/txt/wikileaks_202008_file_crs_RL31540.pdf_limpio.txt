best known networks of maternity homes in 19th century america shielded mothers from psychologi cal or material worries during and after their confinement provided nutritional and medical services that encouraged healthy deliveries helped stressed individuals become better prepared to mother and helped arrange adoptions for mothers who lacked the means to raise their offspring11 the average length of stay in the homes was about 20 months and 60 of the mothers put their children up for adoption12 in 1935 when the aid to families with dependent children afdc program was enacted primarily to help widows car for their children federal funding to assist unwed mothers was established for the first time george liebmann an attorney and former counsel to the maryla nd department of soci services reports that as result of the afdc program the framework of the local maternity homes began to disintegrate through the afdc program cash aid was extended to unwed mothers to support and care for children in their own homes eventually and also as result of changing social attitudes toward nonmarital births maternity homes were widely viewed as obsolete around 1980 liebmann indicates in

providers may set various kinds of goals for their residents and the program in general to attain span suggested that primary goal should be understood and supported by the entities funding the program state and local social service agencies community groups and the teen mothers19 for example massachusetts administrators chose safety as the states primary goal for sch providers consequently st ate officials made contracts with private agencies to establish 27 second chance homes to provide safe and stable housing for unwed teen mothers and their children new mexico chose education as its primary goal and focuses on providing secure housing for t een mothers and assistance in preventing additional pregnancies so that they can complete high school and strive to go to college proponents maintain that shor t and longterm goals th at might be established for second chance homes include stressing the importance of protecting and nurturing the children of the mothers reuniting teens with and stabilizing their families building the selfesteem of the mothers suggesting alternatives to abortion and keeping foster care mothers united with their children among others20 what teen families are served most teen mothers who live in and ar assisted by second chance homes have experienced troubled lives many such mothers have undergone difficulties which might include living in poverty stricken and oftentimes abusive families suffering persistent neglect and possibly using drugs new challenge they must confront is parenthood living in structured sec ond chance home might not be easy for some teen mothers because in large number of cases such setting might be the first time they are required to follow strict rules and meet certain expectations21 because of such backgrounds of potential residents not all second chance homes are qualified to serve all teen mothers span noted that generally teen mothers under age 14 might be better suited for foster care because of their inab ility to assume primary responsib ility for the care of their offspring22 consequently second chance home providers have to determine whether there are teen mothers that they will not serve span gave several tips that second ch ance home providers could consider when deciding which teen mothers can or ca nnot be assisted these tips included determining the age range of teens to admit deciding what time limits if any will be set for periods spent at the home deciding whether teen fathers will be provided residential services and determining how to handle custody issues that is whether minor teen mothers living in such residences will remain in the custody of their parents or be in the custody of the state because of the criteria that most second chance homes apply some teen mothers will not be accepted in such instanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31540crs6 23 ibid p 15 24 greer telephone conversation 25 us dept of health and human services second chance homes providing services for teenage

been several analyses regarding service delivery approaches of di fferent programs that documented how the programs worked and provide d descriptions of the teen mothers and their children as result insights have been gained regarding the needs of the mothers and their children as well as in some cases pr ogram outcomes such as subsequent employment education or subsequent pregnancies63 successful outcomes have been reported according to hhs by several states or programs related to reduc tions in repeat pregnancies compared with the state average higher rates of mothers comple ting school lower rates of child abuse and neglect improvements in the health of mothers and children higher rates of mothers becoming employed and reduction in their dependency upon welfare64 n w mexico

the state and had the capacity to help 120 teen families on tanf and 16 teen families in the child welfare system span reported however that because of lack of funding massachusetts closed some of its sec ond chance homes consequently the housing capacity to assist such teens might have diminished it remained however the state with the largest network of such homes and according to span was good

reports that 90 of babies born to residents weigh more than the average birth weight for teen births which are expected to be high risk for low birthweight72 hhs cautions that there are limitations in using these results to make informed policy decisions about designing programs to assist such mothers because 1 results were based upon the participan ts selfreports that were not independently validated for accuracy 2 information was based on the reports of very small number of mothers and 3 results reflected the outcomes of mothers who remained with the programs or were tracked after leaving th programs hhs found that in nearly all cases there was other group used to co mpare outcomes in order to determine whether participating in second chance homes specifically made difference compared with what could have otherwise occurred73 the need for evaluation hhs concluded is being recognized as fundamental part of new programs design such information hhs believed not only could inform program operators and sponsors bout the general success of second chance home in accomplishing intended outcomes but could be useful in informing others interested in starting or re designing second chance homehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31540crs19 74 ibidhhs suggests four key issues and challeng that might be considered as more program administrators try to conduct accu rate program evaluations they are program size and capacity most second chance homes accommodate very small number of teen mothers and their children at one time usually six or eight because of the small numbers rigorous impact eval uations are more difficult measurements determining certain outcomes for mother and child such as acquiring high school diploma or ged might be easily quantified other outcomes such as good parenting skills or increased selfesteem might not be easily or quickly determined and might not surface for extended periods of time comparison for rigorous impact evaluation there is need to use two comparable groups s econd chance homes participants however would be difficult to sepa rate into two distinct groups neither program operators nor researchers hhs states would support the denial of services to teens and their children for purely research purposes often however there are places where there is more demand for service than the ability to serve in such instances applicants who are not selected hhs suggests could be included in study to compare outcomes followup and tracking certain key outcomes needed todetermine the effectiveness of second chance homes can be measured only after an extended period of time these outcomes include longterm employment subs equent higher earning and self sufficiency and child development outcomes many of the evaluations of second chance hom have data collected about participants while in the program tracking such teens after they have left program however has proven to be very difficult 74
