immediately following the delivery of the london congress lrh delivered 25 lectures to top auditors here is rons first fully embracive statement on auditor presence and altitude and the use of help control communication and interest as presession processes to get person fuly insession so these are the first prerequisites to auditing whatever else one knows and i would say are really the first prerequisites to living how can they live without them and i think the answer is they havent been living well these developments are brandnew they have lot to do with dissemination you can go out and use these points on your friends and all of sudden theyll be mysteriously interested in scientology when they never were before you can get people into session you never dreamed was possible before you can do various things with these theyre all prerequisites to auditing so go ahead and use them l ron hubbard history of this series the year was 1960 and since ron had established saint hill manor as an international dissemination center the scientology population had doubled in just ten months yet what ron next discovered was about to signal even greater growth all began with an investigation into what keeps preclear from being fully in session and the isolation of the one factor so vital to life that he described it as not only the makebreak point of sanity but the reason life is life grass grows and rain falls that factor was help this in turn revealed not just one but four factors requisite to preclear being fully insession he had to be willing to receive help under the control of the auditor in communication and interested in his own case but this discovery went even deeperthese four presession points were found to also hold the key to dissemination for the exact factors that kept being from interest in his own case likewise kept him from an interest in scientology itself thus the deadly quartet of help control communication and interest was born whats this series about in june 1960 ron presented the deadly quartet of help control communication and interest through series of four open evening lectures in the empire rooms on tottenham court road in these public lectures to scientologists and their friends ron demonstrated the use of these factors to revitalize anyones interest in lifeaccomplished through casual conversation and as to how that casual conversation might play out ron spelled it out in vivid detail while to bring that technology of revitalization to every scientologist he convened landmark congress at londons royal commonwealth society hall held on the 7th of august ron presented the power of presessioning both in auditing and in dissemination he further presented an undercut to those four steps revealing the real why behind mans often destructive behavior as defined by an expanded cycleofaction createsurvivedestroy why are these lectures important this is technology that cuts right to the core of deeprooted apathy and gradiently brings individuals to revitalized interestin their case in their environment and in life itself what youll learn how does help become betrayal why if you think of somebody you hate it is probably because you failed to help him what are the consequences of ones failures to help why being can only have bad luck or experience pain if hes in someone elses valence how do you straighten out marriage why must person not fail when dealing with the field of human relations why does touch assist work why do machines fall apart around one person and run well around another and what does this have to do with the cycleofaction why do peace conferences always fail what was lrh really investigating in those saint hill horticultural experiments whats the undercut to the deadly quartet why does one person get ill and another person doesnt if man is basically good why does he do evil things what is the most basic thing that makes scientology different from any other subject the specific questions that man asks himself over and over and worries about constantly whats the mechanism that causes person to resort to drugs why are people unwilling to confront their past lives how do you put thetan into prison and how do you get him to stay there how could you get general to confront an army the relationship between confront and investigation how one cannot do an inspection of something unless he is willing to confront it why injuries stay injured and why they heal in direct relationship to confront how person makes picture of something by resisting the actual experience how you can only make slave by making it impossible for people to observe truth what makes child go delinquent the lectures there are 7 lectures in this series on cd the four london open evening

something somebody else said uninspected as truth you have to do what we have done here in the last couple of decades and that is simply decide you dont know ruddy blasted thing and start all over again and of course when you do you start out on road of the freedom of truth lrh what is the cycle of knowledge by which one comes to know something ron introduces the idea that if it is true for you its true and shows how this leads to freedom of truth is man basically good or basically evil and if he is basically good why does he do evil things the importance of looking and finding out the truth for yourself 2 confront existence is basically composed of very few truths onto which have hung great many artificialities and which man has adorned with enormous numbers of lies and man is prisoner of his own shadows now one of the things you can do with man is get him to look up and find out that he can look through the shadows and look at the shadows and find out what they are lrh what is

gets tampered with why does man react to the subject of help and have such difficulty with it what happens to man when he feels he can longer help how does help turn into betrayal how you can obtain miraculous results just by talking to someone about help 4 help this is so fundamental that the reason life is life and people are together and grass grows and trees grow and apparently the rain falls
