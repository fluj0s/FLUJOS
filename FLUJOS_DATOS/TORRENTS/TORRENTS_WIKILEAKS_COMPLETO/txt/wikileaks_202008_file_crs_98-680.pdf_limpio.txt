sanctions iraqi civilians and especia lly children suffer and die from lack of adequate food and medical supplies despite the oil for food program and other international assistance they argue th at the sanctions are inhumane and should be lifted immediately on the opposing side fenders of internati onal policy argue that it is not the sanctions causing suffering but deliberate iraqi policies diverting resources and even manipulating the humanita rian crisis some also accuse iraqi officials of exaggerating the level of sufferi ng they point out that iraq can end the sanctions at any time by meeting th conditions of its 1991 surrender the security council established the oil for food program in december 1996 to alleviate the impact of sanctions on the civilian population since december 1996 the program has been extende d and amended to allow more oil to be sold in the face of evidence that civilian suffering conti nues but iraq alleges that the us and british governments deliberately hold up th arrival of humanitarian goods the united states and britain argue that the ir aqi government creates the delays itself on june 4 1998 the latest extension of the oil for food program began and will allow iraq to sell oil worth up to 45 billion to import humanitarian goods and pay for their distribution during this six month period bringing the volume of permitted oil

applied to iraq after its invasion of kuwait in 1990 the 1991 report of undersecretar general describing nearapocalyptic destruction in iraq at the end of the wa r led the security council to establish the current sanctions regime security c ouncil resoluti on 686 dopted on march 2 1991 prohibited all trade with iraq including the sale of oil limits were placed on iraqs ability to import food medicine or other humanitarian goods after the war however iraqs foreign assets were froze n under special oil for food program established by security council resolution 986 in april 1995 the sale of oil currently allowed may be used only to purchase g oods authorized by the security council the oil for food program is not the onl source of food available to iraq the iraqi government controls domestic food pr oduction and distribution this system prior to the war provided up to one th ird of domestic food the oil for food program is also not the only way iraq cu rrently sells oil some oil about 100000 barrels per day at below market rate prices is exported to jordan under longstanding program tacitly authorized by the united nations press reports indicate that about 100 million in oil per year is smuggled into turkey and sold on the black market other oil is also exported throug h iran and from seaports in the south such as basra for black market sale it is not clear how much this benefits the iraqi government the oil for food program is not the onl source of humanitarian aid to iraq both bilateral and multila teral aid continues to flow into the country as it has since the end of the war because and other humanitarian agencies provide aid to iraq both through the oil for food progra m and with other funding it is difficult to determine how much humanitarian assistance is provided outside of the oil for food program it is also impossible to determine the total am ount of multilateral and bilateral aid provided by all donors but unicef alone has spent 200 million since the end of the war on programs of health nutrition water san itation education and child protection in iraq the unicef budg et for iraq for 1997 independent of oil for food funded assistance was 16 million including 77 million donated by the united states unicef expects to spend 20 million during 1998 and 19991 similarly the development program budget included 128 million for

end of the war with iraq numerous surveys and studies have been made of the health and nutrition status of the civilian population mo st studies show continuing decline in health and nutrition of iraqi civilians especially children and the elderly but it is difficult to determine how much of the suffering is due to the sanctions imposed on iraq and how much is due to other factor s imposition of sanctions followed nearly decade long war between iraq and iran during which spending on the social welfare system declined the bombing dur ing the gulf war damaged or destroyed much of the public infrastructure such as water and sewage pl ants and many public buildings and since the end of the war iraqs government has repeatedly attacked with military force its minority populations in both the north and the south parts of the country leading to destruction of homes and growing population of displaced persons there is governmentimposed internal embargo on the northern kurdish areas which limits trade financial transactions and other commerce within iraq much of the information available on the conditions within iraq is also questionable in closed society such as ir aq information is pr ovided either with the concurrence of the iraqi government or in anecdotal form from people fleeing the country the iraqi government publicizes estimates that the death toll from the sanctions is

sources of information all timates of the number of deaths due to lack of f ood or medical care vary widely based on the source in an april 20 1998 speech calling for new look at the iraq sanctions european co mmissioner for humanitarian affairs emma bonino noted that despite the shortage of reliable information all the information gleaned from and private sources led her to the conclusion that the iraqi social fabric is badly eroded3 because iraq has not satisfied s ecurity council conditions for full lifting of the trade embargo the oil for food pr ogram was adopted by the security council as way of protecting the iraqi poor wh ile maintaining pressure on the iraqi government to abide by the terms of the peace agreement4 iraq did not accept the conditions of the oil for food program

improvements in the food suppl situation under the revised oil for food program malnutrition remained rious problem throughout the country unicef survey made in october november 1997 indicated that nearly 1 million iraqi children under five years old ar suffering from chronic malnutrition in the center and south of iraq the iraqi government maintains that the infant mortality rate has risen

malnutrition seen in iraq is caused by iraqi government activities and is imposed selectively iraqi dissident groups point out that the ration basket was supposed to be an addition to what the iraqi

subsidized food to some groups leaving the food basket the only food available for many people families of dissidents and army deserters as well as ethnic and religious minorities have lost their ration cards the special rapporteur on human rights in iraq noted in his march 1998 report to the econo mic and social council that the effect of the embargo is harsher on members of ethnic and religious minorities and that there exists discrimination in the allocation by the authorities of the limited resources available between rural and urban areas nd against the southern region with respect to the marsh people7 it should be noted that the human rights rapporteur has not been allowed into iraq for several years and this information is acquired second hand the us state department in february 28 1998 fact sheet on the oil for food program states that iraq s reduced its own purchases of humanitarian goods and diverted its own stocks to th military or placed them in warehouses for future use the united states asserts that iraq continues to spend its available funds on arms and benefits for the government lite and its supporters finally the united states points out the assessment team was in iraq during the 2 months when the iraqi government refused to sell oil thereby ex acerbating food shortages in resolution adopted by the security council to mitigate th effect of this iraqi shutdown of oil sales the security council noted in the text that the iraqi government bore full responsibility for hardships caused by its decision not to sell oil during the period others have questioned ir aqi statistics on whether there has been an unusually large number of civilian deaths particular ly among children under five according to the newsletter of the washington

march 1998 report10 noted that despite the fact that large variety of supplies have been delivered quantities received to date remain inadequa teoften covering only 20 percent of requirements the report suggested that some of the problems were caused by inadequate internal transport at all levels which led to an average time of 5 to 6 weeks to distribute supplies from wa rehouses to the rest of the country and that cold chain transport of medicines whic h need to be kept refrigerated is even worse other problems were caused by uncoordinated arrival of supplies such as injectable drugs but syringes some problems he blamed on personnel since the problems exist in both the northe rn administere d and central and southern areas iraqi government administered area it seems fair to fault administrators at least in part othe r problems were caused by the lack of prioritization of needs by iraqi governme nt personnel which led to oversupplies of some drugs and very low or quantities of others as well as poor communication between health care facilities and the minist ry of health or even within health facilities before the war iraq im ported an estimated 500 million in drugs and medical supplies annually or 75 percent of total needs the other 25 percent were manufactured locally according to ccounts in the press 200 million worth of medicine was delivered under th oil for

schools at the primary and secondary levels and for ssential supplies for students according to the march 1998 re port of the secretarygeneral only 12 percent of the educational s upplies of the first

primary school compared to 71 percent completing primary school in 198587 this discrepancy may be due in part to internal political disputes which have halted teacher pay by the government in the northern kurdish areas and the large increase in the number of displaced persons due to iraqi and kurdish military activity the oil for food program how the program works14 security council resolution

all the report noted many other examples of delays in both food and medical supplies secretarygeneral kofi annan in his february 1998 investigation of the delivery system agreed with many of these complaints he spoke of exceptional nd unprecedented complexity in the oil for food bureaucracy he pointed out other delays noting that only 25 of the phase i and ii water and sanitation equipment budgeted has arrived in the south and central parts of iraq though distribution is adequate delays have occurred in the installation of equipment due to lack of funds and qualified technicians in the northern governates 21 of supplies have arrived 15 while not disputing bureaucra tic slowness others argued that much of the delay has been caused by the iraqi government the march 1998 report of the
