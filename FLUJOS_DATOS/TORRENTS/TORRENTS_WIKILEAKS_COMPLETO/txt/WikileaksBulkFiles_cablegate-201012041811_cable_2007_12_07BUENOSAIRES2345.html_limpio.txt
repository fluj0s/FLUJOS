mcwhirter 121407 email to ds command center classified by ambassador wayne for reasons 14 b d summary 1 c the goa has repeatedly suspended ministeriallevel contacts and has cut off some law enforcement contacts with the usg in wake of the continuing furor ref over doj allegations that 800000 intercepted august 4 by argentine officials was brv cash contribution for cristina kirchners cfk presidential campaign the press reports that the goa is considering further responses including the staging of massive protest in front of the embassy which could involve radical and sometimes violent groups the argentine deputy foreign minister advised the ambassador that he would be called in to the mfa on december 18 the ambassador used previously scheduled holiday reception for more than 100 journalists to roll out washingtoncleared guidance reinforcing the message that the recent arrests in miami do not constitute us conspiracy against the goa and that the united states wants good relationship with argentina end summary goa ire against usg dominates headlines 2 sbu argentine media on december 14 continued to give extensive coverage to the goas furious reaction ref to fbi allegations that 800000 intercepted august 4 by argentine officials was brv cash contribution for cristina kirchners cfk presidential campaign according to several sources cfk was very angry and upset interpreting us arrests and charges as rejection of her overtures for better relations an attempt to destabilize her new administration and an effort to force her to distance argentina from venezuela following the lead of president kirchner her chief of staff and justice minister whose remarks ref were broadcast and rebroadcast throughout the day and night broad array of cfks congressional gubernatorial and mayoral allies have accused the usg of slandering cfk and the goa in premeditated fashion in its effort to get chavez 3 sbu opposition leader and presidential candidate elisa carrio who finished the october 28 polling in second place ridiculed the goas attempt to portray the arrests as part of an anticfk conspiracy president kirchner does not seem to understand that the justice system in the us is autonomous thank god cfk cannot stop the us justice system i am happy that the americans are investigating because theyre the best guarantee of an impartial inestigation not even the us president can intervene leaders of other opposition parties questioned cfks ties to caracas and criticized the goa for having let antoniniwilson leave the country before completing its own investigation goa gives the usg the silent treatment 4 sbu the press is further reporting that cabinet ministers have been instructed not to meet with the ambassador and that all us requests for highlevel meetings with goa officials must be coordinated through the mfa we are also hearing from our law enforcement contacts that they are being instructed by the goa leadership to minimize contacts with us several bilateral meetings were cancelled under instruction on december 13 the airport security police told embassy they had been instructed not to meet with us officials on the afternoon of december 14 the goa ended more than 24 hours of shunning contacts with the embassy when deputy foreign minister garcia moritan called the ambassador he advised the ambassador that he should come to the mfa to meet foreign minister taiana on the evening of december 18 we anticipate this will entail protest and an explanation of the steps the goa plans to undertake goaorganized antiusg protest in the offing 5 sbu nacion the newspaper of record and other media have reported that cfk and her top advisers repeatedly huddled wednesday night and thursday morning on how to deal with the worst moment of the bilateral relationship with the united states in the last four and half years according to nacion the casa rosada presidential palace thursday considered ordering mayors social organizations and activists piqueteros to organize mass demonstration of protest in front of the us embassy the article quotes an unnamed official at casa rosada who said we have not ruled it out there is great deal of anger with the united states but it has not yet been decided mission arso sent report on this development and mission countermeasures to ds command center ref b 6 sbu the press reported remarks by wha as shannon that the case was law enforcement matter not political issue and that it should not be allowed to affect bilateral relations the press also quoted department spokesman mccormack on the strength of the bilateral relationship and the independence of federal prosecutors as well as similar statements by the embassys spokesperson the empire strikes back mission pd response 7 u the ambassador used previously scheduled holiday reception for more than 100 print radio and tv journalists december 14 to roll out washingtoncleared guidance on the case several of the radio journalists used their cell phones to transmit the ambassadors words on the air through their stations and many rushed out after the ambassador concluded to call in stories several stories reporting on the ambassadors reception remarks have already hit the wires we expect that the ambassadors remarks will dominate argentine headlines saturday 8 u we also gave the journalists recent quotes by assistant secretary shannon secretary chao dana perino and the ambassador on the usargentine relationship we are posting the ambassadors remarks on the missions web page comment 9 c what began as black day for the us image in argentina with headlines filled with attacks by cfk and others about our supposedly dark intentions is ending on more hopeful note as the quick work by state justice and the fbi to review and clear our draft guidance on the issue enabled us to get our story out to captive group of argentine journalists as the first week of the cfk administration draws to close we have given pragmatists within the goa material to work with in their effort to convince cfk to climb back from the precipice and reengage with the usg as she begins the second week of her presidential term we will see their reaction and response in the days ahead wayne
