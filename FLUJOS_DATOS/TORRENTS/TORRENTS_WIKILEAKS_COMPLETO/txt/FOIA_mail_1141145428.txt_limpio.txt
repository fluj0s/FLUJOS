here it is original message from wahl eugene r sent tuesday february 28 2006 132 pm to jonathan overpeck cc keith briffa eystein jansen caspar ammann subject re wahl ritson ammann science article on vonstorch 04 hello jonathan keith and eystein i dont yet have any word from steve schneider concerning the wahlammann article on the mbhmm issues however here is something that slipped under my radar screen about which i should have made you aware previously ive attached the accepted version of the wahlritsonammann comment article on the vonstorch et 2004 science paper this the article that criticizes mbh for very large lowfrequency amplitude losses the final acceptance from science just came today and is copied below in this comment article specifically requested to be expanded to 1000 words by the science editors we note that the calibration and verification performance of the mbh method as implemented in vs04 show really poor lf fidelitywhich cannot happen if the mbh method is implemented according to its original form we note this which is explained by significant omission on the part of vs04 in implementing the mbh methodology detrending step that was only disclosed later last year in conference proceedings paper we also comment on physical and statistical reasons why detrending is not appropriate in this context we conclude that the large amplitude losses vs04 claims are simply not correct i am imagining that this contextualization of the vs04 critique would also be relevant for your chapter and it can now be considered in press as the from our science correspondent notes below i would think this acceptance makes it citable if not i understand note that this article is subject to the usual science embargo rules i do not believe that this means citation is embargoed cf 5th paragraph in copied message below which supports citation peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university 6078712604 copied message
