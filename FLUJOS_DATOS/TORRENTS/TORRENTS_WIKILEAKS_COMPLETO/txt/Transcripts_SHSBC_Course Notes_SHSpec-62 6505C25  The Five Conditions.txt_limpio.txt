6505c25 shspec62 the five conditions if it isnt written it isnt true is laid down so that rumors and verbal orders dont foul things up condition is an operating state each condition has formula that must be applied in order to change the state for the better dont misapply formulas if you know the conditions and their formulas you blow lot of the mystery that the rest of the world is sitting in emergency emergency is the most common state on this planet it is the condition of stats going the wrong way usually down over some significant period for instance it is declared by down stat for four consecutive weeks if stat that should go up goes down or vice versa youve got emergency the condition has to be declared by secretarial executive directive which is causative order certain steps then have to be done the first action is promote if an organization or produce if an individual when this has been done but not before economize dont economize on promoting if you do you inhibit getting out anything in order to produce enough money to raise the stat if this happens you will find yourself smaller and weaker after recovering from the crisis taxation is page out of das kapital from each according to his ability to pay to each according to his need dont economize until after you have promoted or produced if an artist in need of money economized first on materials he would have little or nothing to draw with therefore he would have little to sell so he would have trouble getting out of the financial hole after promotion is well in hand economize and prepare to deliver if you apply the affluence formula and economize when you are in emergency you will either stay in emergency or if you recover the organization will be smaller and of less scope also part of the emergency formula is to change your operating basis or you will head back into another condition of emergency youve got to stiffen discipline you have to stop going down to the pub every night do your homework be little more regular on the job work little harder dont goof quite so much if the activity does not come out of the condition of emergency after that state has been assigned then you have to use discipline because life itself is going to discipline the individual very cruelly cog that is why protecting person from the consequences of his actions is outethics you should give the person consequence beforehand that parallels life but anticipates it if the steps of emergency are not taken successfully even if they are taken and the condition of emergency is prolonged it has to walk forward into an ethics matter because someone must be sitting on most of the comm lines goofing like crazy there must be some ethical problem involved for the condition to be continuing normal operation this is the next condition up from emergency it isnt stable unchanging state because everything in the mest universe either expands or contracts nothing stays really unchanging there are laws against it so in order for normal operation to be stable state it must be continual small increase there must be gradual routine increase the way you maintain small increase is to just let everything continue dont change anything dont put in any harsh discipline ethics and justice is mild and reasonable carefully observe every slightest rise of statistic to see what bettered it and do that for every slight worsening find out why usually it is something nonstandard remedy it jockey change and repair back and forth keep an oic board this keeps your improving statistics going up statistic that stays level isnt normal operation its emergency because one should be expanding if only to keep up with inflation the stat must keep pace with the world around it for instance salary that doesnt rise over two to three years is stable really down statistic and will tend to crash what looks level is really declining if one then economizes which is the affluence formula then you will really be in an emergency continuing this practice will result in collapse sooner or later matter and everything else in this universe obeys these laws or conditions the roman empire went into affluence brought about bv julius caesar but it violated the affluence formula they didnt deliver and they didnt economize instead they squandered the wealth of the empire on socalled conquest they treated the condition as normal julius caesar violated the commercial pax romana normal op which was stable by going off conquering tribes etc britain was trading with rome very happily then caesar came over and fought added britain to the empire gave them slavery not civilization and the empire collapsed in the year 0 ad or 1 ad the chinese conquered russia in siberia driving people west wave of displacement took place with the russians driving eastern european peoples into western europe rome didnt handle them it didnt resettle them or whatever they had boundaries to defend so they resisted the barbarian invasions and got overwhelmed it was all matter of the wrong condition being applied the russians who were in emergency didnt apply that condition either there is such thing as nocondition state state of emergency persists until it is handled even if one loses one gets stuck in the incident and goes on even after something has gone down to collapse it persists the condition continues all the way down even beyond death the dwindling spiral is really just applying the wrong formula for the condition affluence the condition of affluence is one which is dangerous surprisingly enough for instance gambler who hits it big is in danger of getting himself in debt instantly the first thing to do now is economize you must economize first then make very sure that you dont buy anything with any future commitment to it eg installment purchases dont hire anybody with any future commitments that is all part of that economizing clamp it down find every bill and debt you can pay and pay them now invest the remainder in service facilities make it more possible to deliver discover what caused the condition of affluence and strengthen it conduct research to discover what caused it it is something you are doing doubt power and power change the condition above affluence is power change for instance someone is very successful and gets promotion the correct formula is usually violated the new man errs by changing things the formula for power change is just because power has changed dont change anything new broom sweeps clean violates this formula if the operation was successful as it was running the new exec would be silly to change things but that is what people usually do it is easy to inherit successful hats just step in the boots and dont walk all the pressure points will come to you to make changes but the person before you must have resisted these successfully if your predecessor didnt sign it dont sign it dont do anything keep your eyes open learn the ropes see how the place is running apply normal operation to it if it is in normal op there are only two circumstances that need replacement success or disaster if it is successful there is nothing to change if someone can keep an organization doing well he is eventually promoted creditably and moves up to higher power position he would be leaving his organization or his post in condition of power if you move into the position of someone who left in disgrace so the place is in emergency just apply the emergency formula promote for starters keep the promotion going until stats start to rise then economize like mad condition of power is most interesting it is peculiar in that it apparently belies what you would normally think or expect to do as an operating thetan because that is condition of power what you mustnt do is disconnect that will bring about catastrophe for you and for anyone else its the violation of that condition alone thats brought about implanting trapping and an antagonism towards thetans guy who becomes powerful on wall street and disconnects from his old home town friends exemplifies this they resent it people are in fact so used to the power formula being violated that they dont expect celebrities that they used to know to talk to them they think you are going to disconnect it is hard to get people to continue talking to you because they feel that you are superior you have to break down the communication barrier when you come back from saint hill people may be in awe of you somewhat again it is up to you to break down the comm barrier people will be sure that you dont want to be in comm anymore beings in the universe fully expect you to violate the power formula if an organization gets to the point where it is fully selfsufficient in need of pcs students etc and disconnects from those around it people in the community will start thinking about implants mistakes and violating any freedom thetan might have they will get very suppressive they are being denied service for one thing one of the most dangerous things we could do would be not to make what we know available when you move out of position on power change the only way you can disconnect is to take ownership and responsibility for your connections the condition of power change is fellow assuming position that has been held from power to disconnect you have to make record of all of your lines you show what is there so that the replacement can then see what not to change make record of your whole post or you will be stuck with piece of that post to the end of time also you might check in once in awhile to see how your replacement is doing guy gets time track by not taking responsibility for something in this universe it is foul trick to permit death people write last will and testament but they dont take responsibility for their former positions by transferring their lines and writing up the post for their successors probably also have trouble checking in from time to time do all you can to make the post occupiable for fun look at the condition of government and the formula it is applying keynes economic law is increase want
