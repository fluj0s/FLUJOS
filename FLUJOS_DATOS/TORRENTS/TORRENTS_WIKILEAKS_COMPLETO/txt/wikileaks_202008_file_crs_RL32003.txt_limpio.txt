known as the hatchwaxman act the hatchwaxman act made several significant changes to the patent laws designed to encourage innovation in the pharmaceutical industry while facilitating the speedy introduction of lowercost generic drugs however over the 18 years since its passage concerns have been expressed as to whether or not implementation of certain portions of the law has led to unintended consequences contrary to the original intent some argue that brand name companies andor generic firms have exploited provisions of the act to prevent the timely marketing of less costly pharmaceuticals other experts maintain that while few isolated cases of misinterpretation of the law have arisen these can be addressed through existing procedures and that legislative changes are not necessary2 the two bills currently under consideration would address hatchwaxman related issues of drug patents listed in the orange book patent challenges by generic firms and the award of market
