us efforts are underway to prevent foreign court libel judgments from infringing on the first amendment guarantees of press freedom on may 7 senator joseph lieberman ict was among those announcing introduction of the free speech protection act which has been referred to the senate judiciary committee for consideration he explained the united kingdom has become popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world because under english law it is not necessary for libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the united states lynne bradley director of american library associations office of government relations explains the alas july 31 decision to support the bill ala is concerned that foreign libel lawsuits threaten us authors and publishers and our freedoms of speech and the press through its chilling effect such venue shopping also denies the american people the right to read and to access informationanother inherent first amendment right essential to our democratic form of government the ala has endorsed the bill which is cosponsored by senators arlen specter rpa and charles schumer dny auchi is not the only one taking advantage in the uk several books have been pulped and removed from libraries and booksellers after threats of expensive drawn out litigation by wealthy arabs and others while islamist illegal combatants captured

his background his leftist terrorbomber backers his god damn america pastor his cocaine use his financial dealings with indicted syrianborn businessman tony rezko or with saddam hussein crony and oilforfood banker nadhmi auchi they are mistaken intimidation apparently i was mistaken after american thinker received letter from carterruck the sentence was chopped off after the word rezko many website operators simply do not have the legal or financial resources necessary to face off with carterruck larry johnson of the quarter blog received and posted online february 18 demand letter from carterruck which claims auchi was not involved in any of saddam husseins operations carterruck even demands removal of material in the comments section below johnsons blog postings similar claims as well as misspellings are contained in other of peppers letters seen by this writerperhaps indicating that the auchi threat letter machine is nearing its operational limits and might fail if internet users revolt and begin randomly posting deleted auchi material all over the internet in an act of cybercivildisobedience senator liebermans free speech protection act is modeled on rachels law signed april 30 2008 by new york governor david paterson rachels law had passed both houses of the new york state legislature unanimously march 31 after being introduced with bipartisan support rachel is rachel ehrenfeld an investigative journalist and author of funding evil how terrorism is financed and how to stop it ehrenfelds 2003 book published in the us pointed to saudi multimillionaire khalid salim bin mahfouz as funding source for alqaeda prior to 911 mahfouz sued he is saudi the book its author and publisher are american but rather than coming to us court mahfouz selected english jurisdiction in typical case of libel tourism ehrenfeld did not answer the english suit and instead countersued in us federal court legal assaults from middle eastern sources are becoming so widespread that the middle east forum has founded the legal project to raise funds and recruit some of the nations finest attorneys willing to stand up probono for free speech and defend writers against lawsuits and intimidation six weeks after governor paterson signed rachels law the new york times published out of step with allies us defends freedom to offend in speech painting us free speech as out of step with almost every other country because socalled hate speech is not banned the times primary examplea trial in british colombia where the canadian islamic conference accuses macleans magazine of violating canadian hate speech laws for publishing an excerpt from mark steyns book america alone the end of the world as we know it according to the times the muslims demand the magazine should be forbidden from saying similar things forced to publish rebuttal and made to compensate muslims for injuring their dignity feelings and selfrespect canadas laws are similar to those in britain and the many other countries with which the us is out of step as negative comment raged across the internet the times scrubbed its own article removing out of step with allies from the title also quoted in the times jeremy waldron new york university law professor wrote in the new york review of books may 29 it is not clear to that the europeans are mistaken when they say that liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack silent treatment us media outlets are historically strong defenders of press freedoms but there has been neartotal silence about the ukbased legal threats to public discussion of the rezko affair while auchis interference may explain part of the medias lack of interest the attitude of the new york times and new york review of books goes long way towards explaining the rest if elected president obama will be required to swear to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states will senator obama now join in cosponsoring s2977 the free speech protection act of 2008 and call upon his fellow democrats to bring the bill to the floor of the senate for vote if not will obama explain why the free speech protection act is not necessary to preserve protect and defend the constitution will reporters covering the campaign ask obama whether if elected he would approve request for us residency from auchi are the media now cooperating in their own silencing the attitude of the new york times does not bode well
