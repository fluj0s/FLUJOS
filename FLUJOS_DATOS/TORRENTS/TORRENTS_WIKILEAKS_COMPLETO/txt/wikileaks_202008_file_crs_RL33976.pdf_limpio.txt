forms of domestic trade remedy laws antidumping law ad which combats the sale of goods at less than their fair market value and countervailing duty law cvd which assess duties on imported goods to offset the amount of government or other public entity subsidization both of these remedies are available when the imported goods come from competitor countries that have free market policies since 1984 however only ad law has been applied to those imported goods that come from nonmarket or other transitional economies with the continued economic growth of some nonmarket and transitional economies such as china and vietnam pressure has increased on the us government to more aggressively utilize domestic trade remedy laws such as ad and cvd against unfair imports from these countries ad law has been amended several times since its initial inception in 1921 each modern amendment has allowed for new methodology for dealing with imports from nonmarket economies with congresss continued statutory guidance the department of commerce doc has developed and implemented several different methodologies for applying ad law even when the fair market value in the originating country is not readily ascertainable cvd law however has not been used against nonmarket economies since the doc concluded in 1984 that it could not determine subsidization in such situations this decision by the doc was upheld as reasonable by the court of appeals for the federal circuit in georgetown steel corporation v united states since that time with the noted exception of 1991 petition against china the doc has refused to review cvd petitions against nonmarket economies in november 2006 however the doc accepted petition seeking countervailing duty against imported coated freesheet paper from china to offset alleged government subsidization in april 2007 the doc published preliminary determination levying duties against the chinese imports as well as memorandum distinguishing the chinese economy from those economies that were at issue in the georgetown steel case while such an action appears to be consistent with us law review of us international obligations under the world trade organizations wtos agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures as well as chinas accession agreement to the wto is also required both agreements appear to accept and sanction the use of surrogate country data in the application of domestic ad or cvd law as result while challenge to its actions at the wto is always possibility the united states appears to have acted in manner consistent with its obligations several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the 110 th congress to specifically address the application of cvd laws to nonmarket economies these include but

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 as generally applied antidumping ad law cons iders dumping to have occurred when foreign manufacturer charges price that is less than the fair market value ltfmv for its product1 for dumping that is alleged from marketbased economies the department of commerce doc employs standard methodology for determining products fair market value first the doc determines whether foreign manufacturers goods were sold in the united states for ltfmv by comparing the us price of the product with th fair market value similar merchandise in the firms domestic market if the product is not sold or offered for sale in the foreign firms domestic market the doc identifies the price at which the product is sold or offered for sale in countries other than the united states finally if there are sales in the home market or to third countries the statute authorizes the doc to utilize constructed value 2 if the doc finds that dumping has occurred it establishes the dumping margin by calculating the average amount by which the products fair market value exceeds the price of the product in the united states3 the finding of dumping and the fixing of the dumping margin establish the first of the two prongs required to impose an ad duty the final step in imposing an ad duty is an affirmative determination that the dumping has caused or threatens to cause material injury to us industry 4 the injury determination is made by the international trade commission itc an independent agency 1 see 19 usc 1677 2000 2 see 19 usc 1677ba2 2000 defining the use of constructed value 19 usc 1677be1 2000 providing the method of calculating constructed value 3 19 usc 1673bb1a 2000 4 see 19 usc 16777a 2000 stating that the term material injury means harm which is not inconsequential immaterial or unimportant the statute requires that for threatened injuries the itc support its findings by evidence that the threat of material injury is real and that actual injury is imminent and not merely based on conjecture or supposition see 19 usc 16777fii 2000

as applied to nonmarket economies the standard methodology described above causes problems because nonmarket economies do not allocate resources according to traditional market concepts of supply and demand thereby making determinations of fair market value almost impossible from the adoption of the antidumping act of 19215 until the passage of the trade act of 19746 the application of ad law to nonmarket economies was devised and implemented exclusively through administrative agency action as the statutes were silent in the 1960s the treasury department which was at the time the agency with responsibility over domestic trade remedy laws developed and began using what was known as the surrogate country approach for applying ad law to nonmarket economies under this approach comparable prices and costs from similarly situated third countries were substituted for the nonmarket economy to determine fair market value 7 this approach was adopted and codified by congress in the trade act of 19748 according to at least one legal scholar the surrogate methodology proved difficult to apply because there were occasions when there was available surrogate therefore it was necessary to devise an alternative methodology to use when an appropriate surrogate could not be located9 the treasury department responded to the concerns raised by the surrogate country approach by adopting new methodology in 1975 this methodology known as the factors of production approach required that the amount of each factor input be taken from market economy country considered to be at comparable stage of economic development10 congress expressly adopted this approach in the trade agreements act of 1979 as an alternative to be used in nonmarket economy cases where there was available surrogate country11 in 1988 congress again acted to adopt new ad provisions for dealing with nonmarket economies in the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 otca12 congress enacted numerous reforms to the antidumping laws starting with definition of nonmarket economy as well as set of standards that the doc was to take into consideration when determining whether specific country is nonmarket economy according to the otca nonmarket economy is country that does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures so that sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise13 the 5 antidumping act of 1921 ch 14 205 42 stat 9 13 1921 6 trade act of 1974 pl 93618 321 88 stat 1978 2074 1974 7 see department of commerce bicycles from czechoslovakia

methodologies to be used in determining the fair market value in ad investigations involving nonmarket economies according to the doc market value should be determined according to 1 the home market prices of such or similar merchandise in surrogate country 2 the export price of such or similar merchandise shipped from surrogate 3 when actual or accurate prices are not available the constructed value of such or similar merchandise in surrogate country and 4 the value in surrogate country of the factors of production used in the nonmarket economy for such or similar merchandise see 19 cfr

determination regarding countrys status as nonmarket economy include i the extent to which the currency of the foreign country is convertible into the currency of other countries ii the extent to which wage rates in the foreign country are determined by free bargaining between labor and management iii the extent to which joint ventures or other investments by firms of other foreign countries are permitted in the foreign country iv the extent of government ownership or control of the means of production v the extent of government control over the allocation of resources and over the price and output decisions of enterprises and vi such other factors as the administering authority considers appropriate 14 in addition the otca provides the doc with significant administrative discretion for determining when foreign country is an nonmarket economy according to the statute the determination of nonmarket economy status may be made with respect to any foreign country at any time and remains effective until expressly revoked by the doc15 moreover the docs determinations are not subject to judicial review in any antidumping investigation16 with respect to ad methodologies the otca amended the ad laws to require that the factors of production approach was the preferred method of applying the law to nonmarket economies17 despite this express statutory change however the doc appears to have retained significant amount of discretion with respect to its application the legislative history of the otca seems to support the docs broad claims of discretion indicating that the doc is to determine on casebycase basis whether the available information permits the use of the standard methodology or whether different approach is warranted 18 as further evidence of its discretion to determine which approach to use when determining fair market value the doc stated that it would apply the various methodologies in the following order of priority 1 prices paid by the nonmarket economy manufacturer for items imported from market economy 2 prices in the primary surrogate country of domestically produced or imported materials 3 prices in one or more secondary surrogate countries reported by the industry producing the subject merchandise in the secondary country or countries or 4 prices in one or more secondary surrogate countries from sources other than the industry producing the subject merchandise 19 14 19 usc 167718b 2000 15 19 usc 167718c 2000 16 19 usc 167718d 2000 17 see 19 usc 1677bc2000 stating that when the subject merchandise is exported from nonmarket economy country and b the administering authority finds that available information does not permit the normal value of the subject merchandise to be determined the admini stering authority shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers coverings and other expenses 18 see s rep 10071 100th cong 1st sess 108 1987 stating that the bill does not prohibit the doc from using its normal methodology for determining foreign market value in cases regarding nonmarket economy countries if information submitted by nonmarket economy country to the doc permits foreign market value to be determined accurately using the normal met hodology then the committee expects such methodology to be used by the doc see also conf report 100576 100th cong 2d sess 591 1988 19 department of

exclusive remedy for us industries when confronting unfair trade practices from nonmarket economies as discussed below however the recent applicationafter 23year abstention by the docof countervailing duty law to china nonmarket economy would appear to potentially provide adversely affected industries with another option for combating unfair trade practices from nonmarket economies

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 countervailing duty laws cvd are designed and intended to provide relief to domestic industries that have been or are threatened with the adverse impact from imported goods sold in the us market that have been subsidized by foreign government or other public entity specifically the relief provided takes the form of an additional import duty on the subsidized imports the duty levied is to be equal to the estimated amount of the government or other public subsidization similar to ad law for an industry to obtain relief both the itc and the doc must make conclusive determinations the doc must find that the targeted imports have been subsidized and itc must find that the domestic industry has been materially injured or threatened with material injury due to the subsidized imports

however us cvd laws have not been traditionally applied to nonmarket economies this is largely as result of 1984 determination by the doc that there is adequate way to measure market distortions caused by subsidies in an economy that is not based on market principles the first determination by the doc regarding the application of cvd law to nonmarket economies involved carbon steel wire rods manufactured in czechoslovakia and poland both of which were nonmarket economies 20 at the time of the docs decision the united states had two separate cvd statutes the first 303 of the tariff act of 193021 applied whenever any country dependency colony province or other political subdivision of government person partnership association cartel or corporation shall pay or bestow directly or

enacted as part of the trade agreements act of 1979 and intended to bring the united states into compliance with the agreement on the interpretation and application of articles vi xvi and xxiii of the general agreements on tariffs and trade subsidies code that had been negotiated in geneva under the auspices of the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt23 section 701b applied cvd law to country under the agreement and required that the united states first make determination that the subsidized imports either caused or threatened to cause material injury to an industry in the united states or caused the establishment of an industry in the united states to be materially retarded 24 because neither poland nor czechoslovakia were signatories to the 1979 subsidies code the doc conducted its investigations of the alleged subs idization of carbon wire steel rod pursuant to section 303 of the tariff act25 at the preliminary determination stage the doc found that the phrase any country meant that government entity could be excluded on per basis from the cvd law26 at the final determination stage however the doc indicated that it had failed to address second jurisdictional element namely w hether government activities in nonmarket economy confer bounty or grant within the meaning of section 30327 in evaluating this element the doc determined that countervailable subsidies cannot conceptually speaking be found within nonmarket economy and therefore cannot be included within the scope of the phrase bounty or grant 28 to justify its final determinations the doc relied on the rationale that subsidy is an action taken by government or other public entity that distorts or subverts the operation of the free market since all costs prices and profits in nonmarket economies are centrally controlled ie by the state the concept of subsidization is arguably meaningless as there are market forces to subvert or distort in other words because subsidy is essentially market phenomena it has meaning or purpose in nonmarket economy 29 in addition according to the doc while resources may in fact be allocated inefficiently relative to similarly developed market economy it is impossible to state with any degree of certainty whether the misallocation results from subsidization or from central planning30 furthermore the doc noted practical problem with determining the amount of subsidization from nonmarket economy specifically the doc stated that because all economic activity in nonmarket economy is centrally controlled there exists way to practically disaggregate government action in such way as to identify the exceptional action that is subsidy31 the doc in determining that its conclusion was consistent with its statutory authority conducted review of the applicable cvd statutes and their legislative histories based on this review the doc held that congress has never confronted directly the question of whether the 23 see trade

the doc pointed to amendments to us trade remedies law made by congress in both 1974 and 1979 to justify its determination the doc noted in particular that while congress addressed import violations by nonmarket economies by adopting section 406 of the trade act of 1974 and by making changes to the antidumping laws it declined to make corresponding changes to cvd law33 therefore in light of congresss silence with respect to the application of cvds to imports from nonmarket economies the doc concluded that as the administering agency it possessed broad discretionary authority with respect to the question of whether countervailable subsidy could exist in nonmarket economy situation 34

court of international trade cit in continental steel corp v united states 35 disagreed with the agencys conclusion that subsidies cannot by definition exist within nonmarket economy as result the cit reversed and remanded the case back to the doc for further investigation the cit took specific issue with two of the docs holdings first the cit noted that the doc committed fundamental error in its premise that subsidy can only exist in market economy36 second the cit argued that the docs determination was at odds with the plain meaning and purpose of the law contradicts judicial interpretations of the law and is inconsistent with past administration of the law37 regarding its second point the cit noted that section 303 of the tariff act of 1930 makes distinctions based on the form of any countrys economy and on its face shows meticulous inclusiveness and an unwavering intention to cover all possible variations of the acts sought to be counterbalanced38 according to the cit the docs adoption of per rule that subsidies cannot exist in nonmarket economies served to effectively amend cvd law by administrative fiat and therefore was irrational arbitrary and contrary to law39 regarding the docs determination that subsidies are purely market phenomena and thus not applicable to nonmarket economies the cit argued that the problem is essentially one of measurement and not one of meaning40 the cit pointed to the application of antidumping law to nonmarket economies and noted that the use of surrogate or other substitute values for free market values does not deter the doc from determining dumping margins therefore the absence of free market values similarly should not serve to deter or prevent the doc from being able to calculate subsidy margins 41 32 id at 19373 33 id

georgetown steel corp v united states 42 the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the cit and reinstated the docs conclusions the court focusing first on the docs holding that the terms bounty and grant as contained in section 303 of the tariff act of 1930 were not intended to apply to nonmarket economies held that the question could not be answered by relying on the statutes plain language43 the court noted that when the statute was initially enacted in 1897 there were nonmarket economies therefore congress had reason to have addressed the issue 44 according to the court the fact that in the six subsequent amendments to the cvd statute congress made attempt to address the issue of the statutes application to nonmarket economies strongly suggests that congress did not intend to change the scope or meaning of the provision that it had first enacted in the last century45 the court then discussed the two most recent amendments to the cvd laws and observed congresss belief as evidenced by both the acts themselves and their legislative histories that changes in the antidumping law were necessary to make that law more effective in dealing with exports from nonmarket economies coupled with its silence about application of the countervailing duty law to such exports strongly indicates that congress did not believe that the latter law covered nonmarket economies46 in other words according to the court congress intended to deal with imports from nonmarket economies being sold at unreasonably low prices under antidumping law not cvd law47 in conclusion the court relying on accepted principles of administrative law afforded the doc substantial deference with respect to its decisions regarding the application of cvd law to non market economies specifically the court held that the doc has broad discretion in determining the existence of subsidy under us cvd law48 and that the docs conclusion that subsidies cannot be found in nonmarket economies was reasonable in accordance with the law and not an abuse of discretion49 g18g152g156g157g561 g9g142g152g155g144g142g157g152g160g151g561g21g157g142g142g149

industry was sufficiently marketoriented that the doc could reliably use the economic data provided by the industry itself consistent with the standards utilized for cvd investigations in market economies51 according to the doc to determine whether an in dustry is sufficiently marketoriented three part test is utilized first there must be virtually government involvement in setting prices or amounts to be produced52 second the industry should be characterized by private or collective ownership there may be stateowned enterprises in the industry but substantial state ownership would weigh heavily against finding marketoriented industry53 finally marketdetermined prices must be paid for all significant inputs whether material or nonmaterial eg labor and overhead and for an allbutinsignificant proportion of all the inputs accounting for the total value of the merchandise under investigation54 the doc ultimately concluded that while some of the inputs for the ceiling and oscillating fans were in fact obtained from market sources there remained significant portion of the inputs that were not and therefore the industry as whole did not qualify as marketoriented industry55 as result of this determination the doc held that cvd law did not apply to the chinese ceiling and oscillating fan industry56 some commentators and scholars have objected to this socalled marketoriented industry approach because the test especially the third prong almost guarantees that such industries will be found57 in addition some critics have contended that the docs determination that significantly all factor input prices must be marketdriven is ambiguous and may lead to arbitrary results such arbitrary results accordin g to critics arguably play role in creating uncertainty for nonmarket economy producers with respect to us trade remedy laws58 furthermore it appears possible to argue that under this approach nonmarket economy can enact substantial market based reforms while remaining immunized from cvd investigations59 although the docs determination in oscillating and ceiling fans from the people s republic of china appears to have opened the door to the potential

prohibited from applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economies nothing in the language of the countervailing duty statute excludes nonmarket economies 68its holding with respect to georgetown steel and its meaning is arguably dicta as it does not appear to have been necessary to the conclusion that the court lacked jurisdiction in publishing its preliminary findings the doc also issued memorandum that directly confronts the georgetown steel precedent69 the memorandum provides justification as to why chinas economy in 2005 the period for which the investigation is concerned with and the socalled sovietstyle economies are distinguishable such that it is now possible to apply cvd law to some nonmarket economies70 it is important to note that the memorandum and preliminary cvd determination do not in any way change or alter chinas formal status as nonmarket economy71 rather the memorandum and justification focus on whether the rationale used to prevent cvd law from applying to non market economies in 1984 remains true for modernday china the memorandum concerns itself with five major areas of the chinese economy wages and prices access to foreign currency personal property rights and private entrepreneurship foreign trading rights and allocation of financial resources 72 while the specific economic analysis and details are beyond the scope of this report the memorandum concludes that unlike the socalled sovietstyle economies at issue in georgetown steel chinas present economy does not contain the same obstacles to determining the existence of subsidies according to the memorandum private industry now dominates many sectors of the chinese economy and entrepreneurship is flourishing foreign trading rights have been given to over 200000 firms many business entities in presentday china are generally free to direct most aspects of their operations and to respond to albeit limited market forces the role of central planners is vastly smaller given these developments we believe that it is possible to determine whether the prc government has bestowed benefit upon chinese producer ie the subsidy can be identified and measured and whether any such

right to challenge both preliminary and final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations before the dispute settlement body of the world trade organization wto the ability to initiate dispute

which would appear to include the surrogate country methodology as well as the factors of production or market oriented indust ry approach would in general appear to be consistent with us international obligations that being said however it may be the case that specific application of substitute benchmark may be found to be incompatible with us wto obligations on an as applied basis it would appear that the operative provision with respect to the use of substitute benchmarks is article 14d of the scm agreement article 14d states in relevant part that any method used by the investigating authority to calculate the benefit to the recipient conferred pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 1 shall be provided for in the national legislation or implementing regulations of the member co ncerned and its application to each particular case shall be transparent and adequately explained furthermore any such method shall be consistent with the following guidelines d th provision of goods or services or purchase of goods by government shall not be considered as conferring benefit unless the provision is made for less than adequate remuneration or the purchase is made for more than adequate remuneration the adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for the good or service in question in the country of provision or purchase including price quality availability marketability transportation and other conditions of purchase or sale 74 the scm agreements use of the phrase any method used would appear to encompass not only existing us practice regarding the use of surrogates in the factors of production methodology but also the artificial pricing method discussed above in addition recent appellate body ab ruling interpreting the scope of article 14d concluded that an investigating authority may use benchmark other than private prices of the goods in question in the country of provision when it has been established that those private prices are distorted because of the predominant role of the government in the market as provider of the same or similar goods 75 the ab went on to establish limitation on the use of such benchmarks requiring that their use must relate or refer to or be connected with the prevailing market c onditions in that country and must reflect price 73 id at 10 74 wto

conditions of purchase or sale as required by article 14d76 nevertheless the ab expressly refused to suggest or rule upon specific alternative methods that might be available to countries noting that such review would be appropriate only on casebycase basis77 further evidence suggesting the consistency of the use of either surrogate countries factors of production or other substitute benchmarks with respect to nonmarket economies may be derived from chinas accession agreement to the wto 78 adopted in november of 2001 the agreement governs chinas accession to the wto and has become an integral part of the wto agreement because china is currently classified by the united states and other countries as nonmarket economy79 the language with respect to the application of the scm agreement appears to be relevant to any discussion of the application of trade remedy laws to nonmarket economies article 15b of chinas accession agreement indicates that when applying the relevant provisions of the scm agreement if there are special difficulties in that application the importing wto member may then use methodologies for identifying and measuring the subsidy benefit which take into account the possibility that prevailing terms and conditions in china may not always be available as appropriate benchmarks in applying such methodologies where practicable the importing wto member should adjust such prevailing terms and conditions before considering the use of terms and conditions prevailing outside china 80 this language appears to recognize the inherent difficulties in calculating subsidy or dumping margin using values obtained from nonmarket economies moreover the language seems to indicate that provided that the use of benchmarks can be adjusted to meet the prevailing economic terms and conditions their use is both acceptable by china and permissible under wto obligations it should be noted however that while it may be possible to argue that the use of benchmarks is not violation of wto obligations on their face their application to specific industry or imported product may still be subject to challenge on an as applied basis 76 id 77 id at 106
