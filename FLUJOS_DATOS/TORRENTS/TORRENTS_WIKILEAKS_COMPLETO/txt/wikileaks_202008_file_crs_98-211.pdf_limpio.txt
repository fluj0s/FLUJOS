oversight nd involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past decade congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorization s emanating from the legislative oversight com mittees as result foreign operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issue s and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive an d congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largel through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified ai d policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war th legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions an d conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that hav frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes

the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistance issues fo r congress and executive branch policymakers has been the

after peaking in size at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operation s appropriations began period of declining levels falling to about 123 billion i n fy1997 foreign aid spending cuts we re especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by 115 billion or nearly 9 from the previous year administratio n officials and many in the broader foreign policy community argued that such severe budget reductions in short period of time seriously undermined many us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence oversea s events after foreign operations funding l evels fell again in fy1997 although by much smaller amounts the state department and other executive agencie s launched an aggressive campaign in support of foreign policy budget request fo r fy1998 that sought to reverse the decadelong downwa rd trend congress approved much of the presidents 1 billion increase recommended f or this year setting foreign operatio ns appropriations at 1315 billion for fy1998 currently foreig n operations represents 078 of the entire federal budget and 24 of tota l discretion ary budget authority by comparison these same figures in fy1985 were 2 and 46 respectively over the longer term of the past 20 years foreign operations spending s experienced three distinct trends when calculated in real terms taking into accoun t the effects of inflation the first period was marked by steady growth in foreign operatio ns appropriations levels during the early 1980s when the united state s rapidly expan ded securityrelated aid programs in central america pakistan and to countries providing the us with military bases funding peak ed in fy1985 at 319 billion in fy1999 dollars followed by sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of th grammrudman deficit reduc

these large infreq uent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congres s provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount f us participation the tra nsaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and result s in outlays from the us treasury in short

some of the trade and investment activities policy issues in the foreign operations debate in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operation s appropriation bill the annual spending measure also includes wide range of policy provisions that frequently raise conte ntious foreign policy disagreements between the president and congress as mentioned above because of congress inability to enact foreign aid authorization bills for over decade the foreign operations legislatio n often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct of us foreign policy mor generally many of these policy provisions take the form of conditions or restrictions on how th president can use money included in the spending bill many of thes provisions are opposed by the administration as excessively limiting his ability t manage american foreign policy the most serious of these legislativeexecutiv policy differences can ultimately result in delaying the enactment of the foreig n

aid to israel conditio ns on aid to russia and ukraine and aid policy related to the dispute ove r nagornokarabakh policy priorities of us development aid since the end of the cold war common theme of many administration discussions and congressional debates s been what s hould replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 5 0 years more fundamental question raised by some espec ially critics of development assistance is whether the uni ted states needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program or can it be transformed as smaller more targete d instrument with some elements being privatized that would support only th highest us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus reached on these question s between the executive and legislative branches the clinton administration s strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster variety of us foreign po licy initiatives around the

reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuatin g administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reenforcing principles can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fys199698 to roughly twothirds the amount provided in

programs and presses usaid to allocate the maximu m amount possible to such activiti as result the environment sector of sustainable development probably has not declined as much as it might have otherwise but at the center of this issue for the past three years has been difference s between congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for program s supporting child survival basic education and hivaids and other infectiou s diseases despite cutting overall development id in fys199697 by about 23 from fy1995 levels congress earmark ed children and disease programs at amounts equal to or somewhat greater tha n those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements of sustainable development closer to 30 although congress booste d development ai d appropriations for fy1998 by 100 million over the previous year lawmakers earmarked half of the additional funds for the child survival and diseas account congressional proponents of the child survival earmark argue that eve n though budget pressures require the united states to reduce or hold the line n foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core american valu demanding that cuts should be implemented witho ut putting at risk the lives and well being of small chil dren in developing nations they further point out that the spread of infectious diseases poses direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate suc h illnesses while agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious diseas program s usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing fo r example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations an d access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also i s determi ned by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability i n society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policies that will ensure jobs and economi c opportunities in the future consequently they contend the squeeze that earmarks place on other areas of sustainable development undermines to some extent th success of programs that also benefit children for fy1999 although usaid proposed to alter only slightly its resourc allocation for sustainable development objectives the few changes recommende d drew sharp criticism in some quarters of congress the 42 million reduction in child survival and infectious disease programs planned for fy1999 ran counter to th emphasis and increased funding mandated by congress for these activities the pas t three years the reques t for additional family planning funds although at levels well below the 548 million appropriated in fy1995 focused even greater attention on the most controversial element of usaids sustainable development agenda the largest increase recommended for fy1999 46 million was for environmental programs portion of which would support the administrations stated c ommitment for usaid to provide at least 150 million annually for the next five years for global climat change activities some also challenged the absence of increased funding for certain usaid activities especially for agriculture programs that agency official s acknowledge have been cut too deeply over the past decade although usaid said it was increasing emphasis on agriculture by strengthening links with economi c growth and food security strategies the request for fy1999 was 127 million th same as for fy1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98211crs19 congressional action the house restored to fy19 98 levels 650 million the amounts for child survival and disease programs including basic education fo r

an fy1999 target for othe r developm ent activities house spending levels were nearly identical to fy199 8 appropriations although about 100 million less than the request as in previou s years this would have most likely resulted in reductions to economic growth an d environment programs from amounts planned by usaid moreover if funds were transferred ut of the development assistance account to shore up funding shortfalls for disaster aid or usaid operating expen ses authority granted by the committee larger cuts in economic growth and environment activities might be expected the senate

the administration to continue spending for infectious diseases at fy1998 levels and set basic education aid at 100 million the senate measure also include d 305 million agriculture programs and

senate in s 2334 took supportive and s restrictive position on family planning issues earmarking 435 million for popula tion assistance level higher than the administrations request the legislation

activities middle east aid and israels plan to phaseout economic assistance since the late 1970s by far the largest portion of us foreign aid has supported american friends and allies in the middle east especially israel and egypt combined thes two countries have received over 100 billion during the past 20 years for decade foreign aid bills annually have earmarked 3 billion for israel and 2115 billion for egypt in economic and military assistance the fy1999 request matched thes traditional levels although annual aid allocations for israel and egypt have not grown in dolla r terms the decline in overall foreign operations funding the past several years s meant that the proportion of worldwide foreign aid going to the middle east climbed to 44 in fy1997 some in congress and in the executive branch suggested that at time of overall budget cuts all aid activ ities including those for israel and egypt should be examined for possible reductions in order to fund other emerging initiatives for which new money is not available in sim ilar vein others have argued that if the administration wants to launch new regional i nitiatives to advance the peace process it should finance them through the reallocation of existing middle east aid resources so funds are not drawn from other foreign aid activities following this suggestion the administration has financ ed about 100 million in additional assistance to jordan in each of the past two years by transferring 50 million from israel and egypt s economic aid packages last year congress took steps to legislate cap on foreign operation s resources for the middle east largely at the initiative of representative callahan chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee lawmakers stipulated in the fy1998 funding measure section 586 of pl 105118 that selected middle east nations and regional programs could not receive more than 54 billion of the tota l appropriation level representing 41 of all foreign operations funds israel 3 billion egypt 2115 billion and jordan 225 million accounted for all but 60 million of the regional total although it was assum ed that israel would contribute 50 million for jordan and prioryear appropriations for egypt would be tapped fo r another 50 million the administrations fy1999 proposal excee ded the 54 billion cap for fy1998 by about 200 million but state department budget justificatio n documents pledged to work with congress on an appropriate formula in order to keep spending within the maximum permitted for fy1998 as congress and th administration have searched the past two years for ways to finance new middle east peace initiatives while straightlining or reducing aid to the region isr ael put forth in january 1998 plan to cut its aid over the next tento twelve years the concept behin d an israeli initiative to decrease assistance from the united states was fi rst raised by prime minister netanyahu during speech before joint session of congress on july 10 1996 as outlined to congressional an d administration officials b israeli finance minister neeman in late january 1998 the united states would cut eco nomic aid by 120 million each year for about ten years while increasing military assistance by 6 0 million annually at the end of the period israel would be receiving an annual appropria tion of 24 billion in military aid but longer receive any economic ass istance if done over tenyear period in net termshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98211crs23 us aid to israel would fall 60 million each year with total savings of 600 million by 2009 congre ssional reaction to the israeli proposal generally was positive som cautioned however that perhaps the plan could be impleme nted over shorter period of time and that further study was needed to assess if israe l needed additional military aid because many in congress have viewed eg ypts aid as linked to israels through the camp david peace process reduction in assistance to israel

conflict by carol migdalovitzeuropes osce minsk group but also with extensi ve russian participation gained ceasefire in 1994 but permanent resolution6 congress has tended to favor armenia in the dispute by earmarking hig h amounts of economic aid to armenia and designating nagornokarabakh as recipient of humanitarian aid distinct from azerbaijan and enacting in 1992 ban on all us assistance to azerbaijan ction 907 of the freedom support act pl 102 511 concern over the situation of azeri refugees and the growing importance of potential ame rican investment in the large azerbaijan oil sector has led congress to soften the outright ba n on aid to azerbaijan and to construct for fy1998 regional assistance package aimed in part at supporting the minsk group peace efforts previous foreign operations bills have permitted humanitarian aid for armenian and azeri refugees in the region as well as assistance to the government f azerbaijan for disarmament programs for fy1998 congress also exempte d democracy projects from the section 907 prohibition s well as export promotion aid provided by the trade and development agency and activities performed by us foreign commercial officers in azerbaijan the foreign operations spendin g measure for fy1998 also included 250 million for the southern caucasus regio n with the intent in part to encourage the regional parties to cooperate with mins k group peace efforts out of this total armenia was allocated 875 million georgia 925 million and up to 70 million could assist refugees and internally displace d persons as well as reconstruction efforts throughout the region including those i n nagornokarabakh although the section 907 aid restrictions continued to apply to azerbaijan in fy1998 with modifications noted above congress assumed that with an interim settlement brokered by the minsk group the president would be able to meet the requirements stated in section 907 for fully lifting the aid ban and permi t azerbaijan to receive portions of reconstruction assistance if an interim agreement was not reached by may 30 1998 however the president could reallocate up t 4375 million of the 70 million total for other nis states including those in central asia or russia for fy1999 the administration sought 80 million for armenia and 80 7 million for georgia down somewhat from the fy1998 earmarks and 315 million for azerbaijan up from an allocation of 214 million for fy1998 the program in azerbaijan would continue humanitarian and democracyrelate d activities plus initiate new programs aimed at the private sector and demining activities all consistent according to usaid with the terms of section 907 moreover the administration asked congress to repeal section 907 saying that it continued to act as handicap for us negotia tors who need to be perceived as fair and honest brokers to all sides in the dispute in addition executive branch officials argued that section 90 7 restrictions block us
