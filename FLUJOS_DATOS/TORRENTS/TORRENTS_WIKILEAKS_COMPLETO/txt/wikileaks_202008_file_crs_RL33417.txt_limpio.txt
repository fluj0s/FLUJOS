2008 jeffrey w seifert specialist in information policy and technology resources science and industry division federal enterprise architecture and egovernment issues for information technology management summary congressional policymakers are concerned about potential inefficiencies and inefficacies in the operation of the federal government particularly as it relates to decisions regarding information technology it investments these concerns have increased as federal it spending has grown to approximately 70 billion annually one approach being implemented to reduce duplicative spending and improve cross agency collaboration is the use of enterprise architecture ea planning across the federal government an ea serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the information and technology needed to carry out these functions as an information technology management and planning tool ea planning represents businessdriven approach to information technology management that emphasizes interoperability and information sharing the federal enterprise architecture fea was started in 2002 by the office of management and budget omb and continues to be developed today the fea is composed of five reference models performance business service data and technical each of the reference models represents specific aspects of the fea and provides common language for departments and agencies to use in developing shared technology solutions to focus efforts on specific areas that may yield savings omb has identified several lines of business lob which represent noncore business functions common to many departments and agencies some of the current lobs include financial management grants management case management human resources management federal health architecture and information systems security within each of the lob initiatives the longer term goal is to shift the locus of activity for these noncore business functions from being replicated by each individual department and agency to consolidated shared service centers or centers of excellence as they are also referred to which serve as common service providers for the other departments and agencies departments and agencies are selected to serve as centers of excellence through competitive process managed by omb three other lobs budget formulation and execution geospatial and information technology infrastructure optimization focus on the development of common practices and information standards to facilitate crossagency interoperability and collaboration some of the congressional oversight issues related to the fea include but are not limited to ongoing updates of the reference models the status of efforts to align the eas of individual departments with the fea the role of the fea in developing second generation of egovernment initiatives and progress and implications of consolidating specific business functions across the federal government in anticipation of an upcoming presidential administration transition congress may also wish to consider the broader issues of the continuity and future direction of fea efforts this report will be updated as events warrant

technology management background the federal government spends approximately 70 billion annually on information technology it goods and services1 the federal enterprise architecture fea has the potential to serve as critical it management tool for achieving greater efficiencies and breaking down the socalled stove pipes that separate individual departments and agencies the office of management and budget omb describes the fea as playing central role to ultimately transform the federal government into citizencentered resultsoriented and marketbased organization as set forth in the presidents management agenda pma2 the fea emphasizes developing interoperable standards facilitating information sharing and increasing crossagency collaboration the fea is also expected to play significant role in the future development of federal egovernment3 and homeland security initiatives with these activities in mind omb describes the three primary objectives or goals of the fea as improving the utilization of information resources to achieve citizencentered government resulting in proactive policy and improved decisionmaking increasing enterprise architecture practice maturity experience using enterprise architecture planning techniques to make decisions regarding the procurement and use of information technology governmentwide resulting in better alignment of it investments with mission performance and increasing crossagency intergovernment and publicprivate sector collaboration resulting in increased common solutions and cost savings4 1 us office of

what is an enterprise architecture in the mid1980s john zachman business planning consultant developed the zachman framework which was designed to serve as blueprint or an architecture to facilitate the integration of it systems5 the enterprise for which an architecture is created refers to either single organization or mission area that transcends more than one organizational boundary eg financial management homeland security6 the architecture represents big picture view of how the enterprise operates and carries out its responsibilities an enterprise architecture ea serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the information and technology needed to carry out these operations both currently and prospectively as such it is an information technology management and planning tool it is designed to be comprehensive and scalable to account for future growth needs ea planning represents businessdriven approach to it management that emphasizes interoperability and information sharing since the development of the zachman framework various parts of the federal government have attempted to work with eas for example the clingercohen act pl 104106 passed in 1996 tasked agency chief information officers cios with among other responsibilities developing maintaining and facilitating the implementation of sound and integrated information technology architecture for the executive agency7 the clingercohen act defined information technology architecture as an integrated framework for evolving or maintaining existing information technology and acquiring new information technology to achieve the agencys strategic goals and information resources management goals8 in september 1999 the federal chief information officers cio council9 issued its fea framework which was described as conceptual model that begins to define documented and coordinated structure for crosscutting businesses and 4 continued government 20052006 fea

responsibilities are statutorily defined by the clingercohen act pl 104106 individuals serving as chief architects may be doing so in addition to other assigned responsibilities the caf meets quarterly and similar to the cio council serves as means for sharing information and identifying solutions to common problems reference models the fea is composed of five reference models performance business service data and technical each of the reference models represents specific aspects of the fea and provides framework or shared language for departments and agencies to develop technology solutions that can be used by the federal government collectively the reference models are updated as needed to reflect changes in applications and services brief descriptions of the five reference models drawn from the ea website are as follows performance reference model framework for measuring the output of major information technology investments and their contributions to program performance20 business reference model framework for describing the federal government business operations independent of the agencies that perform them21 service component reference model framework for identifying information technology service components applications used to support business andor performance objectives22 data reference model framework that at an aggregate level describes the

for describing the standards specifications and technologies that support and enable the delivery of service components applications and capabilities24 the omb developed the fea reference models through its fea program management office in conjunction with the federal cio council and the general services administration gsa for federal agencies and departments to use in their it budget and planning process25 the performance reference model prm provides standardized framework for measuring the contribution of major it initiatives that fulfill existing legislativelymandated management processes the processes that the prm emphasizes are drawn primarily from the egovernment act of 2002 the clingercohen act of 1996 and the government performance and results act gpra of 199326 while the prm emphasizes government performance goals applicable to nearly all executive branch agencies omb describes the business reference model brm as the foundation of the fea itself27 the brm is based on functional view of government operations rather than an organizational view this orientation reflects the businessfocused nature of enterprise architecture it management the service component reference model srm in turn is intended to identify applications and components that independent of their business function can provide foundation of technologies that are reusable governmentwide the data reference model drm identifies standards for harmonizing how data is described categorized and shared across the federal government with an emphasis on information sharing and data reuse by applications in the srm28 the technical reference model trm identifies the core technologies and standards for facilitating the reuse of applications and components in the srm with an emphasis on interoperability and security the five reference models were collectively updated and released as the consolidated reference model crm version 20 in june 200629 and updated again most recently in

quicksilver projects and the lines of business projects as well as other governmentwide initiatives such as the effort to transition all federal agency network backbones to internet protocol version 6 ipv6 and homeland security presidential directive 12 hspd12 to develop common identification standard for all federal employees and contractors the ftf extends the fea reference models by providing catalog of architectural information and implementation guidance for crossagency initiatives that is aligned with the reference models of the fea32 the ftf is intended to help agencies tailor their own enterprise architectures to be compatible with the cross agency initiatives and to ensure agencies budget proposals support their enterprise architecture transition strategies the tasks and milestones that define what needs to be accomplished to transition from their current eas to their target eas that will better facilitate crossagency initiatives to that end the ftf is intended to

increase collaboration through agency participation in crossagency communities of practice lines of business initiatives the first generation of bush administration egovernment initiatives sometimes referred to as the quicksilver projects were proposed in 200133 since that time these initiatives have been mostly successful in achieving various project specific milestones and objectives although collectively attempts to attain full cross agency collaboration have been somewhat limited34 the omb expressed an interest in having the next generation of egovernment projects have broader government wide character to that end in spring 2004 after reviewing data collected from agencies for the development of the fea and formulating the annual federal budget omb identified five major collaborative initiatives to transform government improve services to citizens and deliver substantial savings35 the five areas included financial management36 human resources management grants management case management and federal health architecture these initiatives were chosen in part because they represent core business functions common to many departments and agencies andor have the potential to reap significant efficiency and efficacy gains hence they are strong candidates for utilizing some of the more transformative egovernment practices such as buy once use many 33 pursuant to the july 18 2001 omb memorandum m0128 an egovernment task force was established to create strategy for achieving the bush administrations egovernment goals in doing so the task force identified 23 interagency initiatives designed to better integrate agency operations and information technology investments twentyfourth initiative governmentwide payroll process project was subsequently added by the

ten years by 201537 in march 2005 omb established task force for sixth project the information systems security iss lob initiative this it security initiative is intended to address common security weaknesses faced by many agencies and generally improve the state of federal information security similar to the first five lob initiatives the iss lob initiative emphasizes the development of shared service centers to carry out common tasks for this particular lob initiative four areas are targeted for consolidation security training federal information security management act fisma reporting situational awarenessincident response and the selection evaluation and implementation of security products according to president bushs fy2009 budget proposal shared service centers have been selected for security training and fisma reporting and efforts are underway to migrate agencies to these centers by the second quarter of fy2010 the iss lob will also be used to facilitate the trusted internet connection tic initiative the tic initiative is intended to optimize individual external connections including internet points of presence by reducing the total number of external connections from more than 1000 to approximately 50 and establish centralized gateway monitoring to detect and prevent cyber threats to federal networks38 updated descriptions of these six initiatives and their primary objectives as provided in table 99 of president bushs fy2009 budget proposal39 are financial management to standardize and consolidate the governments financial systems and financial business

opportunities for consolidation to be proposed during the fy2008 budget review in contrast to the first six lines of business initiatives which emphasize the consolidation of activities at shared service centers the most recent three lines of business initiatives instead focus more on the development of common practices and information standards to facilitate crossagency interoperability and collaboration as described in the presidents fy2009 budget proposal the primary objectives of the three new lobs include budget formulation and execution enhancing federal agency and central budget

information technology infrastructure identifying opportunities for it infrastructure consolidation and optimization and developing governmentwide common solutions to realize cost savings48 as omb continues to collect and analyze information from the departments and agencies it will be able to further develop the fea in turn omb is likely to identify additional opportunities for egovernment initiatives based around the lobs oversight issues for congress as the federal enterprise architecture initiative continues to evolve congress may decide to consider several issues related to implementation and oversight these issues include but are not limited to the following the overall effectiveness of the federal enterprise architecture at improving federal it management and reducing it spending the progress of ongoing efforts to update and enhance the five reference models and how effective they are at identifying cross agency redundancies how well the enterprise architectures of the individual departments and agencies align with the federal enterprise architecture how omb is using the fea to evaluate the it business cases submitted by agencies with their yearly budget requests and how much money has been saved through this process how the federal enterprise architecture is being used to address federal information security problems how the federal enterprise architecture is facilitating and benefitting largescale it projects such as agencylevel technology modernization efforts the federal governments adoption of internet protocol version 6 ipv6 the 24
