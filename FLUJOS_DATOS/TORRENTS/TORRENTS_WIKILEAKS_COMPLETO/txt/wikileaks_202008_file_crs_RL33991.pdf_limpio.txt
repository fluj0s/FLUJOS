published the first in series of articles describing problems with outpatient medical care and other services provided at the walter reed army medical center wramc the series noted among other things concerns about the processes used to evaluate disability in injured military servicemembers both the department of defense dod and the department of veterans affairs va conduct disability evaluations and assign disability ratings to servicemembers or veterans under their respective authorities an individuals disability rating from either department affects the scope of pay and benefits for which he or she is eligible and the cost to the respective department of providing such benefits there are significant differences between the disability evaluations performed by dod and va as well as civilian disability evaluations conducted by the social security administration ssa and workers compensation programs most notably the dod disability evaluation is focused on the effect of any disabling condition on the performance of the servicemembers duties in the military while the other three systems evaluate the impact of disability on gainful employment in the civilian economy congress has followed recent news reports with interest and several legislative initiatives are under consideration for example hr 1538 the wounded warrior assistance act of 2007 passed unanimously in the house on march 28 2007 the senate version of hr 1538 the dignified treatment of wounded warriors act passed the senate by unanimous consent on july 25 2007 the bills included numerous provisions to improve or streamline medical care and benefits processing for returning injured servicemembers title xvi of the national defense authorization act for fy2008 hr 4986 pl 110 181 contains provisions from both versions of hr 1538 related to the care and transition of injured servicemembers this report is intended as primer to describe disability evaluation in general including evaluations used by dod and va as well as civilian evaluations used by the ssa and by workers compensation programs next the dod and va disability rating processes are described respectively in greater detail finally recent congressional and executive actions and recommendations regarding dod and va disability evaluations are described this report emphasizes the disability evaluation systems at dod and va with

washington post published the first in series of articles describing problems with outpatient medical care and other services provided at the walter reed army medical center wramc1 wramc department of defense dod facility in washington dc is one of several military treatment facilities mtfs providing medical care to injured servicemembers returning from combat theaters in iraq and afghanistan in support of operation enduring freedom oef and operation iraqi freedom oif intense media scrutiny followed the washington post series news reports have in general observed that medical care provided to returning servicemembers is good or excellent but noted evidence of problems with infrastructure and cleanliness in both dod and department of veterans affairs v facilities in addition reported problems have included complex administrative systems delays and errors in dods processing of retirement and other benefits for those servicemembers who separate from the armed forces the transitioning of eligible servicemembers to veteran status and v s processing of veterans benefits reports have also mentioned understaffing and inadequate training of case workers who assist servicemembers and veterans with benefits processing and other aspects of their return to civilian life some reports have however been problematic in their descriptions of the respective roles of dod and va in providing health care and other benefits to injured servicemembers or in their descriptions of the health care and other benefits systems in the two departments 2 recent reports have spotlighted problems faced by some returning injured oefoif servicemembers however dod and va do not apply their disability evaluations differently to oefoif servicemembers than to other servicemembers and veterans also less than half of each departments disability evaluation caseloads involve oefoif personnel nonetheless the added number of oefoif cases and in particular their complexity do appear to have strained the capacity of the disability evaluation systems in the two departments 3 1 dana priest and anne hull soldiers face negl ect frustration at armys top medical facility washington post february 18 2007 2 among other discrepancies several news reports mistakenly referred to soldiers at wramc as veterans for example on february 20 2007 the seattle times

american law division crs some news reports and other sources have asserted that the dod underrates disability in both the dod and va systems disability ratings range from zero least severe to 100 most severe in increments of 10 generally if an injured servicemember has served in the military less than 20 years dod disability rating of 20 or less entitles the servicemember to single lumpsum severance payment and additional military benefits while rating of 30 or greater may subject to certain other conditions make the individual eligible for certain lifelong military benefits such as retirement pay and health insurance for the servicemember and his or her family hence in most cases disability rating of 30 or greater yields more favorable benefits package for the servicemember and higher and longerterm cost for the department for veterans under the v system in comparison serviceconnected disability rating of 10 or more provides monthly disability compensation payment whereas disability rating of 30 or more provides additional disability compensation for spouse and dependents the amount of monthly disability compensation depends on the disability percentage rating in addition unlike the dod disability evaluation va disa bility ratings may over time be revised as veteran files claim or claims for changes in disability status related to prior military service this

evaluations performed by the dod the v the social security administration ssa and workers compensation programs wc there are differences in process and more importantly fundamental differences in the basis for evaluation in each of the systems this may result in different rating outcomes from each system which can affect the financial condition of the disabled applicant and the future costs incurred by the benefits provider brief overview and comparison of the four systems is provided below more detailed descriptions of the dod and va systems are presented later in this report some have proposed combining or linking different disability evaluation programs to improve outcomes or other problems with program performance for example proposals to consolidate the dod and va disability systems or to have the va conduct disability evaluations of dod personnel are discussed in the final section of this report recent congressional and executive actions however attempts to combine or link existing disability evaluation systems may be difficult and may not be desirable given the different purposes of each system the government accountability office gao has designated as highrisk the federal disability programs at ssa and va which rate disability based on civilian employability gao says that these systems are based upon outmoded concepts of disability and fail to optimize

disability evaluation is focused on the effect of any disabling condition on the performance of the servicemember s duties in the military the evaluation can be viewed as twostep process the first step is to determine if the applicant servicemember is fit for military duty the second step for applicants found to be unfit is the rating of serviceconnected disability several factors are taken into account to determine servicemembers fitness for duty including whether or not the servicemember can perform his or her required duties based on office grade rank or rating whether or not the servicemember is medically prevented from taking the required physical fitness test the impact on deployability of the servicemember and his or her unit and whether or not an alternative job specialty for the servicemember is feasible if servicemember is found unfit for duty the servicemember can be placed on the temporary disability retired list tdrl which requires reevaluation in the future or

same rating table the veterans affairs schedule for rating disabilities often referred to as v asrd or srd described in the text box below to determine the disability percentage this disability percentage is one factor used to determine if the service member receives lumpsum payment upon discharge based on rating of 20 or lower or an annual pension and possibly other lifelong benefits based on rating of 30 or higher once the ratings determination is made and accepted by the servicemember further changes to the evaluation percentage rating lumpsum payment or pension are made in the future the military disability evaluation process does not look at the individual servicemembers current future or potential earnings or earnings capacity in evaluating disability the v eterans affairs

rating based on the vasrd determines the level of monthly disability compensation eligibility for other benefits and also plays role in determining the veterans position in the priority system for v medical care in order to receive disability compensation an individual must be rated at least 10 disabled8 in contrast to the dod system the veteran can be reevaluated if new or newly recognized

for all work injuries the employer is responsible for full payment of all necessary medical treatment until the point of maximum medical improvement is reached14 various forms of cost control eg utilization review may be used and disputes can be referred to an administrative proceeding conducted by the state labor department or equivalent agency medical evaluations for wc may be done by the employees personal physician or one specified by the insurance carrier with disputed results again appealable to state agency as noted total disability is compensated by percentage of lost wages for as long as the disability persists though with some time limits or reductions in amount at retirement age in some states the various jurisdictions evaluate partial disability in many different ways which have been classified by some analysts into three basic models impairment rating an assessment is made of the workers proportionate loss of general physical andor mental functioning compared to hypothetical whole person loss of earning capacity an estimate is made of the maximum level of earnings the worker can attain in his or her present condition compared to his or her previous earnings this takes into accoun t education age state of the local job market and other particulars of the case actual wage loss postinjury earnings are subtracted from the preinjury rate of earnings however additional criteria are usually applied in order to assure that the loss of earnings is fully caused by the injury 15 most jurisdictions also make distinctions among types of injury for example there may be benefit limitations applied to mental injury versus physical injury or occupational disease versus traumatic injury most states also list specific types of injuries called scheduled injuries usually loss of body parts or functions such as vision or hearingand specify standardized benefit for example loss of an arm could be compensated by six years of payment at twothirds of ones normal wage state governments insurers and employers generally place high priority on return to work whether it is to the original job light duty assi gnment or with new employer this strategy is usually the most costeffective and arguably preferred by most workers accordingly vocational rehabilitation is included in all wc systems and indeed worker may lose his or her wc payments if not participating in prescribed rehabilitation program in addition to wc some employers offer private disability insurance to cover disabilities that may not be caused by work injuries under these policies the employee makes premium payments the employer may or may not contribute to the premiums for insurance to provide 13 workers compensation payments are taxexempt 14 maximal medical improvement is the greatest degree of cure likely to be achieved with further medical services 15 reville robert t et an evaluation of californias pe rmanent disability rating system appendix santa monica ca rand corp institute

servicemembers who are determined to be physically unfit and have disability rating of 30 or greater generally will be retired even though they may have less than 20 years of active duty the disability retirement pay calculation differs somewhat from the normal longevity retirement calculation it is computed by multiplying the basic pay of the retired grade by the greater of the percentage of the disability or 25 multiplied by the number of years of service the maximum benefit under either computation cannot currently exceed 75 of basic pay 23 retired servicemembers with serviceconnected disabilities may also be eligible for v disability compensation until recently military retired pay was offset by any v compensation received however the fy2004 national defense authorization act now allows some military retirees to receive both v and military retirement compensation if the individual was retired with more than 20 years of service 24 generally military retired pay is taxable exceptions are 1 if the disability pay is for combatrelated injuries or 2 if the servicemember was in the military or so obligated on september 24 1975 23 see crs report rl33449

disability policy is that the physical disability evaluation process will be conducted in consistent and timely manner25 however dod has given the services the latitude to set up their own processes so inc onsistencies would appear to be inevitable while standards or common schedules such as the v asrd are used these may be subject to interpretation andor misapplication dod has also established timeliness standard s for case initiation and processing all servicemembers must be referred for evaluation within one year of the diagnosis of their condition if they are unable to return to duty in addition dod allows 30 days to complete the meb process and 40 days to complete the peb process gao has found that dod has not monitored compliance by the services with dod di rectives on disability evaluation or exercised oversight over the training of disability program staff26 the army inspector general in recent inspection of the army disability system found that the army was not meeting the

time after an initial disability rating may encounter more problems in providing the required documentation for example veteran filing claim for disability 15 years after service may need to contact or have the v contact several physicians who have treated the veteran for the medical condition over the period 15 years since the veteran was discharged from the military in addition veteran out of the military for number of years may have to rely on the va or dod to conduct search of stored paper documents for the needed discharge or medical documentation once all of the documentation needed for the application is complete veteran may undergo compensation and pension examination at v facility at the veterans convenience some examinations are done under contract outside of v facilities the compensation and pension examination is not complete examination of all body systems and is not focused on diagnosis and treatment the focus of the examination is the body systems covered by the veterans claim for disability or pension and is designed to provide information specific to determining disability rating the information gathered during the examination is then reviewed by ratings specialist using the veterans affairs schedule for rating disabilities v asrd to determine the disability rating for the veteran the v ratings are done in increments of 10 with scale of 0 to 100 31 the finding is then reviewed by differen t rating specialist as means of confirming the rating letter is sent to the veteran explaining the rating and the basis for the rating the veteran has the right to appeal rating determination 32 the veterans disability evaluation is based on the impact of the disability on civilian employability the v asrd rating can be viewed as measure of the average impact on civilian employment of the disability however the evaluation does not take into account veterans current earnings or potential future earnings in determining disability payments the evaluation may take into account the individual unemployability of veteran if the veteran claims that he or she cannot work as result of the disability or if the disability is of such nature that there is presumption of unemployability the payment levels are established in law based on the disability percentage and whether the veteran has spouse or dependents an additional payment can be made if needed for aid and attendance problems have been noted with the veterans disability evaluation process because the evaluation is done at the local level the v inspector general has noted that there are unwarranted geographic variations in disability ratings33 also gao has recommended that the department do more monitoring with respect to the process particularly of the regional medical centers reports to ensure consistency in disability determinations34 the v as claims process also has large backlog currently oifoef servicemembers particularly those recuperating in mtfs are the v s first
