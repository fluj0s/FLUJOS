organization and the respective service the goal is for both organizations to gain from the unique educational experience although the progra m has operated under stri ct guidelines it has become the focus of attention in the last fifteen years due to the individual actions of some officers employed in high visibility positions outside of dod thus it appears likely that there will be ongoing

is lessens the potential for nondod service to jeopardize promotion and car eer development fellows graduate to headquarters or join t staff assignment8 issues for congress costbenefit of defense fellowship programs weighing the costs and benefits of the defense fellows program is somewhat subjective the cost to the individual military departments is constant they lose high quality officer from their ranks for the duration of the fellowship while they continue to provide normal pay and allowances in many cases the additional co st includes paying for the officer to move twice and supplemental overhead in the form of university tuition books and travel the benefits must transcend the individual and carry over to th service and the sponsor for the programs to retain support first the prog rams have to meet regulatory guidelines and provide an educational experience not ava ilable through the dod education structure individuals must value the experience both professionally and pers onally enough to keep the program supported by qualifie d applicants the services must accrue sufficient return on their investment through open communicati ons with sponsor organizations during the fellowship or postfellowship contribution to maintain individual fellowship support in most instances the sponsor organization also incurs some cost through administrative support educational workload andor research oversight does the technical organizational and operationa l knowledge brought to the sponsor outweigh the burden of support for dod specific benefit is the extended service commitment of the participating officers in the end much of th benefit for all is of ten intangible however most participating officers and institutions clearly support these voluntary programs defense fellowship program s impact on endstrength primary dod arguments for reducing or eliminating fellowships hinge on the issues of operations and personnel tempo of us military forces th concern is that these dod fellows might better serve their country opera ting within their respective services when considering this issue one can examine the impact of the fellowships on the services for senior service collegeequivalent officers the fellows represent less than 3 of the activeduty individual service o5 and o6 populations wh the active guard and reserve and the dod civilian participants are excluded for the initial calculations the percentage is lower legislative fellows represent less than 2 of their respective populations it may be argued many fellows represent critical career specialities from fighter pilots and destroyer captains to battalion commanders or other operationallystre ssed fields one may also consider that these resident service school candidates w ith all likelihood will be pulled from their career tracks to attend professiona l military education whether it be ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21350crs5 9 directorate for

impact on operational endstrength therefore appears moot politicization of defense fellows some argue that joint ethics regulation and dod directives cannot adequate ly insulate defense fello ws from politics especially within legislative fellowships by nature and design the program favors some offices and committees with defenserela ted responsibilities interests or oversight to those more centered on domestic policy fellows and sponsors tend to aggregate around the armed services committees and defense appropriations subcommittees and their members as members of house or senate personal staff fellows have to balance requests from their superiors with strict regulatory guidelines during election campaigns research on issues today may become partisan policy tomorrow and differentiating between the two can be difficult advocates of legislative programs suggest politics are part of the legislative process they also believe that fellows exposure to the process makes them better prepared to facilitate communication and collaboration between the executive branch and congress critics argue that by positioning midcareer officers in potentially compromising situations the training is at be st counter productive nd at worst partisan and could jeopardize careers of the very officers meant to lead tomorrows military optimizing professional military education because military car eer can be as short as 20 years optimizing the poi nt in structured military career when an officer receives professional military education including fellowships is difficult but important senior service co lleges take officers who ve already had extensive experience in their own service and focus them on national security military policy formulation and force transformation issues in both joint and multinational setting senior service fellowships tend to concentrate on the same issues in an academic or interagency environment in many cases crossservice and multinational exposure is lost in the fellowship but many officers have co mpleted jpme and joint or international assignment by this juncture in their careers senior service colleges award masters degrees upon graduation senior fellows do not receive degrees while almost all senior fellows have advanced academic degrees acquisition of institutional certification of programs arguably would validate to dod th importance of their contribution and add credibility to individual institutional programs intermediate service colleges are proponents for education in the operational art of war and veloping staff officers and future commanders the schools are jpme accredited and many of the graduating officers receive followon joint assignment legislative fellowships take different tack relying on nonresident programs to fill the void in the educational experience the program provides handson staff experience nd attempts to make up in depth for what it may lack in breadth some have suggest ed that formalized educational union of service legislative programs possibly in the form of weekly seminars sponsored through local universityinstitution may bring jpme accreditation and bolst er program
