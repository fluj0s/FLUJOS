for action by congress or the administration on december 30 1998 the bipartisan committe unanimously approved the final classified report issued on january 3 1999 th committee then released 3volume declassified version on may 25 1999 according to the committee the prc has stolen classified information on the most advan ced us thermonuclear weapons giving the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own the information includes classified information on seven warheads including every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the us ballistic missile arsenal on the neutron bomb and on number of us reentry vehicles the prc acquired information on seven us nuclea r warheads including the w88 the most advanced miniature us nuclear warhea d deployed on the trident d5 submarinelaunched ballistic missile the committe reported that us information accelerated prc nuclear weapon modernization and helping its efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclea r weapons designs these warheads give the prc small modern thermonuclea r warheads roughly equivalent to current us warhead yields the committe said that after three failed satellite launches in 1992 1995 and 1996 us satellite makers hughes and loral transferred missile design information and knowhow to china without required export licenses from the department f state in violation of t he international traffic in arms regulations the firms gave technical information that has improved the reliability of chinese rockets used t launch satellites with civilian and military purpos the information is also useful for the design and improved reliability of future prc ballistic missiles there are num ber of questions for possible further study raised by the report including implications for us national security arising from the status of chines nuclear weapons missiles intelligence and military technology the report note d that the united states retains an overwhelming qualitative and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic nuclear forces over the p rcs up to two dozen css4 icbms nonetheless the report stated that in crisis in which the united states confronts the prcs conventional and nuclear forces at the regional level modernized prc strategic nuclear ballistic missile force would pose credible direct threat against the united states the

investigation was on whether us satellite firm s transferred technology useful for chinas missile program and on related policies of the clinton administration the committee broadened its examination to includ events in the last two decades and subsequently turned its attention in crucia l direction to examine whether china acquired nuclear weapon secrets after donal d rumsfeld indicated problem in that rea on october 15 1998 the committee then took testimony on two days november 12 and december 16 1998 from th department of energy doe the central intelligence agency cia and the federal bureau of investigation fbi on chinas suspected acquisition of us nuclea r weapon information in early 1999 news media began to report on those mor e6 controversial concerns the following is summary of the reports major findings with the committees judgments of benefits for the chinese military the people s liberation army pla questions for possible further study are discussed later nuclear weapons according to the committee since the late 1970s and almost certainly continuin g today the prc has pursued intelligence collection that includes not only espiona ge but also review of unclassified publications and interaction with us scientists at the does national laboratories including alamos lawrenc livermore oak ridge and sandia the prc has stolen classified information on the most advanced us thermonuclear weapons giving the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own the information include s classified information on seven warheads including every currently deploye d thermonuclear warhead in the us ballistic missile arsenal on the neutron bomb and on number of reentry vehicles of us missiles the prc acquired informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs4 for information see crs report 971022 chinese nuclear testing and warhea d7 development by jonathan medaliaon seven us nuclear warheads including the w88 the most advanced miniatur us nuclear warhead deployed on the trident d5 submarinelaunched ballisti c missile slbm w88 deployed on the trident d5 submari nelaunched ballistic missile slbm w87 deployed on the peackeeper intercontinental ballistic missile icbm w78 deployed on the minuteman iii icbm w76 deployed on the trident c4 slbm w70 previously deployed on the lance shortrange ballistic missile srbm w62 deployed on the minuteman iii icbm w56 previously deployed on the minuteman ii icbm the committee focused on potential implications for us national security judging that the prc will exploit elements of the us design information on th prcs next generation of thermonuclear weapons the prc successfully teste d smaller thermonuclear warheads in 1992 to 1996 prior to its july 199 67 announcement of nuclear testing morat orium and its september 1996 signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt the committee reported that information lost from the doe labs accelerated chinese nuclear weapon modernization an d helped the prc in i ts efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclear weapons designs these warheads give the prc small mode rn thermonuclear warheads roughly equivalent to current us war head yields the prc could begin serial production of such weapons during the next decade in connection with th development of its next generation of solidfuel mobile icbms including the df31 that may be tested in 1999 and could be ployed as soon as 2002 although the prc currently deploys nucleararmed icbms with s tolen us technology the prc has leaped in handful of years from 1950sera strategic nuclear capabilities to the more modern thermonuclear weapons designs regarding whether the prc s nuclear program continues to require testing the committee judged that if the prc successfully steals us nuclear test codes com puter models and data and uses them with the us hpcs already imported the prc could diminish its need for further nuclear testing to evaluate weapons and proposed design changes as for the strategic balance the report noted that the united states retains an overwhelming qualitative and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic nuclea r forces over the prcs up to two dozen css4 icbms nonetheless the repor t stated that in crisis in which the united states confronts the prcs conventional and nuclear force s at the regional level modernized prc strategic nuclear ballistic missile force would pose credible direct threat against the united states on the question of whether having smaller nuclear warheads would facilitat chinese developme nt of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs for its nuclear missile force the committee reported that it had information n whether the prc currently intends to develop and deploy mirvs missile and space technology httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs5 according to the committee the prc has s tolen or otherwise illegally obtained us missi and space technology that improves the prcs military and intelligence capabilitie s after three failed satellite launches in 1992 1995 and 1996 us satellite makers hughes and loral trans ferred missile design information and know how to china without required export licenses from the department of state i n violation of the international traffic in arms regulations the us firms gav technical information that has improved the reliability of chinese rockets used t launch satellites with civilian and military purpos the information is also useful for the design and improved reliability of future prc ballistic missiles specifically the committee found that in 1993 and 1995 hughes illegally recommended to the prc improvements to the fairing nose cone th at protects the payload and in 1996 loral and hughes helped the chines improve the guidance of failed chinese rocket and in so doing deliberately acted without the legally required license and violated us export control laws regarding hughes the committees report printed an unclassified assessmen t completed on december 18 1998 by the state departments off ice of defense trade controls that office concluded that in reviewing the chinese launch failure f january 1995 that involved lm2e space launch vehicle slv and the apstar ii satellite hughes engaged in technical discussions with the chinese without us governm ent monitors that resulted in significant improvement to the chines spacelift program and contributed to chinas goal of assured access to space moreover the lessons learned by the chinese are inherently applicable to thei r missile programs as well since slvs and icbms share many common technologies as for loral and hughes activities i n 1996 the committee reported that 1998 interagency review determined that the technical issue of greatest concern was the exposure of the prc to western diagnostic processes which could lead t improvements in reliability for all prc missile and rocket programs th improve ments to chinas missile program could come from increased productio n efficiency and improved reliabi lity through adoption of improved quality control and reliabilityenhancing measures in design and m anufacturing that were introduced after the accident investigation including some that the loralled independent revie w committee advocated the committee ju dged that the guidance system of the long march 3b rocket reviewed by loral and hughes in 1996 is among the system s capable of being adapted for use in the prcs planned roadmobile intercontinental ballistic missiles ie the df31 there were previous concer ns that after the explosion that destroyed the loral built intelsat 708 satellite in 1996 classified us encryption boards were lost t china the committ ee reported that while the two fac3r encryption boards were not recovered from the crash site by loral they most likely were destroyed in th explosion while it is not known whether the chinese recovered the boards even if they did it would be difficult for the prc to determine the cryptographi c algorithm that was imprinted on them and r everseengineering of damaged board would be even more difficult thus the national security agency remain s convinced that there is risk to other satellite systems now or in the future resulting from having not recovering the fac3r boards from the prc contrary to earlier allegations of us assistance for chinas development f multiple satellite dispensers and mirvs the committee determined that motorol ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs6 did not prov ide the prc with information on how to design the smart dispenser rather the prc built the smart dispenser ind igenously to motorolas specifications the cox report agreed with earlier public assessments of the ad ministration that in the 1990s the prc has deployed total of approximately 20 css4 icbms i n silos but contrary to the white houses june 1998 announcement of detargetin g agreement with china most of those icbms remain targeted on the united states nonetheless the report noted previous statement s by us intelligence that the css 4s are deployed in their silos without warheads and without pr opellants during dayto day operations the committee judged that within 15 years chinas missil moderniz ation program could result in the deployment of up to 100 icbms moreover if china aggressively developed mirvs it could deploy upwards f 1000 thermonuclear warheads on icbms by 2015 confirming suspicions of problems in chinas slbm force the committe reported that while china developed jl1 slbm to be launched from the pla s xiaclass nuclearpowered submarine the prc has not yet deployed the jl1 slbm prc intelligence chinas pervasive efforts to obtain us military technology by any means pose challenges to the us counterintelligence and lawenforcement agencies the committee reported that johnny chung us businessman and democrati c fundraiser told federal prosecutors that in 1996 he received 300000 from li u chaoying pla colonel aerospace executive and daughter of retired general liu huaqing and general ji shengde head of pla intelligence the committe determi ned that col lius payment to johnny chung was an attempt to bette r position her in the united states to acquire computer missile and satellit technologies on the question of chinese front companies the committee concluded tha t government and nongovernme ntal estimates of pla companies in the united states ranging from 2 to 30 have been far below the true figure nd there are more than 3000 prc corporations operating in the united states some with links to the pla state intelligence service or with technology targeting and acquisition roles the committee revealed that in 1995 the cia obtained someplace outside of the prc secret prc document containing design information on the w88 an d technical inf ormation on another five us thermonuclear warheads from walk in directed by prc intelligen ce the walkin volunteered various materials to the cia violations of technology safeguards and nonproliferatio n agreements in addition to alleged violations of us export control laws by us firms the cox report raised instances of violations by us firms and the chinese of the us china technology safeguards agreement first signed on december 17 1988 with new agreement signed on february 11 1993 incl uding numerous lapses in security at the chinese launch siteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs7 the committee noted that there have been re ports of additional possible chinese violations of the missile technology control provisions of us laws additiona l sanctions however have bee n imposed as result while some reports have raised possible ch inese missile or space assistance for north korea the committee alleged that china may have helped north korea to build satellite that it claimed wa s launched on august 31 1998 but did not discuss chinese missil technology transfers to north korea dualuse export controls the committee noted that chinas chief source of military equipment is russia and that until recently the united states has lawfully transferred little militar technology to the pla in part because of sanctions imposed after the tiananmen crackdow n of 1989 however illegal transfers of us technology have bee n significant significant transfers of us military technology included thos through the reexport by israel of advanced technology transferred to it by th united states the committee looked at dualuse both civilian and military technolog and reported that us and multilateral export control policies an d practices have facilitated the prcs efforts to obtain militarily useful technology during the bush administration the transfer of licensing authority over som commercial communication satellites from the state department to the commerc department in 1992 resulted in divided jurisdiction between commerce and stat over satellite export licensing that facilitated the loss of us technology to th prc while remaining licensing authority over commercial comm unication satellites was transf erred to commerce in 1996 during the clinton administration legislation passed by congress in 1998 properly reversed that decision us policies n satellite exports that rel on corporate selfpolicing to prevent technology loss have not worked because of the inherent conflicts of interest an d lack of priority placed on security in comparison with other corporation objectives the united states has relaxed export control restrictions on hpcs since 1996 but the uni ted states has effective way to verify that hpc purchases reportedly made for commercial purposes are not diverted to military uses the committe judged that china has i n fact used hpcs to perform nuclear weapons applications hpcs could be useful for production of chinas next generation nuclear weapons and for maintaining the current chinese nuclear weapon stockpile for which test dat exists although the exact mtops millions of theoretical operations per second range needed is unclear in addition to nuclear weapon applications the committee reporte d that the prcs use of hpcs for its military modernization poses risks t us national security the committee raised concerns about diversions of militarily sensitive technology from hong kong to china the cox report stated that with the reversion of hong kong to chinese sovereignty export controls on the prc were effectively liberalized on july 1 1997 permitting the transfer of many additional technologies of potential use to the pla without prior review by the department of commerce th committee said that us trade officials repo rt that inspections by the hong kong regional government nor by any other government including the united states are permitted when pla vehicles cross the hong kong border the committee reportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs8 central intelligence agency the intelligence community damage assessment on th e8 implica tions of chinas acquisition of us nuclear weapons information on th development of future chinese weapons unclassified release april 21 1999 hereafter the source for the dcis conclusionsindications that sizeable number of h ong kong enterprises serve as cover for prc intelligence services the report reviewed two previouslyreported cases of chinese acquisitions f machine tools from mcdonnell douglas in 1994 and of jet engine technology from allied signals garrett ngine division in the late 1980s and early 1990s however the review did not assess the degree to which the prc has hanced it aerospace and military industrial capabilities through the acquisition of us technologies an d equipment in addition the report discussed chinese attempts to acquire composite materials and structures technology the report also noted that the prc p robably cannot build stealth aircraft or miss iles with the same capabilities as the f117 and b2 now or in the near fu ture moreover the report said that even acquisition of these elements will be insufficient to permit the prc to build effectively stealthy aircraft or missiles system integration of stealth is major additional task facing the prc some questions for further study there are some questions for further study raised by the cox report thes question s pertain to findings related to nuclear weapons missile and spac technology prc intelligence and dualuse transfers nuclear weapons publicly the cox committee and the intelligence community agree that china has obtained classified information on more than one nuclear weapon including the w88 and the neutron b omb and on more than one nuclear reentry vehicle including the trident ii slbm china may have successfully tested and produced at least one new nuclear wa rhead based on us information but it reportedly has not deployed such weapon in its current arsenal according to the intelligence community s damage assessment as publicly reported by the director of central intelligenc dci us information has likely accelerated chinas program to develop futur e8 nuclear weapons and there is apparent modernization of the chinese deploye d nuclear missile force or new nuclear weapons the cox report also stated that the main application of the stolen us thermonuclear warhead information will likely be to the prcs nextgeneration intercontinental ballistic missiles on whether china has obtained classified information on seven us nuclea r warheads us intelligence and the administration have not publicly confirmed this extent of chinese acquisition the dci reported that the intelligence communit found thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs9 statement of us representative john spratt dsc release of the select committe e9 report technology transfers to china may 25 1999 gerth jeff and james risen intelligence report points to second china nuclear leak10 new york times april 8 1999china obtained at least basic design information on several modern us nuclear reentry vehicles including the trident ii w88 china also obtaine d information on variety of us weapon design concepts and weaponization features including those of the neutron bomb we cannot determine the full extent of weapon information obtained fo r example we do not know whether any weapon design documentation r blueprints were acquired we believe it is more likely that the chinese used us design information to inform their own program than to replicate us weapon designs responding to whether china stole classified information on ever deployed us warhead energy secre tary richardson said on nbcs meet the press on may 30 1999 that certainly they stole information relating to the w88 and anothe r warhead but there is evidence beyond that and the jury is still out on th extent of the damage he added that there are three confirmed cases of espionage in the 70s and the 80s the neutron bomb and the 90s is still being assessed he commented further that there is question that the chines got some of our nuclear secrets on all seven i think that we still have to be absolutely sure representative spratt of the cox committee said that it is reach to say that stolen us nuclear secrets give the prc design information on thermonuclea r weapons on par with our own he also stated th at the prc has tested neutron9 bomb and w88 derivative but the prc has not replicated the w70 or the w88 he noted that there was too little time to conduct an independent investigation of chinese espionage targeted against us nuclear weapon secrets and the committee relied on few witn esses and did not substantiate their testimony with experts at the national laboratories or interagency review as result there are statements in the report that will not bear scrutiny he reported on the intelligence community s best estimate of what the prc has obtained late 1970s design information on the w70 enhanced radiation warhead 19841988 design information on the w88 warhead and its reentry vehicle 19841988 classified but not design information on reentry vehicles an d weighttoyield ratios of the w62 minuteman ii w76 trident c4 w78 minuteman iii and the w87 peacekeeper on the committees report that china stole additional neutron bomb data from us national weapon laboratory reported by us intelligence in 1996 new s report said that the u s government reportedly has evidence that china has been able to improve its neutron bomb nor that any of the nuclear weapon labs wa s involved in this case representative spratts statement on the release of the cox10 report added that the evidence is limited on the loss of neutron or enhance d radiation technology in the mid1990s and the information if stolen is esoteri c physics that may have little military applicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs10 beyond what specific information china obtained there is the issue of how the threat from chinas nuclear force might have increased the committee found that china stole modern us nuclear weapon information th at accelerated chinas nuclear modernization and helped t he prc in its efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclear weapons designs giving the prc small moder n thermon uclear warheads roughly equivalent to current us warhead yields th cox report also noted that assessing the extent to which design information losses accelerated the prcs nuclear weapons developm ent is complicated because so much is unknown moreover the full extent of us information that the prc acquired and the sophistication of the prcs indigenous design capabilities are unclear and there is the possibility of third country assistance to the prcs nuclear weapon s program which could also assist the prcs exploitation of the stolen us nuclea r weapons information in addition the dci reported that the intelligence community found that as of april 1999 the aggressi ve chinese collection effort has not resulted in any apparent modernization of their deployed strategic force or any new nuclea r weapons deployment while the development of future nuclear weapons s probably accelerated because of the classified us information while the committ ee noted that experts believe that the prc currently has the technical capabil ity to develop and deploy silobased ballistic missiles with mirvs there are still the questions of why china has not yet deployed mirvs and whe n china will deploy small warheads on mirv system the dci reported in apri l 1999 that china has had the technical capability to develop mirv system for its large currently deployed icbm for many years but has not done so us information acquired by the chinese could help them develop mirv for futur mobile missile there could be imp lications for us national missile defense arising from future chinese modern nuclear missile force with mirvs there are the questions of whether china will continue its morat orium on nuclear testing and what are the implications of lack of further testing for china s maintenance of older nuclear weapons as well as modernization of newer warheads representative spratts statement on the cox report said that the ctbt woul d impose major impediments on china while imposing minor impediments on us as the committee repor ted since signing the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in 1996 the pr c has faced new challenges in maintaining its modern thermonuclear warheads without physical testing the report said that the prc likely does t need additional physical tests for its older thermonuclear warhead designs bu t maintena nce of the nuclear weapons stockpile for these weapons does requir testing the committee judged that the prc has likely developed only ver modest complement of codes from inputting its own testing data into hig h performance computers the prc would therefore be especially interested i n acquiring us thermonuclear weapon code s for any new weapons based on elements of stolen us design information the department of energy reports that the prc has in fact acquired some us computer codes indeed since the committee approved its report at the end of 1998 the fb i discovered that the prime suspect in the w88 case us scientist wen ho lee had transferred largely from 1994 to 1995 enormo us volumes of files containing millions of lines of highly secret comp uter codes on nuclear weapon designs legacy codeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs11 risen james and jeff gerth us says suspect put data on bombs in unsecure files11 new york times april 28 1999from classified computer to an unclassified computer the fbi made tha t11 discovery upon checking lees computers in march 1999 after he was fired fro m alamo s lab on march 8 and energy secretary richardson temporarily shu t down the labs computers on april 2 1999 for security reasons one question i s whether china has accessed us legacy codes missile and space technology while citing hughes alleged technology transfers to china the committe nonetheless noted uncertainty about potential military implications there are differing views within the us government as to the extent to which the information that hughes imparted to the prc may assist the prc in its ballistic missile development there is agreement that any suc h improvement would pertain to reliability and not to range or accuracy it is not cle ar at present whether the prc will use fairing that wa s improved as result of hughes disclosures in current or future ballistic missile program currentlydeployed prc ballistic missiles do not us fairings and the prcs future mobile landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles wil l probably not use fairing however fairings are used by the prc in launching mil itary communications satellites and could be used for submarinelaunched ballistic missile the cox report also noted three issues for further investigation concernin g hughes the kind of information that may have been passed to the prc beyond what appeared in the materials reviewed by the department of defense dod the application if any of coupled loads analysis to improving the accurac and range as well as the reliability of prc ballistic missiles the likelihood that the prc will in fact incorporate this knowhow into their future missile and space programs as for lorals assistance to china in 1996 the committee noted that the inertial measurement unit imu of the lm3b rocket is considered an unlikely choice for the prcs ne xt generation of icbms which require relatively small and lightweight imus although experience in improving the lm3bs imu will almost certainl benefit its designs of icbm guidance systems in the future the cox report noted that an inte ragency team concluded in july 1998 that the technical issue of greatest concern was the exposure of the prc to western diagnostic process and that the long march 3b guidan ce system on which loral and hughes provided advice is not likely candidate for use in future prc icbms representative spratt member of the cox committee noted that the report deals with the launch failure investigations of hughes and loral in detail an d concludes that chinas rockets and missiles may have gained reliability but t range payload or accuracy moreover he added that china has acquire d technology from loral and hughes that will improve the reliability of its rockets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30220crs12 statement of us representative john spratt dsc release of the select committe e12 report technology transfers to china may 25 1999 for

costind and defense industries by shirley kan crs report 97391 china ballistic and cruise missiles by shirley kan14but the greatest contribution to reliability probably comes from having its rocke t launches 28 to date pai d for by someone else he stated that the most significant technology that hughes transferred to china was not the structural fix proposed for the fairing but the tutorial they gave their chinese counterparts in failure analysis and diagnostic techniqu the same is true of loral the gain is hard to quantify because it goes to reliability and not the range payload or accuracy of chines rockets and missiles12 the committee i mplied that exporting satellites to china for launch has harmed us national security interests saying that those interests would be advanced b avoiding the need for foreign launches through increased domestic launch capability the committee seemed to call for reassessment of the policy of satellite exports to china the reagan administrations decision to permit launches in the prc was affected by two factors insufficient domestic launch options in th aftermath of the challenger disaster and the perception of the prc as strategic bala nce against the soviet union in the context of the cold war these factors are longer applicabl today launching western satellites has provided the prc with additional experience that has improved it s space launch capabilities even in the absence of any loss of us technology such experience benefits potential longrun competitor of the united states it is uncer tain how much us firms may have improved the

approach in its intelligence efforts that capitalizes on the collection of bits of information by large number of in dividuals and information on us nuclear weapons is obtained through espionage rigorous review of us unclassified technica l and academic publications and extensive interaction with us scientists and department of energy laboratories issues for countering china s varied co llection efforts include how successful chinese espionage has been relative to acquiring opensource materials and how china conducts what one expert s termed an unconventional espionage program that tries to develop as many sources as possible15 there are questions about the credibility and motivation of the walkin who provided documents showing chinese pos session of us nuclear weapon secrets as the cox report noted there is speculation as to the prcs motives for advertising to the united states the state of its nuclear weapons development chines intelligence could have sought to raise the credibility of the walkin increase th credibility of ch inas nuclear arsenal as deterrent to us intervention in regional crisis trigger disruptive spy hunt in the united states or raise suspicions f chinese students work ing in the united states to bring them back to china also16 china could have made major blunder or had another unknown objective i n addition rival of the prc could have planted the documents in taiwan or the17 walkin could have sold them in selfinterest in any case as the cox report said chinese n uclear tests conducted from 1992 to 1996 had already raised suspicions in us intelligence that china had stolen us nuclear weapon information and th informat ion provided by the walkin in 1995 definitely confirmed thos suspicions regarding continuing penetration by chinese

representative cox addressed the energy secretarys denial that there i s penetration by saying that penetration means simply that there are agents in place what secretary richar dson i think will tell you is that the counterintelligence plans that we are now executing are designed to frustrate that espionage so that it s unsuccessful while the committee concluded that there are more than 3000

the uschina technology safeguards agreement includ ing numerous lapses in security at the chinese launch sites questions concern the seriousness of violations of that agreement and the appropriate us response today to questions about the value of the agreement including whether new one should be negotiated the committee noted that the prc has p roliferated nuclear missile and space related technologies to number of countries questio ns concern whether china has engaged in weapon proliferation and the administrations respons and whether china might pass us nucle ar weapon secrets to third countries such as pakistan and iran which have benefitted from chinese arms sales and other cooperation the19 intellige nce communitys assessment noted that the answer is not known bu t cautioned that having obtained more modern us nuclear technology the chinese might be less concerned about sharing their older technology the committee also reported that there is information on

retransfers of us nuclear or missile knowhow could present additional or greater threats to us security dualuse export controls the committee reported that while china agreed in june 1998 to allow us
