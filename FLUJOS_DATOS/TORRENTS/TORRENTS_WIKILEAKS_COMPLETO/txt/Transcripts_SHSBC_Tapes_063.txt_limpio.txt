subject shsbc 63 question and answer period states of beingness lecture given on 27 september 1961 thank you now i suppose its about time you asked questions this is the what of what what year twentyseventh ive been dating letters all day 26th what do you know 27th of september ad 11 well youd better come up with some questions ill count to ten one two yes male voice would you say little bit about how obsessive individuation makes the person eventually become the thing theyre individuating from will i say little bit about how obsessive individuation makes person eventually become the thing he is individuating from male voice please right all right its very simple mechanism an overt act is an effort to individuate it is withhold of oneself from and if you get an idea lets say of well lets see brer rabbit and the tar baby this is pretty good example if you had huge lump of tar and you didnt want to be part of this piece of tar so you didnt permit yourself to come near the tar every time you came close to this lump of tar you say well im not going to become that tar you would eventually find yourself slightly misemotional about this tar because youre cutting communication with it and you would try to push yourself off from this piece of tar because you would find yourself drifting in toward the tar you would one night go in the room and its dark and you accidentally touch the tar and this is counter of one of your postulates you see and so you push yourself off and away from the tar and the more you push yourself off and away from the tar of course the more tarry you get and eventually you get into state of affairs where you were tar just all from forceful effort to hold yourself off from the tar well of course this only starts to happen after one begins to use effort to withhold oneself from the tar you get the idea now the way this works in the field of the mind is this way there is thorn tree and lets take denizen of arizona the denizens of arizona have rather uniformly done this cactus and they are rushing around out in the desert avoiding cactus and they avoid cactus and they avoid cactus and they avoid cactus and they avoid cactus and they sort of push against the cactus you know every time they come near cactus they sort of push themselves off from the cactus they have some very interesting cactus out there some of it is actually i had it confused for the moment the most interesting thorn bush i ever ran into or the most interesting piece of shrubbery was spareamomento bush which is the waitaminute bush of the tropics which has its thorns growing wrong way to like fishhooks its waitaminute bush all right well their rivalous piece of vegetation is particular type of cactus which has very yellow spines in bunched group and these spines are quite invisible in their last inch or two so that it actually makes one feel that the cactus has leaped at him in other words you can touch the cactus without being aware of the fact that youre that close to the cactus because the outer spines of these bundles of spines are invisible and it people all there all claim all the arizonans claim that this cactus jumps at you and ive forgotten the name they call it by but its very annoying cactus i remember one time i was pulling cactus out of mary sues ankle after motorcycle ride and with pair of pliers and so on and what made it most interesting is the fact that i tried to get the cactus spines out originally with my motorcycle gloves and of course it just saturated my motorcycle gloves and i couldnt wear those and so i got cactus in and we just had more cactus all over the place than you could well appreciate went straight through her boots well arizonans with experiences of this particular character eventually begin to avoid this cactus very carefully at all times they avoid this cactus and theyre all convinced that it leaps at you which it doesnt so anyway imagine living in country always avoiding this cactus now what does the thetan do every time he sees this cactus he takes picture of the cactus he resists the cactus which makes an energy picture of cactus right so that far from avoiding cactus he is actually duplicating the cactus in his bank obsessively so the more he pushes back against the cactus of course the more pictures he gets of the cactus well eventually he finds out that his bank is prickly he doesnt like his bank he gets few traumatic experiences with the cactus and of course this sort of submerges and the engrams all get tangled up and that makes chain out of these pictures of cactus and one fine day hes being awfully pointed to people dont push too close on some native arizonans because theyre very cactusized theyre highly individuated and so on its interesting how unfriendly canthave land actually is youre walking out through the vast reaches of desert theres food theres water and that sort of thing hes very unfriendly and eventually the denizens of the country will become very unfriendly and everybodys having beautiful canthave run on him but there is an example of pushing against the cactus and of course every time you push against something you get picture of it and you must avoid the cactus you just must not well of course you cant see the pictures youre making of the cactus so they dont asis thats an important point because we must avoid the cactus we are taking pictures of the cactus and therefore we never asis the pictures of the cactus dont you see and eventually its these pictures which cause one to feel that closure has taken place actually it is not directly true that person avoids the cactus and then snaps into the cactus you see thats simple look but it is not correct one actually by avoiding he takes pictures then which he doesnt asis and these pictures not being asised can become quite dominant and after while he thinks of himself as cactus all because he tried to avoid cactus now he has already said lets go back one step earlier hes had hes already had to say that cactus can overwhelm hes had to make that postulate and that is the initial postulate and in all valence difficulties this is the initial postulate cactus can overwhelm that can overwhelm and when person has made this determinism of course he has started on the road of valence closure that can overwhelm and thats the way that goes now do you see how that mechanism is its its relatively easy mechanism when youre taking it apart as an auditor what are you doing you are trying to make somebody confront things they then start confronting the things they havent confronted in the bank and then the next thing you know it turns up that they have number of overts well they are being this thing so of course they havent any overts against it and therefore theyre totally irresponsible for anything theyve ever done to it because they arent doing anything to it they are it and the first thing they would tell you is that theyve never done anything to it and youll get null reading on the emeter with regard to questions regard to it but as you go along and in general processing the person begins to confront more and more of the pictures of his bank and we phrase it as his responsibility rises actually its not even as complicated as that its just the fact that hes now confronted enough of his bank to individuate slightly from his pictures and the moment he does that the string of overts which he did against the objects appear and so your security check begins to work and this is why security check is an excellent index as to whether or not your processing is getting anywhere because if security check works during the third intensive and it didnt work during the first intensive some question of it it is only that during the intervening time you have caused somebody to confront bank now if youve caused him to confront bank then naturally your security checks will work later on things they wouldnt work on earlier but if the pc is totally irresponsible on the third intensive on the same things that he was irresponsible for on the first intensive then we are making progress at all he is stuck totally in the valences that he was stuck in at the beginning of the intensives so your security check gives us wonderful index if more withholds dont appear constantly and continually during processing on things that were clean before then the person is not getting out of any valences and he is not confronting his bank better processing is not working if new withholds dont turn up on security checks you have made null give you an example we give sec check form 3 and we get all the way through it and everything is just fine and we say well thats wonderful and we clean this all up now and wrong adjudication well we wont have to do form 3 again thats totally wrong adjudication we give the pc twentyfive hours of particularly something like routine 3 which is straight at valences and at the end of those twentyfive hours we could go into form 3 again you understand we got form 3 all clean before these twentyfive hours were given now we give him twentyfive hours of routine 3 processing and now we give another form 3 and if we dont get whole bunch of new withholds our processing during that twentyfive hours might as well have been garbagecanned it was nonfunctional processing do you see why this mechanism is the mechanism is actually simple one its that an individual is not responsible for the things that have totally overwhelmed him because its responsible for having overwhelmed him dont you see so he is being these things so therefore he doesnt have any security check reaction to them because he is them youre talking to cactus so therefore he hasnt any overts against cactus he just is cactus thats all now as you processed him all of his times of resisting cactus have come up little by little or this way or that until you have confront going and you have little asis going of some of these pictures and of course this has shifted him from being cactus to somebody who has overts against cactus so security check on the subject of cactus would not work theres two tests of rightness that are invariable tests and are very wonderful ones and thats new withholds on the same security check that was null is the best representation of case advance there is that is better than profiles its better than iq tests its better than anything else its direct representation security check was null you processed him it is not now null that one and the other mechanism is the prehav these are the two most important mechanisms in scientology if you have the right goal and terminal and you have made an assessment on the prehav scale less levels will be alive on subsequent assessments on the prehav scale if the terminal is right if the terminal is wrong increasing numbers of levels will be alive at each successive assessment on the prehav scale those are very interesting things and those are two things which you should know and have good reality on you need to observe those things when you see them and get good grip on them because it tells you at once claw off to windward man this boy has not got the right terminal and it is utterly dynamite to run the wrong terminal complete dynamite it just must not be done if youve got the wrong terminal the first time you assess the terminal on the prehav scale to get run you had 5 levels live and you found 1 level and then you ran it and you ran it quote flat unquote and then you assess him again on the prehav scale and you have 12 levels alive oh oh oh oh oh oh oh you have the wrong terminal on the pc theres just arguing with it and you should go back and check it all over again and then if you still think youre right so you run this new level that you found and then you find 15 levels are now alive well dont commit suicide we need auditors but its almost that kind of condition thats really wrong the other one is if you give person security check ask him certain security questions audit him for while and then fail to get new withholds off the same questions youre not advancing in processing because youre not splitting him out of any valence so those are the two most important tests so thank you very much for asking that question male voice right that answered male voice yes ive got it thank you good all right any other question male voice yes preclear can have one goal and then you find one terminal and after youve run that terminal on all the levels that will fall you may look for new terminal correct and you may find new terminal and run it again you lost someplace this is not routine this is wildly off youre asking to do whole recapitulation of routine 3 now let see this and i wont scold you for asking question im glad you did instructor take note bulletin checks are in order because this is very clean clear activity very clean you get one goal the pc only has one goal you get one terminal off of that goal you run that until it is completely flat on all levels of the prehav scale and when that is completely flat and you get more reaction on it you check make sure your rudiments are all in completely and then you check the goal and check the terminal once more before you leave any terminal now having established for once and for all that you have actually flattened that terminal you try to find if there are any more terminals for that goal now only then would you depart from the first terminal only if there were more terminals for that goal now if there were you would assess them and run them the same way assessment by elimination but youve actually started routine 3 all over again male voice yes person accidentally has the first goal is still alive hes got another terminal for that goal now once more we do routine 3 all over again we just keep doing routine 3 all over again but the way you phrased it there and what i heard or what i seem to hear was offline in that running number of levels you then find new terminal that does not determine anything about it at all what is determined here very cleanly and clearly is the fact that youve run that terminal utterly absolutely flat on the case and then go back and do routine 3 again if the goal that he had before is still alive you assess for new terminal but remember you are only doing routine 3 over and over and over and there is shift from routine 3 it is the same action every time you always do the same action it is invariable male voice thank you i get more clear now ah so it is likely that he may have more than one terminals for that goal and would it be likely that he would have more than one goals well if you get that goal gone yes hes going to have other goals but its hes never going to have more than one goal that you can find youre never going to find more than one goal on him youre never gonna find pc with two goals and youre never going to find pc with goals male voice yes and after the goal that has and if youve got the goal youre never going to find more than one terminal youll never find terminals and youll never find two terminals youll always find one terminal this is an oddity there is only one level of the prehav scale never two levels never levels unless the terminal is flat its always one one one theres reason for that is this is twopole universe and the only way thetan can get into trouble is go one pole so you found the onepole track and its one goal which is utterly foreign to this universe so therefore hangs one terminal which is utterly foreign to this universe and therefore hangs one level of thought on this subject foreign to this universe and therefore hangs but once having done this whole action of finding the goal finding the terminal finding the level and then running that level flat and then finding another level and running it flat and finding another level and running it flat and make sure after you have flat level only after level is flat find some pictures the person has had run those things as engrams get that two or three engrams out of the road find new level run that you keep doing this and eventually that goal will longer produce any reaction of any kind matter how well the rudiments are in or anything else now you can just scrub any complications because all you do is routine 3 again it just so happens that that goal is still alive well therefore youll find another terminal now thatll fit that goal and youll find new level and you assess that level and you run that level and you just go through the whole action again so its actually you cant say you cant say that you run terminal flat and then go back and find another terminal and run it flat because if you looked at it in this way this is very unneat it looks complicated and it looks like there is more than one routine 3 and it looks like he might get hung up this thing is much more simple than that routine 3 is just routine 3 when you have flattened terminal utterly on the prehav scale all levels you do routine 3 again its as simple as that you see and of course you take goals assessment and naturally if the goal is still alive and its and theres another terminal to be run on that particular goal now naturally that goal is going to show up again but theres reason to be complicated about it because you might as well say well we scrubbed that terminal now were going to go back and do routine 3 all over again and just do routine 3 and all you have to learn how to do is do routine 3 and you can learn how to do that well and just do it repetitively over and over and over and the case will go clear that is all you have to know and also that there is only one goal and at any one time there is only one terminal will show up and theres only one level on the prehav scale also theres only one engram in the chain that actually the pc is hung up in that can be run at time he never has two engrams in restimulation youll only get one to react on the meter this is the most oneoneoneone affair you ever heard of you see its one goal one terminal one level one engram and its quite remarkable and once youve gotten routine 3 done with youve said thats it you go back with terminal you see you cant find any more live levels on the prehav scale you just go back and do routine 3 all over again and of course if the same goal is alive youre going to get the same goal but nevertheless its still there now what goals list do you use to get the second terminal you use his first goals list use the first goals list you ever saw therefore the papers on person who is being run on routine 3 assume considerable importance not for the record and not for my research files or something like that theyre of great importance to the auditor and great importance to the pc and therefore the records of goals assessments and so on must be carefully preserved theres another reason for this is once case is stalled some because somebody has done something weird youve got to have his auditing records available in order to track back and find out what he was run on before because the cure for all this is oddly enough to go back and do what was not done and you go back and find the first undone do and do it and its always invariable the same thing if youve missed the fellows goal entirely you always return to the first list dont go on with these interminable lists see it go onto the first list therefore that list must be preserved if youve missed his terminal and after youve gotten up to five six seven hundred terminals and you still are getting place well youd better decide that you are driving tricycle all over the wide plains because that terminal is right back in the first group but the rudiments or something or something about the case or something like this or some withholds or some suppressions have knocked it out and you put this all in order and then you go back to the first list of terminals and if youre putting somebody to rights who has been misrun and you cant find prehav level live then the thing for you to do if you get the rudiments in and you still cant find prehav level alive then you had better go back and check and find out if there was any level left unflat at any time and get the first level that was left unflat and flatten it and all of sudden the whole prehav scale will go alive again so you always go back and do what was left undone and you always cover the same records and its one of these interesting circular activities and the person is clear when you can longer can do any of them you cant get the rudiments in because theyre in you cant get any goal because he hasnt got any stuck goals you cant get any terminals because they dont exist and you cant get any levels on the prehav scale because there arent any and you cant run any engrams because theyre blown and of course at this interesting state of affairs you have fortunately another indicator so that you dont just have somebody who is arc broke and so isnt registering on the meter you see youve got another state of affairs and that state of affairs is floating needle the emeter is unreadable the emeter is useless and the emeter becomes completely useless instrument when routine 3 becomes completely useless and wont work when the emeter is completely useless and wont work and when the pc will sit down and go through any endless number of doodledaddles and whatamagoodjits and processes and you just go ahead if you want to audit it thats all right in other words not even bad auditing works why hes clear and thats thats if you want your final test for clear that would be it the final test for clear is that you cant run routine 3 on him anymore because the pc works but the meter doesnt work pc by the way will go on being audited which is quite interesting they dont do big blow and say im too busy and im really clear and i want to get things done they will go on being audited you make an auditing appointment you want to audit him and so forth theyll be audited and it leaves very upset auditor very often well he does manage to find an engram he does he manages to find one that wasnt run and there it is and so forth and hes got it and it reacted on the meter and the meter stopped floating damn it and it stopped floating and he actually got reaction and it fell and so forth so he rolls up his sleeves and he gets all set to run it and its not there anymore and so he decides the pc must have escaped and so he goes over the track carefully and he runs the attack and escape process in order to get the pc back into the incident and the incident is there it must be there and but it isnt there and you cant get any reaction on the emeter its very disappointing activity heartbreaking more auditors have been upset by trying to run routine 3 on clear than any other single action its very upsetting and they start blowing engrams by inspection and this is fantastic when everybody knows that they ought to be 75 hours on the engram you see and they blow it by inspection so when you run into that sort of thing youve got that but dont make an error into the fact that routine 3 is complicated it is not it is very simple action but therefore because it is simple action it requires superlatively well trained auditors to follow it through okay yes male voice thank you how long would it take time hm how long would it take to what male voice how long would it take uh how long would be the maximum time allowed to run the first level off aw you cant even guess theyd vary vary vary ill tell you how long how long the last clear took audited by clear clear audited person to clear in 118 hours that was the last clear that was made just week or so ago last week i think in australia just checked out by hco and the whole auditing time was 118 hours that is clear auditing so female voice but ron what about the one that was produced in fifty hours in mauritius fifty oh well yes ive just given you time im just giving you the time of the last clear theres other complications in what im saying male voice what i really meant was the first level oh you want to know how the first level well if i could tell you that it took 18 hours 17 minutes and 63 seconds i would first have to predict how many booboos youre gonna make how far your rudiments are going to be out on the pc how much trouble the pc is going to be in in life what the pcs actual case state was how difficult terminal it was and how muggy goal now when weve got all those things settled in we could estimate this it would just take anything that you can guess just think of figure male voice now lets say if i knew that on the worst case if i have more than fifty hours that would be bad auditing on my part i would have i wouldnt want to go that far nope female voice it takes as long as it takes will you take will you take this as an example and as an answer just think of figure right now think of figure male voice fifty hours all right thats how long it takes all right okay got it i mean its just anybodys guess all right another male voice what are the indications that pc is ready for routine 3 what are the indications that pc is ready for routine 3 will he sit in the auditing chair and answer your questions coherently audience member any pc then anyone who any pc any pc if hell sit in the auditing chair and give you some coherent response to questions can be run on routine 3 audience member thank you any coherent response now that word coherent will be susceptible to numerous interpretations and i had better define that word for you little more closely intelligible answer you say to the pc how are you today and he thinks for little while and he says well im not so good that is coherent response to your question you say to the pc how are you today and he looks at you and he says well i dont know aunt mamie is pretty good now were getting questionable coherence but nevertheless is in the zone of coherence now we say to the pc how are you today and the pc says cars should eat crackers this is not level of coherence we say to the pc how are you today and the pc says uh im not going to talk to you because i am mad at you that is level of coherence that is level of coherence hes still talking to you and it is in response to the fact that hes being addressed that is level of coherence you say to the pc how are you today and he says gooba gooba gooba ubauba well you probably arent talking his language so that isnt level of coherence in other words the thing is susceptible to numerous interpretations but it merely means that even with little struggle you can get the pc to concentrate on what youre doing and respond to some degree on what you want him to say when you ask him for goal why although he might occasionally wander off and comm lag and so forth he will give you goal that much response is all the response you need to run routine 3 and it doesnt matter what his sanity is or what his profile is or his graph or anything else you could probably find many many people probably the preponderance of people inn an insane asylum could be run on this okay male voice thank you right all right yes another male voice could you tell us something about the difference in what the clears are today whether theyre theta clear or mest clear you are dealing with mest clears entirely with very upgraded definition of mest clear theta clear is very finite definition and very cleancut definition it is person who operates exterior to body without need of body now you see youre not making that type of clear it is an upgrade from this actually theta clear is cleared on all dynamics including the fourth all dynamics he is simply cleared on these dynamics he therefore does not have tremendous dependency on body and that is it now we have upgraded the definition of mest clear because it is the first stable state we have got state of stability for this particular state and this is state of stability so just make it what it is it is mest clear but mest clear before had much lower requirement it was person who was not troubled by bank particularly now today youre not doing that actually mest clear is inoperative on meter meter merely floats mest clear totally stabilized takes them some months to even out they will run into things life itself is sort of confusion and theyve got the confusion of life stabilized and that sort of thing they are however operating as person and they are operating as member of the human race and so forth so could not be considered to be theta clear now the probability is that the borderline between mest clear and theta clear is developed not on the button of can somebody operate exterior to his body but on the button is he anymore controlled by the symptoms of hunger does he need food air and these other things to survive and it is these buttons those buttons rather than some esoteric button of could he sit on mountaintop and regard his navel with an xray eye that would establish this particular facet now you go up to the next grade you go up to the grade of operating thetan and you notice that the word clear has not been used for that grade and there is idea of clear youre talking about different being entirely and that state or status would be therefore one who didnt have bank that was troubling him in other words his reactive bank was not an unknown series of factors to him to one who was not influenced in favor of one more than another of the dynamics and who did not experience need or necessity for food clothing shelter and the rest of these things didnt have to have body and so forth now we go up to an entirely different aspect on the upgrade and that is somebody who can handle mest he is not in state where he could take it or leave it alone he is in the state where he could be quite aggressive toward it or he could be quite manipulative of it now you get the clever states of moving the ashtray you know this kind of thing of of starting the whirlwind this is your trick the trick level oddly enough some very aberrated thetans can on some very reactive system or another of something terrifically emphasized produce poltergeist and some magician here or there in past times has been able to start whirlwind and well for instance you could probably theres undoubtedly somebody here although you possibly havent noticed it who could disintegrate cloud by looking at it and this odd trickeries but these things are too channeled and theyre too fixed and the band isnt broad an operating thetan well you could disperse cloud and you could collect one and then you could move one and then you could precipitate one got the idea then you could put it back the way it was in the first place and then make three clouds and make three pretzels and ballantines beer and hang it over the cloud you could do something weird you could do something with mest and the best index of that the best explanatory statement that could be made is someone who has consequences connected with creation and when hes the person is totally recovered from all consequences of creation you could say well ot thats about the only test there would be there and one of the tests would be youd have him mock up whole bunch of things and see if hes spun in i mean thats thatd be the crudest level of testing we would have right at the present moment you know and its great liability having ots around its very great liability it must be because the state has been fought tooth and toenail by practically every society that has ever been formed and right now the one thing to which the roman catholic church owes tremendous success line is the fact they promised everybody to get rid of all of the spirits in their vicinity and whether these spirits were good bad or indifferent they never bothered to inquire but they promised everybody they were going to get rid of all the spirits and save their souls well we dont know what that was all about but it was apparently lot of people were afraid of this particular state because they made lot of smoke about it but of course the people around who were in that state at that time were in such limited state it was something like well being able to dissolve cloud today they couldnt do very much that and they were possibly sufficiently irresponsible though that they were dangerous members of society who knows it was three states with which youre dealing youre dealing with the fourth state and this fourth state is release when you have found somebodys goal and terminal and level and when you have really nicely completed security check you will find that you have made tremendous difference in this particular person and if you have at the same time lets expand the definition little bit eradicated his present time problems off long duration let assure you you have something which is so superior to anything you had before that you certainly had better designate it as something so you designate it as release the basic definition of release is somebody who doesnt think hes going to keep going downhill thats all he doesnt think hes going to get worse he thinks hes going to get better he knows now hes going to get better hes got certainty on the fact that hes on the road out that is release its the same state of mind that youve opened this jail door and they can look down the road and there are soldiers with pikes and nobody in the watchtowers with sten guns and theres booby traps or mines on the highway and they all think there is at first and they inspect these things very carefully if you were to suddenly go to wormwood scrubs or something and suddenly throw open the gates and say well all right boys youd find there are tremendous numbers of them that wouldnt even go near the gate or inspect it youd say well there are guards out here theres nobody in the watchtowers anymore and theres nothing on the road and you can just leave go ahead the gates are wide open and turn your back youd come back in some hours to inspect it you would find very interesting state of affairs youd find that some of them had not left at all and were not about to leave they knew they had been fooled this would be their first mental reaction if anybody tells you anything like that this must be total foolery uh and its just new new technique of betrayal thats their big certainty and theyre still cowering back in their cells sitting apathetic about it all and so on another group you would find milling around the courtyard trying to get nerve enough up to look to see if the guards were still on both sides of the gate they would just be trying to get up their nerve thered be another group out in the courtyard satisfied that there were guards at the gate but recognizing that the ne plus ultra would be to take the guards off the gate and then have machine guns in the towers you see and as soon as you got outside you would probably get it in the back and theyre satisfied that theyre free for the courtyard but they are pretty sure that they had better not go down the road and then youll find another group who are outside dodging down the road but jumping back of bushes and jumping in and out of ditches and progressing in short bursts you see from cover to cover and then way down the road someplace youd find group of guys walking along saying wasnt that nice of somebody to open the gates and these these various states are reflected of course in the attitudes of pcs and when theyve gotten over the idea that this is the principal idea theyd have to get over is that this freedom is new betrayal thats the principal idea that release would have to get over if he got the if he still had the idea that this offered freedom was just new betrayal you couldnt say he was release because hes never going to walk past the front gates or the watchtowers so he has to be over that particular state of mind and you could counterphrase it and say well he knows he isnt going to get worse and so forth but he knows he is on the road out and up and he knows that he isnt going to get tripped down and thrown to the wolves again now he knows this so just knowing that actually produces an enormous difference of case level and it isnt something that collapses its fairly stable case level so those are the four states you are operating with right at the present moment of course that first state is terribly easy to attain and one of the best ways to attain it is by security checks oddly enough but security check just rendered endlessly on somebody may take quite awhile you find his goal you find his terminal he gets greater reality on himself and now he understands lot of things that he did and you complete good security check on him and he gets off all of his pretense and feeling of fraudulences about himself and odd doubts and that sort of thing youve made an enormous difference in person the person now looks factual to others he has level of reality which is very good and so forth so its dignified by this term release although of course being the lowest of the states on the road up not the lowest of states but for the lowest of states on the road up it of course is far more complicated state and far more difficult to establish than the upper three states these are very easy much easier to establish probably the easiest state in the world to establish right now is the state of clear anybody could check for clear anybody could check for it if he could operate meter he can check clear i mean its as easy as that because the meters inoperative the person isnt hanging at 20 or 30 on the apathetic underbeat with stuck needle you see because the meters still operative you can still make that meter operate but you got floating needle thats drifting around and it floats and you ask the person various questions and you dont get any responses and so forth thats clear test that straighten out these states for you arthur male voice thanks so much you bet all right yes bonnie female voice two questions ron one only one at time female voice where would you read im in this universe huh female voice all right where would you read release on the meter where would you read release on the meter oh well thats very difficult to say i can tell you where he wouldnt be audience voice not at clear now thats i can tell you where he wouldnt be and this is the only thing youve got to be careful of in checking out release and youd better be careful of this because lots of auditors have been fooled in the last decade by this one he sits at the clear read for his body and hes dead body hes totally irresponsible he gets fast needle reactions the needle is pretty sticky and to get any response at all you have to advance the sensitivity but the tone arm does locate him at his clear read of that is the lower harmonic of clear and it is total apathy it is total irresponsibility and its giddygiddy whee all us people in seventh heaven some kind of weird state and every now and then some auditor has enthusiastically offered one of these people up as clear and he hasnt noticed you see he hasnt noticed any time he was auditing the person never has had response on the meter the person never has been able to go all the way through security check merely because the person hasnt any withholds nothing is withhold he has responsibility for anything so of course nothing is withhold you get the idea nothing you never get single reaction on the needle when youre asking him about anything and to get any kind of reading you have to have your sensitivity very well advanced and it is very far from floating needle and anybody who knows emeters could look at this particular case at once and say clear near beer man thats nowhere yet that has fooled people and people have even occasionally been checked out as clear who were in total apathy whose chronic somatics were in full scream who just complete flub now this is this is interesting because it means that you have to know what is floating needle and it is quite distinctly different from this other phenomena the other phenomena is very distinctive but i was fooled one time by this other phenomena i had newspaper reporter who was doing some press work for an organization here and he was one of these cases and only when i suddenly realized the man couldnt work couldnt think didnt think it was possible to get any press or publicity was totally negative along all these lines i took another look at the situation and sure enough he was one of these spook cases he sat directly on 30 he didnt respond in any particular direction to anything but his needle was stuck couldnt get any response to what it was and what it turned up the clue was that he couldnt run help that was the clue he couldnt run help and he couldnt run control see he couldnt answer positive question he couldnt make decision he just was dead body he was deadthetan case and he had initiative he couldnt work he was in horrible condition but nevertheless at first glance on meter you see you say well the man is reading this was many years ago by the way when we didnt know very much about this and he was just sitting at this clear read and apparently wasnt too stuck up and so forth and i just happened to notice this in passing and then later on noticed his behavior on post and it was fantastic complete irresponsibility he just could not get anything done in any direction he could not work he could not think he couldnt make decision he thought everything was impossible and another thing he thought was everything was fraud and everything was going to betray him and he was really betraying everybody and oh it was the wildest package well i was inter got interested in the package because that was the first one i ever saw that was perfect dead thetan he was perfect dead thetan he really thought of himself as having died long time ago and hadnt been alive ever since all right now theres your there is in essence the behavior of that female voice but how would you recognize release on the meter well the release has action on the meter but he doesnt have that one you see he doesnt have that one but neither does he have any other person actually could possibly theoretically be stuck in 70 on your dial and still be considered release i mean you cannot lay down now something like this because person in processing from day to day if you will notice if his case is making any progress hes liable to be reading these days at 10 or 60 or almost anything release is not necessarily not on clear read and release is not necessarily high release is necessarily however not one of these deadthetan cases and he of course is not reading with floating needle if he were reading with floating needle he would be clear so its not determinate its not determinate youll female voice how would you recognize him then hm female voice youd recognize him by his case not worsening ill go over this again his characteristics are very finite and very easily established if you call these characteristics that of release you will be absolutely certain not to make any mistakes you dont want somebody who is going to be disgrace to you so hes got to know hes on the road out hes got to know hes been helped and hes got to know that he isnt being betrayed and so if you lay down these characteristics you will have such person 1 you have found his goal 2 you have found his terminal this will make an enormous difference with case and 3 has successfully gotten through form 3 security check and has it all clean for this particular level now if those things have occurred the chances of this person now being in state of fraudulence betrayal upset superchronic somatics road out its all blocked youre gypping tremendous numbers of present time problems skidding all over the place these things are relatively well ruled out by these conditions now if you wanted to add another one to it to be absolutely sure you would say that you have handled his problems of long duration which is his chronic somatics have been handled now that for sure would be release now if youve put these things together you could if person had met all those characteristics it would be the safest thing in the world the safest thing in the world to say well he is release because he is stable case at this point and he is not going to cave in again female voice thank you you betcha all right now what was the other question female voice how would you audit mest clear to ot how would you audit mest clear to ot well thats very good thats very fine now you are dealing with unknown data you are dealing with vast number of processes which have been turned out and nearly all of these processes have were covered over the years and they are totally out of reach but itd be something on the order of he could do any process in scientology i released some from south africa called ultimate processes now if fellow could do those ultimate processes and they were all flat given the fact he was clear in the first place and he could do all those processes why you would find that was fine but of course youre youve taken double jump here you want to know how to audit person from clear to operating thetan is that right audience member thats right all right now operating thetan and clear are not next to each other there is clear and then there is theta clear and you would be operating him from theta clear to operating thetan or you would be operating him from clear to theta clear now taking him from theta clear to operating thetan is relatively easy because you have the old book creation of human ability now youll find all those processes in there are applicable youll find the ultimate processes which i released last fall in south africa those are all applicable you have all of creative processing released in england in the 52 53 all of that is applicable youd find that weve already covered the ground it isnt an unknown zone at all its zone that has been developed now the other one what you really ought to be asking about is how do you take person from mest clear to theta clear now that is very pertinent and how you get him over that jump is under study right at this moment and its very difficult because you are totally inoperative youre not guided by any meter female voice what about the oscilloscope well thats all right but we havent made the total jump on there we merely have some clues we kind of know where were going were feeling our way the subject is one of these research projects of some magnitude the first goal along this line and the first big discovery along this line occurred just fortyeight hours ago i found out the common denominator of all cases that have bodies and its not very startling since you could have suspected it but of course itd be violation of havingness in some fashion or another naturally but their attitudes in of havingness are incorrect incorrect to this state is they hunger they can starve and they have anxieties about procurement of food air heat and these other factors and i finally isolated this thing to my own satisfaction only about fortyeight hours ago you clear clear of hunger you see hes already clear but there he is in body and hes eating and hes breathing and hes still hanging around and he still considers himself exclusively member of the human race he still swats flies with great enthusiasm get the idea all right how come all this how come all this well he is clear on the fourth dynamic youll find out youre going to have trouble by the way from time to time administrationally and politically in scientology its entering right now because just about the first place person who is good and clear heads is of course the fourth dynamic and they get over this so suffer them suffer along with them on it its its an almost an occupational illness of clear the fourth dynamic and they go intensely onto the fourth dynamic you see up to this time theyd been on third theyd been on second theyd been on first and all of sudden bang they find themselves on the fourth well theyre cleared on the first second and third and that fourth dynamic they suddenly wake up with tremendous reality on the fourth dynamic and they say there is mankind wow see well now this isnt the lower harmonic of lets all go to trafalgar square and sit down this is very overt that is the lower harmonic of the same phenomenon you see all things have their lower scale mockeries thisll make you feel funny more than once in your lifetimes all things have their lower scale mockeries all great dancers are now and then imitated by lousy dancers in burleycue shows you know i mean its lower scale mockeries always occur just like theres lower scale mockery of clear person sits on his clear read is absolutely dead and completely useless you see person says well thats what clear is i dont want to be one well i dont blame him i dont want to be dead either because its so inactive thats the only thing wrong with being dead and so we look over the attributes of the clear as he goes up the line and we find out crash he discovers the fourth dynamic only now the aberration is not in his bank the aberration is right out here right now and you take bunch of people who arent clear and try to persuade them up that they ought to do something on the fourth dynamic and you lay ostrich eggs robins eggs very frail eggs very tough eggs but theyre all eggs and you dont get even get an omelet out of it because nobody pays any attention to this at all but nevertheless clear has an ability to lead youll find most of them are well are they will lead and they can infect people with considerable enthusiasm along certain lines like the fourth dynamic and that sort of thing so youll have here and there throughout scientology i can absolutely assure you whether its south africa australia the united states and so on south africa has right now got one of these things going very laudable to its degree but its iimpractical to this extent is the clear in this particular case is talking completely beyond the reality of other people and theyre not going to know what the hell this persons talking about thats all now the best way to do something for the fourth dynamic is of course get people into the pe course and have an hgc that clears people now if you can get those two things youre doing the most for the fourth dynamic that you could possibly do to do much more than that at this particular stage of the game exceeds reality youll only cause tremendous crosscommotion of some kind or another and itll only wind up in the soup but this particular aspect of the clear is that he has found mankind and he has found them out here now and he finds them present time problem now its not case of his bank its not case of the bank condition whereby he has got to do something because it hurts him so on his little toe every time he sees woman see thats his motivation before that his motivation right now is this fourth dynamic as we look around this particular rather small planet on twelfthrate sun seems to be in one godawful mess and it seems to be causing it number of problems and these are very observable to the clear and its they enter into it in the same enthusiasm that youll find in pc when you eventually uncover the problem hes really worrying about have you ever had this happen with pc the pcs going on and on and on hes talking about nattering problems this way nattering problems and all of sudden he finds problem hes really worrying about in life he takes off with enthusiasm well thats it you know bang well clear casewise does this and sooner or later you can expect that phenomenon to occur well of course theyre on the road up and they will eventually blow that and go on to the fifth and the seventh and the eighth and come back to the sixth and by the time theyve got these more or less whipped you will find that theyre upwards toward theta clear and then if they thought there was something to be done about mankind they would probably do something about mankind for instance i can tell you very practical way of stopping war you mock up small herald and he walks up the steps of the white house and hes got tabard on you see and of course the gmen of course all shoot him and the bullets go through him and dont make any impression which upsets the gmen and he goes on in and he pulls out he blows blast on this trumpet and he pulls out this long scroll and he reads to the president people of earth we come in peace we bring plowshare not sword you see that sort of thing and unless conference is held amongst all nations with whereby they are sincerely going to operate along peaceful lines something like this you see in fortnight why were going to have to put the president and the other heads of nations under close arrest and then of course just disappears in small cloud of smoke now thats very effective of course they dont do anything but natter for fortnight and then you mock up some very tough space opera characters standing around the gates of the white house standing around the kremlin standing around here and there you see and so on and they dont let anybody leave or enter this is upsetting because the gmen and the nkvd and other such nonsense peoples cant shoot them you see and its all very upsetting and so they finally do hold conference of some kind or another you see and they come to some agreement to scrap bombs or turn them into the running of merchant ships or something else practical see now there is method of doing this but youll find somebody as he goes up scale will collide with this as solution actually this is not much of solution but its pretty good stopgap and its much better than going to trafalgar square and sitting down in the rain because the pavement is so damp ah dear these things of course are problems of politics governments civilizations and person starts colliding with these things then eventually as you go along why lot of people are clear theyll eventually realize mores what mores people arent operating with any mores theyre operating with bunch of prejudices which they themselves do while enforcing them on others and we dont have civilization we have games condition well they start straightening out this you see and that keeps them busy for quite while thats about the way it goes you dont necessarily have quiet peace when you wind up by the way they eventually get up to the point where they recognize the imposition of inaction on everybody is fine method of making everybody ill all youve got to do is make everybody be quiet enough and they all get sick you notice the medical doctor is always making himself enormous future fees always he tells you you must be quiet and you must go to bed for week or so and you must do this he must you must you must be quiet that is the main thing whereas truthfully speaking the best advice as you could get good reality on is tell somebody who is coughing and wheezing and having terrible time you tell him well walk around the block for an hour and note everything you see carefully in other words get little bit active get little more active than they are now of course theres finite point where this becomes impossible and that is when person cant move his legs or his arms or his head you tell him to get up and walk around the block youve given him lose but i dont think at that stage you should tell him to be quiet and the medical doctor can never resist you couldnt get him out of bed practically with derrick you see and the medical doctor can always be counted on in the patients hearing to tell somebody else particularly well you have to keep him in bed for few days you know cant you dont you recognize this is very familiar has familiar ring to it well they just never can resist telling everybody to be inactive which is marvelous piece of nonsense because its going to make everybody sick but of course that increases their fees theyre practical men at least even if rather shortsighted on the dynamics i dont think medical doctor even gets to the first but your best system of doing anything for society the most practical system of doing something for society is rehabilitate knowingness if you rehabilitate knowingness and ability people will work things out if you pull the rug out from underneath everybody and tell them to be utter slaves and that sort of thing you dont work things out it becomes nosolution of magnitude common solutions on the track which many of you have reality on you well you do such things as set up huge electronic computer that figures out everybodys lives for them and they all go by the ticker tape and go in for their inoculations and truth serum or something like this or you have thought tower prominent in the middle of town everybody anytime thinks hostile thought why he immediately reports himself to the police because he realizes its been picked up by the thought tower and so on were skating awfully close to that you know with security checks and the only thing that security check has to excuse itself is that it makes people free and the thought tower mechanism never did anything but make slaves because if somebody reported in that hes thought hostile thought against the administration of course they immediately put him in the electric box and that was that anyway those are your various states well ive overanswered the question but given you some various views on things which youve probably been thinking about whither are we drifting i imagine scientologist every once in while looks up and says whither are we drifting well the only way id modify the statement is should we ask whither are we gegangen at such helluva rate of speed because were on our way were not drifting anyplace now the basic modus operandi on which i operate politically or administratively is that the only solutions are technological solutions which restore comprehension and selfdeterminism and those are valid solutions because at the same time comprehension is restored people can understand what is going on and when you reestablish selfdeterminism then you have made person capable of responsibility for his own actions and youll find out that when somebody is responsible for his actions across number of the dynamics that he does not commit crimes he is not evil and you dont necessarily put him into motionlessness you see and so on and youll find out the more people that can know the difference between right and wrong the more people who can understand the more people who can reach decisions the more people who can act to straighten out any given situation the better things will be that is all its very simple solution its too simple that one could very often be accused of some subterfugenous deviative offbeat pitch of some kind or another he could be accused of all kinds of odd things because there is an old mystical law though that fellow has as much power as he can be trusted with its not quite right thats theosophy theres normally little pitch connected with those things the proper statement is person has as much power as he will trust himself to have that is the proper statement that is the real basic law of that he will have as much power as he can trust himself to have and when he can longer entrust himself to have any power he then starts running on some kind of wild automaticity that has nothing to do with selftrust or selfdistrust or anything else its just its just motion and the more you have to do with criminals the more this fact is impressed on you that criminal is not any longer dealing in right and wrong criminal is simply dealing in forms of action and inaction insentient criminal does not make sense after he steals something he never does anything with it hes quite amazing but of course any confusion is amazing hes as hes like mest in that mest turned loose on mest simply collides with mest you pour bunch of liquids into the same bowl theres decision on whether they associate or dont associate they simply do and you separate them out in test tubes and theres question on the subject of the mest doesnt think that its being separated out or not being separated out it simply separates out any exterior force any exterior stimuli brings about some type of response but response in the individual only occurs by reason of exterior stimuli and you have packaged the criminal in very tight package right there all things occur by exterior stimuli only exterior stimuli is responsible for anything you talk to him he is the most amazing fellow confirmed criminal is the most amazing fellow to talk to you ever heard of cawooo he just leaves you utterly baffled the way to get unbaffled about it all is disabuse yourself of the fact that youre talking to sentients youre not talking to anyone or anything that is sentient you are talking about mechanism which activates on exterior stimuli the bottle is on the counter and because the bottle is on the counter it makes him put it in his pocket because the whisky is on the table it makes him drink the whisky you got the idea see he has nothing to do with anything that is going on anywhere and if you understand him at all you had just better put it in the phraseology of mest you dont think of an ashtray deciding whether or not it is going to be moved well dont think of criminal as deciding whether or not he is going to do criminal act there is understanding there so of course its incomprehensible his actions are then incomprehensible well incomprehensible is because he has understanding its as simple as that now when you get large section of the populace down to certain low levels of irresponsibility and all things start operating on stimulusresponse basis there is sentience left to furnish any direction and there is nothing going to happen but indirection and collision of some kind theres nothing going to occur but confusion and randomity that is about all that occurs and you see society which is disintegrated it has many interesting dramatizations and aspects and oddball activities and mores and all these things and eventually theyre just merely confusion because theyre none of them sentient none of them directional and all of them occurring because of exterior stimuli why did he kill the girl he killed the girl because the room was hot youll find out thats where its gone and thats it and of course the poor police they sit around and they grant this fellow beingness you know theyre always granting the criminal beingness and theyre granting the he had some motive for killing the girl theyre if theyre any sure of anything you see theyre hung with that security see they think well he had motive for killing the girl why did he kill the girl you see well they put him under the hot lights why did you kill this girl you see and he says well the room was hot and thats why and they say well he wont answer the question and question him for another twentyfour hours you see and then decide that hes crazy and then put him in mental home where he stays for five days and is then released i mean some weird things are going on in the society at this time its basically on the basis that the society is rigged for people to be responsible in and then you have vast numbers of people who are being irresponsible in it you see so it becomes incomprehensible how it is running somebody mr jubbajubba pangawonga is suddenly elected as president of the algerian secret consuls of the upper hinterland or something you see why hell he hasnt any responsibility for it he has administrative training he has nothing of the sort he has tradition background of anything else but throwing spears at gazelles maybe and there he is but everybody says well he is president of the upper abyssinian hinterland so therefore he is responsible authority so therefore the things which he is doing make sense see you see thats what doesnt make sense is the assumption that what hes doing makes sense you see where it breaks down the stupidity is interjected by the interjecting of pretended knowingness its false knowingness they know he knows what hes doing but of course this country might two thousand three thousand years ago when it had an administrative political tradition when things were running in the country when it was set up at one time for instance abyssinia was the conquering entity of egypt and actually ran egypt for god knows how long you see they werent always stupid and there they are and at that time if youd elected mr jubbajubba pongawonga as president of the upper abyssinian hinterland and so forth you would have had an administrator in the place and you wouldnt have had to ask all these odd questions you see but now the society decays goes to pieces is conquered by this one conquered by that one overrun by somebody else everybody carefully shoots anybody in that society who has any political leanings naturally if they want to control the thing theyve got to kill everybody that has any political leanings and they gradually weeded out the japanese in formosa were quite interesting they made everybody who had any political aptitude or was demonstrating any they made him into an opium addict whats more simple that was their basic government policy in formosa well all of sudden we tried to set up government in formosa well for lord knows how many many many many many decades you see they carefully made sure that there are leaders and nobody to take responsibility for formosa and all of sudden the japanese pull out and we elect one of these people as in charge of formosa and their first action i think their first action was to shoot fifteen thousand students that seemed to be good political action the proper action to take well the students were around and they had some banners and they were in motion so of course you had to stop the motion and they did total responsibility the stimulusresponse you get the idea so you get any kind of if you want chaos all you have to do is remove all responsibility from the chaos and if you want to disestablish chaos all you have to do is return responsibility into the area and thats it very simple except its such simplicity that it has apparently escaped man for very long time i didnt mean to get off onto harangue like this but whither are we drifting i think probably should need comment here and there you see we might very well be part and parcel to the fifth invaders conquering earth you see we might be secret adjunct of the space command which is really interrupting everything we might be this and we might be that theres every reason why we might well have been part of the marcab confederacy dont you see as an extensional arm of invasion on earth theres every reason because this is timetable on which earth is operating right at the present moment but the truth of the matter is its too simple to observe you see it rather escapes the eye we are just us you see thats the most we could be could be said about us because we are definitely more and more us and we are more us than any other uss on the simple rationale that the more effective we become individually why the greater effectiveness we will have as group and the greater sentience and responsibility zones will occur and of course we cant help but win because its not very complex and the complex structures break down but every once in while somebody looks into scientology for some vast complicated complexity of some kind or another theres every reason in the world why we might be one but you just it evades peoples thirst for complexity you see that we arent and what were doing is very very simple its just the more the individual is selfdetermined the greater his zone of influence the greater capability there is there the more potential that is built up in that particular area and this is im only talking now third dynamic on scientology why naturally you build up tremendous potential there isnt anything thatd stand up to it theres not much doubt about that reversewise there is another one that goes on simultaneously and that is the simple action of setting men free and thats perfectly simple laudable understandable action youre going to find sooner or later theres going to be some scientologist stood up against the wall because he was overthrowing earth let tell you man were getting up to point where authority could here and there shake in its boots but actually more than shake in their boots they succumb because remember that the world is basically running on the basis of exterior stimuli today and the most stimulating stimuli there is around in the field of human relations is us so we couldnt help but win i think we could try to go backwards at this particular time i dont think wed make it i think our forward impetus is too great im not even talking hopefully australia is unbearably cocky at this particular instant see probably you none of you would find it capable of living with any of them you see theyre making clears theyre doing this and doing that all you all they do is put something on the grapevine and the government does it thats right i mean its that positive i had big discussion one night with bunch of scientologists in australia i said well the currency is inflating because you dont have enough goods in the country to absorb the money and the country is doing something very stupid in that it has very high tariff wall now what we need to do is organize resistance against the tariff wall and keep you from being cut off from the commonwealth utterly and we discussed it all over and we even had demonstrations that we were going to organize and we were going to have all the workmen in the country refuse to work with tools on which tariff had been paid all the housewives to refuse to serve food or use utensils on which anything had been paid you know make bit of demonstration and so forth we never had chance went straight to canberra ten days later they lifted all tariffs all tariffs to the united states i think they left 10 percent of them on some goods being established were left on but the rest of them were all lifted that was quite interesting wasnt it it made do double take i said what is going on here well what was going on is very simple our lines of influence were much stronger than we realized and amongst the people i was talking to of course they had lots of friends and the friends had friends and what we were talking about and what i was talking about was very acceptable and they thought this was very fine idea and it went straight to canberra and it got done instantly there are other such instances of that down there theyre not having much trouble now doctors we made the doctors get rid of their secretary of their association because he was objectionable to us goofball things like this but theyre the australian scientologist now is pretty cocky the south african scientologist is getting very cocky and should be and the atmosphere is changing one way or the other and you wont notice the degree of the influences you will sometimes make mistake youll say well theyre copying us theyre not copying you theyre obeying you theres big difference and they will change off to more practical aspects of it as fast you get clear thats all there is to it well i want two by tomorrow so you better get to work and right now good night
