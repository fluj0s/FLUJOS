classified by economic counselor dale eppler for reasons 14 b and d 1 c on february 22 local press reported that turkey and iran had established joint venture company to develop gas in iran and build pipeline to bring this gas to turkey and europe this jv was established to further the agreements reached in november 2008 and july 2007 mous between turkey and iran reftel in trying to undercover more about this deal we spoke with several people botas chairman saltuk duzyol said botas was not included in the deal and that the agreement was made with private company but declined to specify it one of energy minister gulers advisors musa gunaydin who is widely believed to be behind the ministers push to do business with iran refused to discuss the topic with us xxxxx was more open the turkish company som petrol has entered into joint venture with iran demir said the owner of som petrol is sitki ayan good friend of pm erdogan they both attended istanbul imam hatip religious high school ayan is in the pms circle of friends including mustafa erdogan pms brother cihan kamer see 2 and mucahit aslan xxxxx according to our research xxxxx is active in port construction fuel transshipments and other activities but doesnt appear to have any experience in upstream oil and gas development 2 c in 2007 kartet an electricity generation and exporting company signed deal with tavanir irans state owned electricity company to import from iran 14 billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity to turkey kartet applied to the turkish authorities the electricity markets regulatory board emra to get an electricity import license in november 2007 turkish company called savk electricity owned by pm erdogans friend cihan kamer received license from emra to import electricity from iran at that time kartet went public with the dispute and claimed savk actions were unethical and illegal kartet istanbul managing director nuray atacik told us on february 27 that kartet had still not received any response from emra and had basically given up on the project however she added with bit of glee savk electricity has not been able to realize the deal either the iranians prefer us and dont want to do deal with company that was forced on them atacik said 3 c comment if true the pms push of som petrol to do the gas deal with iran could actually slow progress on the deal it is clear from the savk electricity case that iran doesnt appreciate being assigned business partners there are other reasons why this deal is on the slowtrack including lack of legal regulatory and commercial framework for the deal and irans potential pique at the february 26 announcement that botas won usd 750 million arbitration case against iran although the award must still be accepted by iranian authorities end comment visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalturk ey jeffrey
