divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225mostfavorednation status of the peoples republic of china summary particularly sinceand to some extent despitethe tiananmen square incident of june 4 1989 the us congress has considered two diametrically opposed types of action regarding chinas nondiscriminatory or mostfavorednation mfn normaltraderelations tariff status in trade with the united states one has been its total withdrawal the otherof more recent originits extension on permanent basis after having been suspended in 1951 chinas mfn tariff status with the united states was restored in 1980 conditionally under title iv of the trade act of 1974 including compliance with the jacksonvanik freedomofemigration amendment which must be renewed annually and the existence in force of bilateral trade agreement between the two countries this status would be either terminated or changed into permanent one chinas loss of mfn tariff status would result principally in the imposition of substantially higher us customs duties onand in higher often prohibitive costs ofover 95 of us imports from china 995805 million total in 2000 and likely cutback in such imports as well as possible retaliatory reduction by china of its imports from the united states significant economic disadvantage might result for hong kong and macau which despite their political reunification with china remain separate economic entities with permanent us mfn status sundry legislation introduced in earlier congresses to withdraw or severely restrict chinas mfn status failed to be enacted in two instances for failure to override the presidents veto in the 105th congress legislation was introduced but not passed to grant permanent mfn status to china outright or upon its accession to the world trade organization some of the permanentmfn bills would have placed additional conditions or restrictions on the grant of the mfn status legislation in the 106th congress reflected chinas prospective accession to the wto on one hand it prohibited us support of chinas admission to the wto without congresss legislative approval and moreover in two instances required the united states to withdraw from the wto if china was admitted to it without the us suppo rt on the other hand like in prior years congress failed to pass legislation disapproving the presidents midyear renewals of chinas jacksonvanik waiver and moreover enacted legislation title i pl 106286 approving permanent nondiscriminatory status for china upon its accession to the wto on january 30 1998 the president extended the trade agreement with china for 3 years and on june 1 2001 renewed for one year chinas jacksonvanik waiver and thereby its temporary nondiscriminatory status legislative action to disapprove the

treatment if taken literally is misleading it has been replaced in 1998 by law in existing and future us statutes with that of normal trade relations ntr or another appropriate term which also is to be used in any subsequent enactments the term is still used in this report interchangeably with that of mfn for reasons of historical continuity and because of its continued universal use in international trade relations and agreements eg the wto agreement as well as in existing us bilateral trade compacts including the july 1979 and the november 1999 trade agreements with china 2although legislation to grant permanent ntr treatment to china has been enacted title i continuedmostfavorednation status of the peoples republic of china chinas mostfavorednation status in the context of the controversy surroundi ng the renewal of chinas most favorednation mfn status1 or its permanent grant it should be pointed out that historically the specific mfn issue involved is that of tariffs rather than of the general mfn treatment as envisaged by the general agreement on tariffs and trade or the bilateral commercial compacts to which the united states is party thus the mfn status in controversy and consequently discussed in this report is limited to nondiscriminatory tariff treatment of china that is the application to imports from china of the same concessional customs duty rates agreed to by the united states in reciprocal negotiations with other trading partners the united states has applied such mfn tariff treatment as matter of statutory policy enacted in 1934 generally to all of its trading partners this policy was modified with the enactment of section 5 of the trade agreements extension act of 1951 pl 8250 which required the president to suspend mfn tariff treatment of the soviet union and all countries of the then sinosoviet bloc under this statutory mandate president truman suspended chinas mostfavorednation tariff status as of september 1 1951 after chinas occupation of tibet that countrys mfn status also was suspended as of july 14 1952 whereas earlier the mfn status could under certain conditions be restored to suspended country by presidential action such restoration could take place since october 1962 only by specific law until the trade act of 1974 in title iv provided specific authority and set out the conditions and the procedure for its temporary restoration to nonmarket economy nme countries and its subsequent continuation in effect under title iv the key elements of the procedure for temporary restoration of the mfn status to an nme country2 are 1 conclusion of bilateral tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs2 2continued pl 106286 it cannot enter into force in accordance with its own terms before chinas accession to the world trade organization possibly sometime in 2001 until then chinas ntr status remains subject to annual extensions under the provisions of title iv 3although determination has been published renewing the trade agreement with china for the subsequent 3year period this has not resulted in practice in the termination of the agreementagreement containing reciprocal grant of the mfn status and additional provisions required by law and approved by the enact ment of joint resolution and 2 compliance with the freedom ofemigration requirements jacksonvanik amendment section 402 19 usc 2432 these requirements can be fulfilled either by presidential determination that the country in question places obstacles to free emigration of its citizens or under specified conditions by presidential waiver of such full compliance in accordance with this procedure the president on october 23 1979 transmitted to congress the trade agreement with china signed on july 7 1979 its proclamat ion pres proc 4697 44 fr 61161 and the executive order eo 12167 44 fr 61167 granting to china the jacksonvanik waiver hdoc 96209 the agreement was approved by congress on january 24 1980 hconres 204 96th congress and entered into force on february 1 1980 together with the reciprocal grant of the mfn status which it contains in addition to all other provisions required by section 405b of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435b the continuation in force of chinas or any other nme countrys mfn status is contingent on 1 triennial extensions of the underlying trade agreement and 2 continued compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment the latter in the case of two nme countries including china by means of annual renewals of the waiver authority and existing waivers the agreement concluded for 3year initial term itself provides for automatic 3year extensions but is subject to termination by either party upon notice at least 30 days before the expiration of any 3year term the continuation in force of the agreement is also subject to the requirement in section 405b1b of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435b1b which applies to any trade agreement concluded under title iv with an nme under that provision the agreement is renewed triennially if satisfactory balance of concessions has been maintained during the life of the agreement and the president determines that actual and foreseeable reductions in united states tariff and nontariff barriers resulting from multilateral negotiations which benefit china unilater ally because of its mfn status are satisfactorily reciprocated by china such determination has thus far been published six times most recently as presidential determination 9814 of january 30 1998 63 fr 5857 extending the agreement through january 31 20013 to remain in force the jacksonvanik overall waiver authority as well as the specific china waiver and chinas mostfavorednation tariff status which is contingent on it at present must be renewed annually the renewal procedure entails 1 presidents recommendation which must be made by june 3 of every year thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs3 4for detailed description of the legislative procedure for enacting joint resolution of disapproval see crs report 96490 legislative procedure for disapproving the renewal of chinas mostfavorednation status 5additional information on this subject is contained in crs issue brief ib93107 most favorednation normaltraderelations policy of the united states 6once chinas ntr status is made permanent under the recently enacted legislation see continuedthe existing waiver authority and individual waivers be extended for another 12month period through july 2 of the following year such extension is 2 automatic upon the presidents recommendation unless it is disapproved by the enactment of joint resolution before 1990 adoption of onehouse resolution the language of the disapproval resolution is prescribed by law and specific fasttrack procedure is provided for its consideration in its basic legislative steps the resolution must be reported within 30 calendar days or else the committee considering it may be discharged may be amended only with respect to the country or countries to which it applies and the debate on it is limited in either chamber to 20 hours divided equally between those favoring it and those opposing it the resolution must be approved by august 31 presidential veto of the resolution must be overridden by the august 31 deadline or within 15 days of session after congress has received the veto message whichever is later4 if the resolution is enacted the waiver and the mfn status cease to be effective on the 61st day after its enactment particularly in recent years congressional opposition to the continuation in force of chinas mfn status has increased on various ground s mostly unrelated to the freedomofemigration considerations despite this opposition legislative action to disapprove its annua l extensions has thus far been consistently unsuccessful and chinas waiver and mfn status have remained in force moreover the controversy in congress has recently undergone decided shift of its focus from the issue of whether to continue in force chinas mfn status under the provisions of title iv to the opposite one of granting such status to china unconditionally and permanently in related side issue the opposition to the applicati on of mfn treatment to import s from china among the public at large has been in some part caused by an obvious misunderstanding of the term mostfavorednation treatment itself taking it in its literal meaning congress primarily prompted by this misunderstanding with respect to china consequently enacte d legislation section 5003 of the internal revenue restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 replacing the misleading term in all seven instances of the then existing and in any future statutes with the term normal trade relations ntr or another appropriate term5 withdrawing or restricting chinas mfn status as long as china remains subject to the title iv regime see footnote 2 mfn status could be withdrawn from china either permanently or temporarily in one of several ways 1 by direct legislation enacted through regular legislative process6 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs4 6continued footnote 2 this would be the only way to restrict suspend or revoke it such adverse action however would have to be taken having regard of the us mfn obligation toward china under the wto since by then china would have already become wto member or else permanent ntr status could not have been extended to china by the united states 7in view of the fact that presidential determination extending the agreement past january 31 2001 has been published see footnote 3 but chinas ntr status in practice remains in force it appears that such omission bears practical consequenceby using the specific means provided in the trade act of 1974 for denying mfn tariff status to nme country that had it restored under that law ie by the specific fasttrack enactment of joint resolution disapproving the midyear annual renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver authority with respect to china if such renewal is recommended by the president 3 by the presidents failure to recommend such renewal with respect to china in the first place for noncompliance with the jacksonvanik requirements or 4 by direct action by the president suspending or withdrawing chinas mfn status china also could lose its mfn status if the agreement is terminated upon notice at the end of term or presumably if the 3year extension of the uschina trade agreement in force does not take place because the president declines or omits to make the required determination7 in past years congress has repeatedly and consistently attempted to terminate or restrict chinas mfn status by means of resolutions disapproving the annual extension of chinas waiver or by specific legislation or subject its continuation in force to additional statutory conditions primarily in the area of human rights none of these measures has become law although two of them one in either session of the 102nd congress setting additional conditions for the annual extensions of mfn status came close to being enacted passed by both houses they were vetoed by the president and the veto was upheld by the senate special situation arose in mid1993 when the president extended chinas waiver for another year but at the same time in executive order 12850 also set specific additional conditions for the mid1994 extension of chinas waiver and mfn tariff status these conditions closely reflected those set in the several versions of the united stateschina act of 1993 103rd congress and in addition to compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment mandated compliance with the 1992 uschina prison labor agreement and significant progress with respect to chinas adherence to the univers declaration of human rights release of and accounting for chinese citizens imprisoned or detained for the nonviolent expression of political and religious beliefs ensuring humane treatment of priso ners by allowing access to prisons by international humanitarian and human rights organizations protecting tibets religious and cultural heritage and permitting international radio and tv broadcasts into china the eo also charged us officials to pursue resolutely actions to ensure that china keeps its commitments to follow fair nondiscriminatory trade practices in dealing with us businesses and adheres to the nuclear nonpro liferation treaty the missile technology control regime guidelines and other nonproliferation commitments although china denounced the action taken by the president the principal sponsors in both houses of the legislation to subject the 1994 extension of chinashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs5 mfn status to additional conditions representative pelosi and senator mitchell expressed their satisfaction with the presidents action as representing sufficient step and stated that further congressional action on their respective bills would be unnecessary the linking of chinas mfn status to overall human rights however was abandoned in mid1994 when president clinton renewed the china waiver taking into account only its statutory condition namely compli ance with the freedomofemigration requirement of the jacksonvanik amendment subsequent legislative measures to disapprove the renewal or subject it again to broader human rights conditions failed in both sessions of the 104th congress the joint resolutions disappro ving the presidential extensions of chinas mfn status through the renewals of the jacksonvanik waiver failed of passage likewise action was taken on several other bills such as one nullifying chinas waiver and subjecting its restoration to enactment by regular procedure or another conditioning the continuation of chinas waiver on taiwans speedy admission to the world trade organization wto or one assessing additional tariffs on imports from china until the president determines that china is fully implementing the agreement on the protection of american intellectual property rights in china in the 105th congress joint resolutions disapproving the midyear renewals of the waiver authority were introduced in both sessions but failed to be enacted allowing the extension of the waiver and chinas mfn status to remain in force through july 2 1999 specific legislation was introduced to withdraw altogether chinas mfn status such action however was proposed with respect to goods produced or expo rted by the peoples liberation army or chinese military company but not further considered chinas mfn status also would have been impaired by bill which required quarterly adjustments of us tariffs on imports from china based on the amount by which chinas tariffs on exports from the united states exceed us tariffs on imports from china chinas mfn status with the united states also could have been adversely affected by legislation introduced but not passed requiring prior congressional approval of us support of chinas admission to the wto and the withdrawal of the united states from the wto if china were to be admitted without us support in january 1998 the president also published the determination renewing the 1979 trade agreement with china for three years through january 31 2001 see p 2 in the 106th congress congressional action regarding chinas mfn status other than two failed annual attempts to disapprove the presidents renewal of chinas freedomof emigration waiveras in the preceding congress reflected to some extent the current action for chinas admission to the wto four measureswhich would have had only indirect adverse effect on chinas ntr status were introduced but not passed to prohibit us support of chinas admission unless approved by legislation three of the four measures also required the united states to withdraw from the wto if china were to be admitted without the us support lack of us support however would have had practical consequences since it could not prevent chinas admission united states withdrawal from the wto on the other hand would have had not only serioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs6 8since the enactment of permanent nondiscriminatory treatment for china and consequent nonapplication of title iv to china have not yet been implemented this and some subsequent section of the report are presented not only for their historical interest but also because of their continued applicabilityconsequences for uschina trade relations but even more serious consequences for the united states leading role in overall international trade relations chinas admission to the wto would have played more direct role the us mfn policy toward china through the snapback provision of the proposed china market access and export opportunities act of 1999 under the provision current us duty rates on imports from china would be increased to the preuruguay round levels if china were not according adequate trade benefits to the united states or taking adequate steps toward becoming wto member lower duty rates would be restored if the relevant contingency were reversed reasons for and effects of withdrawing chinas mfn status8 in the context of the jacksonvanik amendment and title iv procedure the sole statutory criterio n for continuing in force or withdrawing chinas mfn status at present is chinas compliance with the freedomofemigration requirementsa criterion that in present circumstances longer represents practical obstacle to mfn treatment of china by the united states the advocates of denying mfn status to china however have gone beyond the narrow scope of the freedomofemigration issue and have based their opposition to continued mfn status on chinas violation of human rights in general its unfair trade practices and obstacles to market access lack of legal and regulatory transparency the large and growing us trade deficit with china chinas uncooperative attitude in weapons and nuclear nonproliferation and more recently the alleged illegal chinese donations to the democratic national committee or nuclear espionage supporters of mfn treatment of china among them the administration have taken the position that the resolution of these issues ought to be pursued through consultations and negotiations in other fora or by other appropriate means particularly the structural trade and economic issues involved they suggest would best be resolved in the still ongoing negotiations for chinas accession to the world trade organization in the view of the supporters of chinas continued mfn status its withdrawal would be counterproductive since it would increase friction and be less conducive to resolution of any problems through dialogue it would they assert particularly in the human rights area possibly exacerbate the situation in addition to the adverse economic consequences it would engender economic consequences would be considerable withdrawal of chinas mfn status would result in the first instance in significant duty increases on about 95 of us imports from china totaling 995805 million in 2000 the cost effect of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs7 increases would vary among the various product groups but would on the whole be substantial table 1 illustrates how the withdrawal of the mfn tariff status would change the duty rates assessable in 2001 on 15 major

chinas mfn status would result in substantial increases in the cost of imports from china the average trade weighte d mfn duty rate on all 2000 imports from china dutiable as well as nondutiable was 38 on dutiable alone 71 without mfn treatment and assuming change in the volume of imports this rate would have been at about the 45 level an even larger gap between the mfn and fullduty treatment would occur in the top categories of us imports from china primarily because substantial share of them are duty free under mfn treatment but would be subject to high duty rates without it on the basis of our recent survey of imports under the individual tariff items each of whose imports in 2000 exceeded 100 million 212 items in all and which together accounted for 667 billion 670 of all us imports from china in that year the termination of chinas mfn status would increase the importers overall cost of those products by over onethird mostly in the range between 25 and 65httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs8 compar ed to similar data for earlier years these figures indicate larger concentration of chinas exports to the united states in dutyfree products or those dutiable at low rates up to 10 ad valorem imports free of duty under the ntr tariff treatment accounted for 87 out of 212 included tariff items at total value of 363 billion 365 of total us imports from china and imports dutied at rates of up to 10 mostly 5 ad valorem accounted for 104 tariff items totaling 259 billion 260 of total imports see table 2 the data also suggest significantly increasing absolute intensification of chinas exports to the united states in the product lines subject to zero or lowrate duty rates as consequence of the changes brought about by the termination of chinas ntr status the trade pattern of articles now imported from china would be likely to change substantially much of their sourcing would be likely to shift to suppliers in other countries or to domestic suppliers this restructuring also could and often would result in higher costs to the importers and consumers of the articles involved this in part because those lowpriced imports from china that would still take place would generally be subject to higher in many instances much higher nonntr duties and in part because the cost of imports from alternative sources at ntr duty rates would most likely be higher than present imports of comparable goods from china due to their higher product prices although some of the increases in importers costs would likely be in part absorbed in the subsequent chain of distribution relative cost increases at the retail level would still be high particularly on lowmargin moderately priced consumer goods certain clothing footwear household electrical and electronic products toys etc china is now substantial supplier of such goods and some of them may at least temporarily even become priced out of the us market because of the type of the articles involved the resulting increased costs and reduced availability would affect disproportionately lowerincome us consumers on the chinese side such changes would obviously have an adverse effect by reducing significantly the us demand for such imports from china the size of this reduction and the impact of its adverse effect on chinas economy would depend on number of factors but in the opinion of several china trade experts would be substantial it would be it is claimed particularly damaging to the economy of chinas southern provinces fujian and guangdong which are most dependent on exports and where much of chinas exports originate indirectly it would also adversely affect hong kong and the economic benefits it derives from being the port of trans it for close to 60 of chinas exports to the united states and whose businesses also have substantial manufacturing interests in the neighboring southern china hence hong kongs general opposition to the withdrawal of chinas mfn status hong kongs reversion to chinas sovereignty as special administrative region has not changed its international status as separate trade and customs entity nor the role it has played in the past in chinas foreign trade and other economic relations withdrawal of chinas mfn status would also have adverse consequences for other major investors in south china taiwan japan and the

world trade organization legal issues and crs memorandum questions regarding accession of the peoples republic of china to the world trade organization by jeanne j grimmett dated march 23 2000 released with client consent and available from the american law division crsin addition to having serious adverse practical consequences disapproval of the extension of temporary mfnntr treatme nt of china under the provisions of title iv would go counter to the obvious intent of the congress to permanently normalize trade relations with china expressed in the substantial vote in favor of pl 106286 see p 14 international contractual implications denial of chinas mfn status would have to be implemented also with having regard of two relevant provisions of the 1979 uschina trade agreement still in force addressing specifically the discontinuance of the agreement or of any of its provisions in its automatic 3year extension provision article x2 the agreement allows for its termination if either party to it notifies the other of its intent to termin ate this agreement at least thirty 30 days before the end of term the agreement also provides in article x3 that if either contracting party does not have domestic legal authority to carry out its obligations under this agreement either contracting party may suspend application of this agreement or with the agreement of the other contracting party any part of this agreement this provision appears to be applicable with respect to mfn treatment in the event that the waiver authority is withdrawn under the jacksonvanik amendment or the treatment itself is terminated by specific newly enacted statute more generally applicable provision article ix which asserts the right of either contracting party to take any action for the protection of its security interests also might conceivably if circumstances warranted be used to suspend the mfn treatment an additional element to be considered in the context of us mfn policy toward china is chinas almost completed if somewhat delayedprocedure for membership in the world trade organization 9 and the obligation of wto members which include the united states to accord to each other unconditional mfn treatment in its allencompassing meaning ie not only with regard to tariffs this obligatio n is contained in article i of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994 gatt 1994 one of the many compacts resulting from the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations that constitute the agreement establishing the world trade organization chinas accession to the wto the procedure for which was initiated in 1986 is goal that china as well as many other wto members including the united states are earnestly pursuing chinas 6yearold negotiations of bilateral trade agreement with the united states the provisions of which make part of chinas protocol of accession to the wto intensified in the several months prior to the early april 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs11 10such action was taken by the united states at the time when in similar circumstances hungary romania mongolia kyrgyzstan and georgia were in recent years joining the gatt or wto the invocation of article xiii with respect to the all five countries was rescinded upon their being extended permanent mfn status by the united states the invocation of article xiii by the united states with respect to china would result in reciprocal nonapplication of the wto agreements including the substantial benefits of the uschina 1999 bilateral agreementa point in favor stressed in the congressional debate on approving chinas permanent mfn status the lack of chinas permanent us mfn status however would not prevent in the context of wto rules the united states from voting in favor of chinas admission to the wto nor on the other hand would lack of us support by itself prevent chinas admission to the wto visit to the united states by chinas premier zhu rongji and resulted in partial agreement on market access for agricultural and industrial products and various services the negotiations to resolve several other differences between the two countries which the united states considered of essence for chinas participation in the wto however were temporarily suspended by china in the wake of the accidental bombing by nato aircraft of chinas embassy in belgrade the bilateral negotiations were resumed and were successfully concluded with the signing of voluminou s and comprehensive bilateral agreement on november 15 1999 there are however still some unresolved issues of interest to the united states being negotiated multilaterally with the wto chinas accession has also become an issue of direct interes t to congress through the introduction in the 105th and 106th congresses of several measures requiring statutory approval of the us support of such accession see p 5 when china accedes to the wto the continuati on of the present us policy which conditions chinas mfn treatment by the united states on compliance with the requirements of title iv or more drastically an imposition of additional restrictions on or withdrawal of mfn status from china would constitute violation of the us obligations under the gatt 1994 article i calling for general most favoredn ation treatment of all gatt signatorieswto members in such case china wouldafter its accessionhave cause to submit the issue for resolution to the wto dispute settlement body one way for the united states to avoid such violation would be by taking recourse to wto article xiii this article provides for nonapplication of all wto multilateral agreements between any current and newly acceding member if before the accession agreement of the new member is approved by the wto general council either country does not consent to such application10 if the united states and china then wished to apply reciprocally any other provisions of the wto package of agreements except permanent mfn treatment they could technically do so by amending the existing bilateral agreement or renegotiating it by including provisions for such application such course of action however does not appear likely in practice under present circumstances particularly in view of the fact that comprehensive agreement the benefits of which weigh heavily to the benefit of the united states has already been reached between the united states and china as part of chinas accession to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30225crs12 11as long as the 1979 trade agreement with china remains in force however the united states can benefit from limited number of those types of concessions that have been granted by china to other countries in bilateral agreements or included in the accession protocol as part

states were able to apply to china the wto agreement in its entirety essentially by extending to it unconditional and permanent mfn status quid pro quo on which china would undoubtedly insist11 granting to china permanent mfn status12 due to chinas progress in its quest for accession to the wto the focus of congressional china mfn debate has in recent years shifted from the issue of annual renewals of chinas status under jacksonvanik waiver to one of granting china permanent unconditional mfnntr status the shift has been brought about by the likelihood that china will soon become wto member and such membership will require both countries to apply to each other permanent mostfavorednation treatment more crucially denial of permanent ntr treatment on the part of the united states by continuing the practice of renewing it annually would make impos sible the reciprocal application of the wto agreement as well as of the comprehensive uschina bilateral agreement which was signed on november 15 1999 as part of the process of chinas accession to the wto see preceding section although attempts to grant permanent mfnntr status to chinawhether unconditionally or tied to chinas
