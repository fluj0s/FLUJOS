globalizationan overview summary in the 1990s globalization gained widespread usage as term with many interpretations globalism is employed in this report to describe networks of interdependence functioning at multicontinental distances globalization is an increase in globalism and deglobalization reduction in providing an introductory view of these networks with an emphasis on contemporary economic factors goal of this report is to illustrate how policy consequences sometimes unintended may be dispersed via globalized networks as networks expand and become more intricate there is an opportunity for feedback along previously nonexistent linkages the rapid economic globalization we are witnessing influences is influenced by and oftentimes becomes inseparable from multicontinental networks that take many forms including political cultural technologic financial national security and environmental several factors play role in todays rapid formation of networks they include globa lizationfriendly technological advancements governmental polices and management techniques if government does not institute policies that inhibitprevent globalization multicontinental networks will form within the limits of available technology and management and there is compounding effect as enhanced competition encourages further advancements hence globalization feeds upon itself todays webbased technology is tailormade for globalization it builds on an impressive round of politicoeconomic globalization that began early in the 19th century and lasted until the beginning of world war i to spark this globalization governments adopted polices encouraging international activi ty and enterprising individuals took advantage of emerging transportation and communication technologies to build sophisticated global networks of trade comm unications and investment to large extent these networks were dismantled between 1914 and the end of world war ii governmental policies were respo nsible for this deglobalizati on in addition to the effects of war nations pursued protectionist policies in an attempt to avoid cyclical downturns punctuated by the great depression as this period indicates governments can shield their citizens from globalization pressures in the shortrun but the economic costs can be significant globalization allows economies to specialize in producing items for which they have an advantage and in trading for items others produce resulting gains are lost when an economy shields itself from foreign competition north korea stands as an example of an economy sheltered for political reasons while globalization gains can be substantial for the general population some may suffer potentially severe economic losses included are owners and workers in industries pressured by more efficient foreign firms and governments coping with new realities in globalized environment some individuals also become distressed as their cultural environment changes while many see globalization as an irreversible process those adversely impacted by globalization put pressure on their governments to slow or stop it resulting policies may protect some of the victims of globalization but they may also curb the potential for longterm economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955contents introduction 1 definitions 1 history 3 why globalization and why now 7 incentives

globalization and security continuedthe issue of globalizationan overview introduction globalization is process inherent to life from the creation of lifes self sustaining envelope aeons ago to the transmigration of primitive humans that ultimately encompassed the entire planet it is characterized by continual flux and adjustment beginning in the 1990s human globalization entered an accelerative phase in which the process gained widespread usage as an international term with many interpretations perhaps because of its wide usage there is universally accepted definition of the term this report will provide an overview of globalizationincluding sampling of definitions although emphasis will be placed on economic globalization and its impacts attention will be paid to linking the relevance of the term to policymaking as whole in particular the special role government plays in allowing or prohibiting globalizations spread within country will be discussed the possibility of unintended consequences also is considered in the introduction definitions are provided followed by brief history subsequent sections discuss the factors driving todays globalization its accomplishments and its opposition definitions the executive summary of the final report of the defense science board task force on globalization and security sums up globalization as follows globalizationthe integration of the political economic and cultural activities of geographically andor nationally separated peoplesis not discernible event or challenge is not new but is accelerating more importantly globalization is largely irresistible thus globalization is not policy option but fact to which policymakers must adapt globalization has accelerated as result of many positive factors the most notable of which include the collapse of communism and the end of the cold war the spread of capitalism and free trade more rapid and global capital flows and more liberal financial markets the liberalization of communications internati onal academic and scientific collaboration and faster and more efficient forms of transportation at the core of accelerated global integrationat once its principal cause and consequenceis the information revolu tion which is knocking down oncefo rmidable barriers of physical distance blurring national boundaries and creating crossborder communities of all

httpwwwworldbankorghtmlextdrpbglobaliztionpaper1htm scholarly definition of globalizat ion in its current usage has been offered by harvard professors robert keohane and joseph nye they make distinction between globalism globalization and deglobalization globalism is state of the world involving networks of interdependence at multicontinental distances these networks can be linked through flows and influences of capital and goods information and ideas people and force as well as environmentally and biolo gically relevant substances such as acid rain or pathoge ns globalization and deglobalization represent an increase and decrease in globalism respectively2 globalization results in deeper andor geographically more complete globalism deeper globalism means more points of connection and the resulting fuller integration most common usages of globalization probably encompass keohane and nyes globalism and globalization although providing less scholarly definiti on thomas friedman new york times foreign correspondent in his best selling book the lexus and the olive tree understanding globalization also defines globalization in broad terms he states globalization is not phenomenon it is not just some passing trend today it is the overarching international system shaping the domestic politics and foreign relations of virtuall every country and we need to understand it as such3 to friedman globalization is driven by free market capitalis m it is the system that replaced the cold war friedmans globalization has six dimensionspolitics culture technology finance and trade national security and ecology and via globalization the boundaries between these dimensions are disappearing putting friedmans definition in the context of the keohanenye definition deeper globalism means that it becomes more difficult to deal with one of friedmans six dimensi ons in isolation this is because through globalization the boundaries are blurred allowing feedback relationships which prevent isolation that is web of connections forms to link activiti at multiple levels this could manifest itself in an increasing number of unintended consequences from policies designed to address single problem if globalization is given more narrow definition then typically it can be viewed as subset of the keohanenye definition applied to limited dimension such as economic globalization or globalizations impact on labor and the environment4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs3 5doran charles f globalization and statecraft saisphere 2000 p 6 6see orourke kevin h and jeffrey g williamson when did globalization begin national bureau of economic research working paper 7632 april 2000sometimes two dimensions such as the interaction of information technology and the global economy are included oftentimes globalization is used in positive context with emphasis on the opport unities expanded networks offer for information sharing and access to resources products jobs and technology in other uses as keohane and nye noted it can connote the spread of human and environmental plagues as it were such as the aids pandemic and acid rain if globalization is used in highly negative politico economic sense the users definition might fall into the globalizationishegemony school of thought in these cases globalization is viewed as societal plague5 typical hegemonic view is the americanization of the world terms such as mcglobalization illustrate this view history all definitions whether broad targeted optimistic or pointing to societal plague include phenomena that are increasing in importance within several regions of the world andor encompassing growing part of the globe but the question arises what historical events qualify as globalization opinions vary widely of course much depends on the type of globalism that is being discussed for example environmental influences are inherently multicontinental human influences may change their character through deforestation or greenhouse gas emissions but the scope has always been intercontinental from an economic pointofview some historians point to the voyages of christopher colombus in 1492 and vasco da gama in 1498 which opened the spice trade to competition as globalizations big bang but good arguments can be made that economic globalization began even earlier eg the earlier spice trade or the greek and roman empires empirical evidence has not produced consensus on globalizations impact for any of these early events but historians universally agree and the data support that in modern times there was significant economic globalization beginning in the 19th century and lasting until 1914 the beginning of world war i6 by 1900 the basic tools of creating modern multicon tinental networks were already in place these included the railroad steamship telegraph and refrigeration during the preworld war i period goods investment capital and people were able to move between countries for the most part unimpeded by governmental interference that is governmentimposed trade barriers on goods were relatively low although they gradually increased during the period investment funds were allowed to move from one country to another and passports for travel within europe were not required in 1919 john maynard keynes the noted british economist described pre1914 globalization in manner relev ant to the globalization we are experiencing today he wrotehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs4 7 reported in future perfect the challenge and hidden promise of globalization by john mickelthwait and adrian wooldridge crown publishers new york 2000 p 7 from the economic consequences of peace by john maynard keynes 8it is beyond the scope of this overview to compare in detail the 19th century and 20th century periods of globalization but michael d bordo barry eichengreen and douglas irwin in is globalization today really different than globalization hundred years ago national bureau of economic research working paper 7195 june 1999 concluded that our world is different commercial and financial integration before world war i was more limited globalization today raises new issues of governance not just because it is conjoined with politi cal system which gives louder voice to special interests but because the economic phenomenon itself is different integration is deeper and broader than hundred years ago pp 34 for financial integration they found for 19th century globalization that longterm capital flowswere large in volume butjust as in the case of tradelimited to narrow sectors of the economy while shortterm flows remained very much lower relative to the size of the world economy p 4 nonetheless few deny that globalization was impressive during the 19th century 9during the gold standard period 18701914 the values of national currencies were pegged to gold the result was stable currency values for example the number of british pounds dollar could purchase remained stable varying only by the cost of shipping gold unfortunately this system does not allow for the pressure put on currencies as national economies grow at different rates 10the chinese exclusion act of 1882 suspended immigration of chinese laborers to the united states for ten years this was followed by the 1892 act to prohibit the coming of chinese continuedwhat an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in august 1914 the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth in such quantity as he might see fit and reasona bly expect their early delivery upon his doorstep he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world and share without exertio n or even trouble in their prospective fruits and advantages or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend most important of all he regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement and any deviation from it as aberrant scandalous and avoidable the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion which were to play the serpent to this paradise were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper and appeared to exercise almost influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice7 keynes description eloquent ly captures two of the three aspects of pre1914 globalismfree flow of goods and investment capital8 trade barriers while present and growing were relatively small furthermore international flows of investment capital were smoothed by the gold standard9 beyond keynes quote people could for the most part also move relatively freely during this globalization period for exampl during much of this period the united states allowed access to all

states washington us department of commerce 12micklethwait and wooldridge p 12from 1914 to 1944 the world could best be described as in period of rapid economic deglobalization the period began and ended with world war interspersed with worldwide wave of antitrade protectionism with the us smoothawley tariff bill of 1930 which raised tariffs by an average 53 as prominent example the protectionism was aimed at sheltering nations from wide cyclical economic swings while the great depression represented the most severe example britain experienced an earlier depression between 1920 and 1922 many economists including keynes believed that national governments could better control the impacts of unemployment with more constrained interaction with the outside world keynes famous prescription to dig out of the great depression was to increase government spending this is the prescription the roosevelt administration followed but without restricting the openness of the economy the full impact would have been diluted as private investment funds would have fled to avoid competition with public funds and immigrants would have flooded in to avoid even worse conditions elsewhere hence the united states and other governments in similar situations began to take steps that restricted interaction between their nations and others for example in response to tighter policies us immigration fell from 104 immigrants per 1000 residents in the 1901 to 1910 period to 04 per 1000 between 1931 and 194011 the united state was not the only country turning inward between 1929 and 1938 for example the ratio of foreign trade to domestic production declined by 10 percent in britain by nearly 20 percent in canada and by 25 to 40 percent in japan germany and italy in the six years between 1927 and 1933 international lending dropped by over 90 percent12 unfortunately closing nation to the rest of the world to avoid cyclical downturns comes at price the competitive zeal that accompanies globalization is blunted in the shortrun the cyclical downturn may be avoided but over the longer term the innovation which globalization fosters and the resulting growth potential is also avoided until recent years when it began to open its economy indias poverty stood as an example of the costs of autarkic policies present on longterm basis rather than being restricted to periods of crisis as world war ii drew to close 730 delegates representing more than 40 countries met at bretton woods new hampshire to map out strategy for international economic interaction following the war major purpose of the bretton woods meeting was to recapture some of the preworld war i globalization keynes as britains head of delegation played pivotal role in this meeting in fact it was held at bretton woods an isolated resort area partly in deference to keynes declining health it was felt the mild climate would suit his medical needs as result of this conference the world bank and the international monetary fund imf subsequently emerged the world banks first mission was to help rebuild war torn economies later the focus shifted to less developed countries the imf embodiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs6 13reported in janet ceglowskis has globalization created borderless world business review federal reserve bank of philadelphia marchapril 1998the financial architecture upon which worldwide economic reintegration began imf purposes include promoting international monetary cooperation exchange stability and orderly exchange arrangements the intention was to follow the imf and world bank with an international trade organization ito with broad powers to regulate trade the first step in the process of creating the ito was the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which resulted in 45000 tariff conce ssions affecting about 10 billion in trade the gatt also included some provisional rules that were to be part of the ito gatts purposes included providing forum for members to discuss trade issues and fostering rulesbased trading system in the end the ito was not adopted and the gatt stood as provisional agreement for almost 50 years until the world trade organization wto was formed in 1995 the imf and gatt in particular set the stage for the tremendous burst of economic globalization we have witnessed since 1990 similar to 19th century globalization the agreements creating the imf and gatt were based on open trade but unlike the 19th century international portfolio investment flows were restricted and while not part of these agreements immigration was also restricted restrictions on investment flows only began to fall in the 1970s and much of the pressure behind this fall came from private firms and individuals finding ways around foreign investment restrictions nonetheless movement of people remains comparatively regulated for example in the united states although many feel we are currently experiencing an accelerated rate of immigration the annual rate was 36 immigrants per 1000 residents between 1991 to 1998 compared to the 104 per 1000 cited earlier for the 1901 to 1910 period also during the period from 1944 to the 1970s many national governments intervened heavily in the economic activity of their respective nations oftentimes basic industries such as coal and steel were nationalized these actions were based on the thought that government could correct for market failure as the result of poor performance by nationalized industries the 1980s saw reevaluation of this thinking as result the reagan and thatcher administrations led the way in promoting market liberalization actions during their administrations accelerated the economic globalizat ion that began with bretton woods and resulted in our current level of globalism while this places the current spirit of globalism in context it is also worth noting that globalization still has long way to go for example if economic globalization were complete then national borders would not influence trade investment wage patterns and immigration anymore than the borders between two states within the united states but as the significant wage difference between mexico and the us reveals international borders do matter one way to measure border effects on trade is to ask figuratively how wide is the border the width of border can be found by converting the cost of taking goods across the border ie tariffs and nontariff barriers into the equivalent miles of transpor tation those costs would allow one report found that the uscanadian border one of the least restrictive to be 1780 miles wide13 another report found that if globalization were complete us tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs7 14frankel jeffery globalization of the economy in governance in globalizing world joseph s nye and john d donahue eds pp 4571 15this paragraph views costs in two different settings the first involves expanding the use of networks within the existing technology base here costs increase with use the second involves technological advancements in networking capability here costs of all levels of continuedrelative to gross domestic product would have to be six fold larger14 and for investment flows if borders did not matter then crossborder investment flows would rival within country flows but they do not even approach this level nonetheless proponents and opponents of globalization are likely to agree that the rate of globalization we witnessed as the 20th century drew to close was striking why we currently are seeing such rapid globalization is the question next addressed why globalization and why now the two most often cited driving forces of globalization are technological advancements that are conducive to increased international activity and reduction of government induced barriers to international activity third factor pointed to by some is the advancement and growing uniformity of management techniques each of these will be discussed in turn but first an overarching economic stimulant will be presentedthe incentive to globalize it has always been present but has taken time to become reality incentives to globalize if one accepts that resource holders attempt to use their resources in the wisest manner they can discover then economic factors have always pushed for economic globalization arguably the single most powerful concept in economics is comparative advantage simply it states that resource holders use their resources wisely by concentrating efforts on what they can produce best and trading for other desired items as specialization spreads the result is increased output ie through using resources in less wasteful manner in short there are benefits from specialization and trade and networks facilitate this specialization and the resulting trade networks that come into play include trade ie marketing channels communication and management they allow the producers of one product to find the producers of another product so that they can trade with each other networks however have costs and as networks become more sophisticated or more dispersed one would expect the costs to rise these costs eat into the gains from specialization hence trading networks develop so long as they do not consume all the specialization gains over the years technological advancements have reduced the costs of trading networks innovations have included sail boats trains steamships airplanes and refrigeration as the costs of trading networks have fallen the networks have become more sophis ticated deeper and more geographically dispersed somewhere in the process the networks became multicontinental and began to fit into the keohanenye definition15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs8 15continued networking shift downward allowing more networking for each dollar spent 16william ward madhusud an bhattarai and pei huang in the new

domestic railway freight port charges domestic waterborne freight and containerized general cargo anecdotal information only smallzero declines include nonair modes for moving people ocean bulk freight and continuedcomparable arguments can be made for the expansion of political financial and military networks why these networks have now accelerated is the question next addressed why todays acceleration as stated above depending on the analy st two or three factors are given in answ er to why now first advancements in network friendly technologies have reduced the cost of deepening and expanding these networks these advancements for the most part are computer centered and they span numerous areas for example banking has benefitted greatly from computerization going back several decades production and inventory management and control have similarly benefitted of course telecommunication technologies are the most notable example of advancement naturally the computer technologies that have driven advancements in banking production and inventorying also rely on telecommunications after the information is processed it has to be moved to the appropriate places so the technological advancements complement each other moores law named after gordon moore cofounder of intel states that the information processing capacity of microprocessors doubles every eighteen months and at the same time the cost falls at similar speed moores law as general rule of thumb reflects what we have witnessed the culmination of advancing communication abilities thus far is the internet which has been made possible by digital technology costs are so low in this area that distance has become irrelevant internet access fees are charged by the unit time eg hour or month regardless of how many distant sites are visited with the use of digital technology transmitting song picture voice or written word is done the same way using essentially the same equipment this is the first time the lines dividing communication modes have been so completely removed the end result is that the cost to send verbal pictorial or written documents next door or across the world is the samenear zero the cost of live voice calls has also fallen although not as rapidly unless you are willing to make call via the internet which is still somewhat cumbersome while substantially lagging telecommunication cost declines the costs of moving people and goods via certain modes have also fallen16 some of the advancementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs9 16continued domestic intercity motor carriers 17this result is also fostered by section 24 of the gatt which permits regional trade agreements but requires they reduce or eliminate trade barriers on substantially all traded items between members while not violating gattnegotiated trade liberalization agreements for nonmembersdriving these declines are computer related while others such as containerized shipping are more traditional nonetheless the end result has been the substantial technologicallydriven opportunity to deepe n and extend networks and these networks encompass at least five of friedman s six dimensionspolitics culture technology finance and national security and they have influenced sometimes in controversial ways the sixthecology perhaps the most important factor in answering the question why now is government government actions switch on and switch off the agencies of globalization thus the formation of the general agreement on tariff and trade gatt and the international monetary fund imf signaled desire by national governments to open their economies to greater global activity the reductions in trade barriers that resulted from gatt negotiations accomplished results similar to the technological advancement s discussed above that is to say they reduced the friction of economic networking on global scale the source of the first friction was technical and the source of the friction gatt addressed was administrativepolitical the international financial system symbolized by the imf reduced another friction of dealing internationallyaccomplishing payment for traded goods the subsequent removal of curbs to foreign investment added another frictionreduc ing dimension much of the governmental involvement that facilitated these activities was accomplished through supranational institutions such as the gatt and imf nonet heless national governments particularly the united states played critical role while the gatt and its successor the world trade organization wto work on multilateral level regional trade agreements link countries in different way features of gattwto include taking decisions by consensus and expecting trade barrier reductions by one country to be met by reciprocal reductions by its trading partners as result reducing trade barriers has been an incremental process in the eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations tariffs on manufactured goods have fallen from an average of 40 in 1947 to under 4 today however as more and more countries become wto members currently 140 the difficulty in taking decisions by consensus grows regional trade agreements by limiting membership to countries with similar trading goals have accomplished greater liberalization among their members17 the european union and the north american free trade agreement stand as two of the prime examples of regional trade agreements they do not precisely fit the keohanenye definition of globalism or globalization because they are not multicontinental they would probably qualify for friedman s less locationbound definition subsequent action by the eu however does qualify under the keohanenye definition eu members have reached out to nonmember countries in europe africa and the americas to form trade alliances httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs10 18final report of the defense science board task force on globalization and security office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology december 1999creating strong and uniform management networks across the globe is the third factor often cited when consider ing why we are seeing rapid globalization now technological advancements and governments allowing their economies to be more open paved the way for development of geogr aphically dispersed enterprises but these operations could not come into their own without management practices that enabled decision makers to maintain control in addition to the withinfirm improvement in management practices consulting firms have spread these practices around the globe now more and more firms are organized and operated using the same management and accounting practices again the spread of management practices is supported by technological advancements the above three factors provide an overarching framework for the accelerated globalization during the 1990s that continues today recall that the defense science board task force report cited in the definitions section provided list of factors driving globalization that differ from the factor s presented here the factors the board cited were the collapse of communism and the end of the cold war the spread of capitalism and free trade more rapid and global capital flows and more liberal financial markets the liberalization of communications international academic and scientific collaboration and faster and more efficient forms of transportation18 while more detailed each of these can be placed under one or more of the three overarching factors presented here for example the collapse of communism and the end of the cold war fits under the governmentgovernance factor the next section offers sampling of the accomplishments of recent globalization it will first concentrate on the bright side of globalization and then the darker side of globalization will be addressed what globalization accomplishes globalization shares the spotlight with the information age an equally popular phrase many predict that the 21st century will be driven by information information and our increasingly networked world go handinhand and many consider them to be in large measure overlapping today one can sit alone in front of computer and access informati on from worldwide sources and on host of different topics the major challenges in that regard are sorting out useful information from noise sorting out accurate information from inaccurate information protecting individuals from overly intrusive information gathering and effectively processing the useful accurate information available the breadth of information is major benefit of our globalizing environment but perhaps just as important is its accessibility much of it is available to anyone with internet access choice one of the most fundamental accomplishments of globalization is an expanding range of economic choice as result of the expanded trade ties

quote at the beginning of this report is true now more than ever and what is true for consumers is also true for producers with globalized trading networks producers have larger pool of potential customers and as users of inputs they have wider selection of suppliers additionally globalized trading networks allow for the rapid dispersion of technology firms are not only able to acquire inputs from diversity of sources they are also able to acquire stateoftheart production methods additionally multinational firms spread their technology throughout the network they manage investment capital

flows in part help fund the technology flows described above for example multinational companies through foreign direct investment spread technology worldwide and portfolio investments allow local firms to acquire technology from around the world of course as witnessed by the asian financial crisis the enhanced investment capital flows that globalization facilitates also introduce the

more often once they are triggered damage control is difficult once the web of confidence which supports the financial system is breached it is difficult to restore quickly the loss of confidence can trigger rapid and disruptive changes in the patterns of finance which in turn feeds back on exchange rates and asset prices moreover investor concerns that weaknesses revealed in one economy may be present in others that are similarly situated means that the loss of confidence can quickly spread to other countries22 the last part of greenspans quote raises another concern of financial globalizationherd mentality the demise of confidence in one market quickly spreads to other market s and government leaders feel there is little they can do to stop it transparent and fundamentally sound financial systems in place well before the crisis begins may be the strongest defense against this type of attack quality and prices more intertwined trade and financial markets have two additional impacts favorable to consumers first not only is there more expansive choice of products there is also likelihood that product quality will increase the increased number of producers international trade introduces heightens competition in the marketplace firms are under pressure to innovate or risk falling by the wayside the concept of creative destruction has been employed by one prominent economist to describe the situation23 consumers can expect that old products will be swept away and replaced with new and improved versions through process of continual improvement this environment is good for consumers and innovating firms but not so good for the firms that produced the displaced product second the increased level of competition puts downward pressure on prices firms survive by creating new products and finding better less expensive ways to produce them that is firms as resource holders are encouraged by globalization pressures to redouble their efforts to use their resources wisely again the consumer is the beneficiary the result is that globalization networks spread technology and encourage creation of new technology governmentgovernance the accomplishments of globalization discussed thus far are commercial but the list extends much further for example the spread of commerce also spreads new ideas not just technology globalization allows residents around the world to see how the other half lives stories are now common of someone visiting remote part of the world only to find satellite dish serving small village this introduces

treatment for themselves relief this relief ranges from protection from foreign competitors to reducing the regulatory and tax burden government places upon them the former slows or stops commercial globalization and may even foster deglobalization while the latter encourages governments to remove administrative burdens thereby stimulating globalization however slowing or stopping globalization has the unintended consequence of slowing the overall growth of the economy countries that close their borders to globalizing forces are cut off from the benefits of international specialization north korea stands as an example on the other hand embracing globalization reduces governments ability to collect taxes with enhanced mobility firms can avoid what can be the significant costs of taxation24 there is not only pressure for governments to be domesticfirm friendly but foreign firms multinationals through the threat of taking their foreign direct investment elsewhere or withdrawing previous investments pressure governments in fashion similar to domestic firms for multinationals contemplating entering new country this pressure especially applies to economic and financia l matters eg property rights laws governing bankruptcy securities transactions banking trade and other commercial activities but policies that impact personal security and qualityoflife for their employees eg human rights crime immigration safety environmental quality and voting are also of concern to multinational firms25 multinationals have to factor in the governmental environment when choosing locations much of what multinationals want from government is consistent with the institutions of free market democracy hence favorable response by governments will likely foster such institutions26

international management firms are playing role in the formation of egovernment27 they are offering their services worldwide to incorporate egovernment techniques natural consequence is tendency toward uniformity in the approach governments take toward adapting their operations to the information era this drive to uniformity is being further enhanced by governments directly they are carefully monitoring each others activities for example march 2000 uk interim report on modernizing government describes their efforts to evaluate other programs through bench marking the report states the government will be able to learn continuously and take account of what works elsewhere when designing and implementing new ways to serve the public28 while the above puts pressure on governments to

reflect distinctive local needs in addition to facilitate international activity national governments have found it necessary to create supranational institutions such as the imf wto and world bank globalization encourages these institutions to become stronger sometimes at the expense of national governments for example the gatt as provisional institution was not generally viewed as threat to national sovereignty but without effective dispute resolution mechanisms it was also viewed as weak and oftentimes ineffective supplanting gatt with the world trade organization put in place dispute

opponents of economic globalization opposition to economic globalization emanates from many sources this section will provide few of the more common ernst ulrich von weizsäcker member of the german

major source of opposition to globalization many throughout the world view globalization particularly in its economic form as synonymous with americanization to them globalization represents replacing traditional cultures with materialistic american centered culture for example many frenchmen feel mcdonalds is replacing french cuisine josé bové the french farmer who destroyed frenc h mcdonalds under construction has become prominent antiglobalization figur in france that mcdonalds restaurants in france are locally owned and use predominately locally produced items does not matter in this context these frenchmen feel americans are attempting to create an american hegemony by forcing american culture on them via movies books and superstores34 the theme running through many similar arguments from many different parts of the world against economic globalization is that it is an assault on cultural diversity foes argue that it is important to maintain cultural diversity and cultural identity they argue that fastpaced globalization destroys individual cultures and replaces them with monolithic culture based on consumption ie based on the american model those who welcome globalization suggest that it allows the rapid spread of the best culture has to offer they contend that modern communication technologies have the power to preserve cultural diversity eg via the

denominator of the cultural influences migrants brought with them employment wages poverty and working conditions several laborrelated issues are identified as troubling consequences of globalization they include jobs lost due to trade reduced incomes increased wage disparity increased poverty in developing countries and locking many developing country workers into slavelike working conditions the united states has maintained strong labor market overall while playing leading role in globalization on the other hand wage growth adjust ed for inflation in the united states was negative from 1973 to 1992 and barely managed positive growth rate from 1992 to 1996 additionally between 1973 and 1996 the ratio of top earners wages to bottom earners ie the top quintile divided by the bottom widened from 7 to 1135 opponents blame the latter on globalization they point to the rapid growth in trade between the united states and developing countries as the driving force the charge is that this growing trade with lowwage countries has hurt us unskilled workers resulting in these adverse wage trends economic theory does not dispute this assertion in short globalization may cause race to the bottom however empirical analysis suggests that the trade component of globalization is small factor in observed adverse wage trends congressional research service review of the literature identified additional factors influencing this growing wage disparity they are productivity changes rates of investment in capital and labor education technology immigration demographic trends and the effective bargaining power of unions the consensus estimate of international trades impact on the united statess increasing wage inequality ranges from only 10 to 20 this relatively modest impact is partly explained by the labor requirements of the goods involved goods from lowwage countries compete with goods made by only 2 of the us work force36 while trades impact on wage disparity is modest opponents can point to the list of influencing factors compiled in the congressional research service report and claim that the items themselves are products of globalization hence in this sense globalization not just trade is responsible for the growing wage disparities some globalization critics claim that the income gains developed countries have made are at the expense of subset of

globalizat ion encourage multinationals to seek out countries that are willing to tolerate abysmal working conditions for their citizens in this sense globalization is said to foster slavery child labor and subhuman working conditions not only in poor countries but also in rich countries the remedy called for is core labor standards that address the human rights of workers in developing countries an mit economist counters this conclusion with an argument that follows along the line of bad jobs at bad wages are better than jobs at all he writes after all global poverty is not something recently invented for the benefit of multinational corporations wherever the new export industries have grown there has been measurable improvement in the lives of ordinary people39 those that favor adoption of core labor standards argue that globalization facilitates spreading poor labor standards in one country to other countries for example labor leader jay mazur wrote pitting american workers against their counterparts abroad who are forced to live at the very margins of human existence gradually made itself apparent in lowered wages and standards at home the dismal

moving the facility and the children to the united states and producing the footwear with the same sweatshop process nothing has changed except that the production is now against us law41 the environment and health and safety many environmental interactions such as weather patterns are inherently global that is they fit the keohanenye definition of globalism however environmental interactions likely do not fit their definition of globalization in that they are not becoming increasingly global they were global before humans arrived on the scene at the same time the rapid globalization of human civilization we are witnessing eg economic growth and international trade may have significant environ mental impacts for example the socalled ozone hole was product of human civilization some opponents of rapid globalization contend that human actions such as the burning of fossil fuels may result in global warming and they further contend that the consequences of these changes may be significant42 they conclude that this potential warrants taking steps to slow rapid economic globalization line of reasoning similar to the one used on behalf of labor is sometimes also used for the natural environment many globalization opponents see rapid globalization as causing race to the bottom as multinational firms are encouraged by cost considerations to locate in countries with lax environmental laws andor lax enforcement of existing laws43 an institute for international economics study reports that there is theoretical support for this position as it applies to environmental aspects but evidence remains mixed and scarce44 much of the debate over globalizations impact on the environment and health and safety has focused on international organizations and

httpwwwfoeorginternationalwto 47see friends of the earth the world trade organization and the environment citizen action guide httpwwwfoeorginternationalwto 48 op cit arlene wilsonfor example many claim that the world trade organization by its very nature puts trade ahead of the environment they point to cases such as the us attempt to protect sea turtles article 609 of pl 101162 banned import of shrimp harvested in manner harmful to endangered species of sea turtles it also allowed waiving the ban if countries could establish that their fishing methods are not harmful to sea turtles complaint lodged within the wto by india malaysia pakistan and thailand claimed the us ban to be discriminatory the wto upheld the complaint however the wto did find that the uss general environmental motive was valid45 wto actions in situations such as the sea turtle case have served to coalesce groups suspicions of current globalization trends while not motivated only by environmental concerns the demonstrations at wtos seattle meeting and the subsequent imf and world bank meetings in washington dc and prague highlight in an extreme fashion the concern some public groups have with possible adverse impacts of rapid globalization the following two quotes from friends of the earth captures this line of criticism in the five years since its creation the world trade organization wto has been used to undermine environmental regulations the wto has challenged and weakened laws like the clean air act and endangered species act whats worse it has done so behind closed doors and with input from environmentalists or the public friends of the earth is working to prevent the wto from overruling hardwon environmental laws and to make it more open and democratic46 imagine how youd feel if your organization managed to convince your city council state legislature or congress to enact decent law then foreign government or corporation challenged the law as illegal under international trade rules the next thing you know special trade court closed to the public could decide that the law should be eliminated or weakened it can happen it has happened its called the world trade organization47 concerns over rapid uncontrolled globalization also extend to health and safety issues opponents fear that globalization left unchecked may cause substantial health and safety problems as result they contend that concerns over health and safety matters should trump the rapid economic globalization we are currently experiencing on the other hand trade proponents counter that health and safety concerns are oftentimes employed as pretext for protectionism the us position has been that health and safety issues need to be examined under the light of sound science48 while wto member nations agree that these should be the bases of evaluation interpretation of results vary widely the different perspectives are illustrated by the dispute over hormonetreated beef the european union

result of sound science broadly defined wto dispute settlement panel agreed the eu was subsequently ordered to allow importation of hormonetreated beef while the united states and the wto looked at the results of risk assessments and concluded the eu ban was not warranted under wto rules the eu looked at the risk assessments and concluded the opposite the eus consumer policy commissioner stated the scientific evidence is of enormous importance to european consumers as it demonstrates that the commission of the eu was right to strenuously defend the ban on hormones we now have scientific basis to defend our position49 it should be pointed out that while the wto ordered the eu to allow importation of hormonetreated beef the eu refused in such situations if the parties cannot reach an agreement on compensation for not lifting the ban the only recourse available is retaliatory trade barriers on imports in an amount determined via wto procedure from the country found in violation both the united states and canada have imposed retaliatory tariffs the role of nongovernmental organizations world trade organization leaders were surprised by the intensity and impact of the 1999 antiwto demonstrations in seattle nongovernmental organizations ngos played an important role in ensuring the success of the demonstrations subsequent demonstrations against the imf and world bank have convinced leaders of these supranational organizations of the need to seek enhanced interaction with nongovernmental organizations ngos as way to understand counter andor address criticism as result ngos have been able to influence the agendas of these international institutions to greater extent than ever before for example one outcome of world bankngo interaction has been growing number of bank sponsored projects that involve participa tion of ngos or other civil society components70 percent in 1999 this is up from 50 percent five years earlier50 although created in the 1980s the ngoworld bank committee is now playing much greater role in bank activities than before as an additional level of cooperation the wto and world bank have web pages tailored to ngo participation prospects for backtracking like all of the aspects of globalization already discussed there is consensus on the possibility of stopp ing or reversing globalization one reason for this is the diversity

whilst many of these fears and anxieties are understandable we must recognize that key aspects of globalization are essentially irreversible particularly those associated with information ideas and communicati ons this irreversibility together with the magnitude of the potential benefits surely tell us that the central questions concern how to manage and gain from the process and not how to reject it51 major reason many feel globalization is irreversible is the depth of its networks with production and financial networks so intertwined the cost of stepping back could be immense this is the case because disentangling the networks that have formed would necessitate restructuring many of the industrial linkages that have formed over the last few decades the unintended consequences of breaking linkages are likely to be significant nonetheless many are concerned that normally occurring economic downturn will result in calls for protectionism thereby putting pressure on the trade and investment aspects of global ization52 in speech before the 1999 dallas ambassadors forum alan greenspan stated yet the protectionist propensity to thwart the process of the competitive flow of capital from failing technologies to the more productive is unwise and surely selfdefeating history tells us that not only is it unwise to try to hold back innovations it is also not possible over the longer run generation after generation has experienced episodes in which the technologically obsolescent endeavored to undermine progress often appealing to the very real shortterm costs of adjusting to changing economic environment from the luddites to the smoots and the hawleys competitive forces were under attack in the end they did not prevail and longterm advances in standards of living resumed nonetheless the campaign to expand free trade is never won it is continuing battle while tariffs in industrial countries have come down sharply over the past half centu ry other barriers have become more prevalent administrative protection in the form of antidumping suits and countervailing duties is case in point while these forms of protection have often been imposed under the label of promoting fair trade oftentimes they are just simple guises for inhibiting competition53 mr greenspan fears that such efforts at backtracking will spark an economic downturn in part this would be the case because increased protectionism would necessitate undoing some of the networks that would longer make sense in light of the higher cost of doing business that the protection would imposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs24 54dumping is defined as selling exported products at below fair market value this translates into selling below the cost of production or below the price charged in the originating market antidumping measures are duties that may be placed on dumped items found to be threatening us industry or preventing us industry from developing countervailing duties

serious damage to the internet would target servers and routers ie the backbone of the systemdomestic firms pressuring governments for protection from foreign competition tend to become particularly persistent as growth either stalls or falls it is likely that nontariff instruments such as antidumping measures and countervailing duties would be the protection vehicle of choice54 as the first period of globalization came to an end early in the 20th century tariffs were used but with governments having made commitments to reduce tariffs via the gatt they are likely to choose less transparent means of protection in the future55 while government action is the most likely way globalization can be slowed stopped or reversed there are other extreme scenarios that can be envisioned for example one of the unintended consequences of globalization is the spread of disease with so much international interaction spread of disease is inevitable the mad cow bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse and foot and mouth sweeping europe are examples the economic impact of these two diseases has been tremendous of course the loss of human life with newvariant creutzfeldtjakob disease the human equivalent of bse intensifies that concern other human diseases that have been transmitted via our interlinked travel networks include the west nile virus and there has been continual concern over transmission of truly frightening diseas such as ebola additionally it may be merely matter of time before truly vicious computer virus is unleashed around the world such virus could grind much of the interlinked network to halt witness the impact of relatively benign viruses such as the i love you bug of course computer viruses raise the national security specter of using globalized networks as terrorist weapons56 and the threat extends beyond computer networks globalization also increases the threat of the use of nuclear biological and chemic agents by rogue nations or global terrorist organizations whose anti globalism activities are often facilitated by the worldwide internethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30955crs25 conclusion the accelerating and increasingly complex and intertwined development of global networks facilitate specialization by individuals as well as nations in those things for which they are best suited while allowing them to trade for other items as the networks become more intertwined and far flung they eventually break the multi continental barrier and enter the realm of globalism several factors facilitate todays globalization they include rapid technological advancement favorable governmental policies and sophisticated management techniques government facilitation plays key role in this process without economic globalization todays world would be substantially different it has offered unprecedented choice of consumer goods producer inputs financing sources and technology it has also helped to make the capital available to be able to take advantage of these choices and the competitive pressures have increased the quality and reduced the price of the choices available at the same time globalization altered available consumption choices it has also pressured governments to change pressures have been created for governments to adopt internat ionally uniform procedures to become more transparent and more democratic there is also the incentive for governments to improve their services finally national governments are encouraged to push responsibilities down to subna tional levels and up to supranational levels globalization is also controversial one group sees the above accomplishments and declares them good while another group looks at the same list and declares them bad some members of the latter group see globalization as threat to their cultures while others see it as threat to employment and wages with the potential to drive people into poverty and force them to work in inhuman working conditions still others see globalization as threat to the environment and our health and safety at the same time members of the former group see globalization as the best available solution to all of these problems while there is little chance of completely backtracking globalization opponents seek to ameliorate its impacts for example nongovernmental organizations have been vocal in opposing numero us facets of globalization businesses seeking protection from international competition also to the extent they are successful slow globalization there is also the possibility of globalization being affected by globalizationrelated crises such as multicontinental transmission of disease there are two important lessons for policy makers first government policies play key role in starting allowing to continue or stopping globalization second globalization as well as efforts to combat its effects can produce unintended consequences hence in the interconnected world that globalization fosters it is becoming increasingly important to incorporate the big picture into efforts to fix its components
