through the crs web highway finance rabas doubleedged sword john w fischer specialist in transportation resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 the debate over possible reduction in federal highway program spending during fy2003 has ended congress has chosen to overrule provisions of law that would have reduced the fy2003 spending level to 232 billion and has instead settled on 318 billion the same as the fy2002 level in early 2002 it appeared that major reduction in highway program spending was in the offing an office of management and budget calculation in the presidents budget indicated that the raba adjustment for fy2003 would be negative the administration and congress were not proposing cutback rather complex financing mechanism known as revenue aligned budget authority raba was proving the famous law of unintended consequences predictions made at the time raba was created by the transportation equity act for the 21st century as amended tea21pl 105178 pl 105206 saw it as an ever growing source of funding for the highway program even though raba was created with the possibility of downward adjustment raba provided the highway program with almost 9 billion in additional financing during the years fy2000 through fy2002 congressional action in the 2nd session of the 107th congress precluded this downward adjustment at least in part and the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 pl 1087 guaranteed that funding would remain at the fy2002 level this report will not be updated little understood feature of tea21 became significant policy issue in the 2nd session of the 107th congress the federal highway administration fhwa state departments of transportation and localities throughout the united states had become used to the idea that the federalaid highway program obligation level would increase every year as result of additional funds provided by raba the possibility that raba could result in negative adjustment to the funding level of the highway program had been largely forgotten over the previous 5 years in fact the raba adjustment for fy2003 if it had been applied in accordance with tea21 provisions would have required reduction in the federal highway programs guaranteed obligation limitation by 4369 billion and yearoveryear adjustment from fy2002 of negative 86 billion congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the negative raba adjustment would have resulted in 27 decline in new highway contracts obligations in fy2003 when compared with fy2002 according to estimates by the highway construction industry this would have translated into serious reduction in construction nationwide with concomitant loss of some 295000 jobs1 while not all estimates saw the situation in such negative terms there was doubt that an 86 billion change in highway spending would have had far reaching consequences for the industry this was problem that wasnt supposed to occur the concept behind raba expected growth and saw socalled negative raba as only small possibility downward adjustment of the obligation limitation and authorizations could also occur but this is improbable given the conservative receipt estimates used to set the guaranteed spending levels set in tea212 faced with the unexpected congress and the administration had to decide whether to let the raba adjustment stand or whether to modify the raba result in some way congress has now considered the issue and decided to overrule the raba adjustment and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 retain spending at the fy2002 level raba origins the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 changed the budget framework for the federal highway and transit programs it did this in two ways first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statutory limitations on obligations the act amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highways and mass transit the act further amended the budget process by creating statutory level for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy20033 finally tea21 provided mechanism raba to adjust the amounts available in the highway account to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in trust fund dedicated tax revenues the transit account was not included in the raba process the net effect of the creation of these budget categories is predetermined level of funding for core highway programs which is referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee or the guaranteed level these categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls are viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of funding for highway and transit programs additional funds above the firewall level can be made available through the annual appropriations process 1 httpwwwtransportationorgaashfd9e86256b4500776347fopendocument 2 us department of transportation transportation equity act for the 21st century summary1999 p 3 3 limitation on obligations is restriction on the amount of federal assistance that may be promised obligated during specific time period fiscal year crs3 the raba process provides link between the trust fund dedicated tax revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending this relationship has long been sought by advocates of increased highway spending who have contended that highway user fees should be available only for highway programs the raba calculation the act requires that the office of management and budget omb make an annual evaluation of revenues in the highway account during the year prior to the current fiscal year visavis predicted levels of revenue cited in tea21 this is known as the look back adjustment the secretary must then predict revenues visavis spending authorized within the highway firewall for the new fiscal year this is the lookaheadadjustment if revenues go up program spending is increased conversely spending can go down if revenues go down this mechanism was employed beginning in fy2000 if funding adjustment is required an apportionment change is applied to the core highway programs in each state in addition apportionments are made to other allocated federal aid highway and highway safety programs finally funds are reserved on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 proportional basis for programs allocated by the federal highway administration fhwa such as the federal lands highway program at the time tea21 was enacted both the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb predicted that revenues to the highway account would grow at level that exceeded the highway authorization provided within the highway firewall the omb estimated somewhat more growth than that projected by cbo by one analysis looking at best case scenario best case from the perspective of an analysis that favors additional spending the revenue alignment provisions of the bill could have provided as much as 35 billion in additional contract authority for core highway programs during the life of the legislation we now know that these estimates were dramatically wrong raba increases far exceeded these modest expectations during the period fy2000 fy2002 also unexpected however was the strong downward turn in revenues driving the current debate table1 raba and tea21 guaranteed funding

httpwwwfhwadotgovtea21 and pl 1087 for fy2003 guaranteed level crs4 raba fy2003 what caused the negative raba adjustment in nutshell the revenue stream for the highway trust fund responded to the direction of the domestic economy for much of the four decade plus history of the trust fund americans almost always drove more each year than the previous year and used more fuel in the process with the exceptions of the fuel shocks of the 1970s this pattern has continued albeit at slower level even during recessionary periods the boom years of the late 1990s were especially lucrative for the trust fund as the economy started to slow down in 2000 and 2001 this equates to the fy2001 look back period used in the fy2003 calculation trust fund revenues also began to decline this appears to have been especially true for the trucking industry where new vehicle sales dropped off dramatically at the same time gasohol use was increasing primarily because of its use as substitute for the controversial additive mtbe gasohol is taxed at lower rate than other highway fuels so even though automobile use seems to have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 been fairly constant revenue to the trust fund decreased with concomitant reduction in the lookback factor described in the previous section with the nation in recession early in 2002 the budget scorekeepers at omb and treasury were required to reduce their previous estimates about how well the economy would do in fy2003 as result the lookahead element of the raba calculation also came up negative added together these factors resulted in the negative 4369 billion raba adjustment included in the presidents fy2003 budget proposal potential effects of negative raba adjustment the federalaid highway program is slow spending program this reflects the nature of capital infrastructure projects which often are multiyear undertakings the federalaid program is also slow spending because it is reimbursable program that is states receive federal payments until they actually accomplish some agreed upon type of work funds therefore scheduled for obligation in fy2003 might not actually be scored as outlays for several years the administrations fy2003 budget suggested that they viewed the slow spending nature of the program as protection against any serious economic consequences from reduction in highway obligations in 2003 actual spending on highway construction including the continuation of prioryear projects will fall less than three percent from its alltime high in 20024 the highway construction industry and the states did not share the administrations view that oneyear drop in highway obligations would have limited effect they took the position that the proposed yearoveryear reduction would have dramatic effect and 4 us government budget of the united states fy2003 analytical perspectives february 2002 p 241 crs5 that there was guarantee that the program would contract for only one year5 further these groups were specifically concerned that decline in new highway spending would have had deleterious effect on recovery from the then ongoing recession congressional actions there were several options for dealing with the raba situation available to congress the first of these and the one tacitly supported by the bush administration initially was to maintain the status quo from this perspective the downward raba adjustment is what congress agreed to allow when it passed tea21 in 1998 raba in this view had provided significantly more benefit than expected over time and down year should be expected from timetotime the budget assumptions contained in the presidents fy2003 budget submission were predicated on the downward raba adjustment additional spending for highways could have the effect of raising the overall deficit figure in the presidents budget notwithstanding the separate budget category for the highway trust fund and significant unobligated balance in the trust fund httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 an option pursued by some legislators in the 2nd session of the 107th congress was legislation that restored fy2003 funding to the guaranteed level contained in tea21 hr 3694 and s 1917 the highway funding restoration act were simultaneously introduced on february 7 2002 these bills were identical the bills directed that the limitation on obligations for fy2003 be raised to the guaranteed level in other words they raised spending by 4369 billion by drawing from the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund the bills were introduced by the leadership of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure and the senate committee on environment and public works respectively majority of both the house and senate signed on as cosponsors of this legislation an amended version of hr 3694 was reported out of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure on may 1st s 1917 as reported to the senate on june 17th allowed for an additional 13 billion in spending over the 277 billion level from the perspective of some governors and highway interest groups these bills represented good start but didnt make the program whole they continue to seek larger increase in spending perhaps to the 86 billion level that would provide the same level of highway spending as fy2002 congress has now agreed with this argument also at issue for such an increase was the willingness of congress to potentially raise the overall unified budget deficit this issue was particularly important for the appropriations committees who must weigh number of other transportation funding needs and work them into the annual appropriations process also important in this regard was the issue of the intent of rabas authors as mentioned earlier the expectation of raba was that it would provide additional money to the highway program it is not clear that the authors ever considered that peak raba levels should become standard for highway program funding rather it appears that the authors expected that the highway program should benefit in bonus years but also feel some pain in down years 5 rothman heather and ferguson brett governors ask congress president to spend down highway trust fund daily report for executives february 26 2002 p a23 crs6 as result of provision included in the second fy2002 emergency supplemental appropriations bill pl 107206august 2 2002 the downward raba adjustment proposed for fy2003 was blocked the net effect of this provision was to set the program at its authorized 277 billion level later in the session the senate committee on appropriations reported s 2808 which would have increased spending to the fy2002 level ultimately congress has decided to retain funding at the fy2002 level passing the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 pl 1087 early in the 108th congress trust fund balance and reauthorization issues all of the fixes to the raba adjustment were predicated on spending at least some portion of the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund those supporting an increase in the fy2003 limitation on obligations all pointed to the 18 billion plus unexpended beginning of year balance estimate for the trust fund as the likely source of additional highway funds6 while this was the logical place to look for highway funds not all of this balance is actually available at any given time significant portion of the fund is reserved to meet future obligations device created early in the history of the trust fund known as the byrd rule for senator harry byrd virginia requires that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21164 trust fund meet an ongoing fiduciary test any failure to meet this test requires an immediate reduction in highway spending tea21 must be reauthorized prior to fy2004 for the program to continue many observers are suggesting that the raba debate will alert congress and the highway industry to the fact that longstanding trust fund revenue sources need to be reviewed this is especially true in terms of gasohol gasohol use is expected to increase but with lower tax levels on gasohol this actually means that trust fund revenues for the same amount of fuel use could decrease also at issue is the ongoing push for the automobile industry to find alternative fuel sources that are not taxed when tea21 was signed in late 1998 the highway trust fund had growing unexpended balance that was expected to exceed 24 billion by the end of fy1999 one of the principal rationales behind the higher spending levels in tea21 and the creation of the raba spending mechanism was to prevent continued growth in this balance going into 2003 it now appears that the unexpended balance in the trust fund will be trending downward in size should this trend continue it could create dynamic in which it could be difficult to find support for significant growth in the program during the reauthorization debate without new funding sources 6 the unexpended balance is sometimes and inappropriately referred to as the surplus
