outdated list of persons who authorise badge issuance the ineffective process for checks on ext ernal contractors and the release to an external recycling company of expired badges intact without destroying them first the 5year limit to retain information on badge holders leads to systematic destruction of essential paper files even for longterm unog staff members access control the

shift team the high ratio of 28 per cent of security officers performing office and adm inistrative functions and workload statistics developed for the various activities of the section to support the allocation of resources need to be reconsidered unog will look into the implementation of the reco mmendation in 2006 in view of the headquarters minimum operating secur ity standards hmoss comprehensive training programme has been developed however the new objective of 10 training days per staff and year could result in chronic deficit of staff during the training as the original basis for additional staffing resource s required under hmoss was only five days performance appraisals for the period 20032004 tained standard comments and in some cases did not fully reflect actual functions of th staff the pas should be used as an effective tool for performance management and to provide guid ance for career development unog indicated that this would be implemented by the end of the current pas period firearms management and safekeeping task force is currently reviewing the firearms po licy however considering its critical importance unog sss should without delay clearly

with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the security and safety section is part of unog its chief reporting to the director of administration and at the same time to the direc tor division of safety and security services of the newly created department of safety and security at new york headquarters the section is composed of the operations in the pa lais des nations building comprising the palais operations unit and the specialised interven tions unit the administration and support unit and the special services and annexes subunits as of july 2005 total staff was 146 of which 36 were posted in annex buildings servicing other extra budgetary entities total budget for the section in 20042005 amounted to 25 million for the regular budget and 41 million for extrabudgetary activities 3 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 12 september 200 5 with the officerincharge

officerincharge division of administrat ion on 8 november 2005 whose comments have been reflected in the report in itali cs unog has accepted most recommendations and is in the process of implementi ng them ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluat the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with relevant united nations regulations rules and instructions iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit focused on the main organizational com ponents of unog sss namely its environment and the security management system in geneva its missions structure processes and resources the review focused on the current organization and processes taking into account all changes to be implemented as part of the headquarters minimum operating security standards hmoss compliance process 6 the audit activities included review and asse ssment of existing operating procedures and the compliance thereof interviews w ith staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevan t records 2 iv audit findings and recommendations security management system security coordination mechanisms 7 strengthening the security management system req uires coordinated response to emergency situations at duty station however official mechanism exists for the many united nations funds and programmes in geneva let alone specialized agencies and their respective security structures to allow for unif ied security management structure in switzerland 8 the united nations security accountability frame work relies on designated official at each duty station who is fully responsible for the safety and security of united nations personnel given the number of organizations and ag encies the executive direction of which is in geneva the role and responsibilities of the designated official as the senior united nations official at duty station needs to be cla rified as applied to geneva and switzerland unog commented that although the director general had been recently confirmed designated official for switzerland by the underse cretarygeneral department of safety and security there was still need to communicate the significance of this function and the associated responsibilities to other united nations system entities 9 efforts have recently been made to formally create coordination mechanism under the leadership of the designated official for switz erland with several meetings held with representatives of geneva based entities early november 2005 the directorgeneral unog in his capacity as designated official for sec urity matters for switzerland consulted with heads of specialized agencies funds and progr ams in geneva and by memorandum dated 22 november 2005 established the senior mana gement team an ad hoc working group will assist the smt with all matters included in the smts terms of reference at the working level the do also established the executiv secretariat of the smt and of its working group and defined the terms of reference f the executive secretary b the unog senior emergency management group sem g 10 using the model of the crisis management operat ional plan developed at new york headquarters in 2002 unog developed its own plan i n 2003 articulated around semg which identifies potential security threats or eme rgency situations analyzes current crisis situations and identifies possible response scenari advises the directorgeneral on matters related to prevention and response to emergency sit uations upon the occurrence of crisis will decide on the appropriate security phase to be retained in order to protect the staff and the property while the semg was established in june 2 003 and its members appointed the group was never activated oios supports unogs rec ent initiative to update the list of members of the semg and to plan for workshop on c risis management to take place in the fall 2005 to bring all members together and start building awareness on their functions and eventual responsibilities 3 b missions and functions mission statement 11 the stsgb20004 on the organization of the ited nations office at geneva summarizes unog sss mission as ensuring the safet and security of persons and property at the palais des nations including providing spec ial security services for conferences and other events and for united nations officials as required this statement does not fully reflect unog sss responsibilities namely the servi ces provided in the annexes and other united nations secretariat entities recommendation head2right the unog division of administration should initiate revision of the january 2000 stsgb on the organization of unog to properly reflect that unog sss provides security rvices to variety of united nations entities within and outsi the palais des nations rec 01 12 unog confirmed that revised version of the releva nt stsgb had already been initiated in july 2004 and that it would be further revised by march 2006 so as update the services sss provides as well as its change of sta oios will close the recommendation upon issuance of the revised stsgb b operational priorities and allocation of resour ces 13 despite its mission statement and unog sss mana gement confirmation that palais operations were always priority insufficient pri oritisation and conflicting activities were recurrent topics among the security officers who we re interviewed oios also observed that the section seemed to be stretched too thin to cond uct its missions in full to replace staff on leave on external missions or on training the sec tion resorts to temporary staff who are often assigned to the palais operations since anne xes or special missions require specific expertise oios calculated that for the month of j uly 2005 the share of temporary resources to total staff in the palais operations reached l evel as high as 64 per cent oios believes that unog sss should determine the level of temporary re sources acceptable to adequately perform its functions in the palais des nations 14 oios also noted that unog sss lacked the resour ces and means to enforce applicable regulations and rules to achieve its ssions regarding the following control access and surveillance in the premises are impaired as the policy to wear badges visible at all times is not fully enforced i n the palais des nations security coordination with staff is limited due to high absenteeism of wardens in unog sss periodic training sessions on security and fir safety the policy of control for the removal of assets t out in stsgb193rev1 provides for followup of equipment removed from the premi ses which is not complied with and unog sss does not have the resources to conduct the necessary checks 15 unog stated that on the one side sss services at ge neva include security services at client annexes which aim to provide quality mana gement to be able to service unog and its annexes without any priority among them on th other side sss services at geneva have 4 priority over external conferences policy on the matter is being prepared as for badge control it was indicated that sss is reviewing its access control policy based on new system that is being developed in coordination with dss and measures to enforcement of badge wearing are being examined the project shoul d be finalized by late 2006 the issue of the firewardens will be revisited in the context f the full review of fire and safety in unog to be carried out in mid 2006 while equipment and property tracking is within the purview of the mail pouch and inventory section unog sss indi cated it would work with the latter in order to determine the most suitable strategy 16 oios found that general objectives were not fur ther developed into concrete performance indicators for sss the indicators as d isclosed in the proposed programme budget could be improved to effectively measure the sections performance recommendation head2right unog sss should formally set operational priorities assign adequate resources and develop performance indicato rs for its activities including other stakeholders prerequisi actions to enforce existing instructions and policies rec 02 17 unog noted the recommendation and stated that the stablishment of realistic indicators would be discussed at the unsssnet meeti ng in december 2006 c services rendered to united nations entities 18 from the memoranda of understanding signed with the client organizations unog sss provides security and safety services within the premises from this general statement it is not clear what the responsibility of unog sss is in the event crisis occurs since clear link is made between the level of curity to be achieved and the resources provided by the clients 19 recently unog sss undertook hmoss compliance reviews and issued recommendations to the clients on the improvements to security however unog sss is not part of the ensuing decisionmaking process which is entirely left with the client for example at unhcr and itc the decision to increase the security resources was concomitant with unogs still it took unhcr eight months from the approval of new posts to submit to unog sss an official request to provide the additio nal guards the process is protracted where the decision to authorize additional resource s has not yet been taken or action needs to be coordinated with the swiss authorities fipoi recommendation head2right unog sss should liaise with unog frms and clients t clarify the nature and extent of its responsibilities visà vis clients in case of emergency or crisis situations with due consider ation to the adequacy of resources provided rec 03 20 unog agreed that clear plan of activities should be established 5 d services to united nations staff 21 with the exception of 45minute presentation of unog sss at the twiceyearly orientation programme for newly recruited staff of the secretariat in geneva induction training specific to geneva is in place to raise st aff awareness for security issues the security intranet site only provides instructions on evacuat ion and could usefully include information and guidance to staff on other security and safety issues unog sss indicated that project to develop such an intranet page exists and was sub mitted to the directorgeneral but that for the moment neither they nor the unog information and communication technology section could make the resources available unog indicated that the internet project would be taken into consideration by may 2006 22 security officers at door six collect payments from and issue receipts to staff members for posting small announcements on the bull etin board at times receipts issued were not properly numbered and dated periodically one designated security officer deposits the accumulated amount of cash collected into the b ank account of the staff council the unog staff council treasurer compares the deposit s lips with pertinent entries in the bank statement for some days in july and august 2005 n receipt was issued to staff members due to lack of blank receipts instead log of da ily total amount received is maintained in the door six security logbook these duties are not inc luded in the job descriptions of security officers and do not relate to their primary mission recommendation head2right unog should assign to another unog office the funct ions of handling and depositing cash and posting of announc ements which are not within the mandate of the unog sss in the meantime unog sss should ensure that proper receipts are iss ued and periodically verified to deposit slips and bank sta tements rec 04 23 unog accepted the recommendation and will review th issue with the staff coordination council in january 2006 c structure and organization reporting lines 24 the general assembly resolution 59276 creatin g the department of safety and security resulted in new reporting lines for unog sss memo from the undersecretary general for safety and security dated 31 may 2005 provided that the chief of security reports regularly to and gets policy direction and operational guidance from the director division of safety and security services in the partment of safety and security however reporting line also exists to the directorgenera l in fulfilling the overall responsibility for security in geneva in august 2005 the directorg eneral delegated his responsibility to the director of administration and for the interim per iod to the officerincharge of the division of administration through the chief of ce ntral support services reverting to the initial structure until further instruction is rece ived from dss 6 recommendation head2right unog should in consultation with dss clarify the reporting lines of unog sss including practical guidelines as to w hat security related issues should be reported to whom and diss eminate them to all staff members concerned rec 05 25 unog commented that the reporting lines had already been clarified in memorandum from the usgdss dated 31 may 2005 vi deoconference on 5 july 2005 and memorandum from the directorgeneral unog dated 15 august oios still believes that these should be further developed and detailed to b fully operational 26 it is also planned that administrative manageme nt of approved budget resources and staffing tables for security and safety services at all duty stations should be centralized at headquarters however the conditions of this trans fer of administrative responsibilities for the sss as well as those for the delegation to adm inister approved budget and staffing tables in unog remain to be defined as of now sss is cking the skills to fully carry out administrative responsibilities and the process to approve the reclassification of security posts into administrative ones has not yet been initiated unog commented that the establishment of the administrative unit within sss which would tentatively consist of four gs posts under the supervision of the deputy chief sss was under way b internal organization 27 the planning function within sss has been decen tralized resulting in duplication of efforts and scattered information related to leave training schedules etc also questions have come up as to the objectivity of the assignment of staff to the various stations with the sharp increase of the size of the section oios believes that central planning function should be reinstated with adequate information sharing among units and specific software for planning and resource allocation in the latest organigramme submitted by unog sss to dss an operational planning unit is created and although it falls under the uniform security operations group unog sss confirmed that it would be central planning function unog stated that the creation of the coordination and pl anning unit was planned for january february 2006 and that staff scheduling software had already been purchased in new york 28 throughout the audit many of the problems rais ed and complaints formulated officially or unofficially were related to inadequa or insufficient information and communication it was also reported on several inst ances that the monthly section meetings were not satisfactory minutes exist and none took place in the recent period the creation of an internal and external information fu nction as provided for in hmoss would in oios view solve some of these transparency i ssues unog sss should also invest more efforts in communicating the objectives targe t dates progress made and changes introduced by hmoss to ensure that all staff are informed and understand the objectives and stakes of the project recommendation head2right unog sss should introduce regular formal communicat ion to enhance information sharing within the section and update all staff members on the status and progress of hmoss implem entation rec 06 7 29 unog sss commented that conclusions from an interna l survey and working group were being reviewed and that internal vectors of co mmunication already included broadcast system monthly meetings minutes of whic h were systematically prepared and monthly newsletter oios will close the recommendation upon receipt f the minutes of the monthly meetings and copies of the monthly newslett er d processes 30 oios reviewed unog sss main activities to ensu re that adequate and comprehensive procedures were in place in the cont ext of hmoss implementation unog sss developed and promulgated security policies chniques and procedures via standard operating procedures the task of identifying and d eveloping the areas necessitating sops had been delegated to the units further instructio ns on ways to manage monitor and update these procedures should be developed through work shop to take place in the fall of 2005 31 from our review of the various processes of g sss shortfalls as well as good practices were identified in the following areas badges and magnetic cards 32 in general unog sss is well aware of the secur ity defects of the current badge system including easily forgeable identity badges it is expected that the implementation of the secretariatwide global id system will introduc significant improvement it is noteworthy that the online identification system us ed by unog sss has significantly reduced the delays in badgeissuance and allows for instant checks by access control officers 33 oios noted in particular that the list of persons authorizing the badge issuance was outdated there is coordination between the issuance of ba dges by the id unit and the release of magnetic cards by another unog sss unit stand ard checkin procedure could be developed to streamline and coordinate these two pr ocesses unog sss explained that magnetic cards would fall under the id unit upon co mpletion of the pregny security gate currently under construction the period left for external contractors to provide the necessary document to issue nontemporary badge was long up to 45 days follo wing unog sss comment that some contractors had difficulty providing the docum ents within given time oios believes that the control in place is ineffective nd could be enhanced expired badges are released intact to an external c ompany for recycling unog sss should consider destroying them prior to their rele ase the 5year limit to retain information on badge hol ders leads to systematic destruction of essential paper files older than five years inc luding information relating to longterm unog staff still holding badges practices at different duty stations could be adopt ed which require the badge holder to acknowledge hisher responsibility to return the ba dge or report its loss 8 recommendations head2right unog sss should improve security procedures related to the issuance and management of badges namely ensuring that the list of persons authorizing bad ge issuance is uptodate reconsidering the policy for issuing badges to ex ternal contractors destroying expired badges prior to their release ensuring valid information is available on all cu rrent badge holders requiring badge holders to acknowledge their responsibility to return badges or to report their loss rec 07 34 unog stated that efforts were being made to update the list of authorizing persons issue instructions regarding destruction of badges and finalizing the id standard operating procedures the issue of external contractors would be looked into within the context of the complete review of the access control policy b access control 35 the requirement for all staff members to wear t heir badges at all times is not fully enforced at the palais des nations making it diffi cult for security officers to control access at the gates and within the premises oios also observ ed that delivery trucks screening was not systematically performed in response to the audit findings unog recently issued circular requesting staff members conference participants journalists and all persons visiting the palais des nations to show their ground pass to sec urity officers on duty upon request and to wear it visibly at all times while on unog grounds oios appreciates the immediate action taken unog further indicated that standing orders are in place for delivery trucks to be systematically checked 36 visitors joining the guided tours of the palais are not accompanied to the gate at the end of the tour and are free to wander around the p remises where access is restricted unog indicated that it is envisaged to negotiate wi th dpi means and ways to establish more strict controls on visitors recommendation head2right unog sss should enforce controls over access of all vehicles and users of the palais des nations to its gates and pr emises in order to keep the security risk at minimum level rec 08 37 logbooks are kept at each entry gate at the pal ais des nations and the annexes oios noted that the information they contained was not c onsistent and ranged from general information memos to inventory of visitors badges and records of incidents oios found neither clear guidelines on the information to be k ept nor indications on how to followup on some issues 9 recommendation head2right unog sss should develop clear guidelines on the inf ormation to be recorded in visitors logbooks and the manner to address and solve issues reported therein rec 09 38 unog indicated that sops have been established and responsibilities assigned in the future logbooks will have to be signed by the chief of the subunits and regular checks done by the heads of unit oios will close this recommendation once it rece ives the sops and the newly released instructions regarding logbo oks c fire and safety group 39 deriving from the responsibility to ensure the safety and security of persons and property unog sss has fire and safety unit with 12 posts ultimately unog relies on the intervention of the local fire service the ext ent of autonomy response and means that need to be deployed by unog sss and by the swiss fi re service is not documented officially and should be clarified as well as the responsibil ities of the unog sss fire and safety unit the chief sss explained that autonomy of 30 minute s was used to determine the necessary resources 40 the fire emergency system in the premises opera tes around wardens who are designated staff members who ensure the implementat ion of security plans in the zones under their charge however attendance in specific ward ens training provided by unog sss proved to be as low as fifty per cent in the recent period the role and responsibilities of wardens should be reemphasized with staff members and management to ensure that information on security arrangements is shared and coordinated at all levels recommendation head2right unog sss should formally define its responsibilitie s with regard to fire and safety services as well as develop s cheme for warden duties to ensure recognition of their functions and availability for training at given times rec 10 41 unog commented that project is under progress to establish formal framework with the host country fire and safety authority 42 extinguishers in the united nations premises sh ould be controlled and replaced on regular basis responsibility that has been outso urced to several companies in switzerland and was monitored by the unog building and engineer ing section upon oios request unog sss performed an extensive check of fire extin guishers the control of which revealed to be unsatisfactory unog sss already took action to setup database to monitor their control and replacement d investigation 43 general assembly resolution 59287 of 13 april 2005 requests that an administrative mechanism of mandatory reporting to oios be put in place oios noted that the investigation subunit performed its missions without any formal terms of reference or guidelines for its activities as well as guidelines on sharing or transferring cases to the oios investigation division leaving the decision to file an investiga tion case to the discretion of unog 10 management 44 until recently none of the investigators had n investigation background or had undergone specific investigation training although professional investigators have now been recruited presentation or training on the speci ficities of investigations in the united nations has been provided so far although oios pro vided basic investigation training to three sss staff members the security officers trai ned were not staff from the investigation subunit recommendation head2right unog sss should i arrange for investigation train ing of all its investigators to enhance their performance ii sure that all legal provisions applicable to investigation in the unite d nations are complied with and iii establish mechanism for r eferring cases to the investigation division of the office of interna l oversight services rec 11 45 unog indicated that additional training for investi gators should be implemented by the end of 2006 oios will close the recommendation upon receipt f the training plan human resources management status and specificities of the security functi on 46 the status of security officers in unog is that of general service staff with further requirements attached to the specificity of the security function at united nations headquarters security officers fall in the securit service category there is stricter requirement for medical clea rance most personnel files reviewed by oios included medical clearance forms older than four years until recently there was testing on substance or alcohol abuse nor was psychological testing conducted prior to the releas of firearms in sample review of personnel files police rec ords were not always on file 47 unog stated that the new stai200512 requires ann ual medical examination for security officers random testing for illegal drugs and controlled substances as well as psychological testing prior to the release of firea rms will be conducted request for police records has also been introduced in the hmoss recr uitment process b functions and staff allocation 48 job descriptions within unog sss were obsolete and oios was informed that they would be updated following the completion of hmoss recruitment 49 security services in different duty stations us shifts of various duration 8 hours in geneva and 12 hours in vienna for instance unog sss could usefully compare the costbenefits of these arrangements and if need be submit the most beneficial scheme to dss for approval 50 the responsibility of surveillance at night tim is assigned to permanent team selected on voluntary basis having quite aged team with an average of 55 years and 11 comparatively higher average of 21 days of sick lea ve compared to unog sss average of 14 days raises the questions on conditions and rot ation of the night shift team recommendation head2right unog sss should review its various shift arrangemen ts with costsbenefits analysis and ascertain they implemen t the most beneficial shift system rec 12 51 unog noted the recommendation and its implementatio n would be looked into early 2006 52 the ratio of security officer performing office and administrative functions was 28 per cent of total security officers on day duty this r atio should be reviewed to better comply with the destinationnature of the posts workload stati stics should also be developed for the various activities of the section to support the location of resources recommendation head2right unog sss should review the size of its administrati ve and support structure to ensure that it is adequate and efficie nt with regard to its operations rec 13 53 unog indicated that the creation of the administrat ive unit and the coordination and planning unit should contribute to strengthenin g the operational tasks of sss but that the report writing part of security work could not be avoided c training 54 oios found that unog sss training plan up to 2 005 was not consistent with the proportionate response principle security officer s were not always trained on the use of non lethal weapons and annual recycling on firearms was not always performed on time the recent emphasis put on training will address the pr oblem providing additional financial and human resources comprehensive training program has already been developed with an objective of 10 training days per staff and year h owever all additional staffing resources required under hmoss were determined based on 5 dayayear training policy assumption the new 10day objective would unlikely be achieved or would result in chronic deficit of staff in the future whenever security officers are in training 55 oios also noted from the 2004 and 2005 training statistics that the training efforts are not evenly spread and some security officers never undertook training over the period under review unog sss explained that new training requir ements would put increasing pressure on security officers to undergo training and that c ompulsory training prerequisites would be listed under each job description d performance appraisal system pas 56 in reviewing pas evaluations completed for the period 1 april 200331 march 2004 oios noted that many forms contained standard comme nts on the staff member and were sometimes mere copy and paste some of the pas also did not reflect the functions actually fulfilled by the staff member further attention sh ould be put in the pas exercise to provide useful comments and guidance to the concerned staff and to ensure that the evaluation is 12 assigned and carried out by the direct supervisor recommendation head2right unog sss should ensure that the performance apprais of staff is assigned and carried out by the direct supervisor nd provides adequate guidance and advice on each of the staffs professional and personal goals rec 14 57 unog agreed with the recommendation and will endeav or to have full compliance by the end of the current pas cycle f asset management 58 in reviewing the current firearm management sys tem oios noted the following shortfalls when releasing firearms to security officers there are written statements to acknowledge their responsibility and eventual disci plinary sanctions one firearm was sent for repair without any justifi cation or receipt from the geneva armoury some security officers on mission in peacekeeping perations left with their firearm in one case more than nine years ago and action was taken to collect the firearm or transfer it formally to the dpko 59 oios is aware that unog plans to establish ce ntral armory by the end of 2005 that additional firearms will not be purchased until the n and that taskforce has been established to improve the existing policy related to firearms recommendation head2right unog sss should considering the critical importanc of comprehensive and strict firearm instructions impr ove its firearm policy by defining clearly the responsibilities of the custodian as well as the officer who accepts firearms and by im mediately collecting outstanding firearms or clearly document ing their location and transfer of responsibility rec 15 60 unog indicated that software application was deve loped in october 2005 sops should be finalized by january 2006 and new lieut enant post for firearm management had been advertised oios will close the recommendation upon confirmat ion that the software has been implemented the post filled and upon rece ipt of the new sops 61 oios also noted that internal control espec ially segregation of duty is in place for the management of listening devices controls shoul d be strengthened to ensure appropriate use is made of the equipment unog stated that sop had been developed and that security briefing to new security staff on the topi c was planned for the first quarter of 2006 13 g headquarters minimum operating security standard s hmoss 62 as hmoss compliance is an interdependent chai n of security measures physical regulatory practices and processes security in og is only as good as the weakest link of the chain considering the implementation schedule recruitment of security officers is expected to be completed by the end of 2005 howeve r the training and upgrading of all security officers will take
