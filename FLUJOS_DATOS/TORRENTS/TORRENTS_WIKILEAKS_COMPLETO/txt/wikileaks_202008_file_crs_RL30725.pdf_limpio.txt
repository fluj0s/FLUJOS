administrative officers chief administrative officer chaplain clerk and sergeant at arms22 the resolution nominating the slate of candidates is offered by the chairman of the conference of the majority party the minority party proposes its own roster of candidates as an amendment to the majority partys resolution by tradition neither the resolution nor the amendment is debated although the slate can be divided with separate vote on any or all officers 23 again however because of its numerical advantage the majority is able to defeat the minority substitute and to adopt the resolution

of the house although the rules of one congress are not binding on the next the house usually approves its rules by adopting bloc the rules of the previous congress with amendments normally prior to the first day of new congress task forces of both the majority and the minority party have worked on any changes they wish to implement in the houses standing rules in modern times the majority partys rules package has always prevailed the proposed rules are offered in the form of house resolution since there are then existing house rules the resolution is considered under general parliamentary law which the house interprets to mean the rules in force in the preceding congress 24 debate is normally limited to one hour and the majority party manager traditionally yields half the time to the minority manager for purposes of debate only to discuss an alternative proposal because of that stipulation member can offer an amendment to the rules proposal and the minority substitute is not formally considered 22 in the 102nd congress the office of postmaster was abolished and that of doorkeeper was abolished in the 104th congress their duties have been assumed by other officers 23 rep

question the majority partys numerical advantage assures the adoption of this motion the effect is to force an immediate vote on the question of final approval of the majoritys own pending rules package therefore any opportunity for the minority to offer an amendment is precluded25 if that motion were defeated the minority would be entitled to offer an amendment to the majoritys rules package normally this does not happen and the rules are usually adopted on partyline rollcall vote 26 if the rules package were to be defeated the house would continue to operate under general parliamentary law until another rules package was adopted on the opening day of the 110th congress the house adopted rules to prohibit members and staff from receiving most gifts from lobbyists foreign agents and their private clients27 these ethics rules were adopted as part of the 110th congress rules package which also place more restrictions and requirements on the acceptance of travel expenses from outside sources and require the committee on standards of official conduct to offer annual ethics training to members and employees other 110th congress rules changes rename several committees28 prohibit the speaker from holding votes open for longer than the scheduled time for the sole purpose of changing the outcome of the vote and require committees of jurisdiction and conference committees to publish lists of earmarks and tax and tariff benefits contained in all bills reported and unreported managers amendments and conference reports that come to the house floor 29 selected rules changes for the openings of the 104th through 109th congresses are described in the appendix 25 given that the rules of the house in the last congress appl generally the minority party is given the right to offer motion to commit the rules package to committee for further ex amination while this motion traditionally loses it does give the minority party the opportunity to include instructions to the committee for changes in the text of the proposed rules these instructions are in essence an amendment which typically contains selected portions of the minoritys rules package the outcome however remains certain the majority partys rules package prevails 26 in 1971 the previous question motion to end debate on hres 5 was defeated by bipartisan coalition which sought to drop from the rules packag proposal permitting the automatic discharge of measure from the rules committee if that committee had not acted on it within 31 days this coalition voted against ordering the previous question motion thereafter the 31day rule was removed from the rules package by floor amendment and the rules package passed overwhelmingly it should be noted that the consideration of hres 5 was delayed by one day by unanimous consent and the house operated under general parliamentary law for most of the two session days see rules of the house congressional record vol 117 jan 21 1971 pp

both resolutions is routine and occurs without amendment because of the tacit understanding th at each party has right to establish its own internal distribution of work without amendment from the other committee assignments may not be considered on the house floor until both the republican conference and the democratic caucus have adopted their own rules governing committee assignments the
