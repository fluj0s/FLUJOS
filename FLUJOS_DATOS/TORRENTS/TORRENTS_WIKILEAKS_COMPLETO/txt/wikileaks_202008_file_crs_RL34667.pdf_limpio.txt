shelf ocs fo r oil and gas development currently under presidential and congressional moratoria discussed in more detail below the president stated that he would lift the executive branch moratoria only after congress did so legislatively but on july 14 2008 president bush reversed his position and lifted the executive ban on the ocs imposed in 1990 by president george hw bush senator john mccain among others has called on congress to lift the offshore drilling moratoria as well further the administration proposes to begin planning its next fiveyear leasing program that would if approved be implemented as early as 2010 two years ahead of schedule th proposed new fiveyear program would supersede the current fiveyear leasing program from 20072012 the administration argues that new fivey ear lease program beginning in 2010 would allow any newly opened ocs areas if the congressional moratoria is lifted this year to be offered in lease sale sooner than if they remained on their current schedule since the president lifted the executive ban members of congress have introduced legislation that would lift the congressional prohibition in part or completely against leasing and development of oil and natural gas in the ocs the legislation section of this report summarizes several of those bills including the house leadership proposal hr 6899 ma ny in congress however oppose lifting the offshore ban they argue that there are still several million acres leased onshore and offshore but not yet producing and that production from these lands could increase us oil

congress has enacted ocs leasing moratoria for each of fiscal years 19822006 in the annual interi or and related agen cies appropriations bill now the interior and environment nd related agencies appropriations bill allowing leasing only in the gulf of xico except near florida and parts of alaska president george hw bush in 1990 issued presidential directive ordering the department of the interior doi not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in areas covered by the annua l legislative moratoria until 2000 in 1998 president clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012 proponents of the moratoria conte nd that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threat coastal tourism industries whereas supporters of expanded offshore leasing c ounter that more domestic oil and gas production is vital for the nations energy security the outer continental shelf lands act of 1953 ocsla as amended provides for the leasing of ocs lands in manner that protects the environment and returns revenues to the fede ral government in the form of bonus bids rents and royalties1 ocsla requires the secretary of the interior to submit fiveyear leasing programs that specify the time location and size of the areas to be offered each fiveyear leasing program entails lengthy multistep process that includes environmental impact statements afte r public comment period final proposed plan is submitted to the president and congress the latest plan went into effect july 1 2002 public hearings for the 20072012 leasing program are underway states

three imperial nautical miles federal jurisdicti on extends typically 200 nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the rritorial sea is measured one nautical mile equals 115

been placed in escrow which were then paid out between 1986 and 2001states with energy development off their shores in federal waters3 have been seeking larger portion of the federal revenues generated in those areas they particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and nearshore activities that support offshore energy development proponents of these proposals look to th rates at which funds are given to jurisdictions where onshore energy developm ent occurs on federal lands within those jurisdictions coastal destruction has received more attention in louisiana especially hardhit by hurricanes in 2005 where many squa re miles of wetlands have been lost to the ocean each year widespread energyrelated development is thought to contribute to coastal losses currently the affected states receive some revenue directly from offshore oil and gas leases in fede ral waters under section 8g of ocsla and under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 pl 109 4324 this is in contrast to the 50 share of direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their bounda ries opponents point out the budget implications that
