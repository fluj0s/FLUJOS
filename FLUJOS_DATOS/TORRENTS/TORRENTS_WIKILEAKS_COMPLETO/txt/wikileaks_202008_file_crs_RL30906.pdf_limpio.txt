ending the war in bosnia the accords retained bosnia as single country divided into two largelyau tonomous entities natoled peacekeeping force and other international organizations are trying to help implement the accord and bring stability to the country during the clinton administration the premise of us policy in bosnia and the region was that the stability of the balkans is important to stability in europe as whole which the administration viewed as vital us interest during the 2000 presidential campaign candidate george w bush called for us withdrawal from balkans peacekeeping leaving the task up to european countries however administration officials appear to have modi fied their views since taking office in february 2001 secretary of state colin po well said that while the united states wants to reduce over time the number of u s troops in the region the united states would not cut and run he stressed that united states and european forces in the balkans went in together and well come out together the us deployment to bosnia has been controversial in congress critics say this mission and others like it are openende d have overly ambitious fuzzy goals that amount to nationbuilding and that suchmi ssions sap the readiness of us forces nevertheless congress has regularly provided funding for the bosnia deployment over the past five years repeated efforts by some members to set deadlines for withdrawal or tie withdrawal to specifi c conditions have not become law congress has imposed reporting requireme nts on many issues including the impact of balkans peacekeeping missions on the readiness of us forces burdensharing with us allies and the establishm ent of benchmarks to measure progress on the ground the united states and its llies have set the goal of selfsustaining peace in bosnia defined as peace that will likely continue to exist after peacekeeping forces have left benchmarks set to measure progress toward this goal include military

to justice and reintegrating the strategic brcko district supporters of th current approach of the international community in bosnia say the slow steady accumulation of progress in implementing the peace accord is changing the situation in bosnia for the better critics charge that most of this progress has come as result of the international communitys browbeating or direct intervention th ey assert that lacking real domestic constituency this progress is by definition not selfsustaining the international community has several possible options in bosnia it could continue the present course or reduce the level of attention and resources devoted to bosnia other options include formal revision the p eace accords to move openly toward partition on bosnia or reinterpreting or amending the accords to promote bosnias unity acting apart from the international community the united states retains the option of withdrawing unilaterally from bosniahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906contents

1995 the united states and the internati onal community have spent billions of dollars and deployed thousands of troops to bosniaherzegovina in an effort to create selfsustaining peace there defined as peace that will likely continue to exist after peacekeeping forces have left however while the situation in the country has improved significantly in the more than five years since the accords were signed most observers believe that selfsustaining peace is still distant prospect there exist variety of views among experts us policymakers and members of congress on future policy options some see the international effort in bosnia as misguided and impractical exercise in nationbuilding and not in the us interest they advocate us pullout from bosnia leaving the main burden for bosnian peacekeeping with the europeans some dvocates of disengagement also favor partition of bosnia others believe that the stability of bosnia and the balkans is important to stability in europe as whole which they view as vital us interest many calling for greater international role in bosnia attribute the shortcomings of current policy to an insufficiently active effort to defeat nationalists in bosnia andor to flaws in the dayton accords background the history of bosniaherzegovina has been shaped by variety of factors ethnicity is one important factor mo st of the population are from three ethnic groups all of slavic origin the bosniaks also called muslims are the descendants of slavs who converted to islam after the ottoman conquest of the balkans in the 15th century in 1991 bosniaks formed 437 of the population cat holic croats made up 173 and orthodox serbs made up 314 ethnic relations in bosnia herzegovina have been peaceful during most periods but have sometimes been punctuated by horrific violence frequently provoked by outside forces increasing serb and croat nationa lism has been an important fact or as extremists have sought to claim part or most of bosniaherzegovi na as part of neighboring greater serbia or greater croatia for example the atrocities committed by nazibacked croatian ustashe fascists are still remembered by serbs today projects to partition bosnia among the three ethnic groups were comp licated by the patchwork pattern of settlement in bosnia not ll serbs lived in areas neig hboring serbia nor croats in areas near croatia bosniaks were scattered throughout the province httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs2 1 european stability institute reshaping intern ational priorities in bosnia and herzegovina october 14 1999 available on the i website at http wwwesiwe borgdocsshow documentphpdocument_id4 another important factor to bear in nd when looking at bosnia today is the impact of communism bosniaherzegovina was one of six republics in communist yugoslavia the political and economic system put in place by yugoslav leader josip broz tito while perhaps somewhat less harsh than other communist regimes nevertheless retained many of their key characteristics the league of communists of yugoslavia lcy was not just the sole political party in the country it had the ability to appoint people to key posts not only in the government but in the media judiciary the economy the educationa l system and other influential positions throughout yugoslav society this practice often referred to by its soviet name of nomenklatura was key tool of comm unist control the nomenklatura system crippled or rendered meaningless concepts such as political pluralism civil society the rule of law and the free market feature of the system unique to yugoslavia was the fragmentation of the lcy and government structures in yugoslavia along ethnic lines tendency that became particularly marked afte r the adoption of the 1974 yugoslav constitution and accelerated after the death of tito in 1980 the yugoslav political system began to seize up as result of nationalisttinged bureaucratic infighting among republic governments and communist parties th coming of multiparty elections in 1990 actually made this situation worse as newly formed nationalist parties emerged and won elections in bosnia this legacy continues in todays bosnia the main nationalist parties in bosnia tend to us nomenklatura techniques to cement their power and enrich themselves through corruption1 the 19921995 war in bosnia was also critical factor in shaping the country today the rise of hard line nationalism in serbia under slobodan milosevic and similar movement in cr oatia led by franjo tudjman in the late 1980s and early 1990s posed grave threat to bosniaherzegovinas unity bosnias own republic government was split among bosniak croat and serb na tionalists the secession of slovenia and croatia in august 1991 upset the delicate balance of power within yugoslavia milosevic conceded slove nias independence after few days but croatias secession touched ff conflict between croat fo rces and serb irregulars supported by the serbdominated yugoslav army bosnian serb nationalists demanded that bosnia remain part of serbiandominat ed yugoslavia bosnian croat nationalists threatened to secede if bosnia remained in yugoslavia bosnian president alija izetbegovic worried bout the possible spread of the conflict to bosnia tr ied to find compromise solution however these efforts were made very difficult given the nature of the milosevic and tudjman regimes both of which had designs on bosnian territory in addition izetbegovics hand was forced by the european community ec decision in december 1991 to grant diplomatic recognition to any of the former yugoslav republics that requested it provided that the republics held refere ndum on independence and agreed to respect minority rights the borders of neig hboring republics and other cond itions izetbegovic and the bosniaks felt they could not remain in milosevicdominated rump yugoslaviahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs3 2 ibidand had to seek independence and ec reco gnition even given the grave threat such move posed to peace in the republic bosnia n serb leaders warned that international recognition of bosniaherzegovina would lead to civil war in march 1992 most bosniaks and cr oats voted for independence in referendum while most rbs boycotted the vote in april 1992 shortly before recognition of bosnia by the european community and the united states serbian irregulars and the yugoslav army launc hed attacks throughout the republic they quickly seized more than twothirds of the republics territory and besieged the capital of sarajevo bosnian government officials estimated that over 200000 people were killed in the war or were missing about 23 million people were driven from their homes creating the greatest flow of refugees in europe since world war ii serbian forces attacked bosniak and croat civilians in order to drive them from ethnically mixed areas that they wanted to claim croats and bosniaks were initially allied against the serbs but fighting between croats and bosniaks broke out in ethnically mixed areas in 19931994 also resulting in ethnic cleansing by both sides bosniak forces also engaged in et hnic cleansing against serbs in some areas in addition to the interethnic bitterness it created and the damage it caused to bosnias economy the war also greatly strengthened organized crime groups and their links with government officials an important stumbling block to bosnias post war recovery2 the war came to an end in 1995 after nat conducted series of air strikes against bosnian serb positions in late augu st and early september the strikes were in response to bosnian serb refusal to withdraw its artille ry from around sarajevo after an artillery attack on sarajevo marketplace caused many civilian deaths bosniak and bosnian croat fo rces now better equipped and trained than ever before simultaneously launched an offensive against reeling bosnian serb forces inflicting sharp defeats on them the bosnian serbs agreed to ceasefire in october 1995 as did the croats and bosniaks after strong international pressure serbian president slobodan milosevic croatian president franjo tudjman bosnian president alija izetbegovic as well as representatives of the bosnian serbs and croats met at the wrightpatterson air force base in da yton ohio in november 1995 to

least partly ameliorate these coordination problems and to develop more effective tools to deal with obstructionism the role of the office of the high representative has expanded since the peace accords were signed at the beginning ohr had limited mandate to coordinate international efforts and was given few resources faced with obstructi onism by local leaders in december 1997 the peace implementation council ruled that ohr has the power to remove obstructionist officials and impose laws not adopted by central ins titutions since that time ohr has expanded the use of this power to the point that it represents parallel legislative power at both the central and entity level laws have been imposed that have not been submitted to local parliaments or governments the impact of ohrs actions has been important in some areas such as establishing freedom of movement through imposing common licence plate less so in others such as dismissing recalcitrant officials who are often replaced by equally inflexible placemen of the ruling nationalist parties6 us policy since its key role in brokering the dayton peace accords the clinton administration said that us engagement in bosnia was important for several reasons clinton administration officials argued that the stability of europe is vital interest of the united states and that the key us goal in the region is europe whole and free they said that instability in bosnia and elsewhere in the balkans could have negative impact on europe as whole they asserted that the united states must be engaged in trying to prevent or halt conflicts in the region before they spread and intensified pulling the united states into even more costly difficult and dangerous commitments in addition they claimed that failure to meet challenges in bosnia and the balkans could deal damaging blow to the credibility and future viability of nato and euroatlantic coope ration if the united states belie ves that it is in its interest to be leading european power it can hard ly avoid playing an important role in one of the key challenges facing the continent they asserted they stressed that it is proper that europe bear the largest share of the burden in the balkans but that the united states must also participate in efforts to rebuild the region to safeguard its own interests us disengagement from the region could create

was how to deal with congressional concerns over an openended us troop commitment in bosnia in part to head off possible congressiona l objections in late 1995 the clinton administration said that

statement on february 27 powell said that us and european forces in the balkans went in together and well come out together14 congressional concerns the us commitment to bosnia has been controversial issue in congress in late 1995 some members of congress expressed opposition to the deployment of us troops to bosnia or demanded th at the administration secure prior congressional authorization for it after the deployment the 104th and 105th congresses focused on the escalating cost of the bosnia mission and on whether to cut off funds for the deployment ma ny members were skeptical of the administrations one year limitation on the us troop commitment and were angry at the administrations revision of that decision15 members made several efforts to limit or terminate the us troop commitme nt without success instead congress approved the administrations requests for funding the ployment but required the administration to submit reports on progress toward achieving the objectives of the deployment as well as on its impact on the readiness of the us military congress also appropriated large amounts of aid for civilian peace implementation and r econstruction in bosnia and s placed conditions on such aid these conditions included prohibition on us aid to regions of bosnia not cooperating with the international crimin tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty however these conditions include d waiver provisions that were frequently used by the clinton administration in partic ular to help modera rs prime minister milorad dodik bolster his position against hardliners the 106th congress did not focus legislative attention on bosnia but rather on another emerging regional problem ko sovo however congress continued to impose reporting requirements for the

forces to pursue nonmilita ry objectives congressional supporters of the current policy say that there is quick fix alternative to the patient work of building stability in the region they assert that us resources devoted to the region are modest and reject the idea that the ployments have inflic ted serious harm on the readiness of our forces16 congressional debate on kos ovo revisited many issues of previous deliberations on bosnia these include whether the president required prior congressional approval for the deployment of us fo rces members expressed concern about whether kosovo represented another ope nended commitment th at could have negative impact on us military readiness congress also considered proposals to cut off funding for the us troop presen ce in kosovo although proposals were partly tied to new issue burdensharing with european countries on reconstruction and other aid to kosovo as in the bosnia bate congress did not adopt these proposals and approved the funding the administra tion requested for peacekeeping congress even adopted compromise approach similar to that adopted in the bosnia debate by requiring the administration to draw up be nchmarks for achievement of us goals in kosovo in the fy2001 defense authorization bill the actions of the 107th congress on bosnia will likely depend in part on the strategy of the bush administration th political demise of milosevic in october 2000 may also pique congressi onal interest in withdrawal however narrow majorities in both chambers may make achieving consensus more difficult one important issue that congress may continue to address is burdensharing with us allies not only in kosovo but throughout the region including bosnia congress may also address the question of us strategy in the region key benchmarks in the fy1998 defense appropriations w pl 10556 congress required the president to establish benchmarks to meas ure progress toward selfsustaining peace in bosnia and set schedule for their achievement which would permit the withdrawal of us troops the law require d the president to seek to have the benchmarks adopted by the north atlan tic council the clinton

obstacles to this effort to integrate the bosnian militaries one is that bitter memories of the war may be still fresh in the minds of some members of the bosnian armies making it difficult to bring them together another obstacle is that nationalist political parties and leaders in bosnia do not wish to give up facto control over their armies the federation military is not effectively integrated below the level of the federation defense ministry and the highest levels of command which are at least nominally integrated the federation army consists of croat army controlled by the croatian democratic union hdz and bosniak army controlled by the party of democra tic action sda this division was made more obvious in march 2001 when hdz leaders angry at actions taken by the international community befo re and after the november 2000 elections said the areas they control would in effect secede from the federation including from the federation army bosnian croa t officers subsequently resigned from the federation army as the first step to setting up their own armed forces the leadership of the republika srpska has also rejected surrende ring control of the rs army viewing it as the ultimate guarantor of the rss security related issue is the close links that the militaries have had with other countries since its inception the hvo the bosnian croat military within the federation received the overwhelming share of its funding equipment and many of its officers from croatia under the leadership of croatian president franjo tudjman and the hdz in croatia serb ia under the leadership of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic pursued similar policy however croatias military aid to the bosnian croat military has been sharply reduced since the collapse of the tudjman

that has hindered implementation of the dayton accords illegal institutions are particular probl em in the federation above all in croat controlled areas these institutions as well as corruption and crime for the benefit of nationalist political parties corrupt politicians and criminals receive funding from many sources including smuggling di version of customs revenues and other criminal activities another avenue is the payments bureau the three ethnic groups maintain payment bureaus through which all financial transfers must pass this situation gives enormous power and money to

representative imposed w abolishing the payment bureaus july 2000 report by the ge neral accounting office says that international but not us aid has been stolen by corrupt fficials however perhaps more important are the huge amounts stole from bosnian government funds since corruption reduces the overall amount of resources availa ble to deal with bosnias problems it can be said that it has an

september 14 1996 the osce judged that the elections took place in less than free and fair environment media remained in the hands of the ruling nationalist parties which also harassed and intimidated opposition supporters partly as result of these conditions the ruling parties won the elections municipal ections which were planned for the same date were postponed due to fra ud in the registration

osce has banned candidates and parties for violating election rules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs15 critics of the osce say that it approved an election law favoring ethnic gerrymandering and nationalist parties the law thus permitted people to vote where they live now not in the areas in whic h they resided in 1991 this permitted nationalists to concentrate their supporters in areas they wanted to control thereby giving democratic legitimacy to ethni c cleansing on the other hand the implementation of election results has also been problem particularly when ethnic minorities are elected to local governments in areas from which they have been expelled in the most recent elections on n ovember 11 2000 voters elected new bosnian central parliament as well as parliaments for the two entities rs voters elected new president while voters in the federation chose canton legislatures in the federation the results confirmed tr end of eroding support for the nationalist sda among bosniaks but continued hdz dominance among croats in the republika srpska the nationa list serbian democratic party sds won 31 seats in the 83seat rs national assembly making it by far the largest party in the rs parliament the mode rate party of democratic prog ress pdp won 11 seats as did another moderate party the union of inde pendent social democrats led by former rs prime minister milorad

and other nonnationalist parties at the central gove rnment level in february 2001 and the federation level in march the alliance excluded sda hdz and sds furious at osce election rule changes before

on military matters however these institutions are very far from functioning effectively their powers are limited their funding depends on the entities which ve little incentive to make them work nationalist parties have also sabotaged them from within as result the passage and implementation of key legislation needed to integrate bosnia and revive its economy continues to lag the high repres

1998 averaged about 40 gdp reached 41 billion in 1998 about 40 of the prewar level however most observers view this economic growth as deceptive based larg ely on unsustainable levels of economic aid international officials have repeatedly warned bosnian leaders that economic aid to their country will decline sharply ove r the next few years and that they must work harder to reform their economy to the foundation for foreign investment and selfsustaining economic growth the focu s of international aid efforts has now shifted toward creating single economic space in bosnia enabling private sector growth and privatization however economic reform pr ogress has been halting in part due to foot dragging by corrupt bosnian leaders25 displaced persons and refugee returns annex 7 of the peace agreement guarant ees all displaced persons and refugees right to return to their homes success in this area is key to reversing ethnic cleansing and knitting bosnia back together progress has been slow but has picked up in the past year figures are somewh at uncertain due to reporting problems and the significant numbers of people who are returning without notifying international officials an estimated 23 million people we re displaced or b ecame refugees during the war unhcr recorded over 728000 return s of refugees and displaced persons to bosnia from january 1996 to january 2001 however the key figure is minority re turns that is the number of people who have returned to areas in which they are longer the ethnic majority there have been over 100000 minority returns since the signature of the dayton peace accords mainly to the federation the number of minority returns are increasing the high commission for refugees said ther were over 67000 minority returns in 2000 alone however long after the war many people are still displaced in december 2000 unhcr said that over 518000 persons in bo snia continue to be registered as displaced persons nearly 21000 bosnian re fugees remain in croatia while over 190000 live in serbia and montenegro there are an additional 52000 refugees outside the region who have not been repa triated to bosnia or given longterm residency in

also practical issues that hinder returns lack of money to rebuild damaged houses lack of jobs for minority returnees and lack of public services such as utilities sc hools and social benefits some of these problems are due to lack of international assistance the poor state of the local economy or obstructionism by local officials status of the brcko district annex 2 of the dayton accords called for binding international arbitration by december 14 1996 to determine who would c ontrol the strategic brcko region held at that time by the bosnian serbs faced with the irreconcilable positions of

bosnian indictees are still at large30 implications supporters of the current approach of th international community in bosnia say the slow steady accumulation of progress not ed above is changing the situation in bosnia for the better critics charge that most of this progress has come as result of pressure by the international community they claim the international community has so far largely failed in its goal of encouraging local leaders to accept ownership of reforms they assert that lacking real domestic constituency this progress is by definition not selfsustaining one key st ructural problem is th persistence of the nomenklatura system but an additional fact or may be lack of strong active popular support for change an additional challeng is creating new democratic structures to replace the old ones to some extent dayton itself may stand in the way given the weakness of central aut horities and the way it organi zes the country on the basis of ethnicity western strategy is an important factor in bosnias future international aid to bosnia will continue to decline over the next few years given bosnias dependence on such aid and the slow pace of econo mic reform withdrawal symptoms may occur these could include increasing pub lic disorder or nationalist backlash increasing disorder could further strength organized crime gr oups particularly in the rs and in herzegovina however optimists say that there could be positive effect they note that economic hard times helped trigger the defeat of regimes in serbia and croatia some analysts have gone so far as to say that the international community has been unwittingly propping up nationalist regimes with aid and electoral legitimacy while condemning them publicly they argue that if the international community is skillful it can support democratic opposition and other democratic institutions while delegitimizing ruling nationalists in the long term the victories of refo rmist regimes in serbia and croatia will probably improve prospects for bosnian ity especially when compared to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs19 destructive impact of the milosevic and tudjman regimes however this factor may not be decisive at least in short term since coming to office in early 2000 the new croatian government has sharply reduced aid to bosnian croat institutions including the hvo the bosnian croat army and has funneled the remaining assistance through federation institutions however bosnian croat leaders perhaps fearing that continued internationa l pressure and the loss of backing in zagreb could pose grave threat to their power have become obs tructionist culminating in their announced secession from the federation in march 2001 as far as serbia is concerned while some serbs in serbia and perhaps most serbs in bosnia may entertain hopes th at the republika srpska could one day become part of serbia most realize that the international community is opposed to such an outcome and that serbia cannot fford to alienate in ternational aid donors yugoslav and serbian leaders are sympathetic to the problems of the bosnian serbs and wish to bolster the republika srpska in march 2001 the federal republic of yugoslavia signed an agreement with the rs on special parallel relationship such agreements are permitted under the da yton peace accords if they are consistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia as whole the agreement has the approval of the high representative the agreement calls for fryrs cooperation on number of issues rs prime minister mladen ivanic said the agreement would allow for military coopera tion between the fry and rs but that such cooperation would have to be transparent he sa id that the two sides would work on free trade zone he added that the agreement would permit rs citizens to have dual rsfry citizenship possible options the international community has ra nge of possible options in bosnia one possible option would be to continue the present course with similar levels of financial military and political commitment with progress continuing to accumulate gradually the presence of democratic regimes in serbia and croatia could contribute to such progress as bitte r memories of the war recede into the past slow steady progress could achieve sustai nable critical mass over the long term advocates believe however growing international impatience with the pace of change in bosnia may make this option unrealistic critics believe that this approach is doomed to failure given the persis tence of underlying political and economic factors in bosnia that will prevent th achievement of selfsustaining peace second conceivable option would be to put bosnia on the back burner in this scenario the international community would reduce its commitment to bosnia leaving the dayton accords tacitly implemented this option could appear to be politically attractive for western governments weary of continuing large commitment that has so far shown modest results indeed one could interpret declining sfor troop levels and international aid co mmitments as signs that the international community may be drifting in this direction already however this approach also carries significant risks what little the international community has achieved in civilian implementation would likely unravel and political instabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs20 could increase pullout of sfor from bosnia could be particularly destabilizing if nationalists decided to take advantage of the situation third option could be to formally revise the dayton accords to move openly toward partition this possibility could be combined with regional territorial settlement aimed at creating borders that would mo re closely correspond to current patterns of ethnic settlement this could involve the independence of kosovo and an independent rs which could then rge with serbia this option could be suitable for many bosnian serb s and croats however the bosniaks would reject this option strongly given the fact that the bosniaks are now the strongest military faction in bosnia they might be tempted to secure better deal for themselves militarily international peacek eepers could deter such m ove but that force would operate under increased risk such ch ange in western policy could also pose serious challenges for the new democratic regimes in croatia and serbia even if such division could be accomplished peacefully the new regime in croatia would facto have portion of bosnia thrust upon it without their wan ting it many in serbia might want to control the rs but perhaps not at the price of regional settlement that could result in the loss of kosovo moreover such partition might strengthen nationalist forces in both countri this of course would be more likely to occur if war broke out in bosnia again partition of bosnia could also further destabilize macedonia by legitimizing partition of that country as well there could also be intensified fighting over th borders of an independent kosovo moving in the opposite direction one could interpret the peace accords to promote greater unity within bosnia and the international community could play an even more direct role in shaping bosnian society multiethnicity within each entity could be strengthened the powers and resources of the bosnian central government could be expanded greater ac tivism by ohr the further revision of the election laws to the disadvantage of nationalists the use of the bosnian constitutional court to reinterpret the bosnian constitution are some of the ways the international community could move toward these goals sfor could force deeper reductions on the bosnian militaries as step toward their unification the international community has already made incremental steps in this direction in the past few years as it has learned by trialand error the problems with the dayton accords the shortcomings of the parties to it and which tools at the disposal of the international community actually work however if taken further this policy could be risky because nationalists like the current situation in bosnia and could resist violently if their power were threatened this option could also require the international community to continue to devote considerable resources to bosnia economic reform and increased prosperity could be much bigger blow to the prospects of nationalist parties than ohr efforts to impose laws or ban politicians or parties economic reform could help break the power of the nationalist parties by weakening their financial bases however international investment will be needed for economic reforms to take hold taking this approach step further one could radically amend or invalidate the accords including getting rid of the entitie s and creating genuine federal state perhaps with an international protectorate in the interim advocates of this approach say that the dayton accords are t oo fundamentally flawed to save and thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30906crs21 its structural problems should be taken h eadon however such strategy would provoke sharp opposition among bosnian serb and croat leaders and probably among their populations as well the risks of such policy and the resources it would require may make it politically unrealistic in the united states and other western countries finally an option for the united states alone would be unilateral us withdrawal currently the 4300 us troops in bosnia represent 17 of sfors total force the us contribution will drop to 3500 in april 2001 advocates say complete us troop withdrawal fro m bosnia would reduce pressure on an overcommitted us military and fo rce us allies in europe to face up fully to their responsibilities in the region the impact of such move would depend on the response of the europeans it is likely that european countries could find troops of sufficient number and quality to replace the u s contingent par ticularly from major nato allies such as britain france italy and germany however perhaps more important than the military impact of possible us withdrawal could be its political effect nationalists in bosnia and in the region as whole could see such move as weakening of international resolve particularly if european countries also withdrew or showed the divisions and weakness that hampered european forces during peacekeeping efforts in bosnia from 1992 1995 in addition to the impact of us withdrawal on the situation on the ground there is also the issue of natos cohesi on european leaders say that the balkan deployments are central part of natos postcold war mission decision by the most powerful member of the alliance
