at the federal bureau of investigation issues and options for congress summary in the aftermath of sept ember 11 2 001 the federal bureau of investigation fbi embarked on program to reform its intelligence and national security programs in the nearly four years ce 911 many experts agree the fbi has made progress in some areas dissemination of raw intelligence but some believe that the fbi has shown little progress in other areas establishing an integrated and proactive intelligence program while the fbis budget increased by 68 from fy2000 to fy2005 the weapons of mass destruc tion commission has recommended and the white house has approved the establishmen t of national security service within the fbi this service would inte grate the fbis counterterrorism and counterintelligence divisions with the fb is directorate of intelligence di whether this organizational change will yield substantive results is an open question there are at least two schools of thought with respect to how the fbi has performed in implementing its inte lligence reform initiatives the optimists believe there is critical synergy between the law enforcement and intelligence disciplines and that the fbi has successfu lly made changes throughout its history to respond to the threats of the time since the fbis vision for intelligence reform is sound success is simply matter of impleme nting that vision alternatively the skeptics believe that law enforcement and intelligence are distinct disciplines demanding different skill sets to achieve different ends they argue the fbis vision is fundamentally unsound and its ongoing implementation has not yielded an integrated intelligence program accord ing to this group intelligence collection remains effectively separated from intelligence analysis at the fbi this report analyzes the fbis overall intelligence reform effort focusing on the implementation of intelligence reform initiatives in the field reform policies designed at fbi headquarters with field input may be of marginal utility unless they are fully and effectively implemented across the 56 fbi field offices the congressional research service crs examined the fbis reform initiatives with focus on the implementation of the field intelligence group concept at five field offices allowing for varying levels of progress across field offices central tenet of highorder functioning intelligence organization is its ability to harness collection resources to nationally developed intelligence priorities and gaps while areas of promise exist field research indicates that the fbis ability to formally harness intelligence collection including systemic acc ountability mechanisms to analytically identified inte lligence gaps remains nascent in addition this report discusses veral overall options for congress in addressing fbi intelligence reform organizationally and structurally congress could establish standalone domestic intelligence agency alternatively it could codify the recently announced national secur ity service within the fbi potential areas are outlined for functional oversight including the fbicia relationship and the fbis efforts to stanch terrorism finance and fina lly the report reviews options for addressing the fbis intelligence budget bot h at the strategic and tactical

by the fbi crs conducted 65 interviews incl uding three with special agentsincharge and eight with assistant special agents in charge and numerous fbi intelligence analysts and special agents crs visited five field offices new york new york detroit michigan san francisco california nd phoenix arizona and the washington metropolitan field office the sample of field offices visited was not designed to be representative of the fbis 56 field offices ra ther field offices designated for visits were chosen for three reasons either 1 they historically had the most advanced counterterrorism counterintelligence and inte lligence programs or 2 they had substantial experience in investigating highprofile national security cases or 3 they were linked to the events of 911 one could argue that if th field offices visited are not advanced in the implementation of intelligence reform measures smaller field offices with less institutional knowledge of national security cases have higher probability of being even less developed although smaller fbi field office with less institutional knowledge of national security cases may be better at implementing some elem ents of intelligence reform given the nature of threats to national security and the location of riskassessed terrorist targets the national impact of that smaller offices intelligence reform may pale in comparison to the status of intelligence reform in for example new york or san francisco information was gathered in accordance w ith standardized methodology including uniform protocol of questions asked of si milar

reforms the fbi initiated following the september 11 attacks the commission noted that the fbi under director mueller has made signifi cant progress in improving its intelligence capabilities15 in its july 2004 report the commission recommended leaving the responsibility for counterterrorism intelligence collection with the fbi but called for an integrated national security workforce within the bureau such an option has often been referred to as service within service specifically the commission recommended that the fbi establish specialized and integrated national security workforce consisting of agents analysts linguists and surveillance specialists who are recruited trained reward ed and retained to ensu re the development of an institutional culture with deep expertise in intelligence and national security while rejecting the establishment of separate domestic intelligence agency the commission stated that it wanted to ensure that the fbis preventative counterterrorism

regarding weapons of mass destruction hereafter the wmd commission concluded that while the fbi has taken some commendable steps in the direction of an integrated national security workforce its plan fails to create truly sp ecialized and integrated national security workforce21 moreover the wmd commission c oncluded that in essence the di functions as an overlay on intelligence activities that are managed by other elements of the fbi and the director ates lack of authority prevents the fbi from vertically integrating foreign intelligence collection analysis and operations22 with respect to the collection of foreign intelligence within the united states function in which both the fbi and elements of the central intelligence agency engage the wmd commissi on argued for fluid system for coordination where both agencies are involved in the collection of foreign intelligence in the united states and conflicts are resolved by the director of national intelligence or the attorney general if it is question of what us law permits23 the wmd commission concluded in part that although the fbi is making progress to ward becoming full member of the intelligence community it has long way to go and significant hurdles remain in our view the fbi has not constructed its intelligence program in way that will promote integrated intelligence effo rts and its ambitions have led it into unnecessary new turf battles with the cia24 regarding the contentious issue of whet her the fbi should continue to play leading federal role in dom estic intelligence collection or instead be replaced by separate agency akin to the british security service mi525 the 911 and wmd commissions rejected the establishment of separate entity although the wmd commission qualified its rejection concluding we recommend that the policymakers re evaluate the wisdom of creating separate agency an equivalent to the british mi5 dedicated to intelligence collection in the united states should there be continued failure to institute the reforms necessary to tr ansform the fbi into the intelligence organization it must become26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs7 27 see white house memorandum

relationship remains less than clearly defined because the language contained in white house memorandum blishing the national security service is vague with respect to the degree of authority the dni

by law or by the president30 exactly which procedures are established and how the term communicate is interpreted and implemented will be critical factors in determining the extent of the dnis

optimistssynergists the optimistssynergists recognize that the events of 911 repres ented substantial shock to the fbis traditional priorities and culture they argue however that the fbi has developed coherent and sound vision for an intelligence program that integrates and leverages what they assert is synergy between the fbis criminal and national security missions this group also argues that th fbi has made or is in the process of making well thought out organizational business process and budgetary changes that will allow it to implement fully policy and legal changes that once hampered the bureaus efforts to be more effective and efficient members of the us intelligence community while adherents to this sc hool might concede that the pace of fbi reform could be quicker they believe that the fbi has changed its focus and priorities before and is capable of changing them again to meet national security demands today for this group the only hurdles to be overcome are the timely implementation of the vision these hurdles might in clude capacity limitations regarding the recruitment training performance rating and retention of intelligence professionals although additional resources might be we lcomed by this group some adherents to this school might also argue that it may be appropriate for the fbis budget having increased from 31 billion in fy2000 to requested amount of 57 billion for fy2006 to level off as increases of th is magnitude may be difficult to absorb effectively in such short period of time school 2 the skeptics the skeptics believe that there is some limited synergy between the disciplines of law enforcement and intelligence with respect to terrorism fundraising62 but they doubt it extends to other issues moreover they contend that the benefits of focused and integrated intelligence program would far outweigh the intangible benefits derived from any existing synergy as result skeptics of the fbis approach believe the fbis vision for intelligence reform is fundamentally flawed indeed they argu that rather than the bureaus criminal division generating more leads for the bureaus intelligence investigators to pursue just the opposite occurs they believe th at the newly created di is constrained by limited personnel and budget execution cont rol over the bureaus intelligence activities and by minimal c ontrol over intelligence collection in structuring the directorate the fbi they further assert is modeling itself after the cia which has intelligence directorate responsible for an alyzing intelligence and directorate of

the reprogramming action formally establishing the eadi position some critics date whatever progress the fbi has made in upgrading intelligence to baginskis arrival but contend that because this critical position was left vacant for an extended period of time the fbi made little or progress between sept 11 and baginskis arrival almost 1½ years laterthe fbi describes its directorate as dedicated national intelligence workforce within the bureau that is comprised of intelligence analysts language specialists physical surveillance specialists and special agents one of the directorates

essential collection of intelligence takes place making the fig critical determinant of the fbis eventual success in improving its intelligence operation new field intelligence groups if the fbis intelligence reform program has centerpiece it arguably is the newly created figs established in october 2003 in each of the bureaus 56 field offices the fi gs are standalone entities comprised largely of intelligence analysts linguists and surveillance specialists77 who are responsible for executing field intelligence operations at the direction and under the supervision of fbi headquarters form erly bureau intelligence analysts were assigned to field operational squads where they often were tasked by fbi special agents to check data bases and perform other largely daytoday functions including clerical work in support of opera tions field analysts rarely were called on to conduct strategic analysis and to produce analytic reports78 each fig is comprised of intelligence and language analysts who c onduct largely tactical analyses special agents who are re sponsible for intelligence collection reports officers relatively newly created position and security specialists79 reports officers are expected to play key role by sifting raw unevaluated intelligence and determining to whom it s hould be disseminated within the fbi and other federal agen cies for further processing through its figs the fbi says it intends to accomplish two goals first it wants to use each fig to serve as linchpin in the fbis plan to integrate law enforcement and intelligence operations in the field by establishing intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs22 80 ibid see fbi concept of operations fbi field office intelligence operations aug 2003 81 see reforming law

the fbi aims to creat an atmosphere and structure whereby the discipline of intelligence will infuse all operations conducted by special agents second the bureau through the fig says it wants to elevate the importance of analysts within an fbi law enforcement culture that has long celebrated the role of the special agent and had less regard for analysts80 ultimately the bureau maintains that it wants to reverse that relationship by empowering analysts and enabling them to analyze available intelligence identify gaps in that intelligence and then direct fbi special agents to collect intelligence that will fill those gaps according to the fbi it expects each fig to progress through three phases in fashion somewhat analog ous to software release with versions 10 through 30 during version 10 the inte nt is to bring together analysts in the fig and conduct any necessary hiring of new analysts as part of version 20 the fig assumes responsibility for managing th intelligence cycle in the field insuring that collected intelligence is analyzed and disseminated in version 30 the fig tasks special agent collectors to collect intelligence against gaps in intelligence that analysts have determined exist figs and driving intelligence collection whether the fbi will achieve its stated goal of creating culture in which its analysts historically of less status than special agents will acq uire the institutional authority to task special agents to collect intelligence remains at least uncertain and in the view of some highly unlikely although bureau reforms are wo rk in progress there are indications that the fbi may be falling short of this particular goal for example the 911 commission noted that analysts continue to be assigned menial tasks including covering phones at the reception desks and emptying the office trash bins81 the wmd commission in its 2005 report concluded that there is evidence of analysts continuing subordinate role82 crss recent field research largely confirmed those observations although the picture is mix ed and pockets of promise exist crs research indicated that fig analysts often continue to lack the institutional standing and authority to direct special agents to collect needed intelligence one senior fig analyst said that the bureau eventually would accomplish its goal of analytically driven intelligence collection but cautioned th at the fbi is still an investigations driven agency where the bureaus special ag ents rather than its analysts effectively determine what intelligence will be collected83 in comment that reflected the views of many of those interviewed both speci agents and analysts an analyst conceded i cannot imagine fig analysts driving collection84 crs found that analysts who had establis hed credibility in the eyes of special agents could and on occasion did direct sp ecial agent to collect needed intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs23 85 ibid 86 the conceptually pure intelligence model one in which analysis drives intelligence collection is difficult to achieve and as many intelligence professionals are aware there is one agency in the ic that implements such model flawlesslybut that their success in doing so depended on their professional credibility established over time rather than on institutional authority derived from their association with fig professiona l credibility undoubtedly is an important ingredient if an analyst is to successfu lly direct intelligence collection so too is institutionallyderived authority that figs are intended to provide crs detected little evidence of the latter one supervisory special agent commented the special agent will always be the center of the universe85 another contributing factor to the figs success is the credibility with which fbi special agents view the intelligence requirements process if the fig analysts lack the institutional power necessary to direct intelligence collection and hold special agents accountable for that coll ection one of the bureaus principal justifications for establishing the figs the fig construct could become increasingly marginalized figs and the intelligen ce requirements process one of the tools used by analysts and special agents to guide intelligence collection is the requirements process structured procedure employed by intelligence professionals to establish intelligence coll ection priorities specifically the bureau identifies gaps in its understanding of terrori sm and instructs its special agents to fill those gaps by collecting certain intelligence the fbi also provides unclassified law enforcement sensitive versions to state local and tribal law enforcement partners so that they can assist in broadening the bureaus understanding of domestic terrorism through their own intelligence collection both sets of requirements those used by the bureau and those used at the state and local level are supposed to be refined versions that reflect nati onal collection requirements tablished by the dni most observers view the fbis developm ent of formal requirements process as new and positive development that will bring more rigor to the bureaus intelligence program but whether field agents accept and act on the requirements will turn on their willingness to conform to more formal intelligence process than they are used to one in which collection priorities essentially are established by intelligence analysts and special agents are held accountable for collecting needed intelligence central tenet of highorder functioning intelligence organization is that it is able to harness its collection resources to nationally developed and coordinated intelligence prior ities and gaps the intelligence cycle is just that cycle in which analysts and collectors interact regularly to incorporate new information and refine intelligence collection requirements analysts and collectors are central to the cycle86 the 911 commission

noting that many field offices are still tempted to put law enforcement ahead of intelligencegathering crs field interviews surfaced similar c oncerns acceptance of the intelligence requirements process ppears to be mixed while pockets of promise exist field research indicates that the fbis ability to formally harness intelligence collection including systemic accountability m echanisms to analytically iden tified intelligence gaps remains nascent although some found the formal intelligence collection requirements document to be useful the prevailing view was that special agents rather than intelligence analysts were best positioned to determine what intelligence needed to be collected referring to the new formal collec tion requirements one federal official stated we do it intu itively i know what the information requirements are another fficial said if i have piece of information ill find the requirements that it fits the latter sentiment c ould be troubling indication that some agents continue to rely on r eactively collecting intelligence in response to an event than fit into an existing coll ection requirement lthough some intelligence collection requirements can be filled in this manner many observers believe it not proactive or efficient means of doing so such views raise questions about the role of fbi inte lligence analysts and the viability of the new fig structures while the progression of the figs through various stages of analysis will take time what remains to be seen is whether the fbi is capable of making the cultural change necessary to implement an effective efficient and formalized intelligence cycle figs and tactical versus strategic intelligence analysis88 i n addition to ultimately driving intelligence collection through the requirements process fig analysts are expected to tactically and strategically analyze intelligence disseminating their results to the bureau state and local law enforcement partners and when appropriate to the re st of the ic historically analysts in the field have spent the bulk of their time providing t actical support to ongoing cases external dissemination and strategic analysis

disseminating it the commission expressed concern that the bureaus strategic capabilities those that are central to guiding longterm systematic approach to national security issues have lagged the commission attributed this to the bureaus failure to carve out time for the its analysts in the field to do longterm strategic analysis according to the wmd commission the fbi currently publishes approx imately quarter as many longterm noncurrent analyti cal pieces as cia does in given year89 crs interviews indicated those figs visited have been disseminating substantially increased number of intelligence information reports iirs90 however there appears to be continued relative dearth of strategic analysisproduced according to the fbis statistics in the first eight months of fy2005 bureau analysts produced 5630 iirs and 80 strategic assessments there could be number of explanations for this one c ould argue that it is question of resources that only when the figs are fully staffed will individuals be allocated to the strategic analytical functions each field office handled the three analytical work functions differently for example some wanted analysts crosstrained in each of the three work roles and others had indivi dual analysts allocated to one of the three functions critics may contend that local fig management is not allocating sufficient resources to strategic analysis that is if focused strategic analysis is one of the core principals of fbi intelligence reform one could expect that some percentage of on board intelligence analysts should be dedi cated to that

is that the bureau has failed to adequately fund infrastructure support for its new analys ts if true this could pose longterm retention issues as new analysts scan very competitive environment for

decisionmaking implementation challenges including those in each area of the intelligence cycle congressional oversight and the adequacy of resources to support reforms the role of centralized decisionmaking in strengthening fbi intelligence111 some observers believe major issue is whether the fbis new centralized management structure will provide the organization with the requisite formal and informal authority to ensure that its intelligence priorities are implemented effectively and efficiently by fbi field ffices historically and particularly with respect to the fbis law enforcement activities field offices have had relatively high degree of autonomy to pursue locally determined prio rities related issue is whether fbi employees will embrace or resist fbi hea dquarters enhanced management role and its new emphasis on intelligence supporters contend centralized management will help prevent terrorism by improving fbis intelligence program supporters argue that centralized management structure is an essential ingredient of counterterrorism program because it will enable the fbi to strengthen its intelligence program establish intelligence as priority at fbi field

headquarters and 6 based on the recommendations of the wmd com mission and subsequent white house guidance created national s ecurity branch within the fbi that will integrate the fbis national security mission with the director of national intelligence and the intelligence community113 supporters contend that by centralizing decisionmaking the fbi will be able to address several critical weaknesses which the jic inquiry attributed to decentralized management first central management structure will enable the fbi to more easily correlate intelligence and thereby more accurately assess the presence of terrorists in the united states sec ond the fbi will be able to strengthen its analysis capabilities particularly with regard to strategic analysis which is intended to provide broader understa nding of terrorist threats and terrorist organization third fbi headquarters will be able to more effectivel fuse and share intelligence internally and with other ic agencies finally centralized decisionmaking will provide fbi headquarters means to enfo rce intelligence priorities in the field specifically it provides means for fbi h eadquarters to ensure that field agents spend less time gathering information to support criminal prosecutions legacy of the fbis law enforcement culture and more time collecting and analyzing intelligence that will help prevent terrorist acts supporters contend that em ployees are embracing centralized management and the fbis new intelligence priorities but caution it is premature to pronounce centralized management success rather they suggest that with careful planning the commitment of adequate resources and personnel and hard work prog ress should be well along in three or four years114 but concede that were long way from getting there115 skeptics agree strong intellig ence essential but question whether centralized decisi onmaking will improve program skeptics agree that if the fbi is to prevent terrorism it must strengthen

and in grained law enforcement culture and 2 overcome the fbis lack of intelligence experience and integration with the ic skeptics believe fbis law forcement culture will prove impervious to centra lized decisionmaking skeptics assert that the fbis entrenched law enforcement culture will under mine its effort to establish an effective and efficient intelligence program by centralizing decisionmaking at fbi headquarters they point to the histor ical importance that the fbi has placed on convicting criminals including terrorists but those convictions have come after the fact and skeptics argue that the fbi will continue to encounter opposition within its ranks to adopting more subtle nd somewhat unfamiliar intelligence methods designed to prevent terrorism former attorney general janet reno for example reportedly leaned toward closing down surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa if they hindered criminal cases116 one observer said law enforcement and intelligence dont fit law enforcement always wins117 some observers speculate that one reason law enforcement priorities prevail over those of intelligence is because convic tions that can disrupt terrorist planning in advance of an attack often are based on lesser charges such as immigration violations fbi field personnel therefore may conclude that they should focus more effort on prosecuting criminal cases that result in longer jail terms118 observers also suggest that because of the importance ttached to successful criminal prosecutions to the extent intelligence is used it will be used to support criminal investigations rather than to learn more about potential counterterrorism targets119 skeptics are convinced that the fbis law enforcement culture is too entrenched and resistant to change to be easily in fluenced by fbi headquarters directives emphasizing the importance of intelligence in preventing terrorism they cite the gilmore commission which concluded the bureaus longstanding traditional organizational culture persuades us that even with the best of intentions the fbi cannot soon be made over into an organization dedicated to detecting and preventing attacks rather than one dedicated to punishing them120httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs36 121 interview with former nior fbi official aug 21 2003skeptics also question whether centralized decision making can overcome fbis lack of intelligence experience skeptics assert that the fbis inexperience in the intelligence ar ea has caused it to misunderstand the role intelligence can play in preventing terrorism and they question whether centralized decisionmaking can correct this deficiency specifically they contend the fbi does not understand how to collect intelligence about potential counterterrorism ta rgets and properly analyze it instead skeptics argue that notwithstanding the fbis current efforts to develop detailed collection requirements fbi agents will likely continue to gather evidence to support criminal cases moreover skeptics argue the fbi will run faster and jump higher in gathering even more informa tion at the urging of fbi headquarters to improve intelligence121 missing however according to cr itics is the ability to implement successfully system in which intelligence is collected according to strategically determined set of collection requirements that specifically target operational clandestine activity these collection requirements in turn must be informed by strategic analysis that inte grates broader understanding of terrorist threats and known and conceptually unknown gaps in the fbis intelligence base critics fear that fbi analysts instead will continue to spend the bulk of their time providing tactical analytic support to fbi operational units pursuing cases rather than systematically and strategically analyzing allsource intelligence and fbi intelligence gaps implementation challenges the fbi is likely to confront significant challenges in implementing its reforms its most fundamental challeng some assert will be to transform the fbis deeply entrenched law enforcement culture and its emphasis on criminal convictions into culture that emphasizes the importance that intelligence plays in counterterrorism and counterintelligence although observers believe that fbi director mueller is identifying and communicating his counterte rrorism and intelligence priorities they caution that effective reform implementation will be the ultimate determinant of success the fbi they say must implement programs to recruit intelligence professionals with operational and analytical expertise structure formal career development paths including defined paths to promoti on and continue to improve information management nd technology these changes they say should be implemented in timely fash ion as several years have passed since the attacks of september 11 2001 they also contend th fbi must improve intelligence sharing within the fbi and with other ic agencies and with federal state and local agencies technology it is axiomatic that intelligence collected fails to have utility if it cannot be retrieved analyzed and shar ed with appropriate personnel in timely fashion while the fbis experience with the virtual case file vcf was resounding and well documented failure it has made progress in

ofessionals as indicated above the fbi has nearly doubled the size of its anal ytical cadre while substantially increasing the number of special agents dedicated to national security however with such rapid hiring and reallocation comes increasing infrastructure demands that the fbi was not arguably prepared for as ntioned above limited crs research suggests newly hired analysts in the field conti

transferred from program to program intelligence community integration bridging the foreigndomestic divide in the wake of the 911 terrorist attacks the distinction between us domestic and foreign

able and willing to support di rector muellers reforms critics argue that the lack of national security experience among the existing cadre of special agentsincharge sacs of the fbis field offices represents significant impediment to change according to one former senior fbi official over 90 of the sacs have very little national security experience126 he suggested that lack of understanding and experience woul d result in continued field emphasis on law enforcement rather than an intelligence approach to terrorism cases according to the wmd commission even now only nine of the heads of the fbis 56 field offices come from divisions ot her than the criminal division127 while it is arguable how much national security ex pertise senior level executive should have128 in todays complex threat environment leaders with an expertise in national security matters may prove the most useful supporters counter that dir ector mueller has made it cl ear that his priorities are intelligence and terrorism prevention so sacs who have been uncomfortable with the new priorities have chosen to retire but critics contend that it will require number of years of voluntary attrition before field

agenda cia and fbi reform june 6 2005 130 see us department of justice office of the inspector general evaluations and continuedan additional issue raised by some observers is the relatively brief tenure of fbi senior executives both in the field and at headquarters former attorney general richard thornburgh recently stated that th median tenure of special agent in charge is 15 months and the average nure of an senior ex ecutive service ses at headquarters is 13 months129 one could argue that given the longterm nature of implementing such significant cultural chan ge at the fbi there is need for leaders to remain in place for periods longer than 15 months intelligence cycle implementation in the field the essence of the intelligence cycle is that intelligence collectors analysts consumers and those setting intelligence collection requirements are all part of an integrated and holistic system the output of the cycle is onl as strong as its constitu ent elements moreover each stage of the cycle is accountable to the ot hers in nonlinear fashion that is for example the consumers are accountable to those drafting collection requirements because their feedback and view of global threats feed directly into the establishment of additional or refinement of existing intelligence requirements intelligence collectors are accountable to an alysts as analysts represent institutional global and strategic knowledge about partic ular threats and gaps in the ics intelligence base about these threats while the fbi has made some progress in certain elements of the intelligence cycle arguably it does not as yet have well developed system as outlined above crs research indicates that the figs do not as yet have the institutional power to task intelligence collection one supe rvisory special agent told crs the intelligence cycle remains an event for us not process impediments to implementing an effective and efficient intelligence cycle include among other factors the culture of the fbi wherein intelligence analysts particularly in the field may not be treated as equals observers di ffer as to whether they believe the fbi is capable of making these changes the optimistssynergists cite the fbis history of changing to meet the demands of the time and believe over time it will make the necessary changes to become proactive domestic intelligence and investigative agency skeptics believe that intelligence and law enforcement are different disciplines and should be sepa rated into different organi zations albeit with linkages built for analysis and relatively rare criminal prosecutions continued information sharing with state and local law enforcement one of the primary means by which the fbi shares information with state and local law enforcement agencies and officers are the fbi led joint terrorism task forces jttfs started in 1980 in new york city the jttfs have expanded to 103 jttfs in opera tion today recent

2005counterterrorism matters and pa rtly as result of unrealis tic perceptions of inherent intelligence limitations there have histor ically been occasional and mutual recriminations between some state and local law enforcement agencies and the fbi with respect to intelligence sharing options for congress numerous policy and budgetary options ar available to congress with respect to the fbis intelligence program these options range from the farreaching creating new domestic intelligence agency to more narrowly tailored adjustments to the fbis budget to enc ourage more rapid imp lementation of the existing fbi vision for intelligence reform the white house approval of the wmd commissions recommendation to establish national security service within the fbi leads to additional questions about the fbis organization for intelligence first and foremost will the creation of new structure tangibly affect the cultural changes that arguably need to made at the fbi131 for example will the figs now become empowered and more capable of managing and directing intelligence activities in the field because they now have at least an indirect reporting chain to the dni second as the national security service will be led by an ead or other senior fbi official what will be the status of the fbis existing ead positions for counterterrorismcounterintelligence and inte lligence third what exactly is the relationship between the dni and the leader of the national security service for example to what extent if at all will the dni be able to redirect fbi counterterrorism and counter intelligence operational and analytical resources at headquarters and in the field how will an disputes between the fbi director and the dni over resources within the national security service be resolved finally how will the national security service relate to and interact with the fbis criminal and cyber divisions the legislative options depend to some extent on which school of thought one finds most compelling not surprising ly skeptics will advocate more farreaching options and optimists will favor more narrowly targeted changes focused on implementation adherents to the skeptic s school of thought find problematic the argument that there is strong synergy between the intelligence and law enforcement disciplines moreover they believe the civil liberties argument for the fbi maintaining the domestic intelligence mission may have been weakened by pl 108httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs41 132 see pl 108458 1014 50 usc 403406 role of director of national intelligence in

enhanced authority over domestic intelligence through personnel and budgetary means132 if one is in the optimistsynergist camp one of the greatest threats to the fbis intelligence program may be undue turnover in leadership at the senior most levels of the fbi which could undermine the ins titutionalization of change close second in terms of threats to the reform efforts is attrition rates among intelligence professionals and the potential to lose substantial numbers of newly hired analysts the sheer magnitude of intelligence an alyst hiring from 1023 onboard in fy2001 to requested level of 2700 in fy2006 is of considerable concern given certain attrition factors and the apparent lack of welldeveloped internal training infrastructure to support such an in crease while congress has passed human resource retention measures to retain senior leadership and intelligence professionals it is not certain how successfully the fbi is implementing these measures possible legislative options fall into at least two broad categories structuralorganizational and budgetary structuralorganizational there are two broad options in this area 1 establish dom estic intelligence agency the pro and arguments for this option have been outlined in numerous reports and testimony before congressional committees and national commissions133 this option was rejected by both the 911 commission and the wmd commission however the wmd commission stated that we recommend that policymakers reevaluate the wisdom of creating separate agency an equivalent to the british mi5 dedicated to intelligence collection in the united states should there be continuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs42 134 see wmd commission p 468 135 for further discussion see crs report rl32336 fbi intelligence reform since september 11 2001 issues and options for congress by alfred cumming and todd masse 136 see fact sheet bush administration implements wmd commission recommendations white house fact sheet june 29 2005 137 among other initiatives this section of the law redesignated the fbis office of intelligence as the directorate of intelligencefailure to institute reforms necessary to transform the fbi into the intelligence organization it must become134 supporters argue that the establishment of separate agency could provide focus on the intelligence mission that hybrid agency such as the fbi with its dual law enforcement and intelligence missions cannot however according to skeptics tablishing new agency would present organizational challenges and unwisely decouple what they see as mutually reinforcing disciplines of law enforcement and intelligence 2 establish an integrated national security service135 within the fbi while the white house has appr oved key recommendation of the wmd commission to establish such service this acceptance was achieved through the issuance of white house memorandum the june 29 2005 white house fact sheet accompanying the memorandum of the sa date stated that the white house will work with congress on recomme ndations that require legislation136 it then states that one of the issues that requires legislation is the creation of new assistant attorney general for national security at the department of justice it does not state that it would be working with congress on legislation requiring the creation of the national security service within the fbi as result of being created via presidential memorandum the new service and its functions are not codified in law and therefore are subject to unilateral ch ange in the future congress may consider codification of the new organization with in the fbi to ensure its functions relationships and activities are explicitly specified in law because the fbis directorate of intelligence has now become part of the national security service under the new white house plan if congress agrees with the executive branch memorandum section 2002 of title ii of pl 108458137 may need to be amended to update its functions and reporting relationships within the national security service important factors in determining the breadth and efficacy of the position of director of the national security service include what the specific authorities of the ead for national security and his deputy are the relationships of the ead for national security and his deputy to the dni director fbi and attorney general and the extent to which the ead for national security and his deputy can engage constructively the 56 special agents in charge and empower the 56 figs potential areas for functional oversight three areas of potential interest to congress are fbicia cooperation terrorist funding and financial analysts and special agents in charge and figs as described belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs43 138 the budgetary authorities of the dni are strong est with respect to the nip element of the ic budget the dni only participates in the development by the secretary of defense of the annual budgets for the joint military intelligence program jmip and the tactical intelligence and related activities tiara it is possible that the administration could request of congress that the fbis budget for domestic intelligence be treated more in manner like that of the jmip and tiara progra ms with the attorney general for purposes of the fbis intelligence budget serving role si milar to that of the secretary of defense with respect to jmip and tiara1 fbicia cooperation with regard to reported continuing turf battles between the fbi and cia one approach would be to conduct aggressive oversight to ensure that the fbi and cia are coope rating in collecting intelligence overseas and domestically specially congress coul d review whether the memorandum of understanding reportedly ne gotiated between the fbi nd cia includes effective rules of the road that clearly ou tline each agencys intelligence collection responsibilities if congress determined the mou to be appropriate it might then monitor its implementation through the use of various oversight mechanisms including hearings and audits 2 terrorist funding nd financial analysts at time when increasing attention arguably should be focused on terrorist financing congress could assess whether the fbi is focusing adequate intelligence resources in this area among other issues it might review whet her the fbis figs possess an appropriate level of terrorist financial analytic capability financial analysts interviewed by crs at various field offices raised concerns about perceived car eer path inequities between the fbis financial analysts and intelligence analysts 3 special agents in charge and figs congress through its various oversight mechanisms could consider whether the special agents in charge of fbis field offices are devoting an appropriate vel of management attention to the figs it might also inquire whether the fb i has provided an ppropriate level of management attention at the assistant agent in charge level and consider whether the fbi should appoint an assistant special agent in charge asacs in each field office whose sole responsibility is intellig ence activities within each field office budget strategic issues and options with respect to the budget there are both strategic and tactical options the strategic options center on the harmonization of the nati onal intelligence program budget with the internal budgetary authorities of the di the tactical options concern budgetary tradeoffs within the existing fbi intelligence program some options are 1 consolidate all fbi intellig ence spending under the national intelligence program according to the wmd commission the eadi controlled only 4 of fbis spending on intelligence the wmd commission also concluded that if the fbis eadi does not directly control the national intelligence program resources within the fbi then the dnis influence over the fbis national intelligence program is tenuous which may be inconsistent with his stated budgetary authorities outlined in pl 108458138 the bulk of the bureaus spending on intelligence lies outside the eadis control residing principally in the counterterrorism and counterintelligen ce divisions the june 29 2005 whitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs44 139 see white house memorandum strengthening the ability of the department of justice to meet challenges to the security of the nation june 29 2005 140 there are three elements of the intelligen ce communitys budget 1 the nip 2 the joint military intelligence program jmip nd 3 the tactical intelligence and related activities tiara while the nip funds activ ities within and external to the department of defense dod jm ip and tiara only fund dod activities see crs report rs21945 the us intelligence budget basic overview by stephen daggetthouse memorandum stipulates that the atto rney general shall ensure that the fbis national security serv ices intelligence activities both at headquarters and in the field are funded through th national intelligence program139 this appears to be consistent with the more specific language outlined in title i section 102a2c of pl 108458 which provides the dnis authority to provide guidance develop and determine and present national intelligence program budget in related matter the internal structur of the fbis budget might also be more clearly delineated to specify the sum total of its intelligence spending currently the bottom line figure in the fbi budgets int elligence decision unit does not represent the total of fbi spending on intelligence related matters 2 congressional jurisdiction another possible strategic issue for the congress may be whether the fbis portion of the nip continues to be appropriated through existing subcommittees or in manner more consistent with the other elements of the ic budget140 which are funded by th defense appropriations subcommittees the bureaus intelligence program is authorized by the house and senate intelligence committees its intellig ence budget however is appropriated by the house appropriations subcommittee on scie nce department of state justice and commerce and related agencies and the senate appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice and science an estimated onethird of the fbis fy2006 budget request of 57 billion is for intellig encerelated activities consistency in congressional procedures for funding ements of the intelligence community however may not necessarily be compelling argument for change particularly if congressional oversight and support of the fbis intellig ence program is determined to be best served by existing arrangements budget tactical issues and options given the substantial increases in the fbi budget outlined above one central question that may be asked of experts is the extent to which additional resources are essential to the implementation of the fbis vision it may be unive rsally true that any executive agency can do more with more resources however it is also true that there are competing uses for existing resources given the steady fbi increases allocated to intelligence some may question whether an additional 500 intelligence analysts are truly necessary certain tradeoffs between more analytical staff nd infrastructure such as training and information technology to support thos bodies may be debated since not all observers fit neatly into the two school s of thought discussed above crs explores number of optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs45 1 fully fund the administrati ons fy2006 request for the fbi at 57 billion this request represents an 11 increase over fy2005 and would support 2945 counterterrorism agents and 2746 in telligence analysts an increase of 500 intelligence analysts to assist in the war on terrorism in order to allow the fbi maximum flexibility in allocating these resources to areas of greatest threat the appropriation would not be conditioned or tied to any intelligence reform milestones 2 encourage staff retention option 1 condition additional funding to measurable and conc rete personnel achievement s in intelligence reform particularly those measures dedicated to implementation of career paths intelligence professional performance apprai sals and staff retention for example one could fully fund salaries and expenses for additional special agents working yet tie the appropriation for 500 in telligence analysts to one or more of the following 1 ensuring that all analysts hired during the last three years at hq and in the field have taken the analytical cadre education st rategy1 course 2 the development of regional training programs modeled on those provided to other intelligence analysts in the intelligence community 3 the provision of all intelligence analysts with internet terminals on their desks 4 the demonstrated implementation of the expanded human resource authorities including exemptions from title 5 including the implementation of senior analytic service or senior intelligence service within the di for regional and functional intelligence andor terrorism threats yet not policy advisers 5 the implementation of new performance evaluation systems for special agents and intelligence analysts that focus on qualitative versus quantitative output and 6 the development of formal mechanisms to ensure that field intelligence collectors are responsive to filling intelligence gaps assigned to them by the figs if it chose conditional appr opriation of funds the subcommittee might establish reporting requirements for the fbi in whichever areas it adopted 3 encourage staff retention option 2 appropriate some funding level under the requested 500 intelligence anal ysts and require the remainder of the resources be dedicated to new personnel who would serve as 1 administrative assistants responsible for the nonanalytical functions many field inte lligence analysts are asked to perform periodically and 2 qualified fulltime instructors who would be dedicated to providing both new and ex perienced intelligence analysts with access to enhanced inhouse training as we ll as continued exposure to intelligence community and academic training programs while there may be an existing human resources formula for how many support personnel are necessary to support each newly hired special agent this formula likely preceded the current intelligence reform efforts in short congress could require that analysts not be diverted to non analytical taskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs46 141 see national security act of 1947 as ame nded 50 us code chapter 15 401a and eo 12333 34 142 ibid 143 see code of federal regulations part 23appendix 1

restrictions for discouraging domestic intelligence collection unless the fbi could clearly show that its collection was tied to specific alleged crime they also said the restrictions led the fbi to transfer responsibility for parts of its counterterrorism program fro m the fbis former intelligence division to its criminal division the result they c ontend was an anemic intelligence program that

fbi intelligence the fbis current intelligence reform is not its first twice before in 1998 and then again in 1999 the fbi embarked on almost identical efforts to establish intelligence as priority and to strengthen its intelligence program both attempts are considered by some to have been failures162 both previous attempts were driven by concerns that fbis intelligence effectiveness was being unde rcut by the fbis historically fragmented inte lligence program the fbis three operational divisions at the time criminal counterterrorism and counterintelligence each controlled its own intelligence program163 as result the fbi had trouble integrating its intelligence effort horizontally between its divisions in intelligence world parlance the programs were stovepiped in 1998 the fbi attempted to address the stove pipe problem by consolidating control over intelligence under the author ity of newly established office of intelligence it also took steps to impr ove the quality of its intelligence analysis particularly in the criminal area which was viewed as particularly weak dissatisfied with the results the fbi launched second round of reforms the following year aimed at more thoroughly integrating fbi intelligence analysis in support of investigations new inve stigative services division isd was established to replace the office of intellig ence and to house in one location all fbi analysts that until then had been owned by fbis operational divisions although the isd was intended to provide each of th divisions onest op shopping for their intelligence needs it was never accepted by the operational divisions which wanted to control their own intelligence analysis programs in the wake of 911 the fbi concluded that analysts would be more ffective if they were controlled by the operational divisions isd wa s abolished and analysts were dispersed back to the divisions in which they originally served although observers blame the failure of both prior reform efforts on several complex factors they put the fbis deeplyingrained law enforcement mentality at the top of the list as one observer described it efforts to integrate intelligence at the fbi were substantially hampered because resources dedicated to intelligence were gradually siphoned back to the fbis trad itional counter crime programs moreover there was also little sustained senior vel support for an intelligence function that was integrated with the ic164httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33033crs52 165 see comments of former fbi ead dale watson to richard clarke in richard clarke against
