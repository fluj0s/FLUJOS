of legisl ation that placed individual limits on members mail costs and required public disclosure of individual member franking expenditures1 these changes helped reduce overall congressional mail postage costs to 519 llion during the 109th congress 20052006 from 1774 million during the 101st congress 198719882 despite the significant reduction in costs critics c ontinue to raise concerns about the franking privilege3 in particular ma ss mailings franked mailings of 500 or more substantially similar pieces of unsolicited mail sent by individual members during the same session of congress4 have come under increased sc rutiny as critics argue that the vast majority of franked ma il is unsolicited and in eff ect publicly funded campaign literature5 since 1997 the house has publicly reported the volume and cost of individual member mass mailings this report provides an analysis of member mass mailings during the period 199720076 first it examines aggregate member mass mailing data to ascertain how many pieces of mass mail were sent by representatives annually the total cost of those mailings the proportion of ove rall mail costs that member mass ma ilings constituted and the annual pe rcentage of members who sent at least one mass mailing second quarterly mber mass mailing data is evaluated to see whether there was quarterly variation in member mass mailing volume and whether the variation reflected cyclical trends finally the question of whether mass mailing volume was higher in election years than in nonelection years is consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34458crs2 methodology data collection data on member mass mailings were compiled using the quarterly statements of disbursement of the house which report the number of pieces of mail sent by each member of the house in mass mailings during the preceding quarter and the total postage cost of the quarters mass mailings the unit of analysis is the mail statistic for each members office therefore any congress might contain more or fewer than the ty pical 440 members due to vacancies or to members elected in special elections to fill vacancies summary statistics mass mailing data were examined for 44 consecutive quarters from the first quarter of calenda r year cy 1997 through the fourth quarter of cy2007 the universe of data incl udes 38968 observations half

pieces of mass mail costing an average of 181 million per year the total number of ma ss mail pieces sent by the house has ranged from low of 98 million pieces in 2007 to high of 1226 million in 1997

an eightquarter cyclical pattern over the past 10 years corresponding to the twoyear cycle of each congress if the timing of mass mailing was evenly distributed one would expect 125 of total mass mailing to have occurred in each of the eight quarters of each congress as shown in figure 2 that is not the case significant peaks and valleys occur in quarterly mass mailing house member mass mail

occurs in the fourth quarter of the first year when 247 of all pieces of mass mail are sent although mass mailing data is not available by mont h monthly data on overall official mail costs indicate that almost all of the fourth quarter spike is due to large amount of mail sent in december at the end of the first session source crs analysis of mass mail data increased mailings in the second and third quarters 155 and 150 of the total of the second year of each congress corresponds to the period just prior to the 90day preelection prohibite d period in which members are not allowed to send mass mailings in partic ular mass mail sent in the thir d quarter of the second year of any congress julyseptember must be sent during the first month of the quarter prior to the beginning of the prohibited period in early august thus the above average third quarter mass mailing totals for evennumbered years somewhat understate the increased rate of mailing prior to the electi on all third

election vs nonelection year critics of the franking privilege have often cited increased electionyear mail costs as evidence of political use of the frank prior to elections7 although mass mail costs do rise in the quarters prior to th preelection prohibite d period as shown in figure 2 the structure of the fiscal calendar is also important in creating large disparities between electionyear and

table 2 when mass mailings are compared by fiscal year both the december spike and the preelection increase are in the same year so the data show inflated electionyear numbers and s uppressed nonelectionyear numbers when annual data are compared by calendar year the december spike and the preelection increase balance out and the totals are relatively similar thus comparisons of fiscal year

different calendar years and different sessions of congress discussion critics of the franking privilege have generally articulated two concerns first the franking privilege is fina ncially wasteful and second the franking privilege gives unfair advantages to incumben ts in congressional elections8 in particular mass mailings have come under increased scrutiny during the past 20 years as critics argue that the vast majority of franked mail is unsolicited and in ffect public ly funded campaign literature9 critics note that incumbent house members may spend as much on franked mail in year as challenger spends on his or her entire campaign10 proponents of the franking privilege ar gue that the frank allows members to fulfill their representational duties by providing for greater communication between the member and individual constituents11 proponents of the franking privilege also argue that representative accountability is nhanced by use of the frank by regularly maintaining direct communication with their constituents members provide citizens with information by which they can consider current public policy issues as well as information on policy positions by which voters can judge member in future elections12 it is maintained that if legislative matters could not be easily transmitted to constituents free of charge most members could not afford to pay for direct communications with their constituents13 the analysis presented here offers thr ee contributions to this debate first it finds that substantial percentage of the total cost of franked mail in the house of representatives is member mass mailings on average accounting for 87 of all official mail postage costs in the hous between 1997 and 2007 at an average cost of 181 million per year the analysis also fi nds that most representatives make use of mass mailings to communicate with thei r constituents with an annual average of 84 of members sending at least one mass mail during the period 19972007 second the analysis finds significant nd regular quarterly variation in member mass mailing with the total number of pieces sent by members following an eight quarter pattern that corresponds to the two year cycle of each congress the analysis shows two peaks in mailings the first during the last quarter of the first session ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34458crs7 congress and the second during the two quart ers prior to the preelection prohibition on member mass mailings these findings provide insight regardin g concerns about electionyear mass mailing expenditures alt hough they confirm that members send more pieces of mass mail in the quarters just prior to the biennial elections the findings also show that mass mailing peaks twice and the larger p eak takes place not prior to the election but at the end of the first session these findings also suggest that previ ous comparisons of electionyear and non electionyear franked mail data may need to be considered when mass mailings are compared by fiscal year both the first session spike and the preelection increase are in the same year so the data show infl ated electionyear numbers and suppressed nonelectionyear numbers thus comparisons of fiscal year official mail costs tend to overstate the effect of preelection incr eases in mail costs since they also capture the effect of the december spike in mail costs
