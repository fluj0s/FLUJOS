specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra summary summary this report summarizes the emergency planning and community rightto know act epcra and the major regulatory programs that mandate reporting by industrial facilities of releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment as well as local planning to respond in the event of significant accidental releases the text is excerpted with minor modifications from the corresponding chapter of crs report rl30798 environmental laws summaries of statutes administered by the environmental protection agency which summarizes 12 major environmental statutes this report will be updated at the beginning of the first session of each new congress or sooner if congress enacts law that substantively changes the statute the emergency planning and community righttoknow act 42 usc 1100111050 was enacted in 1986 as title iii of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act pl 99499 in subtitle epcra established national framework for epa to mobilize local government officials businesses and other citizens to plan ahead for chemical accidents in their communities epcra required each state to create state emergency response commission serc to designate emergency planning districts and to establish local emergency planning committees lepcs for each district epa is required to list extremely hazardous substances and to establish threshold planning quantities for each substance the law directs each facility to notify the lepc for its district if it stores or uses any extremely hazardous substance in excess of its threshold planning quantity lepcs are to work with such facilities to develop response procedures evacuation plans and training programs for people who will be the first to respond in the event of an accident epcra requires that facilities immediately report sudden release of any hazardous substance that exceeds the reportable quantity to appropriate state local and federal officials subtitle b directs covered facilities annually to submit information about the chemicals that they have present to the lepc serc and local fire department in addition manufacturers and other facilities designated by epa must estimate and report to epa annually on releases from their facilities of certain toxic chemicals to the land air or water epa must compile that data into computerized database known as the toxics release inventory tri generally all information about chemicals that is required to be reported to lepcs sercs or epa is made available to the general public but epcra authorizes reporting facilities to withhold the identity of chemical if it is trade secret citizens are given the authority to bring civil action against facility epa governor or an serc for failure to implement epcra requirements contents introduction 1 overview 1 subtitle emergency planning and notification 1 subtitle b reporting requirements

table 1 major us code sections emergency planning and community righttoknow act 6 the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra summary introduction the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra establishes requirements and framework to ensure that the us environmental protection agency epa state and local governments and the private sector will work together to control and if necessary respond to releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment this report describes key provisions of epcra in addition it provides several references for more detailed information about the act and table that crossreferences sections of the us code with corresponding sections of the act the report highlights key provisions rather than providing comprehensive inventory of the acts numerous sections and addresses authorities and limitations imposed by the statute rather than the status of implementation or other policy issues overview the sudden accidental release in december 1984 of methyl isocyanate in an industrial incident at the union carbide plant in bhopal india and the attendant loss of thousands of lives and widespread injuries motivated many in congress to support legislation to reduce the risk of chemical accidents in the united states the emergency planning and community righttoknow act 42 usc 1100111050 was enacted in 1986 as title iii of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act pl 99499 epcra established state commissions and local committees to develop and implement procedures for coping with releases of hazardous chemicals and mandated annual reporting to government officials on environmental releases of such chemicals by the facilities that manufacture or use them in significant amounts epa facilitates planning enforces compliance when necessary and provides public access to information about environmental releases of toxic chemicals subtitle emergency planning and notification epcra established national framework for epa to mobilize local government officials businesses and other citizens to plan ahead for possible chemical accidents in their communities subtitle requires local planning to respond to sudden releases of chemicals that might occur in the event of spill explosion or fire it is intended to ensure that responsible officials will know what hazardous chemicals are used or stored by local businesses and will be notified quickly in the event of an accident under section 301 each state is required to create state emergency response commission serc to designate emergency planning districts and to establish crs2 local emergency planning committees lepcs for each district section 302 requires epa to list extremely hazardous substances and to establish threshold planning quantities for each substance originally congress defined chemicals as extremely hazardous substances if they appeared on list epa published in november 1985 as appendix in chemical emergency preparedness program interim guidance however epa has authority to revise the list and the threshold quantities of chemicals based on listing criteria the intent appears to be to include only chemicals in quantities that could harm people exposed to them for only short period of time the law directs each facility to notify the lepc for its district if it stores or uses any extremely hazardous substance in excess of its threshold planning quantity section 303 directs lepcs to work with facilities handling specified extremely hazardous substances to develop response procedures evacuation plans and training programs for people who will be the first to respond in the event of an accident upon request facility owners and operators are required to provide an lepc with any additional information that it finds necessary to develop or implement an emergency plan section 304 requires that facilities immediately report sudden release of any extremely hazardous substance or any hazardous substance much broader category of chemicals defined under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla that exceeds the reportable quantity to state local and federal officials1 releases of hazardous substance also must be reported to the national response center under cercla for more on cercla see crs report rl30798 environmental laws summaries of statutes administered by the environmental protection agency epa which includes summary of cercla subtitle b reporting requirements subtitle b establishes various reporting requirements for facilities the information collected may be used to develop and implement emergency plans as well as to provide the public with general information about chemicals to which they may be exposed the occupational health and safety act of 1970 oshact requires most employers to provide employees with access to material safety data sheet msds for any hazardous chemical this righttoknow law for workers aims to ensure that people potentially exposed to such chemicals have access to information about the potential health effects of exposure and how to avoid them epcra section 311 requires facilities covered by oshact to submit an msds for each hazardous chemical or list of such chemicals to the lepc the serc and the local fire department epa has authority to establish categories of health and physical hazards 1 under cercla section 102a hazardous substance includes any elements compounds mixtures solutions and substances which when released into the environment may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment included in this definition are substances listed under the authority of any of the major environmental statutes see cercla section 10114 crs3 and to require facilities to list hazardous chemicals grouped by such categories in their reports an msds need only be submitted once unless there is significant change in the information it contains an msds must be provided in response to request by an lepc or member of the public the occupational safety and health administration has defined hazardous chemicals in the code of federal regulations title 29 at section 19101200c2 epcra section 312 requires the same employers to submit annually an emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form to the lepc serc and local fire department these forms must provide estimates of the maximum amount of the chemicals present at the facility at any time during the preceding year estimates of the average daily amount of chemicals present and the general location of the chemicals in the facility3 information must be provided to the public in response to written request epa is authorized to establish threshold quantities for chemicals below which facilities are not required to report section 313 mandates development of the toxic release inventory tri computerized epa database of toxic chemical releases to the environment by manufacturing facilities4 it requires manufacturing facilities that manufacture use or process toxic chemicals to report annually to epa on the amounts of each chemical released to each environmental medium air land or water or transferred offsite epa makes tri data available in raw and summarized forms to the general public the public may obtain specific information eg about particular manufacturing facility by submitting request in writing to epa epa distributes written and electronic nationwide and statebystate summaries of annual data raw data and summaries also are available on the epa and other websites5 epcra section 313 generally requires report to epa and the state from each manufacturer with 10 or more employees and who either uses 10000 pounds or manufactures or processes 25000 pounds of any toxic chemical during the 2 epcra does not cover foods food additives or other substances regulated by the food and drug administration solids in manufactured item to the extent exposure to people or the environment does not occur substances used for personal or household purposes substances used in research or hospitals or substances used in routine agricultural operations 3 epcra allows facilities to report aggregate amounts of chemicals with similar health and environmental effects this is called tier i information however chemicalspecific information tier ii must be provided on request under certain conditions to an serc lepc fire department or the public 4 toxic chemicals are substances that may sicken people who are exposed to them in relatively small amounts by eating drinking or breathing or through skin absorption the term hazardous substance is broader including toxic chemicals but also substances that are explosive flammable corrosive or otherwise harmful 5 see for example epas envirofacts toxnet operated by the national library of medicine or righttoknow net provided by omb watch respectively

however epa may adjust and has adjusted in the past these thresholds for classes of chemicals or categories of facilities epcra enumerates the following data reporting requirements for each covered chemical present at each covered facility6 whether it is manufactured processed or otherwise used and the general category of use the maximum amount present at each location during the previous year treatment or disposal methods used and amount released to the environment or transferred offsite for treatment or disposal epcra requires reporting by manufacturers which the law defines as facilities in standard industrial classification codes 20 through 397 the law authorized epa to expand reporting requirements to additional industries epa promulgated rule may 1 1997 requiring reports on toxic releases from seven additional industrial categories including some metal mining coal mining commercial electric utilities petroleum bulk terminals chemical wholesalers and solvent recovery facilities 62 federal register 238348 the original statute specified 313 toxic chemicals or categories of chemicals for which reporting was required but epcra gave epa authority to add or delete chemicals from the list either on its own initiative or in response to citizen petitions epa has removed more than 15 and added roughly 350 chemicals or categories to the original list the listing criteria specified in section 313d2 authorize epa to add chemical when it is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as result of continuous or frequently recurring releases in humans cancer birth defects or serious or irreversible chronic health effects or because of i its toxicity ii its toxicity and persistence in the environment or iii its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the 6 congress added data submission requirements for manufacturers and processors of toxic substances when it enacted the pollution prevention act of 1990 7 standard industrial codes were changed to north american industry classification system codes on march 21 2003
