this section is william d jackson specialist in financial institutions government and finance divisionfinancial institutions and markets1 major federal statutes background2 the history of federal legislation significantly affecting banking securities capital markets and financia l services in general may conveniently be divided into three chronological periods civil war to new deal new deal era and 1956 to the present examination of these laws reveals that the increasing role of the federal government in overseeing and protecting financial services has been primarily in response to turmoil or fina ncial distress in the economy for example landmark legislation brought greater federal presence into the financial arena to moderate the financial stress and dversity of the civil war the financial panic of 1907 the great depression of the 1930s and th savings and loan crisis of the 1980s much of this legislation persists albeit in amended form and can be viewed as the foundation of the structure under which the financia l services industry operates today prenew deal legislation set up basic continuing entities including the national banking system th federal reserve syste m and in 1932 the federal home loan bank system new deal era legi slation is probably most striking for its rigid separation of banking securities and insurance businesses and for setting up major parts of the federal financial safety net particularly deposit insurance more recent legislation has permitted reintegrati on of these functions allowing firms to compete across political boundaries and in nontraditional busine sses the overall aim has been to produce more level competitive playing field and continue to maintain safety the effect has been generally to produce an increasingly more uniform structure of us financial providers especially in the last two decades laws have progressively deregulated ne w deal or earlier controls over geography pricing and products of ba nking and financial services providers the growing complexities of financial transactions have prompted financial services companies to maintain data ba ses containing large amounts of information on their individual customers raising potential for improper us this has prompted increasing federal regulation of customer fi nancial information to prot ect customer privacy deter criminal activity and in the interest of national securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32672crs2 the laws cited are those chosen for thei r historical significance their present importance in the federal scheme of regulating
