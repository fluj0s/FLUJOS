tosbornueaacuk mannvirginiaedu hi ellen im still travelling and have only intermittent email access im pretty sure phil is travelling now too so im hoping keith or tim can help out here i think we actually discussed two small changes from the final version phil sent you this involved adding malcolm hughes as coauthor his name was accidentally left off the list and changing the wording of one sentence slightly i believe that tim and keith have these changes and hopefully they can submit this via gems if not will have to wait until phil or i have solid internet connection to do this that will likely be at iugg in sapporo in about 2 weeks thanks for bringing this to our attention philif youre reading email any way you can help out here thanks all mike at 0436 pm 6232003 0400 ellen mosleythompson wrote phil i just learned from agu that you did not submit the revised version back to agu via the gems system can you or mike do this as soon as possible i would like to get this paper moving through agu fred spilhaus still has to approve it he approves all forum pieces so this adds layer that will cost us time thanks ellen ps i have copied everyone who might be able to handle this in your and mikes absence thanks at 0513 pm 06202003 0100 you wrote dear ellen im off on sunday but ive managed to get the revisions done the revised pdf is attached this contains reduced size manuscript by about 10 lines and weve reduced the references to the absolute minimum this is still 30 if we go any lower we have to change the figures as we are commenting on paper we need to specifically reference all the series we use thanks for going through so quickly if further changes are required i wont be here so can you email either keith briffa or tim osborn kbriffaueaacuk tosbornueaacuk i will ask keith and tim to get the copyright forms rolling cheers phil at 1350 180603 0400 eosaguorg wrote dear dr mann copy to phil jones i am pleased to accept on past temperatures and anomalous late20th century warmth for publication in eos with the provision that in your final submission you modify to the first paragraph slightly so that it is fully consistent with the text of the agu statement on climate change and greenhouse gases 1httpwwwaguorgsci_socpolicyclimate_change_positionhtml note that first sentence of your paper indicates that the agu statement includes the inference that there is high probability i cannot find the words high probability in the agu statement unlike ipcc that does state high probability it is critical that the introductory paragraph is carefully constructed so as not to diminish any of the points you make in the forum piece i suggest modification of your first paragraph please feel free to further modify this evidence from gases that there is compelling basis for concern over future climate changes including increases in global mean surface temperatures due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases primarily from fossil fuel burning if this is too long you might wish to break it into two sentences this says the same thing as your original intro sentence but is fully consistent with the text of the agu statement also in the first paragraph would you agree to this change such anomalous warm cannot be fully explained natural factors added the word fully to indicate that some but not all of the anomalous warming can be explained by natural factors another suggestion is to remove the second reference to the agu policy second paragraph what about these claims in light of the fact that they have the content of the forum piece is just fine but i did find few minor problems that you need to fix in the final submission 1 3rd paragraph line 8 reference to jones et 1998 this date occurs in several places in the paper and should be jones et 1999 eg point 2 line 3 2 page 2 the second 2 point last 3 lines remove double period after us also that sentence reads awkwardly try comma after the word cancelling 3 the second paragraph of point 2 2 last three lines this is awkward the word apparent is out of place i think this should this read apparent coldness and warmth differ 4 point 3 last line of first paragraph change insight to remove in from into 5 references the jones et 1999 reference is formatted differently than the rest put date at end finally everywhere throughout the text et should be corrected to et the period is consistently absent before publication your article will be edited to reflect the eos newspaper style including possible change in the headline we will send the edited version to you for review and final approval before the article is published please note that before we can proceed with production work on your submission copyright transfer agreement and reprint order form must be completed and returned to agu these forms may be printed from the agu web site 2httpwwwaguorgpubsjournal_formseoscopyrightpdf 3httpwwwaguorgpubsjournal_formseosreprint_orderspdf for
