is not regulation and does not have the force of law13 however it is used to guide the actions of ssa employees unlike the definition of fugitive felon found in the statute or in implementing regulations the ssas poms guidance specifically states that person is considered fugitive solely on the basis of an outstanding warrant without any consideration of whether the person is actually fleeing or attempting to avoid being captured for the purposes of suspending ssi benefits poms states that the warrant does not have to state that the individual is fleeing for the suspension to apply 14 for the purposes of suspending ssdi or oasi benefits poms states that the person does not have to be actively hiding or evading the law in any way for these provisions to apply the existence of the unsatisfied warrant is the only criterion necessary15 g15g146g157g146g144g138g157g146g151g144g561g5g146g155g140g158g150g156g157g138g151g140g142g156g561 the social security protection act of 2004 pl 108203 gives the ssa commissioner limited ability to pay benefits to fugitive felons if in her opinion mitigating circumstances should be considered however mitigating circumstances can be used only to pay benefits to fugitive felon if the felony offense that is the basis for the warrant is both nonviolent and not related to violation of the drug laws 16 cases involving violent crimes or felonies resulting from the use sale or manufacture of illegal drugs are not eligible for the mitigating circumstances exception under circumstances can fugitive felon with an active outstanding warrant for

effective january 1 2005 with the passage of the social security protection act of 2004 pl 108203 in its report on the bill the house committee on ways and means explained that prohibiting fugitive felons from receiving ssdi and oasi benefits was intended to help stop fraud waste and abuse in these programs in addition the committee expressed concern that ssdi and oasi benefits were being used to aid fugitive felons in their flights from prosecution or punishment 18 in its report on the bill the senate committee on finance explained that the fugitive felon provision should only apply if law enforcement agency is actively pursuing the person the committee stated that this instruction which is not explicitly mentioned in the law as enacted was intended to prevent the ssa from becoming the law enforcement agency of last resort for people who may have committed crimes but whom local or state law enforcement is longer interested in pursuing the committee cited that it was aware of numerous cases in which law enforcement agencies chose not to pursue individuals identified as having open warrants through the enforcement of the existing ssi fugitive felon rules 19

his knowledge of the pending charges was deemed irrelevant to his suspension of benefits on appeal fowlkes argued that he was not fugitive felon ineligible for ssi benefits under 42 usc 1382e4a because the statutory language requires he have an intention to flee which fowlkes argued he lacked prior to march 2000 because he was unaware of the indictments against him in virginia and which fowlkes argued he lacked after march 2000 when he became aware of the indictments because he was financially unable to return to the charging state in addition fowlkes argued that the ssa regulations require court order finding that fowlkes was fleeing felon before the ssa can suspend benefits and that such court order existed in his case the circuit court held that the ssas interpretation of the statute embodied in poms was in direct conflict with the plain language of the statute and its implementing regulations the court stated as follows the statute does not permit the commissioner to conclude simply from the fact that there is an outstanding warrant for persons arrest that he is fleeing to avoid prosecution 42 usc 1382e4a fleeing in 1382e4a is understood to mean the conscious evasion of arrest or prosecution see blacks law dictionary 670 8 th ed 2004 defining flight as the act or an instance of fleeing esp to evade arrest or prosecution thus there must be some evidence that the person knows his apprehension is sought the statutes use of the words to avoid prosecution confirms that for flight to result in suspension of benefits it must be undertaken with specific intent ie to avoid prosecution 22 thus the court found the ssas implementing regulation to be consistent with the statutory requirements because the regulation includes requirement of finding of intentional flight indeed the court posited that the regulation may be stricter than the statute insofar as it provides that the effective date of benefits suspension is the date of issuance of warrant or order issued by court or other authorized tribunal on the basis of finding that an individual fled or was fleeing from justice thus the regulation does not permit the agency to make finding of flight rather it demands court or other appropriate tribunal to have issued warrant or order based on finding of flight 23 the court found that the poms passages cited by the commissioner were in direct conflict with the regulation in that they contemplate suspension of benefits without any finding of flight by court or other tribunal the court held that benefits may be suspended only as of the date of warrant or order issued by court or other authorized tribunal on the basis of finding that person was fleeing or had fled from justice the circuit court remanded the fowlkes case back to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the courts holding that the ssa is only permitted to suspend benefits because of persons fugitive felon status as of the date that warrant or court order finding that person has fled or is fleeing from justice was issued g21g21g3g514g156g561g3g140g154g158g146g142g156g140g142g151g140g142g561g20g158g149g146g151g144g561 on april 6 2006 the ssa

benefits this acquiescence ruling will apply to all administrative determinations or decisions by the ssa involving title ii and title xvi applicants title ii beneficiaries and title xvi recipients who live in states within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals for the second circuit ie connecticut new york and vermont the acquiescence ruling went into effect on april 6 2006 however it can be applied retroactively to the date of the courts decision in fowlkes december 6 2005 if beneficiary or recipient can demonstrate that the application of the acquiescence ruling would have changed the outcome of his or her case within the states affected by the fowlkes decision the ssa will longer rely solely on the existence of an outstanding warrant to determine the fugitive status of beneficiary rather before making determination that an individual is fleeing to avoid prosecution and thus is fugitive felon the ssa must have evidence that the individual knows that there is an outstanding felony arrest warrant and the outstanding arrest warrant must have been issued on the basis that the individual has fled or is fleeing from justice 25 however in all other parts of the country the ssa will continue its policy of suspending benefits based solely on the existence of warrant without any consideration of whether the person is actually fleeing or attempting to avoid being captured as set forth in poms guidance26 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 scott szymendera analyst in disability policy sszymenderacrslocgov
