divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31017the barcelona process the european unions partnership with the southern mediterranean summary the european union eu has identified the mediterranean med region as key external relations priority eu policy towards the region is governed by the comprehensive euromediterranean partnership initiative launched at the 1995 barcelona conferen ce between the eu and the 12 mediterranean partners the barcelona process entails new broader and more farreaching agenda of cooperation with the noneu mediterranean countries including the creation of euromed free trade area to be established by 2010 the barcelona agreement contains three chapters of cooperation the political and security chapter the economic and financial chapter and the social cultural and human chapter many view the economic element of the agreement as the most important one the core of economic cooperation is the establishment of region wide free trade area which will serve to enhance economic development by expanding bilateral support and trade the barcelona process is complementary to but separate from the middle east peace process and as such has managed to serve as forum for the participating countries despite the ups and downs in regional relations since the outbreak of the alaqsa intifadah in september 2000 and the breakdown of israelisyrian talks earlier in the year the barcelona process is facing serious challenges and some arab countries chose to boycott the november 2000 euromediterranean summit in marseilles refusing to participate in cooperative forum including israel the process nevertheless remains the only multilateral forum outside the united nations where all the parties to the conflict meet important benefits have been predicted for many of the mediterranean cooperation partners the partnership is intended for instance to encourage foreign investment and in the long run promote income convergenc as well as political stability and security however some analysts fear the potentially negative effects of opening up to european exports on weaker and less competitive med industries and the effects of the loss of government revenue which could result from significant reductions in tariffs moreover some fear that economic liberalization tends to increase pressure on the physical environment as trade and investment expand in order to avoid important adverse effects on the environment some advocate supporting institutional framework in order to take advantage of the opportunities for improvement while also dealing with potential threats to the environment this report also provides brief discussion of how the barcelona process relates to the middle east peace process as well as to other us interests for further information on

european unions partnership with the southern mediterranean the political context of the barcelona process background and motivations in 1995 the european union eu initiated the barcelona process of cooperation with 12 southern mediterranean noneu member countries med countries thereby superceding previous phases of cooperation1 the first period of the euromed relationship 195879 was characterize d as an emerging relationship the focus of which was the free entry of manufactured goods into european community ec2 markets during the subsequent period from the late 1970s to the mid1990s most mediterranean countries negotiated cooperation agreements with the ec eventually there was recognition of the need to broaden the basis of cooperation in order to tackle issues of common concern and this led to the development of the barcelona declaration the policy objectives of the barcelona declaration are to develop common area of peace and stability zone of shared prosperity free trade area and rapprochement between peoples and cultures3 as compared to the eus previous mediterranean policy the proximity policy launched by the barcelona declaration is innovative in three respects it represents comprehensive policy of cooperation between equal partners with ambitious long term goals such as respect for human rights and democracy as well as political security social cultural and human cooperation it furthermore introduces regional cooperation aimed at encouraging economic integration among the med countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31017crs2 4 the euromediterranean partnership

countries the barcelona process is advantageous insofar as it provides assistance in economic modernization and liberalization eumed cooperation is intended to promote reforms aimed at modernizing economies raising the level of economic infrastructure promoting private investment and creating employment opportunities according to one observer cooperation with the eu offered through the barcelona process is seen by the med countries as an opportunity to penetrate the eu market under more favorable conditions than would otherwise have been available specifically as the eu now increasingly focuses its attention towards the east in anticipation of enlargement5 the med countries furthermore view eumed cooperation as significant chance to upgrade their economies and carry out various reforms with the financial support of the eu it also provides chance to create an environment conducive to trade and investment while strengthening political stability and regional integration and cooperation6 according to one economist the med countries committed to the barcelona agreement because ultimately it represented the best and possibly only attractive choice for their small open economies in the rapidly changing world of globalization7 it should be noted that the 12 med countries differ considerably in their levels of advancement in the cooperation process turkey malta and cyprus for instance all have candidate eu member status and therefore also have access to eu assistance through the preaccession process the other med countries are not likely to become members of the european union and the barcelona process is therefore their primary means of cooperation with the eu for the eu there are several important political and economic goals of cooperation with the mediterranean countries eu countries believe it is important to send signals to the med partner countries that they remain important to europe even as the eu prepares for enlargement to the east8 supporting processes towards good governance democratization rule of law and respect for human rights in the southern mediterranean are important objectives of eu cooperation furthermore controlling immigration drugs and crime are other important goals of common efforts the barcelona agreement moreover recognizes the interdependence of the eu and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31017crs3 9 the eus

and technical support to economic development the euromediterranean partnership is currently the only multilateral forum outside the united nations where all the parties to the middle east conflict meet9 the barcelona process is separate from the peace process but designed as complemen tary instrument which will facilitate regional dialogue one of the instruments of this process the charter for peace and stability elaborated by senior officials of the 27 partners dealing with political and security matters is aimed at contributing to peace and stability in the region through partnershipbuilding and confidencebuilding measures and thus also give the eu lasting political role in this conflict area10 the three components of cooperation the barcelona declaration has three main fields or chapters of activity the political and security chapter the economic and financial chapter and the social cultural and human chapter by combining all three chapters into one comprehensive policy the barcelona process acknowledges that financial economic cultural and security issues cannot be effectively tackled separately political and security cooperation this chapter of the barcelona declaration consists of three parts political dialogue on the bilateral as well as the regional level partnershipbuilding measures and the charter for peace and stability political and security cooperation is central to the euromed partnership providing new forum for conflict resolution the overall aim of this chapter of cooperation is to create an area of peace and stability based on the principles of human rights and democracy the barcelona process is not an instrument for military cooperation however it provides forum for the creation of tools which will be necessary for the construction of future euromediterranean security regime the preparation of such toolbox would represent confidencebuilding effort within the euromed context11 furthermore the prospect of regular meetings between signatory governments such as israel and syria is viewed by most observers as potentially important if such meetings could be arranged it is difficult in the current context

and information seminars for euromediterranean diplomats cooperation among civil protection authorities on natural and manmade disasters and bilateral and regional projects for promoting human rights and democracy in the mediterranean region economic and financial cooperation this chapter contains three interrelated objectives establishing euro mediterranean free trade area fta supporting economic transition and helping med partners meet the challenges posed by economic liberalization and enabling an increase in investment flows to the mediterranean partners through economic liberalization and integration the process of liberalization will essentially entail the opening of med markets to eu goods as the eu already accords duty free access to most med manufactured goods the process of liberalization requires the gradual removal of all tariff and nontariff barriers to trade in manufactured goods by 2010 trade in agricultural goods will be progressively liberalized through reciprocal preferential access for discussion of med agricultural exports to europe see below the priority sectors of economic and financial cooperation include among others industrial cooperation holding conferences on the environment energy and transportation as well as addressing the problem of scarce water resources social cultural and human cooperation the social and cultural partnership aims to improve mutual understanding among the peoples of the region and develop free and flourishing civil society by means of exchange develop ment of human resources and the support of civil societies and social development12 it is part of european commission initiative to encourage the creation of nongovernmental networks linking the northern and southern shores of the mediterranean together as series of confidencebuilding measures the cornerstone of such efforts is increased cooperation with civil society certain med governments have felt threatened by these attempts to activate civil society but the provisions built into the barcelona declaration and the individual association agreements formally oblige them to accept such cooperation efforts cooperation in this area includes programs for the preservation of the euro mediterranean cultural heritage supporting projects in the fields of television radio and cinema as well as bringing together youths from across the mediterran ean in order to advance mutual understanding and cohesionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31017crs5 13 ghesquiere p 5 14 evaluation of aspects of eu development aid to the med region final synthesis report p 6economic and

economic area the core of which will be regionwi free trade area covering most industrial products13 it aims at enhancing economic development by expanding bilateral support and trade the new association agreements set up bilateral industrial free trade between the eu and its partner countries around the mediterranean the eumed association agreements emaas an essential feature of the implementation of the eumed partnership are gradually replacing the 1970s cooperation agreements the emaas establish conditions for progressive liberalization of trade in goods services and capital and are designed to prepare the countries for the 2010 world trade organization wto compatible free trade area in industrial goods14 they also provide for financial support to mitigate some of the adverse effects of economic liberalization many analysts view free trade as catalyst that will help bring about necessary but difficult reforms in the business environment of the med countries the association agreements are part of strategy to encourage signatories to abolish trade barriers and adopt common rules and procedures for trading and conducting business among themselves while the free trade agreements prepare the ground for increased northsouth trade the biggest challenge for eu support efforts will be to encourage southsouth integration the eu thus also promotes the establishment

improved resource allocation harmonization of trade related regulations along with increased assistance from the eu could enhance prosperity and employment15 the agreement is also expected to encourage foreign investmen t over the long run it is hoped that the euromed free trade area will promote income convergence and ensure political stability and security on the other hand sceptics fear that the elimination of trade barriers to european exports will have considerable adverse effects on the weaker and less competitive mediterranean industries16 significant tariff reductions it is also feared will cause considerable loss of revenue for many of the med countries moreover the failure thus far to grant access to mediterranean agricultural exports into the european market may dampen

integration into the global economy will entail significant burden on local economies for instance the eutunisia association agreement calls for the modernization of some 4000 tunisian industries by

represent one example of meda funded projects agriculture is an important sector both socially and economically for many countries around the southern mediterranean employing large segments of the

manufactured goods limits have been imposed so as to ensure med crops do not compete with european production thus forcing farmers who wish to profit from the eu market to choose crops which may not be appropriate to the region such crops normally demand intensive applications of inputs eg water and agro chemicals andor farming marginal lands which may have negative environmental effects in the long run analysts have pointed to potential positive and negative effects on the environment as result of the barcelona process trade liberalization is viewed by many analysts as factor that encourages urbanization which will further heighten pressure on already burdene d urban environments in the med region22 moreover industrial and agricultural activity could intensify as foreign investment increases and the med economies focus increasingly on export promotion furthermore as these countries open up to increased trade and remove customs duties the funds available to various governments will be reduced potentially limiting their ability to address social and environmental issues at time when pressures and needs are mounting23 there are nevertheless some potential positive ecological outcomes the availability of more advanced technology and the removal of certain subsidies may lead to enhanced efficiency and less pollution environmental niche markets such as organic crops may bring potential gains both for trade and the environment24 increased economic activity could boost tax revenues and give governments enhanced capabilities for dealing with environmental programs in order to take advantage of the opportunities for improvement however some advocat the establishment of supporting institutions and policies backed with sufficient authority and finances the eu has directorategeneral dealing with environmental issues and nafta has relevant set of institutions25 this sort of supporting institutional framework has yet to be established in the context of the eumed cooperation process prospects and limitations the process of liberalization will essentially entail the opening of med markets to eu goods as the eu already accords duty free access to most med manufactured goods the eu therefore stands to gain from such increased access to med markets while the mediterranean partner countries have an opportunity to attract european technology and investment as well as increased financial assistance through various programs intended to mitigate the negative effects of economic liberalization nevertheless thus far not many european businesses have shown great interest in the opening med region and in the opportunities offered by the euromed partnershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31017crs9 26rhein eberhardt euromed free trade area for 2010

the growth of their garment industries and intensive subcontracting in that sector would not have been possible without the advantageous conditions of access to the european market offered from 1978 with the entry into force of cooperation agreements industrial development and trade in manufactured products nevertheless remained essentially limited to this sector26 the rest of the region has thus far remained largely unresponsive to the opportunities to sell in the european market many see the participatory partnership approach of the barcelona process is strength in that it brings many diverse nations into cooperation but others worry that it creates enthusiasm and expectations which if not met might lead to disappointment and loss of confidence the diversity of the med countries and the political tensions between some of them already has posed and will continue to pose problems and slow down the process of cooperation furthermore the longterm success and sustain ability of the partnership will hinge on the establishment of durable peace and stability in the region the euromediterranean partnership has also given new impetus to the idea of intraarab free trade this would comprise major step towards true free trade area around the mediterranean with intramed as well as eumed free trade as opposed to hubandspokes system of trade only between the eu and individual med countries many observers believe that the domestic markets of individual med countries are too small to draw substantial interest from the international business community in order to attract larger shares of foreign direct investment they maintain that the med countries have to be perceived as part of one big market where it is possible to invest and trade without restrictions27 the barcelona process can thus offer important financial and technical support for the process of regional integration as well the peace process and us interests the barcelona process is complementary to but separate from the middle east peace process and as such has managed to serve as forum for the partners to meet despite the ups and downs in regional relations28 following the outbreak of the aqsa intifadah in september 2000 and the breakdown of israelisyrian talks earlier in the year the barcelona process is facing serious challenges and some arab countries chose to boycott the november 2000

statement of the marseilles summit in november 200029 the union maintains that it strives to complement the american position on middle east peace rather than compete with it according to the statement the eu presents itself as facilitator of regional dialogue through the euromediterranean partnership according to the european commission one of the successes of the euromediterranean partnership is to have allowed against tense background dialogue to be pursued between mediterranean partners involved in the middle east peace process in context of regional meetings on all questions of common interest the partnership still remains the only multilateral forum outside the united nations where all the conflict parties meet30 despite the positive effects of the barcelona process some
