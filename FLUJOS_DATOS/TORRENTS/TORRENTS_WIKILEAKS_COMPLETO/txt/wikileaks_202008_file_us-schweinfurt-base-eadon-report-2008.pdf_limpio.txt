buildings located at the usag schweinfurt germany the goal of the diagnostic testing was 1 to verify results of previously conducted radon measurements and 2 to develop appropriate and costeffective methods for effective mitigation the work was performed under contract w912gb04d0017 delivery order do 0028 in accordance with the schedule of services dated 19 september 2007 1 12 scope of work the purpose of the radon diagnostic testing was to determine the most appropriate method for mitigation of elevated radon concentrations for each sched uled building radon measurements have previously been conducted and revealed elevated radon concentrations exceeding the epa us environmental protection agency ction level of 4 pico curies per liter pcil at several buildings througho ut the usag

protocols for performing radon diagnostic testing and other applicable laws and regulations 13 previous radon surveys radon measurements were conducted in 2000 indicating elevate d radon levels exceeding epa action level of 40 pcil at several bu ildings throughout the usag schweinfurt to verify these results all buildingsrooms that had identified levated radon concentration were retested using longterm measurements from may 2006 until may 2007 these measurements confirmed the presence of elevated radon concentratio n in these buildingsrooms 14 limitations the purpose of this study was to perform diagnostic testing at several buildings that were identified in previous measurements to have vels of radon that exceed the epa action level of 4 picl the methodology used for this survey indicated t he potential for elevated radon concentration in basements andor housing rooms the detected radon concentrations in tested rooms are snapshot of the concentrations experienced duri ng the monitoring period depending on weather conditions and individual habits of the building occupants radon concentrations may vary strongly the results are therefore not direct ly applicable to other buildings but the potential for elevated radon concentra tions in neighboring rooms andor buildings can be assumed as indicated in section 12 the assessment and mitigation crite rion used to assess the levels of radon is based on the epa radon action level of 4 pcil according to the epa this action level is largely based on the ability of current technologies to reduce elevated radon levels below 4 pcil and is not direct reflection of the hazard s associated with the presence of radon 2 in addition it should be noted that legal opinions are in cluded in this survey and that the intention of this survey is only to provide ge neral epabased guidance for the reduction of previously identified and confirmed radon levels i n the subject buildings usag schweinfurt radon diagnostic testing

its decay product polonium radon is naturallyoccurring radioactive noblegas which is foun d in soil and rock containing granite or shale radon moves with the soil ga s and penetrates the buildings foundation and basement flooring depending on the buildings ventilation system or the ventilation habits of its occupants radon may accumulate in ba sements or other housing spaces it is part of the natural breakdown decay chain of ura nium with halflife of 38 days radon decays into polonium by emitting alpha and gamma radiation alpha collapse polonium itself is very escharotic and so radioactive chemical element with high potential to adsorb to any kind of surface polonium decays aft er halflife of only 305 minutes alpha collapse 32 health effects health risks from elevated rado n concentration are caused by t he radioactive decay releasing small bursts of radiation if the radioactive decay oc curs inside the human body inhaled radioactive particles this radiation can damage lung t issue and lead to lung cancer over the course of lifetime as radon is an inert noble gas it does not adsorb to the lung when inhaled but is breathed out in contrast to radon its decay products especially polonium can become trapped in lungs when inhaled posing potential risk of lung cancer prol onged exposure to elevated radon concentrations and therefore to its decay products cause s an increased risk of lung cancer as it is easier to measure radon is used as reference element f or the assessment of potential health risks related to the radon decay chain epa st rongly recommends that action is taken at any house with radon concentration hig her than 148 bqmÂ³ 4 pcil and encourages action at levels above 74 bqmÂ³ 2 pcil 33 radon entry into buildings radon moves with soil gas convectively through cracks and drafts in the bottom slab masonry and unsealed pipe induction and eduction inside th buildings basement and possibly further up to living areas the so called chimneyeffect accelerates the radon inflow warm air inside the building rises and causes slight negative pressure in the basement this negative pressure results in radoncontaining air being sucked from the underlying soil into the basement many factors contribute to the entry of radon gas into build ing buildings in neighboring areas may have significantly different radon levels from one anot her as result one cannot know if elevated levels of radon are present without testing the following factors determine why some buildings have elevated radon levels and others do n ot the concentration of radon in the soil gas source strength nd permeability of the soil gas mobility under the building usag schweinfurt radon diagnostic testing final report february 2008 amec project 378820028g 13 the structure construction and condition of the building the type operation and maintenance of the hvac system and frequency of opening and closing windows and doors many buildings are constructed on adjoining floor slabs which permit radon gas to enter through construction and expansion joints between the slabs other features such as the presence of basement area crawl spaces util ity tunnels subslab ventilation ducts cracks or other penetrations in the building foundation eg around pipes also allow radon to enter indoor spaces 34 regulatory assumptions and assessment criteria there are us regulations mandating specific radon levels for indoor residential environments only guidelines for remediation epa recommends reduci ng the concentration of radon in the air within building to below 4 pci l according to the epa this action level is largely based on the ability of current technologies to reduce elevated radon levels below 4 pcil 2 army regulation ar 2001 chapter 9 3 establishes guidance on identification assessment and mitigation of indoor levels of radon in us army facilities specifications of action levels and response timing are given in the department of the army pamphlet 2001 dapam 2001 4 chapter 9 dapam 2001 also establishes an action level for radon of 4 pcil the action levels provided in the army regulation ar 2001 and da pam 2001 were used for the assessment of the diagnostic testing results in addit ion the provided assessment and mitigation recommendations are in accordance with epa as require d by da pam 2001 for germany there are legally binding threshold values for ra don concentration in buildings to date in regard to health care the german government recommends radon mitigation if radon concentrations in residential housing are as exceed target level of approximately 27 pcil 100 bqmÂ³ in addition it is recommen ded by the eu commission recommendation on the protection of the public against ind oor exposure to radon in 1990 and the international commission of radiological protection icrp that radon concentrations of an annual average of approximately 54 pci l 200 bqmÂ³ are not exceeded in occupied areas within buildings usag

individual buildings as radon moves with the air in the soil and building to gain th is understanding differential pressure measurements were conducted active soil depressurization was simulat ed and the general buildingflooring construction was investigated 421 differential pressure measurement differential pressure measurement is used to determine soil gas pre ssures relative to the pressures inside the building measuremen ts are accomplished by inserting tube connected to one side of micromanometer in drilled pilot h oles of diameter 12 mm see section 413 results are provided in units of inches of wat er column wc negative number indicates lower pressure under the sl ab than inside the room and alternatively positive number signifies higher pressure in the soil than in side the room as air moves from high pressure towards lower pressure areas results indicate the preferred air flow direction differential pressure measurements were co nducted at classroom 54 elementary school room

cases are higher as possible result of cooler weather conditions and therefore less airing activity the presence of radon inside the building as identified during previous measurements was verified additionally the results confirm that indoor radon levels may be elevated at the schweinfurt facility these findings do not represent need to mitig ate all structures on schweinfurt rather they indicate that with lack of mechanical ventil ation radon levels could significantly increase in areas of demonstrat ed radon potential buildings with one or more locations in excess of the guidance especially during periods where manual ventilation is reduced such as during winter months c onsequently consideration should be given to periodic retesting of facilities at schweinfurt with high rad

unoccupied times the variation in the classroom reflects the typical manner in which th rooms are operated with respect to the amount of fresh air that is allowed into any given room measurements indicate significant decrease in radon concentrations at the time the teacher enters the room and airs it manually by opening the windows due to the uncontrolled manner in which fresh air is provided locations that have previously displayed low radon levels when measured could exhibit elevated radon levels if ventilation rates are reduced the cdc contains ventilation system but meas urements did not indicate significant decrease in the radon concentration after the ventilation syste m was installed the usag schweinfurt radon diagnostic testing final report february 2008 amec project

connects room 2 with the utility room at the rear end of the building where the second fan is located this second fan draws the air outside the b uilding this air movement from room 2 through the duct to the utility room and outside th building leads to change in differential air pressure throughout the basement larger int erior vacuums were measured inside the storage room next to room 2 as well as in the uti lity room at the rear end of the basement due to this fact the installed vent ilation system is more likely to increase radon levels in other portions of the building as an air flow fro m underneath the slab into the basement is created in order to compensate for the interior vacuu ms 513 subgrade soil and crawlspace gas measurement the soil gas measurement values ranged from approximately 300 pcil to 450 pcil these values should not be interpreted as the potential indoor ra don levels within the rooms above rather they indicate that significant potential for evated indoor radon levels exists in buildings situated in the schweinfurt region due to elevat ed radon in the underlying soil these findings do not represent need to mitigate all stru ctures on schweinfurt rather they indicate that with lack of mechanical ventilation radon levels could significantly increase in areas of demonstrated radon potential buildings with one or more locations in excess of the guidance especially during periods where manual ventilation is reduced such as during winter months consequently consideration should be given to periodic retesting of facilities at schweinfurt with high radon potential within the crawlspaces of the residential housing jackson 14 bld g 551 and jackson 15 bldg 552 radon concentrations of 25 pcil and 30 pcil respectively were measured the results of the comparison of radon in air within the craw lspaces relative to the adjacent basement areas see figure 22 in appendix point out the majo r role played by these crawlspaces with respect to radon entry due to the higher concentration within the crawlspaces it is likely that elevated radon concentrations are n ot only found in the basements but also in living spaces above 52 radon diagnostic 521

were verified the soil beneath even those rooms which have previously been identified as having low indoor radon levels has the potential to generate elevated radon levels in these rooms if adequate ventilation is not provided it is likely that t his is the case throughout the entire usag the lack of ventilation in room is likely to cause radon measurements to be higher than the levels to which

building opening it addresses the source of th concern by minimizing radon entry and treating the radon decay products via air filtration as addressed in the next section key parameters and elements needed for the effectiveness of the systems are as follows underlying soil of slabongrade need be reasonably permeab presence of intermediate footings or grade beams lower asd effi ciency in the case of crawlspace foundations plastic sheeting need s to be laid on the soil and sealed to foundation walls asd can be quite costeffective depending on the size of the building footprint that needs to be addressed asd is most applicable to frequent and longte rm occupied buildings residential properties office buildings in cases of existing crawlspaces combination of slabs and sub membrane depressurization system is recommended to co mbat radon entry from underneath the slab as well as from within the crawlspace this approach consists of polyethylene sheet of plastic laid on the earthen floor of the crawlspace including conto urs and sealed to the foundation walls using corrugated and perforated pipe which is route d beneath the plastic sheet and to one point under the adjacent slab vacuum is applied to both the subgrade soil beneath the slab as well as the soil in the crawlspace 63 radon decay product reduction using air filter an alternate method for the reduction of risks associated with indoor radon is to reduce the suspended decay products that are formed when radon decays as in dicated in section 3 the radon decay products readily attach to dust particles or to f ixed objects the lower the percentage of decay products that remain suspended in the air the lower the exposure to health risks even though the precursor radon gas levels may not ch ange with an air filter indoor air is sucked and routed through filter which extracts dust particles and therefore attached radon decay products from the indoor air due to the increased air movement caused by the air filtration radon decay products come in to contact with material they can attach to more frequently air filtration is most viabl in the following situations where only small number of discrete rooms within larger buil ding need to be addressed where asd techniques would be prohibitively expensive where initial radon levels are less than 10 pcil usag schweinfurt radon diagnostic testing final

should be noted that of the three devi ces originally deployed as part of the initial survey only one device was actu ally retrieved consequently this building has not been fully characterized and full retesting should be considered before mitigation option is selected any tunnels or crawl spaces should be sealed in order to decrease radonloaded air flow into the buildings basement the method of sealin g should be determined as function of the need to access this area but preferably expan sive urethane foam would be utilized in the case of the residential housing both the slab fo undation of the basement and the crawl space areas need to be included in the mitigation system given the indoor radon levels measured in the selected rooms levated radon concentrations may be exhibited in other rooms on the same level in case these rooms are occupied frequently eg offices it may be reasonable to focus on the whole level and not just the single room measured remediation may be needed in rooms utilized as storage roo ms due to their infrequent use given relatively low radon level it may be prudent to mea sure radon decay products to determine the actual health risk before proceeding

usag schweinfurt germany 1 general description the diagnostic work described by this report was conducted by colorado vintage companies inc cvc on behalf of am ec earth environmental gmbh amec under their prime contract w912gb04d0017 do0028 on behalf of th us army corps of engineers usag schweinfurt germany the intent of this work was to verify the presen ce of elevated radon levels at selected locations where previous longterm radon measurements d been conducted and if confirmed to develop mitigation approaches for the reduction of radon andor radon decay product exposures 11 background 111 health risk and guidance radon is naturally occurring gas derived from the breakdown of naturally occurring deposits of uranium 238 when these radon producing deposits are near inhabited structures radon laden soil gases can be drawn into the structure through small openings in the foundation due to negative pressures within those structures this entrained radon gas will mix throughout the air in the breathing space of the building and present longterm hazardous exposure radon as shortlived radioactive element quickly decays into series of highly unstable and radioactive elements which have electrostatic ch arges and also are emitters of alpha radiation inhabitants of structure having radon in th breathing space can inhale both radon and radon decay products upon exhalation the radon leaves the lungs but the radon decay products can cling to sensitive lung tissue due to the electrost atic nature of the decay products where they can deliver alpha radiation to sensitive lung cells prolonged exposure to elevated levels of radon d ecay products from radon can increase the risk of lung cancer most recommendations for exposure are based upon 40 cfr chapter i part 19 19220 that sets longterm exposure guidance of 002w orking levels of radon decay products using the assumption that 50 of the radon decay produc ts formed will attach to fixed objects and therefore not respirable surrogate radon gas c oncentration guidance of 40 pcil can be used in lieu of direct measurement of radon decay products1 through the course of this report recommendations for risk reductions will target either radon decay products to less than 002 wl or ra don to less than 40 pcil depending upon the approach utilized 1 radon 100 x rdpsf or radon 100 x 002wl05 40 pcil prepared by colorado vintage companies inc on behalf of amec earth environm ental gmbh november 7 2007 8112 variability of indoor radon and radon decay products radon is soil gas that is drawn into stru cture when interior pressures are less than atmospheric pressures this can occur under number of conditions as listed below operation of interior exhaust systems unbalanced hvac systems thermal stack effects ie when outdoor temperatures are less than interior temperatures soil pressurization or alternatively interi or negative pressures due to wind induced bernoulli effects furthermore after radon has entered structure its final concentration is impacted by the level of fresh air makeup introduced to structure and the degree to which radon decay products remain in the breathing space which is affected by air ci rculation and the presence of air filtration devices due to the variable levels of radon in building and its effect being chronic rather than acute priority is given to measurements of longe r duration and to those that directly measure the dose producing radon decay products 12 previous survey work 121 initial survey facility wide radon survey in the year 2000 iden tified locations within this facility that had radon gas activities in excess of the recommended 40 pcil the attributes of this previous survey were as follows2 longterm tests deployed from march 2000 to april 2001 test devices measured radon gas devices were deployed in lower portions of st ructures where radon levels would likely be the highest due to proximity to underlying soil 19 of the building tested demonstrated locations in excess of the 40 pcil guidance although fairly complete not all devices were retrieved nor were all targeted locations tested consequently additional areas of concern beyond those specifically cited in the 2002 report may exist 122 followup measurements followup measurements also of longterm natu re 10 months were conducted in several of the locations identified within the initial survey as having elevated radon levels these tests were conducted under the direction of klaus koch of the us army corps of engineers and served as one of the basis for selecting the twelve 12 buildings investigated within this report although numerically the results of the followup rvey were different than the initial survey as is to be expected they confirmed the presen ce of elevated levels of radon in these particular 2 technical report radon survey 280th bsb schweinfurt contract daca9098d0011 delivery order 0081 january 2002 prepared by colorado vintage companies inc

the results of an investigation which occurred from october 5 11 2007 the purpose of which was to verify presence of radon at schweinfurt develop approaches for risk reduction via active soil depressurization methods radon decay product reductions 21 radon measurements 211 shortterm indoor air measurements shortterm measurements having minimum dura tion of 48 hours were conducted in at least one location within each of the 12 subject buildings the purpose of these tests was to verify the presence of radon rather than to supplant the resu lts of previous measurements which were of longer duration and would take precedence over these shortterm measurements the devices utilized are shown in figure 1 figure 1 shortterm radon measurement devices rad elec shortterm radon device nehanrpp device code 8212 femtotech continuous radon monitor nehanrpp device code 444 the results of the shortterm tests are provided in figure 2 with comparison to the most recent longterm tests conducted by the usacg note that data for building 505 school is excluded from this graph as it is provided later in the report and that the locations of the followup short term measurement for buildings 209 and 30 although on the same level of the building are not in the same room or location as the initial test due to room access issues as can be seen from the data in figure 2 radon levels continue to be near the levels previously measured and in many cases are higher the fact the recent shortterm measurements are higher should not be interpreted as the radon levels are in creasing in these units but rather reflects the cooler weather conditions ie less open window ventilation and higher stack effect experienced at the time the shorttem measurements were conducted that would tend to increase shortterm radon levels however they do certainly confirm that indoor radon levels can be elevated at the schweinfurt facility prepared by colorado vintage companies inc on behalf of amec

continued to be elevated in the case of rooms 34 and 36 recent shortterm levels are below the guidance level of 40 pcil even more interestingly rooms 25 and 52 where the initial longterm survey indicated there was little to radon present radon levels have current shortterm levels well above the guidance level of 40 pcil changes in radon levels as shown in table 2 are not likely result of modifications that have been made to the structure over the last seven ears but rather reflect the manner in which the specific rooms are operated with respect to the amount of fresh air that is allowed into any given room this is due to the uncontrolled manner in which fresh air is provided via teacher manually operating exterior windows rather than having controlled heating ventilation and air conditioning system hvac that would forcibly provide fresh air makeup to classroom the variable results in this school also point out that any location that had been measured at low radon level could exhibit an elevated radon vel if ventilation rates to that location are reduced and if the soil contains appreciable radon as exhibited by having at least one ground floor room in excess of 40 pcil these findings should not be interpreted as need to mitigate all structures on schweinfurt but rather as precaution that with the lack of mechanical ventilation radon levels could significantly increase in areas of previously dem onstrated potential buildings with one or more locations in excess of the guidance and especially during periods where manual ventilation is prepared by colorado

opening exterior windows which teachers have been instructed to do for an indeterminate amount of time each morning it should also be noted that this test was conducte d in october 2007 when weather was cool but not cold thus allowing for open window ventilation without severe drafts in the classrooms it is likely that during wintry periods when windows would less likely be opened higher radon levels during occupied periods would be observed than wh at is indicated by this four day measurement figure 5 provides graphical comparison of radon exposures during occupied versus unoccupied periods for the test that was conducted in room 23 as can be seen from this data although the average exposure is indeed above 40 pcil the exposure to children and teachers during occupied periods is significantly lower than w ould be indicated by an integrating measurement that does not distinguish between unoccupied and ccupied conditions this is due to the higher prepared by colorado vintage companies inc on behalf of amec earth environm ental gmbh november 7 2007 14levels typically found during unoccupied periods lower ventilation and the fact that the building is unoccupied the majority of the time evenings and weekends figure 5 occupied to unoccupied averages schweinfurt elementary 7284 24 0246810 average unoccupied occupiedradon pcil the data in figure 5 suggests bias associated with integrating measurements to be towards radon levels experienced during unoccupied periods of time this bias is likely to exist with the longterm measurements that were conducted duri ng the initial and followup survey this is not to suggest that radon reductions in the school s hould not be addressed but rather that actual exposures may not be as high as what prev ious longterm measurements would suggest one could also interpret the data in figure 5 as to the effect that ventilation can have where fresh air makeup with proper temperature and humidity conditioning for comfort was controlled however in the absence of central air ndling system that would allow for economical management of fresh air makeup reliance upon manual opening or closing of windows will provide variable and unreliable reductions esp ecially during extreme cold or hot weather conditions the extreme variations observed in room 23 can also help point out the different radon levels observed within and between the two longterm surveys conducted at this school the large increase in rooms 25 and 52 as indicated in tabl 2 could easily be function of the amount of ventilation that the teachers of these rooms allowe d into these rooms during the tests and that all ground floor rooms in this building have hi gh radon potential and should be addressed as whole similar hourbyhour measurement was also c onducted in lower level room of building 503 child development center and over the same period as the test was conducted in the schweinfurt elementary school the data provide d in figure 6 shows much more consistent radon levels this is due to the fact that th is particular room has windows nor means for ventilation that can reduce radon levels when open prepared by colorado

radon levels duri ng occupied periods however if this ventilation cannot be economically provided th other reduction measures need to be considered 214 summary of radon measurement investigations shortterm radon measurements and soil ga s samples confirmed presence of radon in locations at schweinfurt ventilation rates or lack there of can have profound effect on indoor radon levels most structures observed do not have cont rolled means for addition of fresh air to building rooms that had shown low levels in previous surveys can have the potential for elevated levels depending upon ventilation rate of location rooms or buildings not tested have si milar potential for elevated radon as other locations where elevated levels were found within the same structure it is recommended that all previously untested ground floor locations be tested prepared by colorado vintage companies inc on behalf of amec earth environm ental gmbh november 7 2007 163 radon andor radon decay reduction approaches the contents of this section describe in general measures that can be taken to reduce indoor radon or radon decay products and the relative mer its or viability of each approach specific recommendations for each building studied are provided in section 32 with the following building attributes being relevant to this discussion the buildings including the administrative bu ildings and the school do not have existing central or unitized mechanical forced air hea ting systems that could be utilized to provide controlled amounts of conditioned fresh air the buildings are constructed of concrete with tightly sealed windows both of which reduce the infiltration of outdoor air larger buildings are well constructed with high degree of subgrade grade beams and 2024 inch exterior concrete walls with inte rmediate floors also being constructed of steel reinforced concrete 31 description of potential reductions techniques 311 increased ventilation as noted previously in this report indoor radon levels can be significantly reduced by increasing fresh outdoor air this is particularly true fo r the buildings studied in this work due to the tightness of the exterior shell concrete unfort unately the lack of existing central forced air systems does not allow for economical augmenta tion or introduction and distribution of fresh outdoor air throughout building without complete revision of the buildings heating and air conditioning system although the addition of forced air system could be contemplated when building undergoes major renovation as is being considered in the case of building 215 the addition of ductwork to distribute conditioned air would require signifi cant interior modifications such as dropped ceilings and vertical plenums to roof mounted units and would be prohibitive in costs and therefore is not considered to be viable option for the buildings studied in this report alternatively one could consider unitized fans for each room that would introduce outdoor air into the specific rooms having elevated radon levels ie heat recovery ventilators or simple fan supply units these systems would require cond itioning of the outdoor with respect to humidity and temperature control in order to maintain co mfortable environment this approach is also not recommended based upon experience where ccupants are annoyed by these systems and often disable them due to drafty conditions and ar also considered to be potential bioterrorist opportunity site for introducing agents into the inte rior of controlled structures via the outside air inlets 312 active soil depressurization active soil depressurization asd is method of ten utilized to draw radon from the underlying soil of buildings foundation and exhausting it to the atmosphere at location where it will not be reentrained through building opening figure 7 provides an illustration of such system prepared by colorado vintage companies inc on behalf of amec earth

slabongrade building material equipment installation specifications 18 key parameters and elements needed for th effectiveness of these systems are as follows to extract radon laden soil gas the underl ying soil of slabongrade need be reasonably permeable the area impacted by single point sucti on can be reduced by the presence of intermediate footings or grade beams exist in the case of crawlspace foundations plastic sheeting needs to be lain on the earthen soil and sealed to foundation wa lls with the soil gas extracted from beneath the membrane discharge points of system are to be cated above roof line and well away from building openings 3 meters fans are to operate continuously and consume between 6090 watts of electricity in the case of large footprint buildi ngs and where considerable subgrade restrictions such as grade beams exist single system installed to treat specific room may not be as effective as desire d if radon in the indoor migrates from other portions of the building that are untreated by the asd system note this is likely the case in several of the larg er buildings studied in this report and therefore limits the application of asd in these structures if only individual rooms are to be treated rather than th entire building which would significantly increase the number of asd systems that would be needed piping systems can be routed through the inte rior or the exterior of the structure provided that the fan and its discharge piping are either outdoors on the roof or in an unoccupied attic space many of the larger buildings studied in this report do not have unoccupied attics and interior floors are concrete making interior routing very difficult consequently if th is approach is to be utilized the vent pipes for these systems would be routed on the exterior of the buildings and up to point above the gutters active soil depressurization can be quite co steffective when the entire the entire footprint of building needs to be addre ssed as would be the case for residential structure it also addresses the source of the concern by minimizing radon entry rather than allowing it to enter and treating the radon decay products via air filtration as addressed in the next section however wh one or two rooms within large building are to be addressed more unitized approach may be preferred that would treat the air within the room rather than the radon source especially if additional benefits could be derived from air filtration when asd can be applied to where negative pressures throughout the entire subgrade can be achieved indoor radon can be decreased quickly and effectively as can be seen from an example result in figure 8 material equipment installation specifications 19 figure 8 example of

radon decay product reduction 3131 background and application an alternate method for the reduction of risk s associated with indoor radon is to reduce the suspended decay products that are form ed when radon decays as indicated in previous section 111 the radon decay products when formed in the air have electrostatic charges and readily attach to dust particles or attach to fixed objects the lower the percentage of decay products that remain susp ended in the air rather than attaching to fixed objects such as walls or being filtere d out in the lower the exposure even though the precursor radon gas levels may not change this percentage is referred to as the equilibrium factor ef and can range from 0 suspended decay products to 100 all suspended depending upon the degree of ai r circulation and suspended dust within room historically it has been assumed that when relating radon decay risks to radon gas measurements that 50 of the radon decay products remain suspended figure 9 provides graphical representation of decreasing risk as particulate levels in indoor air are reduced from this representation one can see the equivalency of 002 wl of radon decay products being available for inhalation when the percentage of decay products is assumed to be 50 and the radon gas activity level is 40 pcil the figure also indicates the reduced exposures that can be achieved if air filtration occurs even though the radon gas levels remain at the action level of 40 pcil figure 10 provides data from location not schweinfurt where media filter was turned on while simultaneous measurements of radon and radon decay products were made this result has been obtained in num ber of situations and clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of reducing the dose causing radon decay

guidancesguidances material equipment installation specifications 21 the use of air filtration devices for radon ri sk related reductions is not commonly used for residential properties where active soil pressurization is more applicable air filtration as method is most viable in the following situations where additional indoor air quality bene fits would be derived from reducing other suspended particulates or reduc tion of volatile organic compounds via simultaneous carbon treatment of filtered air where only small number of discrete room s within larger building need to be addressed this would be the case for severa l of the larger administrative buildings such as 28d 444 and perhaps 209 where active soil depressurization techni ques have not adequately reduced radon levels or would be prohibitively expensive where initial radon levels are less than 10 pcil as interim solutions until more complicat ed remedies can be applied such as hvac system revisions 3132 air filter criteria there are two design criteria for air filtrati on systems when used to reduce radon decay products air circulation filtration devices should recirculate air within room at volumetric air flow delivery rate equal to twice the volume of the room per hour this rate provides reasonable filtration efficiency but equally important provides sufficient air movement in the room to increase attachment of radon decay products to fixed objects such as walls and floors filter media it is recommended that media filters be utilized rather than electrostatic filters media filters do not need to be high efficiency particulate filters true hepas filters rated at merv10 or higher have proven to be adequate for radon decay product reductions when accompanied with adequate air flow volumes although electrostatic filters have shown their ability to reduce radon decay products general concerns about ozone generation from these devices continue to be raised and until such issues are resolved within the health community we would recommend that only media filters be utilized although carbon filtration media can be added to reduce other indoor air odors and vocs the addition of these chemical f ilters provides additional benefit for radon decay product reduction but is an option that the client should consider when acquiring air filters material equipment installation specifications 22 3133 installation of air filters there are three basic methods for installing air filters as follows 31331 incorporation into an existing air handling system the most preferred method of installing air f ilters is to incorporate the filter into an existing hvac system where good recirculation can be achieved in so doing the media needs to be of significant depth and surface ar ea so as to not restrict the existing air handling system since none of the buildings investigated in th is report have existing air handling systems this approach is not viable option but could be considered in the future when major building renovations may allow for the installation of central hvac systems 31332 localized air handling systems unitized air filters with ductwork are available that can be installed either in attic spaces or in dropped ceilings these have the advant age of fully distribu ting the air within room or number of rooms because of th low air flow rates 2 air changes per hour the duct size is typically 79 inch and can be routed in flex duct through dropped ceilings they also have the advantage of not taki ng up floor space as would be the case with console filters addressed in the next section localized air handling systems may be an op tion for the schweinfurt elementary school if adequate space is available above the dropped ceilings however discussions with mr jackman who oversees maintenance at the school indicated that there was very little space above the ceilings and what space is available is congested with conduit and cabling figure 11 examples of localized air filtration systems ceiling grid air returnair supply honeywell f120 material equipment installation specifications 23 example of ceiling mounted air filter with boot for attachment to ductwork for fan unit and similar ceiling mounted diffuser medical air model 500 httpwwwmedicalairsolutionscom ceiling mounted air filter 31333 console air filtration devices in cases where individual rooms are to be treated or where the ductwork does not exist nor can be readily installed console filters ar an option there are two basic approaches with console units as follows portable floor units floor mounted units are conveniently insta lled by merely placing in room and plugging them in but can have the following disadvantages floor space is taken up air movement may be restricted by furniture and corner location which may be preferable for space utilization is not optimal for air movement more than one unit may needed for larger rooms such as classrooms if units are plugged in to receptacle they can easily be relocated or disabled fixed wall or ceiling units fixed units would be preferable as they would have the following advantages over portable units seen as fixed part of room and not easily relocated power can be run via conduit and interlocke d to light switch such that they are on during occupied periods note that there are very few standalone filtration units designed for wall or ceiling mounting consequently it may be necessa ry to utilize portable console unit and secure it to wall and modify its electrical supply for direct connection material equipment installation

to note that although health risk exposures would be reduced th radon gas will not be affected since it will pass through the filter without ttachment consequently to measure the effectiveness of the filtration units radon decay product m easurement devices will be required furthermore it is recommended that when such measurements are made that radon gas is simultaneously measured to verify that the reduction of radon decay products is achieved by virtue of the filter rather than temporary decrease in radon gas concentrations during the measurement period devices capable of measuring both radon and radon decay products are shown in figure 14 figure 14 shortterm devices for measuring radon decay products and radon device pairs description collocated continuous monitors that measure and

following sections provide synopsis of investigations that occurred at each building as well as recommendations for approaches with alternatives where appropriate in considering the information and reco mmendations provided it is important to determine if the objective is to treat the i ndividual rooms that have been identified as having longterm elevated radon levels or if the entire lower

ary concern is currently associated with the basement area rather than the first fl oor rooms it is however recommended that since the soil beneath this building clearly monstrates the potential for elevated indoor material equipment installation specifications 28 radon levels for rooms directly contacting the soil that future testing programs include the retesting of ground floor rooms to insure that the assumption that ground floor rooms continue to be less than the action level and especially after major building modifications hourly measurements of radon in this room are provided below and

signifying higher pressure in the soil than inside the room suction side of vacuum cleaner deployed at test hole location v1 as noted in figure 17 as means of simulating an active soil depressurizati on system the data presented in figure 17 indicates the location of the pilot holes and the pressure differential measurements made through the slab floor one can see from measurements material equipment installation specifications 30 at t2 and t3 that the soil is at positive pressu re relative to the interior which would cause radon to enter the structure one can also see that the soil pressure is essentially neutral at t1 within the office room 2 where prev ious efforts had been made to reduce radon by the installation of wall fan that draws air from the corridor and blows it into room 2 to have worked properly the pressure impart ed by this fan would need to be at least 0010 inches of water column however in creasing the air handled by this fan is not recommended as it is responsible for creating rger interior vacuums in the storage room where t2 is located as well as the wall fan that was installed in the utility room tha t is causing larger interior vacuum at t3 in essence although the installation of th ventilation system in room 2 may have reduced radon levels it did not fully reduce vels to less than 40 pcil and is likely causing increased radon levels in other portions of the building and therefore should be removed as part of the mitigation plan for this building figure 17 bldg 503 child development center tunnel soil gas at v1 301 pcil soil gas from

diagram in figure 17 with photographs shown in figure 18 this tunnel represents significant pathway for radon laden soil gas and should be sealed at its opening as part of the mitigation planned for

ability to create s ubstantial negative pressures under the entire foundation and adequately reduce radon thr oughout the entire basement area provided exhaust fan in utility room is disabled also when interpreting the data in figur 19 although the vacuum was applied at v1 the ability for its vacuum to influence subgrad pressures at all three locations in the subgrade indicates that the suction

3232 diagnostic findings diagnostics for these two buildings consiste d of visual observations and grab radon samples the most notable feat ure of these buildings is that in addition to the footprint of the buildings having finished basement w ith laundry room and office there is an earthen floor crawlspace area adjacent to th basement and also under the first floor living area as illustrated in figure 21 figure 21 duplex unit foundation schematic basementfirst floor stem wallslabcrawl cvc c material equipment installation specifications 39 the crawlspace area was accessed from small hatch located within the basement rea through which radon grab samples could be taken from the air space within the crawlspace note that grab samples are qui ck samples that provide an indication of relative strengths of radon sources the results of the comparisons of radon in air within the crawlspaces relative to the adjacent baseme nt areas is provided in figure 22 and point out the major role that these earthen areas ar playing in with respect to radon entry not only into the basements but also into liv ing spaces above them photographs of the crawlspace area can be seen in figure 23

positive 0002 inches wc within th crawlspace relative to basement interior with elevated radon levels in crawlspace and the passage of air from crawlspace into living space these areas are major radon entry points additionally access was obtained to site utility tunnels through which utility lines pass into duplex units and radon levels of 2030 pc il were measured consequently it is recommended that these tunnels be sealed wh ere they pass into duplex units to reduce radon entry from areas other than the duplex unit itself material equipment installation specifications 41 3233 recommendations although one could consider air filtration given the large radon source within the crawlspace and the large number of rooms that would need to have individual air filters ie central air handler to manage air from central location air filtration is not recommended for these style of structures rather the most costeffective methodology for the duplexes is active soil depressurization also based upon experience it is recommended that both the slab foundation of the basement and the crawlspace areas be treated however due to the recessed nature of the earth in the crawlspaces as well as the eas of digging typically encountered in the earthen area of the crawlspace adjacent to the stem wall separating crawlspaces from basements it is recommended that combin ation depressurization system be employed as shown in figure 24 this approach consists of polyethylene sheet of plastic laid on the earthen floor of the crawlspace including contours and sealed to the foundation walls with polyurethane caulk beneath the plastic is corrugated and perforated pipe which is also routed to single point under the adjacent slab where pit is manually dug out and the end of the perforated pipe is inserted into it this allows for vacuum to be applied to both the subgrade soil beneath the slab as well as the so il in the crawlspace with out the need for piping to be routed to separate floor sucti on point within the basement area that would interfere with useable space in the finished area figure 24 combination slab and sub membrane depressurization system basementcrawl

areas within the lower vel it is unclear why these locations had not been included on the initial 2001 survey but given the levels measured in the cashiers area as well as the hallway it is r easonable to assume that other areas of the basement are also likely to have slightly elev ated radon levels or at least the potential for this material equipment installation specifications 44 one approach which would be outside the scope of merely addressing radon levels in the cashiers area would be to incorporate ve ntilation system into the planned remodeling of the lower level this could be in the fo rm of central air handling system or unitized ventilators for the planned occupied areas if this were to be done it is recommended that fresh air makeup be incorporated into the design

the exposure just within the former cashiers area the most costeffective approach would be to install console air filtration device in the two office areas on either side of the vault this is suggested in lieu of an active soil depressurization system due to the height of the structure and the subgrade barrier presented by the vault slab to lateral subgrade air flow which would require the

figure 25 review of this figure points out several issues material equipment installation specifications 60 radon measurements can be significantly diffe rent between adjacent rooms this is typically due to an unbalanced hvac system however in the case of this school where hvac system exists the differences are likely due to differences in how each of the rooms ma be manually ventilated by the teacher or the degree to which hallway doors are open there are portions of the building that were added after the initial 2001 survey that have not been tested given th radon potential exhibited by this building these newer rooms should also be tested note in particular rooms 25 and 52 whose initial radon levels were reported to be 00 and 08 respectively during this inves tigation shortterm measurements were deployed in these two rooms with resu lts of 133 and 118 pcil respectively this suggest that although previous levels may have been low the soil beneath these rooms and likely throughout the entire school have the potential for having elevated indoor radon levels if adequate ventilation is not provided as indicated in figure 4 on page 13 hi gher radon levels exist during unoccupied hours and although the levels shown in figure 25 may be alarming the actual exposure to teachers and students is lik ely lower than indicated by longterm integrating measurements material equipment installation specifications 61 figure 25 diagram of initial longterm tests bldg 505 32113 diagnostic findings in addition to hourly measurements made in room 23 diagnostics were performed to determine the efficacy of an active soil pressurization system these tests were conducted in the plan north section of the building rooms 5256 the results of which are provided in figure 26 in reviewing the results in figure 26 vac uum was temporarily applied at the location notes as v1 subslab pressures were measur ed at holes drilled through the slab at points t1 t2 and t3 the numbers associated with each of the test points are the subgrade pressures relative to the indoor air with the first number being with the vacuum cleaner off and the second with the vacuum cleaner on this simple test allows one to determine the possible area of influence that single point suction system could have material equipment installation specifications 62 figure 26 asd diagnostics bldg 505

room it in which it is applied but also under an adjacent room however it did not seem to impact the classroom across the hallway it should be noted that the air flow being pulled by the vacuum cleaner was in excess of 100 cubic feet per minute which is the maximu m capacity of the vacuum cleaner utilized the significance of this is that it is possible that larger area of influence perhaps is achievable with fan system with much higher air flow capacity than the vacuum cleaner utilized for the diagnostics the high air flow experienced is likely due to the presence of styrofoam layer under the concrete slab that provides insulation but so allows for significant air passage should an active soil depressurization system be installed it will need to penetrate below the styrofoam and lower concrete slab area that is estimated to be at least 145 cm below the top of concrete material equipment installation specifications 63 32114 options for remediation in the absence of retrofitted

particulate filter option as discussed previously in section 313 radon decay product reduction could also be considered for these rooms in addition to reducing radon decay products there would be an added benefit of reducing air borne partic ulates as means to improve overall indoor air quality and the reduction of airborne allergens and asthma triggers there are two basic approaches that can be taken either localized air circulation system within the room if above ceiling sp ace allows for this or the attachment of console filters to walls and interlocked to the light switches obviously the more permanent installation of ceiling mounted fixt ures would be preferable however it is unlikely that ceiling space will allow this and the client is encouraged to investigate this however in view of the need to reduce xposures in these highly occupied areas in fairly expeditious manner it is recommended th at console units be acquired and installed as an interim approach and also to gauge th impact on other indoor air quality issues to better justify and engineer more integral air treatment system for these rooms based upon the geometry of the rooms it is recommended that two filters be placed in each room and at opposite ends affixed to walls most classrooms appear to have open space above sinks or adjacent to blackboards to wall mount such units figure 28 potential locations for
