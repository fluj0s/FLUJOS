bridge publications inc newsletter date present time and the mest universe just look at this then the mission of processing mission as an auditor is not to try to find the future for somebody or knock out the past or anything else its just to put him stably in present time and thats the goal of the auditor the goal of the auditor pc to pt thats all now whatit so happens that this does restore persons selfdeterminism because if hes exactly precisely in present time then he could move step completely out of the mest universe if he wanted to the door out is always there its facing you immediately in present time but youre never facing present time see i mean youve always got to figure out whats going to happen for the future thats logic person is logical enough hell be here forever l ron hubbard this excerpt has been taken from the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures cause and creation an article by l ron hubbard from the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures youll find out readily enough when you start processing beingness out of preclear youll find out all of sudden by the process which i will give you he will recognize something hell say you know theres really nottheres really not an object which is i this will come to him as little bit of surprise hell tell you this you dont have to even give him clue there really isnt anything that is i i dont have form i dont exist really except as igee im only trying to be things i am not anything and he gets real upset right about that point the potential of creating oh im sorry he is something he is something he is capacity to create and if you want to know whether or not capacity to create is worth being look at the pure joy there is in the field of creating arts if youve ever seen anybody absorbed in anything its painter with brush or kid in kindergarten with crayon oh boy so thats not little thing to be at all and thats what he is he is potentiality of creating something he is the directive creative urge and instinct hes nothing in terms of matter but he can create any quantity of it so he all of sudden tells you with horrible feeling that i cantim not really anything hes looking for the reason why i mentioned to you little earlier people all come along and they want to know the reason why and the reason i got bogged down originally in this whole work was i knew there was reason why for all this couldnt find any reason why the prior cause well the hell with the reason why when you say reason why this says logic you see and whats wrong with your preclear is he gets logical see your reason why is based upon the fact that there is prior cause which makes an effect and the fellow is always pushing himself up the time track from cause and is never being cause so the highest thing thetan can be is cause of creation cause of creative instincts cause of creative beingness cause of motivation he is motivation but when he says i am not anything he is saying nothing existed before i exist which gives form i dont have any further responsibility for in other words hes in the optimum condition permitted to being unlimited cause there is more condition more optimum than i am what i create myself to be at any instant that is really optimum that is too juicy thats too wonderful nobody could be that and yet thats what every thetan is and he said and theres reason why he said nobody came along he suddenly realized nobody came along and gave top hat and said you are now top hat and thats what im complaining about the fellow is complainingthe fellow is complaining because he is not permitted to be an effect hes complaining because hes being permitted to be unlimited cause thats heck of thing to complain about isnt it so there is goal on the line what do you want what do you want to make what do you want to create what effect do you want to create its just yourswham there isnt any more than that i mean youve said the most superlative superlative you could say when you say somebodysomebody is the potentiality of directed creation the hidden influence he doesnt need facsimiles to remember anything he doesnt need energy he doesnt need terminals he doesnt even have to communicate with anything if he doesnt want to hes cause and look at cause up there at the top of the chart of attitudes and you will find that cause goes along with lot of other desirable things theyre all about at the same band and all those things exist up there at that band all right enough for that what keeps him from being that oh there might be hidden influence oh what kind of hidden influence well there might be in fact he might run into vacuum and everybody knows vacuum pulls in thats really the truth he might be vacuum it doesnt ever occur to him that he could mock the whole thing up again afterwards your ability to create so the state of your preclear isactually can be graphed on curve of the amount of ability to create which he has retained the amount of action he can initiate is also an index how much action does he initiate how much is he willing to do with his hands all of these various things are indexes but the primary index is how much does he wish to independently create what is his creational desire now it gets better the better he gets that is one index that is just as solid as the rock of gibraltar that is one like the communication lag index the creative instinct of the individual what is this creative instinct your preclear gets as well as that is restored and it is beautiful little thing to work with the creative instinct and its power because one day your preclear comes inhe doesnt think you know hes doing anything particularlyand one day he comes in and he says to you he says you know i always wanted to paint and i bought brush yesterday here he goes you dont care whether he ever paints or not thats silly thing to do anyhow paint you get it on you and so forth but you have restored his creative instinct now it is being directed toward mest you see handling mest and meshing the mest around and so on well hell even unfix from that and hell get to much higher level of creation he wants creation with duration that is the level of the painter and that level is way higher than any level there is out in the society its up there in the stars its so incomprehensibly high to homo sapiens that hell stand around and look at painter with his jaw dropped and the painter had picture exhibited and thought well of and so on this is way up in the stars this is dwelling on the olympian
