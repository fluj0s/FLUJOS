united nations a61760 general assembly distr general 23 february 2007 original english 0724909 190307 0724909 sixtyfirst session agenda items 127 and 132 report on the activities of the office of internal oversight services administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the united nations peacekeeping operations report of the office of internal oversight services on the horizontal audit of fuel management in peacekeeping missions summary as requested by the general assembly in its resolution 60259 the office of internal oversight services oios conduc ted an audit of fuel management in peacekeeping missions the main objective of the audit was to obtain reasonable assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls over fuel management for the financial year 1 july 2005 to 30 june 2006 the department of peacekeeping operations llotted approximately 286 milli on for fuel or 6 per cent of the total budget in the 10 missions audited by oios as of october 2006 the 10 missions had 43 active fuel contracts totalling 513 million for contract validity periods of mostly one or two years the large amount of expenditures on fuel to support peacekeeping operations and the ea with which such products can be converted into cash represent significant risk to the organization oios found that internal controls over fuel management need significant improvement particularly in the following areas in all missions audited mechanism to monitor fuel consumption was either lacking or inadequate as result there were abnormal fuel consumption patterns in the united nations operation in burundi onub the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan unama the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik and the united nations operation in côte divoire unoci and discrepancies between sample physical counts conducted by oios and the underlying records maintained by a61760 2 the united nations stabilization mission in haiti minustah the united nations organization mission in the democratic republic of the congo monuc and unmik in number of instances payments to fuel vendors were processed without adequate supporting documentation and verification onub and unama did not have the relevant price indices with which prices being charged by the vendors could be verified that is critica l because fuel prices are volatile and not fixed in the contract in some missions there were vacancies in the fuel unit that needed to be filled immediately to ensure the proper discha rge of fuel management functions for example in onub some critical fuel management tasks were either being undertaken by junior staff members or left to the contractor in the united nations mission in the sudan unmis some critical tasks were not being performed satisfactorily in some missions the receipt and inspection of fuel deliveries were not consistently performed which led to the acceptance by unama and the united nations assistance mission for iraq unami of fuel inferior to contract specifications monuc onub unami unmis and unoci had contingency plans to ensure the continuity of fuel supply that is critical because of the unstable environment missions operate in and because in some cases missions relied on single supplier as result of the weaknesses in the processing of invoices and ambiguities in the fuel contracts unmik overpaid cont ractor by approximately 2 million over period of four years also in monuc prepayments of 19 million were made to contractor for fuel reserves that were not delivered oios noted instances of noncompliance with the provisions of the procurement manual in the procurement of fuel products in minustah unama and unami in unmis the amended contract for the supply of fuel included additional costs of 9 million for operation and maintenance charges although the united nations had the option to extend the contract at the original terms with lower rate the mission also paid the ctor 921000 for fuel equipment at rates higher than those provided for in the contract and for the procurement of some additional equipment not provided for in the contract without any formal amendment to the contract oios recommende d that further investigation be made of the irregularities discussed in the present re port and that appropriate action be taken against staff members found responsible for such instances of waste and mismanagement oios made 182 recommendations including 83 considered to be critical in the audit reports that were issued to the management of the 10 missions audited out of the 182 recommendations made 174 were accepte d most of which were already in the process of being implemented as of th date of the present report oios will monitor the status of actions taken by the missions in implementing oios recommendations a61760 3 contents paragraphs page i introduction 13 4 ii internal controls over the monitoring of fuel

__________________ 1 the following missions were covered by the audit united nations stabilization mission in haiti minustah united nations organization missi on in the democratic republic of the congo monuc united nations operation in burundi onub united nations assistance mission in afghanistan unama united nations assistance mission for iraq unami united nations mission in ethiopia and eritrea unm ee united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik united nations ssion in liberia unmil united nations mission in the sudan unmis and united nations operation in côte divoire unoci a61760 5 ii internal controls over the monitoring of fuel consumption inadequate 4 internal controls over the monitoring of fuel consumption should include procedures to prevent or identify potential irregularities early on in the process oios found that the internal control mechanism to monitor fuel consumption in all missions had either not been established or was inadequate as explained below in unama unmis and unmik there were systems in place to monitor fuel consumption the department of peacekeep ing operations commented that fuel log an electronic fuel system had been implemented in unmik and that it is standard practice to verify fuel import and distribution to fuel locations to facilitate prompt detection and correction of discrepancies b in unoci the system of monitoring was ineffective and inefficient because several manual processes and spreadsheets were used for review and analysis in onub because the mission electronic fuel accounting system was only partially implemented number of spreadsheets were still being used to monitor fuel consumption in addition the monitoring of fuel consumption commenced only six to eight weeks after invoices were paid c in unmee inspections of fuel fa cilities at locations away from asmara were conducted infrequently d in unmil fuel consumption by united nationsowned equipment which represented 40 per cent of equipment deployed in unmil was not adequately monitored because the monitoring of fuel consumption was focused on contingentowned equipment and in monuc procedures for the monitoring of fuel consumption in the transport and engineering sections for united nations and contingentowned equipment in kisangani bunia and goma were not documented moreover the transport section in kinshasa did not monitor the fuel consumed by contingentowned vehicles because it was not cl ear who should conduct the monitoring and how it should be accomplished the department of peacekeeping operations commented that mef as is being implemented in monuc the department added that technical compliance cell was established in october 2006 to expedite the implementation of mef as train the fuel staff and develop standard operating procedures daily data entry is now performed to assist the transport and engineering sections in monitoring fuel consumption 5 in onub and unmis the monitoring of fuel consumed by contingentowned equipment was inadequate in onub none of the contingents submitted the complete set of fuel consumption reports for the months reviewed in unmis there was assurance of the continuity of fu records kept by military contingents when contingent was rotated the exiting team took along its fuel accounting records making it impossible to verify transactions relating to particular contingent and period also the records ke pt by one of the military contingents at kadugli did not show the stock balances for bulk deliveries 6 oios found abnormal fuel consumption patterns in onub unama unmik and unoci and discrepancies between sa mple physical counts conducted by oios and the underlying records maintained by minustah monuc and unmik the missions were unable to explain th irregular consumption patterns and a61760 6 discrepancies noted in unmee and onub records of fuel in tanks were not maintained to determine book balances with which periodic physical measurements could be reconciled 7 because of the lack of uniform monitoring mechanism in the missions and the varying levels of controls put in place for the monitoring of fuel consumption and the corresponding records kept or the ck thereof see related findings in paras 3336 below oios was unable to make consolidated summary of all the discrepancies and abnormal consumption patterns found the individual audit reports issued to the missions concerned discuss in detail examples of irregular consumption patterns and disc repancies where the ava ilability of mission records enabled oios to analyse them 8 in its report on the audit of fuel management in unamsil dated 29 december 2004 oios had recommended that mefas should be replicated in other peacekeeping missions to strengthen internal controls on fuel management the current audits found that only few missions have started implementing the system and only partially as of july 2006 monuc was still in the process of implementing mefas in onub the implementation of mefas covered only 50 per cent of the missions vehicles and the system was not being used for generators and aircraft mefas if properly implemented is an effective and efficient tool to identify abnormal fuel consumption patterns 9 for example soon after the implementation of mefas in onub system generated report indicating unusual consumption patterns was used to successfully investigate fuel theft evidence showed the existence of syndicate of onub and contractor personnel which had perpetrated the theft by means of onub staff signing inflated vehicle fuel dockets fuel not dispensed into vehicles was alleged to have been sold in the local market and the proceeds distributed among the perpetrators at the conclusion of the investigation conducted by the onub security section the of ficerincharge of administration recommended that disciplinary action be taken against the implicated staff members oios will continue to monitor the status of this case 10 oios recommended that further invest igation be made of the irregularities discussed above and that appropriate acti on be taken against staff members found responsible for substantiated instances of waste and mismanagement iii internal controls ov er payments to vendors need improvement inadequate documentation and verification of payments 11 regulation 58 b of the financial regulations and rules of the united nations2 states that the secretarygeneral shall cause all payments to be made on the basis of supporting vouchers and other documents which ensure that the services or goods have been received and that payments have not previously been made oios found that internal controls over payments were weak in many missions and did not include adequate supporting documentation as explained below __________________ 2 stsgb20037 of 9 may 2003 a61760 7 monuc made prepayments of 19 million to vendor for reserve fuel stocks that were never delivered an oil company owned by the government of the democratic republic of the congo and private companies controls the supply and allocation of fuel to vendors in the country under that arrangement the oil company sends confirmation letters to all fu vendors on their available daily fuel stock balances monuc had direct contractual relationship with the oil company and the mission relied on the governmentcontrolled oil companys statements of fuel balances to vendors as evidence that fuel had been reserved for monuc without verifying the actual delivery of the fuel in its response to the draft report monuc explained the circumstances surrounding the prepayment and commented that as of october 2006 it had recovered 500000 from the vendor and that the balance of 14 million would be withheld from the vendor s outstanding invoices the department of peacekeeping operations however commented that the 19 million fuel reserve purchased by monuc was delivered and measures were put in place to ensure that fuel is available to monuc at all times this purchase of fuel used as strategic reserve not only allowed the mission to operate during two major crises but also yielded savings of approximately 12 million since the cost of fuel increased substantially between the purchase of the reserve and final delivery however the oios audit showed that the vendor had not in fact positioned the fuel contrary to the confirmation by the monuc chief supply section of such positioning by the vendor furthermore the department of peacekeeping operations provided documentary evidence supporting the fuel delivery oios continues to assert that the fuel had not been delivered by the vendor and will monitor the status of actions taken by the mission until the remaining prepayments 14 million ve been fully recovered b in unoci payments for fuel deliveries were not supported by receiving and inspection reports in unmee receiving and inspection reports were prepared without actually verifying the quantities delivered in unami fuel invoices were paid on the basis of vendors documentation without actual physical inspection by the receiving and inspection unit the department of peacekeeping operations commented that physical inspection of fuel deliveries in unami are routinely carried out by the receiving and inspection unit and that the results of the inspections are now documented and countersigned by the representatives of the selfaccounting units c in minustah payments were not supported by original documents such as fuelling tickets for aviation fuel and delivery notes for generator fuel in onub documentation provided by vendors for each importation of fuel was inconsistent and did not always comp ly with the contract requirements the department of peacekeeping operations co mmented that the processing of invoices in minustah has been streamlined and that payments are now based on the originals of the required supporting documents 12 with regard to the validity of fuel prices the vendors did not consistently provide onub and unama with the relevant price indices needed to verify fuel prices 13 unmis did not have mechanism to verify whether the fuel being delivered to the mission was sourced locally or was imported in the absence of such mechanism the contractor could be and was in fact paid at higher rate the contractor issued two credit notes to the mission totalling 183483 when it a61760 8 discovered that certain amount of local fuel was erroneously charged at import rates in this case it was the contract or and not the mission who discovered and pointed out the excess payment 14 oios will monitor the status of actions taken by the missions in implementing its recommendations and where appropri ate will recommend disciplinary action against those found accountable for the lapses b ineffective internal controls over the processing of invoices led to overpayments 15 internal controls over the processing of invoices should include procedures to ensure that payments are made accurately and on timely basis in unmee unmik unmis and unoci the payment pr ocesses for fuel invoices were not streamlined or well coordinated between the units involved in the process this significant weakness was generally caused by the unclear definitio n and division of roles and responsibilities between the units as result the following lapses in internal controls occurred overpayment of approximately 2 million over period of four years to major fuel contractor in unmik the overpayment was also caused by the ambiguity of contract provisions for the setting of fuel prices unmik commented that recovery action would be taken immedi ately the mission retained the sum of 200000 from the vendors outstanding invoices since september 2005 the sum of 1 million was to be withheld from the vendor s february and march 2006 invoices and the balance was to be offset against the vendor s april and may 2006 invoices when received the vendor still maintains that it is entitled to the 2 million sales cost it charged the mission b onemonth delay in effecting payments to fuel vendors in unmee and unoci delay of between 1 and 45 days was also noted in onub in some instances of delayed payments the contract ors threatened to withhold deliveries of fuel to the mission until their invoices were paid c ninemonth to oneyear delay in determining the final prices for the second third and fourth fuel shipments in unmis as such the mission continued to apply the rate of the first shipment to the succeeding fuel shipments in paying the vendor c inadequate control over price changes 16 internal controls over changes in the prices of fuel should include procedures to ensure that such changes are authorized and valid in onub with the exception of the first price amendment in september 2004 price changes had not been effected through contract amendment the contractor increased the price of aviation fuel on 22 december 2004 from 068 to 073 per litre as well as the price of diesel from 068 to 078 per litre without the missions prior approval onub became aware of the increase only when the invoices for april 2005 were being processed for payment approval for the price increase was granted on an ex post facto basis a61760 9 17 in unama the administration approved and paid winterized diesel surcharge of 00704 per gallon imposed by one of the fuel contractors for the period from 15 november 2005 to 31 march 2006 during that period the mission procured 641919 litres of diesel fuel from the contractor with winterized diesel surcharge amounting to total of 45191 however approval for that additional payment was obtained from the headquarters committee on contracts 18 in another fuel contract memorandum of understanding between unama and the united nations humanitarian air services unhas the pricing terms and provisions stated that fuel shall be delivered to unama at the prevailing landed price at the location where unama requires the fuel which shall include transportation and handling but free from unhas administrative charges the oios review of unhas charges indicated however that unama paid an additional 3700 because unhas unilaterally decided to charge the mission an additional 003 per litre of fuel delivered as demurrage cost for the period 1 january to march 2006 b unhas had added the proportionate loss which it sustained owing to the difference between the actual quantity of fuel received and the quantity delivered by its supplier because of temperature and humidity difference between the fuel depot and the delivery site 19 in unmis contractor was paid to tal of 921000 for fuel equipment at rates higher than the contract rates an d b additional items of equipment not provided for in the contract without ny formal amendment to the contract unmis commented that it found the total equipment required and approved in the contract to be insufficient for its operations also the task orders issued were actually approved after checking the requirements on the ground further review was ongoing to validate the values highlighted by oios and the united nations procurement service will be consulted accordingly iv overriding of internal contro ls resulted in irregularities in procurement 20 oios identified the following instances of irregularities in the procurement of fuel extension of fuel contract with terms unfavourable to unmis in unmis the amended contract with vendor for the supply of fuel will result in an additional cost of 9 million towards operation and maintenance charges although the united nations had the option to extend the contract at the original terms with lower rate unmis explained that this amendment was made directly by the united nations procurement service at headquarters oios will follow up with the department of peacekeeping operations and the united nations procurement service to determine accountability for the lapse award for longterm ground fuel requirements in minustah b best and final offer bafo was solicited without complying with the procurement manual requirements for such solicitation specifically bidder who a61760 10 was assessed to be technically noncompliant was invited to submit bafo in addition there were indications that th vendor may have benefited from insider information in its response to the bafo exercise the vendor offered the required mobilization arrangements at additional cost to minustah exactly as indicated by the technical evaluation team in its inte rnal report when they proposed the bafo exercise and the vendor became the lowest bidder c because of the above irregularities the headquarters committee on contracts recommended that the contract be awarded to another bidder and the controller requested the chairman of th headquarters committee on contracts to remind the chief procurement officer of minustah to adhere to the procurement rules and that vendor should be given any preferential treatment d minustah commented that the decision to obtain the bafo was based on the unanimous decision made by the tender evaluation committee in conformity with the provisions of the procurement manual and in the best interests of the organization consideration of the other vendor s proposal as sole proposal since the current contractor s proposal was deem ed technically noncompliant owing to nonsubmission of mobilization plan would not have been in the best interest of the organization oios notes that the vendor had been the missions fuel provider and had demonstrated that it had the nece ssary capacity to pply fuel in the mission area therefore rather than declaring the vendors proposal technically noncompliant owing to its failure to provide the required mobilization schedule the mission should have asked the vendor to provide the missing information in accordance with paragraph 1033 c of the procurement manual award for longterm aviation fuel requirements in minustah in response to its solicitation of proposals for longterm aviation fuel requirements minustah received only one proposal with very high price offer moreover the only proposer indicated that it had formed consortium with three other vendors although the minustah procurement section expressed its concern over the risk of possible collusi on between the vendors resulting from the consortium and stated that the contractors price was very high the mission did not rebid the requirements but proposed to the local committee on contracts that the mission negotiate with the vendor for better terms the bafo turned out to be unsuccessful because the contractor did not change its offer f the local committee on contracts and the hea dquarters committee on contracts endorsed the minustah proposal for negotiated contract with this contractor while raising some concerns over the ability of minustah to carry out large and complex bidding exercise and the appropriateness of bafo involving sole bidder however the controller rejected the recommendation of the headquarters committee on contracts because local procurement authority had not been granted to minustah for aviation fuel and b the bid had resulted in sole sourcing at price considered excessively high the controller requested the united nations procurement service to conduct new bidding exercise based on specifications vetted by the departme nt of peacekeeping operations minustah commented that as of july 2006 bids in response to the rebidding exercise were received by the united nations procurement service and that the department of peacekeeping operations has requested the minustah fuel cell to assist with the technical evaluation a61760 11 unsigned contract for the shortterm supply of aviation fuel in minustah g while procurement for the longterm supply of aviation fuel in minustah was under way the missions shortterm requirements were being met by vendor b from june to 28 september 2004 vendor supplied the mission with aviation fuel from 29 september 2004 to july 2006 vendor b had been delivering aviation fuel to the mission however neither vendor nor b had signed contract for that shortterm arrangement h in its presentation to the local committee on contracts to regularize the arrangements with vendor b the minust ah procurement section indicated that vendor b had assured the mission that it would offer the same or better rates than vendor and that vendor b had extensive experience in supplying fuel to large organizations such as the united nations both the local committee on contracts and the headquarters committee on contracts endorsed the procurement action the local committee on contracts cited financia l rule 10516 ie competitive marketplace exists and prices are fixed by legislation or government regulation as the basis for recommending the award to vendor b i according to the minustah fuel cell vendor bs unit prices exceeded vendor as rates by up to 40 per cent and totalled 513364 for the period from july 2005 to february 2006 or monthly average of 64170 applying this monthly average over the period from oc tober 2004 to june 2005 577530 oios estimated that by ordering aviation fuel from vendor b instead of vendor minustah incurred additional costs of 11 million for the period vendor b had supplied aviation fuel to the mission minustah commented that the mission does not believe it has paid excessively fo r aviation fuel b the cost charged by vendor b is slightly higher as compared with international market rates which are closely monitored by the supply and procurement section and c the situation is dictated by the local market conditions which in the case of aviation fuel is totally monopolistic the department of peacekeeping operations however stated that an investigation is ongoing to determine whether minustah has paid charges to vendor in excess of another vendor s rates the result of the investigation will be communicated to oios j there is need to expedite the completion of the procurement action for the longterm supply of aviation fuel in order to ensure that the mission gets the most economical and competitive price and the missions air operations are not disrupted minustah commented that it has followed up with the united nations headquarters for the early conclusion of longterm supply contract for aviation fuel and will continue to pursue the matter until the contract is finalized k oios will monitor the status of the actions taken with respect to the procurement of the longterm contracts for ground and aviation fuel in minustah including accountability for the lapses noncompliance with procurement guidelines in unami and unama l in unami the mission did not elicit competitive offers during the bidding exercise in june 2004 for the procurement of fuel in kuwait because the time given for the vendors to respond to the bid was limited to two calendar days nor did the terms and conditions of the contract specify the missions right to test the products and seek reimbursement for discrepancies in quality moreover the a61760 12 missions requirement for benzene with 98 octane rating was in excess of the octane grade of 91 recommended by the vehicle manufacturer and m in unama oios noted case of noncompliance with the requirement on the minimum number of invitees to participate in bidding exercise and another case where contract was awarded to vendor who did not participate in the bidding exercise also the octane rating specified by the mission for unleaded gasoline was in excess of the octane rating recommended by the vehicle manufacturer oios will monitor th above cases to confirm that its recommendations have been implemented by unama and unami v staffing issues 21 table 2 shows the number of filled and vacant posts in the fuel unitcell of the following missions table 2 analysis of vacant posts in fuel unitcell posts mission authorized filled vacant monuc 5 2 3 onub 7 3 4 unmis 30 13 17 total 42 18 24 includes international fi eld service and national staff monuc and onub numbers represent posts only in th professional category 22 because of these vacancies some important tasks were either being undertaken by junior staff members or assigned to the contractor in onub in unmis the following tasks were not performed satisfactorily development of missionspecific st andard operating procedures for fuel management b determination of price for each shipment received c analysis of consumption data d development of contingency plan to ensure the continuity of fuel supply 23 unama did not have single unit responsible for the monitoring of fuel consumption nor did the mission have dedica ted fuel officers in the mazaresharif and maimana offices as result fuel m onitoring was not adequately addressed in unama a61760 13 vi internal controls not establ ished to monitor continuity of fuel supply 24 provisions for contingency in case of interruption or shortage in fuel supply were inadequate hence there was assurance as to the continuity of fuel supply in the following missions monuc onub unami unmis and unoci did not have documented and tested contingency plan to ensure the continuity of fuel supply the department of peacekeeping operations commented that the standard practice at unmis is to maintain 30 days of fuel supply at all locations as local reserve as contingency plan fuel technicians and detachments from the bangladesh petroleum platoon at all sector headquarters locations can operate the fuel installations in circumstances where the contractor is not able to do so this plan was implemented in malakal during novemberdecember 2006 where the contractor s staff members were evacuated owing to an outbreak of fighting fuel support continued uninterrupted with the assistance of the bangladesh petroleum platoon in the opinion of oios the maintenance of 30 days fuel supply at unmis did not substitute for having contingency plan b onub and monuc had not developed the required risk assessment matrix and the corresponding risk mitigation plan for the mission the matrix and plan are intended to identify risks that could impinge the continuity of fuel supply and to present plan to ma nage the identified risks the department of peacekeeping operations commented that formal operational risk assessment had been completed on 6 february 2007 several important key elements noted in the report will be incorporated in the development of continuity and disaster recovery plan c the unoci risk assessment matrix did not cover the risks and appropriate mitigation measures based on lessons learned from the political and security crises in the country which had led to the evacuation of staff in the past for example the matrix did not include and address the missions inability to access the fuel installations of the contractor and to transfer fuel from one location to another and the lack of an operational plan and measures to be taken to refuel vehicles and aircraft during evacuation d the level of fuel reserves in unmee was below the minimum critical level necessary to ensure continuity of operations in the event of an emergency the chief of the fuel cell in unmis was the only staff member in khartoum with the technical knowledge and institutional memory on fuel operations in the mission in unami the fuel contract administrator did not have backup the lack of backup personnel to discharge critical functions in the absence of the chief could heighten the missions exposure to the risk of interruption of fuel operations 25 moreover the unami operations in iraq and unoci relied heavily on one supplier for the provision of fuel that situation increased the risk of interruption in the supply of fuel in the event that the sole supplier in the mission area is unable to supply or meet the missions fuel require ments which could adversely affect the mission operations the department of peacekeeping operations commented that a61760 14 unami has now created reserve storage capability in all fuel locations in sufficient quantity to address any risk of interruption vii safety security and environmental practices safety and environmental practices 26 the oios review of safety and environmental practices and inspection visits to sample fuel sites indicated the following firefighting capacity in onub was limited and the areas around fuel tanks were not adequately protected from fuel spillages b fire safety hazards were noted at the prizren and gjakova fuel stations in unmik c in unmil oios noted actual fuel spillages and the potential for fuel contamination at certain fuel sites in addition there was inadequate or firefighting equipment at the sites visited fuel tanks were not installed on level ground or hardsurface platforms d in unmis there were damaged fuel bladders the firefighting capacity at two team sites was impaired when fire extinguishers were sent out to elobeid or khartoum for refilling the department of peacekeeping operations commented that the damaged fuel bladders are being replaced by the fuel contractor under the warranty clause contained in the contract at cost to unmis fire extinguishers were not installed at certain fuel sites in unoci and unama f fuel storage areas at the bunia aviation fuel farm in monuc were not adequately secured the capacity of fire extinguishers was insufficient given the significant quantity of fuel kept at the in stallation fuel drums were placed on the grass diesel bladder was leaking and the surrounding berms did not contain the leakage thereby polluting the environment seven team sites that handled diesel did not have fire extinguishers b security 27 physical access to the main generato r houses in the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian and economic assistance programmes relating to afghanistan unoca compound and complex b where unama has offices was not controlled in unmee security measures were implemented mainly as reaction to incidents of theft and pilferage rather than in anticipation of threat events for instance the loss of 37 fuel drums in adiguadad resulted in stricter security measures and the loss of 18700 litres of aviation fuel owing to the unexplained rupture in fuel bladder in ptember 2005 resulted in the transfer of the remaining fuel to hard tanks a61760 15 c quality contro l of fuel supplies 28 fuel deliveries were not always inspect ed for quality assura nce for example bulk deliveries of diesel in monuc were not physically inspected by the receiving and inspection unit in minustah fuel deliveries were not inspected either because testing kits purchased in june 2005 had still not been distributed to all fuel sites in the mission as at the time of the audit july 2006 moreover the fuel cell in minustah explained that in the absenc of formal contracts with vendors it was difficult to enforce qua lity control requirements 29 the unama regional and subregional offices did not have system to check the quality of vehicle and generator fuel the mission relied on the suppliers statement about the quality of fuel as result unama had received contaminated fuel from one of its vendors and fuel inferior to the quality specified in the contract 30 the lack of quality checks in unami allowed the fuel contractor to supply benzene with 95 octane rating instead of the 98 octane rating that was contracted for which unduly benefited the contractor in an amount estimated at 20240 during the period 1 june 2004 to 9 september 2006 31 the above deficiencies were caused by the nonenforcement of the standard operating procedures on safety security and environmental practices and the insufficient number of staff to enforc or monitor the implementation of the standard operating procedures 32 the department of peacekeeping operations stated that minustah has distributed the testing kits and that the relevant staff members are being trained to do the testing in complianc with quality control requi rements at unami the acquisition of fuel testing equipment is in progress meanwhile periodic quality spotchecks are now conducted in local laboratory viii standard operating procedures 33 some of the weaknesses discussed in the present report were caused by the inconsistent and limited application of th department of peacekeeping operations fuel operations manual as explained below the fuel cell of unama and unami had been managing fuel operations without the standard operating procedures during the course of the audit oios provided them with copy of the standard operating procedures the missions indicated that they will start to implement and customize the standard operating procedures as appropriate b the procedures in the fuel operations manual were designed predominantly for fuel operations managed by united nations staff as opposed to the turnkey operations in onub unmis and minustah c the draft monuc standard operati ng procedures did not adequately and consistently reflect mission practices for example there were variations in record keeping practices such as for lubricant stock records in kisangani bunia and goma a61760 16 d unoci had not implemented the standard operating procedures on quality control and inspections safety s ecurity and environmental practices and planning for fuel requirements 34 oios acknowledges the efforts of the department of peacekeeping operations in drafting and publishing the fuel operations manual however in the opinion of oios there is need to expedite the completion and promulgation of the standard operating procedures which are still in draf t form table 3 shows
