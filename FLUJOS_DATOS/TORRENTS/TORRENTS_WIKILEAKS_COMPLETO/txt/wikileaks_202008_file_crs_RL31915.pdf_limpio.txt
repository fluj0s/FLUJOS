state should follow with respect to such accessions but article 11 does provide that this treaty shall be ratified and its provisions carried out by the parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes the senate gave its advice and consent to the north atlantic treaty on july 21 1949 by vote of 82133 it did not include formal condition regarding the senates role in any future enlargement of nato in its resolution of ratification but the issue was matter of concern during the hearings held by the senate committee on foreign relations on the treaty senator vandenberg the ranking member posed specific question on the matter to secretary of state dean acheson and received the following carefully prepared response senator i am authorized by the president of the united states to say that in his judgment the accession of new members to this treaty creates in regard to each new member coming in effect new treaty between the united states and that nation and that therefore the president would consider it necessary to ask for the advice and c onsent of the senate before himself agreeing to the admission of new member 4 3 95 cong rec 9916 july 21 1949 4

acheson subsequently id at 4849 discussed whether president trumans commitment would be binding on subsequent presidents senator vandenberg mr secretary you recall that you quoted the president as saying that if he were confronted with the problem of deciding whether or not to accede to the addition of other members to the pact he would consider that this involved the equivalent of writing new treaty and so far as he is concerned he would seek the advice and consent of the senate secretary acheson yes sir senator vandenberg that protects us up to 1952 i do not mean to put limitation at that point but after all this treaty runs for 20 years what pr otects us if as and when this president concludes to retire voluntarily or otherwise secretary acheson i think there is precedent senator the chairman would this not be precedent would not the statement of the president in the event it transpired within that periodand the custom and the practice would that not make precedent that the others would respect secretary acheson yes sir this mere statement would be precedent but i was going to say that there is precedent for the fact that statement made by sitting president in regard to presidential interpretation of the treaty and what should be done under it is accepted by his successors as statement coming from the presidential office senator vandenberg you yourself evidently considered it to be somewhat important point i judge from the degree of attention which you gave to arming yourself with thoroughly adequate answer the chairman along the line of the interrogation the presidential action in saying that this is matter for congress and the executive would certainly have some influence at least i hope on successor secretary acheson i should think it would make it clear that the basis of the thing is what the president said that it is in effect new treaty with new state the chairman exactly it either has to be new treaty or modification of an existing treaty and the consent of the congress is required in any even t i think the president was exactly right in that attitude because if he could make treaty wit hout referring it to the senate at all he would abrogate almost the advice and consent clause of the constitution continued

foreign relations on the treaty commented specifically on the senates role with respect to the admission of new members to nato as follows inasmuch as the admission of new members might radically alter our obligations under the pact the committee examined article 10 very carefully the question arose whether any united states decision respecting new members would be based solely on presidential action or would require senate approval consequently the committee was fully satisfied by the commitment of the president delivered by the secretary of state that he would consider the admission of new member to the pact as the conclusion of new treaty with that member and would seek the advice and consent of the senate to each such admission the committee considers this an obligation binding upon the presidential office 5 as noted above this commitment has been honored in all five of the subsequent enlargements of nato in each instance protocol providing for the inclusion of an additional state or states in nato has been negotiated and the protocol has been submitted to the senate for its advice and consent

thereafter the kingdom of greece and the republic of turkey shall each become party on the date when it deposits its instrument of accession with the government of the united states in accordance with article 10 of the treaty president truman submitted the protocol to the senate for its advice and consent on january 10 19526 and the senate approved the protocol without conditions on february 7 1952 by vote of 7327 the report of the senate committee on foreign relations which unanimously recommended approval of the protocol recalled and reiterated president trumans commitment to seek senate advice and consent to any enlargement of na to as follows before the senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the north atlantic treaty on july 21 1949 it received the presidents assurance delivered by the secretary of state during the hearings on the treaty that continued secretary acheson i think the statement that was made on behalf of the president really puts the question to rest i do not think that any future president in the light of that statement would undertake to vote for the admission of new member and any new member would be very ill advised to let the matter
