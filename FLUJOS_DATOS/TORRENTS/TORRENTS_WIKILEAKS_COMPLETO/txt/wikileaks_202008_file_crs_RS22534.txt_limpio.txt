regarding debt reliefs effectiveness as form of foreign assistance for possible congressional consideration it will be updated as events warrant the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri is the most recent effort by the international monetary fund imf world bank and african development bank afdb to provide poor country debt relief proposed by g8 finance ministers in june 2005 the mdri provides 100 debt relief to select countries that are already participating in the jointimfworld bank heavily indebted poor countries hipc program1 the goal of the mdri program is to free up additional resources for the poorest countries in order to help them reach the united nations millennium development goals mdgs which are focused among other things on reducing world poverty by half by 20152 there are several key features of the mdri all preexisting imf world bank and afdb debt will be cancelled for any country that completes the hipc program the asian development bank

the mdri agreement provides additional net assistance hipc countries that receive debt reduction will have their total assistance flows from the agency canceling their debt reduced by the amount of debt forgiven the imf will internally fund its debt relief while the world bank and afdb will be compensated by g8 donors imf debt relief will be funded with the money obtained from the sale of some imf gold in the late 1990s the mdri raises several questions for policy makers what is the effect of debt on the poorest countries what impact can the mdri be expected to have on poverty reduction what policies could make debt relief more effective looking at several studies of the effectiveness of the hipc program from 19962006 it appears that although debt relief can slightly increase the amount of financial resources available to poor countries the debt burden is not the main impediment to poverty reduction and economic growth in the poorest countries weak macroeconomic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22534 institutions and difficulty absorbing foreign assistance as well as political challenges appear more likely hurdles alleviating the debt burden in the absence of other strategic reforms is unlikely to substantially contribute to improved conditions in the poorest countries if combined with other efforts however debt relief can have complementary effect on domestic government finances and can help promote further reform past debt relief efforts the mdri builds on several bilateral and multilateral debt relief initiatives conducted over the past twenty years in the 1980s and early 1990s as the debts of the poorest countries increased rapidly compared to other lowincome countries the g7 and other creditor countries implemented several plans aimed at reducing the countries debt payment burden bilateral debt relief in 1988 in response to g7 initiative group of major creditor nations known as the paris club agreed for the first time to cancel debts owed to them by up to onethird instead of refinancing them on easier terms as they had done previously4 over the next decade the paris club gradually increased the amount of debt that it would be willing to write off by up to 90 in 1999 the united states did not participate in the initial debt forgiveness plans but in 1991 at the initiative of congress independently forgave almost all of the debt owed to it by the poorest nations since 1991 the united states has forgiven 239 billion in foreign debt5 hipc debt relief the imf and world bank introduced debt relief in 1996 through the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative when conceived the intention of the program was to reduce poor countries debts to socalled sustainable level sustainability was defined as multilateral debts not exceeding maximum debtto 4 see crs report rs21482 the paris club and international debt relief by martin weiss 5 us treasury department and the office of management and budget us government foreign credit

from debt relief the target debt servicetoexports ratio was reduced to 150 and the time period for eligibility was shortened the hipc program was also modified to require increased poverty reduction efforts any money freed up by debt relief must now be used explicitly on poverty reduction efforts hipc debt relief is provided in stages based on each countrys performance against defined set of economic targets and requirements hipceligible countries must successfully implement imfproscribed reforms for three years before reaching the decision point and receiving intermediate debt relief

source world bank mdri debt relief the eventual mdri agreement was compromise agreement between the united states and the europeans us officials had reportedly argued that the cost of multilateral debt relief could be borne by the institutions and did not require donors contributing any new assistance other creditors believed the institutions should be compensated for their debt forgiveness to avoid diverting potential resources that could be lent to the poorest countries any debt relief they argued should be additional to existing multilateral assistance the compromise plan entailed the multilateral development banks receiving new money from creditor nations to offset their debt reductions while the imf would absorb the cost of debt relief using internal resources6 6 eric helleiner and geoffrey cameron another world order the bush administration and continued crs4 mdri implementation the imf was the first of the participating institutions to implement its mdri debt relief under mdri the imf is cancelling all hipc debt incurred by yearend 2004 in addition to the eligible hipc countries the imf expanded mdri to all imf members with per capita incomes of 380 or less two nonhipc countries cambodia and tajikistan have qualified for mdri debt relief to date the imf has provided mdri debt relief to 21 countries totaling 367 billion the imf expects that total mdri debt relief will be around 5 billion if all eligible countries complete the program unlike the imf both the world bank and the asian development bank are only providing mdri relief to hipc completion point countries only debts accrued prior to yearend 2003 are eligible for world bankafdb mdri debt relief if fully implemented the world bank will provide about 37 billion in debt relief african development bank debt relief would be 85 billion policy issues there are numerous reasons why policymakers support poor country debt relief httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22534 debt relief emerged as foreign policy issue mainly through moral arguments against requiring the poorest countries to repay their debts at united nations conference on africa in 2004 columbia university professor and united nations advisor jeffrey sachs remarked civilized nation should try to collect the debts of people who are dying of hunger and disease and poverty7 others including the bush administration presented what they viewed as pragmatic argument for debt relief they argued that debt was locking these poorest countries into poverty and preventing them from using their own resources for development8 by providing debt relief they argued resources that would have been allocated for debt repayments would now be redirected toward new investment andor domestic social services at press release announcing the mdri deal former world bank president paul wolfowitz announced that across africa and around the world leaders in 38 countries will longer have to choose between spending to benefit their people and repaying impossible debts9 recent studies cast doubt however on debt reliefs contribution to larger development and poverty reduction goals these studies argue that poor underlying economic and political conditions are the main reason for the hipcs poor performance in light of this research congress may wish to explore in more depth what effect debt has 6 continued the hipc debt cancellation

countries economies and under what conditions debt relief can help promote economic growth and poverty reduction how debt affects the hipc countries historically policymakers and academics viewed high levels of debt as constraint on economic growth it was argued that as long as investors expected countrys debt level to impair its ability to repay its loans its debt overhang investors would abstain from entering country out of concern that the government may resort to distortionary or inflationary measures such as expanding the money supply or raising taxes on their profits to finance debt payments even if the debt is not being serviced the theory suggests that it is still an impediment to economic growth because of the effect the large debt stock has of dissuading private investors in debt overhang situation the appropriate policy response is to forgive the debt either entirely or to some sustainable level so that investor confidence will be restored10 debt overhang theory was instrumental in driving the development of the hipc program over time however it became apparent that the theory was not especially well suited for the poorest countries which relied on foreign assistance rather than private investment as their key source of foreign capital httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22534 according to the world banks 2006 evaluation of the hipc program debt relief alone is not sufficient for debt sustainability in the poorest countries under hipc 18 countries had their debt levels reduced to half their initial levels cancelling 19 billion of external debt however in 11 out of the 13 countries with data available the debt situation has worsened in 8 countries debt levels once again exceed hipc thresholds11 several reasons may explain this situation first the concepts of sustainable debt and debt overhang may be inappropriate for the hipc countries earlier debt overhang models were designed with middleincome countries in mind which were suffering under heavy nonconcessional private debt for example when financial crises hit latin american countries in the 1980s their debts were resolved under the brady plan negotiated by former secretary of the treasury nicholas brady the forgiveness of debt amounted to 60 billion after which private capital surged into the brady countries these countries received 210 billion dollars in net capital flows in the five years following their debt writeoff12 in the case of the hipc countries investors were more likely to stay away for other reasons such as political and economic instability rather than any concerns about indebtedness per moreover unlike other debtor nations bilateral and multilateral hipc debt is highly concessional ie inexpensive compared to private sector debt foreign aid providers have not stopped their aid just because they are not being repaid 10 paul krugman financing vs forgiving debt overhang journal of development economics vol 29 1988 pp 253268 and jeffrey sachs the debt overhang

debt at the crossroads edited by chris jochnick and fraser preston oxford university press 2006 crs6 100 on their bilateral debt moreover the inflow of foreign aid funds is typically more than sufficient to cover debt payments so the cost of debt service is effectively borne by the donor countries rather than by the debtors secondly there are additional factors unique to the poorest countries that may promote increased indebtedness since their debt is highly concessional there may be perverse incentive for countries not to grow in order to remain eligible for multilateral assistance preliminary evidence looking at 94 countries 33 of which are low income over 19882000 found evidence of this effect significant number of countries appeared to stagnate around the income level that defined eligibility for concessional assistance above the cutoff level countries would longer be able to receive concessional aid by diverting their assistance away from investment toward consumption they were able to hover just below the eligibility cutoff13 issues for congress high levels of debt especially in the case of the poorest and most indebted countries are largely symptom of deeper more fundamental economic and societal difficulties removing preexisting debt is not seen as improving growth or reducing poverty by itself this raises two key questions that the second httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22534 session of the 110th congress may wish to consider 1 what impact can the mdri be expected to have on poverty reduction and 2 what policies could make poor country debt relief more effective in reducing poverty andor promoting economic growth the impact of mdri debt relief will likely be modest at best first by definition mdri debt relief does not increase the overall resources available to poor countries any debt relief that country receives results in net decrease in future multilateral aid resources allocated second the amount of debt relief provided by mdri is small in the case of the 15 african hipcs on average they paid 19 million in debt service to the world bank in 2004 that same year they received 197 million in new world bank aid and 946 million in total aid14 any debt relief even if it were in addition to existing foreign aid would provide only minuscule increase in domestic resources thus it appears that debt relief can have its largest impact if it is situated as part of broader package of reforms that include among other things increased debt management capacity and targeted growth enhancing changes in national policy15 13
