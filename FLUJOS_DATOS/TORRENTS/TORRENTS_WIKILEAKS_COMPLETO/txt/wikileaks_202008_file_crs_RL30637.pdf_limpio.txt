military operations since world war ii introduction the purpose of this report is to provide information on involuntary activations of reservists for us military operations since world war ii during that time reservists have been involuntarily ordered to active duty for military operations nine times during the korean war 19501953 the berlin crisis 196162 the cuban missile crisis 1962 the vietnam

mission 1999present this report provides summary of the circumstances surrounding the activation the statutory authority used to activate the reservists the dates of activation the number of reservists activated and the number and types of units activated reservists have also volunteered to serve on active duty during the above mentioned operations and many other operations additionally reservists especially those in the national guard have often been involuntarily activated to respond to domestic disturbances ie riots and natural disasters and to execute the laws of the land notably with respect to desegregation of schools in the south furthermore many reservists have participated in training exercises or operational missions as part of their twoweek long annual training requirement however this report does not include any data on these activities its focus is exclusively on involuntary activations of reservist s for military operations format there is separate section for each of the nine involuntary activations within each section there is brief descripti on of the circumstances surrounding the activation the statutory authority used to activate the reservists the date on which involuntarily activated reservists began to enter active duty and the date when the last involuntarily activated reservists were released from active duty this is followed by table which lists the number of reservists who were involuntarily activated along with the number and types of reserve units activated the data are broken down by the seven individual reserve components army reserve army national guard naval reserve air force reserve air national guard marine corps reserve and coast guard reserve figure for the combined number of involuntarily activated reservists is also providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30637crs2 data sources wide variety of sources were used to compile the tables in this report open sources were the principal sources used to construct the commentary and tables for the korean war the berlin crisis and the cuban missile crisis activations for subsequent activations open source data were combined with official data provided by the department of defense and the various military services to construct the commentary and tables caveats the statistics in this report are subject to revision based on additional research in primary sources or the availability of more comprehensive data it should also be noted that the data in this report may not precisely match that found in earlier press and journalistic accounts which may have been based on expectations or less complete information additionally the data presented on units activated must be interpreted very cautiously providing data on units activated was exceptionally probl ematic for two reasons first when activati ng unit the services often did not activate the entire unit for example the historical record may have shown that the air force activated reserve fighter wing yet it was rarely clear which if any of that wings subordinate elements were activated with it thus the indication in this report that given unit was activated should not be taken to mean that the unit was activated in its entirety the unit may have been activated in its entirety or it may have been activated with only some of its subordinate units or it may have had only its headquarters section activated the difficulty of determining the precise composition of activated units leads to the second problem with the unit data the double counting of units for example the historical record may have shown that during given activation the army activated reserve infantry battalion and four reserve infantry companies as an infantry battalion normally has four to five infantry companies assigned underneath it one might suspect that those infantry companies were really subordinate units of the infantry battalion however absent clear evidence that those infantry companies were indeed subordinate units of the infantry battalion this report lists the activation of both the battalion and the companies this methodology creates high probability that units are counted twice however it also minimizes the likelihood that units are not counted two final caveats are in order with respect to the data contained in the tables first in addition to activating units the various military services often activated individual reservists who were not part of unit or selectively activated individual reservists within unit thus there is not necessarily correlation between the units activated and the number of reservists activated second for three of the activations mentioned here the bosnian peacekeeping mission the iraqi crisis and the kosovo conflict and peacekeeping mission reservists are still being ordered to active duty the personnel and unit data presented for these three operations is current as of february 3 2000 but will change over time this report will be updated periodically to reflect those and other changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30637crs3 1 harry s truman message to congress july 19 1950 us code congressional service volume 1 1950

premier nikita khrushchev called for the termination of british french and us occupation rights in berlin although none of these nations complied on june 3 1961 khrushchev met with president kennedy and declared that the status of berlin would be resolved during 1961 with or without the cooperation of the united states tensions mounted in the following weeks on july 26 kennedy asked congress for authority to order up to 250000 reservists to active duty congress responded with the passage of public law 87117 which was enacted on august 1 the law gave the president authority to call up to

reserves april 12 1968 1 the vietnam war background from 1961 to 1973 us forces were directly involved in military operations to suppress the viet cong communist insurgency in south vietnam and to repel the infiltration of soldiers from communist north vietnam the principal purpose of this involvement was to prevent the spread of communism to south vietnam and neighboring states such as cambodia and laos between 1964 and 1973 the peak years of us military involvement about 34 million members of the us armed forces served in the southeast asia theater6 despite this substantial military involvement in vietnam only two minor reserve activations occurred both in 19687 these activations were carried out by president lyndon b johnson under the authority granted to him by provision in pl 89 687 the fy 1967 defense appropriations bill the provision allowed the president to call to active duty without declaring state of emergency any organized unit of the ready reserve and certain individual members of the ready reserve8 the first reserve activation announced on january 25 1968 was not directly related to the war in vietnam rather it was response to the capture of the us navy intelligence ship pueblo by north korea and the subsequent reinforcement of us forces in south korea most of the units activated remained in the united states or were deployed to korea but some were stationed in vietnam9 these units entered active duty on january 26 1968 and the last units were released from active duty on june 18 1969 the second reserve activation was announced on april 11 1968 just two months after the tet offensive in south vietnam and was intended to meet the needs of the vietnam war and strengthen the depleted active strategic reserve10 these reservists
