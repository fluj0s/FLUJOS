decided by simple majority of senators voting with quorum present yet senate procedure generally lacks means for simple majority to limit consideration and proceed to vote as result senate minorities can attempt to block proposals by preventing vote from occurring practice known as filibustering filibuster opponents have long sought to institute rules permitting voting majority to limit consideration most recently in relation to judicial nominations the senate has seldom been able to adopt such limits however because any such proposal is itself subject to filibuster in addition the senate has held that its existing procedures remain continuously in effect which prevents it from considering change proposal under limits more stringent than those already in effect in this way the existing procedures that lack consideration limits tend to entrench themselves against their own change advocates of majority consideration limits have often sought ways to assure the ability of the senate to reach vote on procedural changes inasmuch as such course of action would break through the obstacles posed by existing procedures it has been called nuclear option nuclear option would presumably either make novel use of existing procedures or engage in ones previously not recognized in senate practice the plan most often discussed has been to raise point of order asserting that the senate must be able to reach vote on nominations or procedural changes in order to exercise effectively its constitutional advise and consent power or rulemaking power by sustaining such point of order the chair would establish precedent for limiting consideration of those matters opponents of the ruling could appeal and could attempt to filibuster to prevent vote on the appeal but the senate could confirm the ruling by adopting nondebatable motion to table the appeal under established procedure however only the sena itself has authority to settle points of order in ways that alter precedent or interpret the co nstitution the chair is to follow precedent in ruling and is to submit points of order raised under the constitution or where precedent exists if point of order is submitted however or ruling against point of order is appealed the point of order can be sustained only by vote and the vote might be blocked by filibuster tabling the question in this situation would have the effect of affirming previous practice only certain additional limits on consideration of point of order raised while another is pending might afford means of overcoming this difficulty under most conditions the senate might be unable to reach vote on procedural question that would institute consideration limits except by setting aside the principle that the chair adheres to precedent or that the rules remain always in effect once these principles were set aside however it might become possible for any voting majority of the senate to institute further procedural changes in other subsequent situations in the past both the senate and the house have ultimately always declined to institute change by accepting standards that would permit this result this report will not be updated

several presidential nominations for federal judgeships has been impeded by filibusters or threatened filibusters in response some leading senators have called for the senate to change its procedures to prevent filibusters or make them harder to sustain at least on this class of business filibusters are possible largely because for most matters including nominations existing senate procedures establish neither limits on the time available for consideration nor means by which voting majority may impose such limits in this sense existing senate rules largely lack provision for effective majoritarian consideration limits accordingly advocates of change in this area have focused on procedural changes that would afford more effective means for majority to limit consideration existing senate rules and procedures however also place potentially substantial obstacles in the way of adopting changes in these rules and procedures in particular the lack of effective majoritarian consideration limits also applies to the procedures under which the senate normally considers proposals for procedural change as result advocates of more effective consideration limits have sought alternative means of institutin g procedural changes that would not be subject to these difficulties

term nuclear option has often been used to refer to procedural course of action that would meet this requirement of bypassing the obstacles posed by the usual procedures for considering procedural changes critics of this form of action however have used this term also to connote that unilateral resort to such course by majority might undermine traditional practices of comity within the senate especially the expectations of predictability through consensual arrangements that have hitherto been held to characterize the body because of this connotation some advocates of this form of action have come to prefer the term constitutional option this designation appears to connote that most of the courses of action currently under consideration would rely on an appeal to constitutional requirements as grounds for instituting consideration limits 1 1 some recent examples of the usage of these terms include the following martin b gold and dinkle gupta the constitutional option to

of action that depend specifically on constitutional points of order as explained in the section on the constitutional option the term nuclear option is here used only to indicate that such course of action would constitute an alternative to conventional proceedings because of its capacity to cut comprehensively through the normal difficulties of achieving procedural change in this usage any form of nuclear option would afford the senate means to circumvent the obstacles to change posed by the usual forms of proceeding this usage leaves open whether course of action could achieve its result without compelling the senate to set aside requirements of its existing procedures in the process course that did require action at variance with established principles und erlying the system of senate procedure might be considered nuclear in more fundamental sense the reason as explained in the section on overcoming entrenchment is that it would presumably constitute precedent for subsequent departures of the same kind it is one purpose of the following discussion to identify the extent to which various courses of action described would or would not be nuclear in this strong sense g21g162g151g152g153g156g146g156g561 the chief intent of this examination is to identify some specific courses of procedural action that might be used to carry out nuclear option in the broad sense just defined it focuses on clarifying the specific features of each course that might enable the senate to avoid the obstacles to change posed by more conventional ways of proceeding it indicates what provisions of existing procedures might pose difficulties for implementing various courses of action as well as possible procedural responses by which proponents of such action might address these difficulties the discussion also identifies the features that specifically distinguish some of these courses of action as constitutional options in addition however it identifies points at which the courses of action might require proceedings at variance with existing requirements on the basis of this examination it is possible in conclusion to identify some implications that resort to nuclear option might have for the subsequent condition of senate procedure showing how course of procedural action represen ts nuclear option involves identifying the ways in which it may bypass or overcome the obstacles posed by the usual procedures to enable this examination the discussion begins by describing the nature of these obstacles and indicating how they are grounded in the existing structure of senate procedure these observations make it possible to explain more specifically not only wh at nuclear option must accomplish but also why resort to proceedings of this kind may appear attractive or necessary in the first place g22g145g142g561g515g7g151g157g155g142g151g140g145g150g142g151g157g516g561g152g143g561g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g561 the question of enhancing the ability of the senate to limit consideration of matters has dominated the procedural history of the body for well over century part of the reason for this persistence is that senate procedures have always lacked effective limits on consideration this lack of consideration limits may often enable oppone nts of proposal to block its approval even if it is supported by majority by extending its consideration indefinitely thereby preventing the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32843g515g7g151g157g155g142g151g140g145g150g142g151g157g516g561g152g143g561g21g142g151

actions of this kind that are colloquially but universally known as filibustering2 this lack of effective consideration limits also applies to the procedures normally used for consideration of proposals for procedural change in particular it extends to the consideration of any proposal to institute additional consideration limits proposals to constrain filibustering can be filibustered in this way the existing lack of consideration limits operates as continuing obstacle to the establishment of new consideration limits the persistence in the senate of the question of limiting consideration however also arises from second cause certain elements of the senates procedural system have the effect of requiring that its established procedures remain continuously in effect as result proposal to institute more effective means of limiting consideration would have to be considered in accordance with the already existing procedures the principle that existing senate procedures remain always in effect then combines with the lack of consideration limits under existing procedures to make it hard for the senate to adopt more effective consideration limits it is in this sense that senate rules have been described as entrenched against their own change 3 this section considers more specifically these two features of senate procedure which together bring about its entrenchment it examines first the procedural provisions that result in the general lack of consideration limits then the principles that result in the continuous force of the existing system of procedure on the basis of this discussion it will be possible to consider what characteristics nuclear option would have to possess in order to succeed in overcoming the entrenchment of senate procedure so as to permit the adoption of additional limits on consideration

rules of the chamber but also by standing and special orders pertinent provisions of the constitution and of statute4 the body of precedent formed by past rulings on procedural questions and informally accepted practices for most matters none of these procedural standards either places any restrictions on how long consideration may last or explicitly establishes any means for simple majority of senators voting to impose such restrictions in general only by supermajority may the senate apply the limits on consideration specified in senate rule xxii an action known as invoking cloture 5 2 see crs report rl30360 filibusters and cloture in the senate by richard s beth and stanley bach 3 this argument is developed in the context of the problem of limiting consideration in

proposal including nomination the requisite number has often lately been referred to as 51 votes although in fact it is smaller when not all senators vote the effect of senate procedures in general is to require supermajority not for the approval of items of business but only for the imposition of limits on their consideration so as to ensure that votes on their approval can occur under these arrangements even if proposal is supported by majority opponents may be able by filibuster to prevent the senate from reaching vote on it unless supporters are numerous enough to invoke cloture it is from desire to avoid possible filibusters that senate practice has historically fostered the settlement of issues through collegial processes of seeking consensual agreement inasmuch as filibusters are defined by the intent of the participants to block action their conduct is not limited to the use of any specified form of procedure although filibusters are commonly thought of as carried out through extended debate they may also be conducted by wide variety of other procedural means correspondingly although cloture is widely understood as motion for bringing debate to close it also restricts certain other actions that could be used for purposes of delay 8 senate procedure also permits debate on many procedural motions in particular motion that the senate proceed to consider bill or resolution is debatable under most circumstances by contrast however present practice permits the senate to proceed to consider nomination on non debatable motion for this reason if opponents of matter persist in filibuster reaching final continued washington gpo 2002 sec 51 see cloture procedure in us congress senate riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices sdoc 10128 101st cong

or other limits on consideration multiple times on each of several essential questions that may arise in the course of consideration for few specific questions nevertheless senate rules or other procedures do establish limits on consideration and as discussed in the next section some of these might play role in the implementation of nuclear option all these conditions of consideration apply to the conduct of senate business generally they are not specific to the consideration of proposals for procedural change only because the senates general rules of procedure also apply specifically to the consideration of proposed changes in procedure do they contribute to the entrenchment of the existing procedures specifically the lack of effective majoritarian consideration limits in existing procedure tends to entrench itself by constituting the chief obstacle to its own change in certain respects moreover the system of senate procedure places greater obstacles in the way of bringing the senate to vote on proposal to amend the standing rules than for other matters as with most other matters the senate can adopt amendments to its standing rules by simple majority of those voting on most matters however the vote required to invoke cloture is three fifths of the full senate membership 60 votes if vacancies exist while for amendments to the standing rules it is twothirds of senators voting 67 if there are vacancies and all senators vote this more demanding requirement contributes specifically to the entrenchment of the standing rules against change 9

procedures would not suffice to entrench those procedures unless the senate also required that existing procedures are to govern consideration of proposals for their own change the chief embodiment of this requirement is the senates practice of treating its rules as remaining continuously in effect even from one congress to the next and even in the absence of any action to reaffirm them this practice arises largely as consequence of the way the senate understands its status under what has been called the continuing body doctrine

senate is continuing body in this sense was explicitly enunciated at least as early as 184113

understood the implications of the fact of its continuity in different ways and it is the understanding of these implications that may be considered the continuing body doctrine under current practice of long standing the senate regards itself not only as continuing body but as continuously organized one the elected officers of the senate appear always to have been regarded as continuing in office from one congress to the next unless replaced by affirmative action of the body 14 in current practice the senate appoints its committees at the beginning of each congress but assignments are regarded as carrying over in the new congress until changed or renewed by action of the senate15 when the senate first established standing committees however its initial practice was to regard assignments as expiring at the end not only of each biennial congress but of each annual session 16 it appears by contrast that the senate has always regarded its standing rules as continuing in effect from congress to congress without affirmative action on its own part the senate implicitly decided this question by not acting to readopt revise or replace its original rules of 1789 at the convening of the first session of the second congress in october 1791 17 since then the senate has amended its rules on numerous occasions and has adopted several comprehensive recodifications not always at the beginning of congress it has generally done so with at least the tacit understanding that it was acting pursuant to the procedures established in the already existing rules this understanding reflects presumption that the continuity of the senate entails the continuity of its rules in 1959 the senate explicitly incorporated this principle into its standing rules by providing that the rules of the senate shall continue from one congress to the next congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules18 this action which accompanied certain 12 this argument is summarized in fisk and chemerinsky the

force of rule to an interpretation of the continuing body doctrine that supports the entrenchment of senate rules the senate also treats other components of its system of procedure as maintaining continuity standing orders like the standing rules are accepted as remaining perpetually in force unless their terms specify otherwise doubt exists that provisions of the constitution having procedural force remain continuously effective and the senate implicitly accords the same treatment to provisions of statute that operate procedurally finally it is implicit in the precedential character of procedural rulings by the chair and the full senate that once made they continue to guide proceedings subject only to subsequent decisions and actions of the body 20 all these understandings also contribute to the tendency of the system of senate procedures toward its own entrenchment

continuing body and the implications it draws from that status may be highlighted by contrast with corresponding practices of the house of representatives in just the sense that the senate is continuing body the house is not for the terms of all house members expire with the biennial expiration of the constitutional term of congress consistent with this circumstance the house adheres to the principle that one house cannot bind subsequent house21 and consequently the organizational arrangements of the house in one congress do not automatically carry over to the next when new house of representatives convenes after an election it understands itself as an inchoate unorganized body that must proceed to its own organization as its first order of business its initial proceedings include the election of its speaker and other officers the adoption of rules and the approval of committee assignments for all members 22 the rules the house adopts typically consist of an amended version of the code in effect in the previous congress23 that code includes effective means for limiting consideration of measures especially in admitting the motion for the previous question as device for concluding consideration and proceeding to an immediate vote24 while considering the adoption of rules however the house regards itself as proceeding not under its previously existing rules

previous question as part of general parliamentary law thereby affording itself means of concluding consideration and proceeding to vote on the resolution to adopt the rules as with the senate however the house implicitly accepts the principle that present procedural rulings should conform to previous precedent the house treats this principle itself as part of the general parliamentary law it could even be said that the house justifies its adherence to general parliamentary law before the adoption of rules by appealing to the precedent of its having done so in the past on similar grounds the house has long continued the practice of having the clerk of the previous house call the new house to order and preside until the election of speaker 26 by these means the house enables itself to maintain continuity of practice without entrenching its rules against their own change in particular these practices enable the house to maintain effective means of limiting consideration while still observing the principle that it is not bound by the rules adopted by the house in previous congress

that bring about the entrenchment of senate procedures do not suff ice to render that entrenchment absolute imperative mandate purports to declare senate procedures immune from change or positively to prevent the senate from altering them27 instead senate procedures are entrenched in practice only as consequence of combination of certain provisions they contain and principles on which they rest even pursuant to procedures as they now stand the senate could in practice alter any of those procedures except of course for constitutional requirements unless opponents were able to prevent the senate from reaching vote if furthermore the senate did alter its procedures so as to provide for limits on the consideration of proposals for procedural change it would thereby enable voting majority in general thereafter to adopt whatever additional change proposals it favored under those conditions senate procedures would cease to be entrenched in the sense just described the conditions that entrench existing procedures come into play only when opponents of proposed change that commends majority support are able to prevent vote as result senate procedures are entrenched only to the extent that because of the lack of majoritarian consideration limits voting majority may still be unable to achieve procedural changes number of legal and constitutional arguments might be raised against the propriety even of this entrenchment in practice yet any such argument might afford the senate concrete assistance in overcoming the practical condition of entrenchment unless it could be brought to bear in an effective way in the context of actual senate proceedingsmeaning presumably that it would be invoked as an element of nuclear option 25 assembly of congress in ibid ch 5 sec 7 26 ibid ch 5

the existing entrenchment of senate procedures and enable voting majority to institute desired procedural changes specifically provisions for limits on consideration to achieve this purpose it appears nuclear option would have to afford some means of ensuring that the senate could reach vote on procedural change proposal which would evidently mean providing some way to overcome at least one of the two conditions that combine to bring about entrenchment course of action could provide nuclear option either by 1 overcoming the scarcity of majoritarian consideration limits afforded by existing procedures or 2 departing from the principle that the existing system of procedure as whole remains always in effect from this perspective it appears that nuclear option might achieve its effects by engaging in either 1 an innovative or unorthodox use of some existing procedures or 2 proceedings not governed by the existing system of senate procedure roughly speaking proceedings of the first kind would involve means of overcoming the existing scarcity of consideration limits those of the second kind would disregard the principle that established procedures remain continuously applicable successful action in either form would result in the institution of changes from the system of senate procedure as previously blished and either approach would represent nuclear option in the sense that it would overcome the obstacles to procedural change presented by the senates existing procedural system setting aside existing procedures in the course of considering procedural changes however might be considered nuclear in an additional sense as well course of action of this kind would not only result in the alteration of establishe d procedure but engaging in it would in itself already constitute an alteration from established procedure under these conditions change would be realized not only as an outcome of process of considering proposals for change but in the very occurrence of the process this form of nuclear option would by definition constitute an extraordinary proceeding in the strict sense of taking place outside the ordinary conditions of proceeding its occurrence in itself would already constitute peremptory ad hoc action to remove the senate from regulation by its previously established procedures as result the subsequent effects of this form of action on the system of senate procedure would come through not only the changes it would institute but also those that would occur simply through carrying it out the remainder of this section examines some specific forms of action that have recently been discussed as possible elements of nuclear option it assesses whether successful nuclear option could be constructed through novel or alte rnative uses of some established elements of procedure or would require extraordinary proceedings these considerations will permit subsequent examination of some specific courses that nuclear option might take on this basis potential implications of carrying out proceedings that would be nuclear in the strong sense of involving peremptory departure from existing procedures will be discussed

previous discussion of entrenchment suggests that the chief requisites of feasible nuclear option would be 1 that proposal for procedural change be subject to adoption with the support of simple majority of senators voting and 2 that its consideration be subject to limitation also by simple voting majority so as to ensure that vote can be reached the first requirement is easily met by the regular procedures of the senate it is the second that presents difficulties to meet the second requirement it appears that applicable procedures would have to either 1 permit voting majority to impose limits on the time available for consideration of matter or 2 provide generally for such limits including by making the matter nondebatable in addition if an existing procedure does not impose an overall time limit on consideration of proposal but only permits majority to limit consideration it can assure vote on the underlying proposal only if it assures that the senate can reach vote on the question of limiting consideration such procedure accordingly would also have to include some effective means of limiting consideration of the question of limiting consideration as with the underlying matter itself the procedure could limit consideration of this new question either by imposing general limit or by permitting vote to impose one if it does so only by permitting vote to impose limit however the same requirement would agai n apply to the procedure for considering the question of imposing the limit it follows that any effective procedure for limiting consideration must include some provision establishing general consideration limit for some question involved in the process if it provides for such limit the senate could be prevented from getting to the point at which it could begin the series of votes that would ultimately result in imposing consideration limits on the underlying substantive matter in addition each of the series of questions involved in limiting consideration of the matter and not only the final vote on the matter itself would have to be subject to the decision of simple voting majority

senate the motion to table matter is not debatable may be adopted by majority vote and if adopted has the same effect as vote to defeat the proposal 28 as result it can in sense be used to impose consideration limits on the underlying question for example if opponents of proposal offer series of amendments in an attempt to protract consideration voting majority can dispose of each amendment by moving and immediately agreeing to table it the motion to table however terminates consideration of proposal only by defeating it rejection of the motion leaves the proposal pending before the senate and still open to further consideration accordingly the motion to table canno t directly be used to expedite approval of proposal for this reason it might be possible for nuclear option to benefit from the use this motion while still remaining consistent with previously established procedure only if the senate could be brought to consider question whose defeat would either result in adopting the desired procedural change or at least facilitate its adoption by limiting its consideration 28 riddicks senate procedure p 1273 under table

process by which the senate decides parliamentary questions also involves elements that can have the effect of limiting consideration typically parliamentary question or question of order comes before the senate in the form of point of order point of order is claim raised from the floor by senator that some pending procedural action is inconsistent with pertinent rules or other procedural standards under most circumstan ces the presiding officer may settle point of order by ruling on whether the claim it raises is procedurally correct question of order may also be presented without any point of order being rais ed if an ambiguous or unsettled situation arises in the course of proceedings most questions arising in this way also may be settled by ruling of the chair in either case the ruling of the chair becomes final unless any senator appeals it to the full senate an appeal is settled by simple majority of senators voting and this vote either confirms or reverses the initial ruling of the chair the initial action of the chair on point of order is in effect subject to limits on consideration because senate practice permits debate on pending point of order only at the discretion of the chair 29 under most circumstances on the other hand appeals of ruling by the chair are debatable30 as result opponents of the decision that the senate seems likely to make on an appeal may be able to filibuster to prevent the senate from reaching vote on the appeal if insufficient support exists to invoke cloture on the appeal the senate might be able to limit its consideration only by tabling it tabling an appeal however confirms the initial ruling of the chair if the senate wishes to reverse the chairs ruling it can do so only by voting directly on the appeal itself for senators wishing to establish position contrary to the ruling of the chair accordingly it appears that the motion to table would afford aid in the face of filibuster indeed the senate might have effective means to reach vote on an appeal that would reverse an initial ruling under these circumstances the senate may be able to limit consideration of an appeal only with the effect of simultaneously confirming an initial ruling of the chair parliamentary question accordingly is like motion to table in that effective consideration limits are usually available only for one of its possible dispositions for parliamentary questions however the protected disposition is the one consistent with the initial ruling of the chair under these conditions it appears that raising parliamentary question could be an effective part of nuclear option without departure from the requirements of already established procedure only when an initial ruling of the chair would be favorable to the adoption of the desired procedural change or at least to limiting consideration of the proposal for change g16g142g156g157g142g141g561g18g152g146g151g157g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561 senate rules however also

may arise before the decision of such appeal shall be decided by the presiding officer without debate and every appeal therefrom shall be decided at once without debate32 under suitable conditions this provision could permit consideration of parliamentary question to be limited whether or not the initial ruling was favorable suppose for example that proponents of nuclear option raised point of order intended to establish consideration limits and the chair overruled it proponents of consideration limits might appeal this unfavorable ruling then raise new point of order claiming that consideration limits should apply to the appeal even if the chair overruled this new point of order as well its proponents could again appeal inasmuch as the sec ond point of order would be nested within the first the prohibition of rule xx against debate on the nested appeal would ensure that the senate could reach vote on that question through its vote on the nested appeal the senate could then impose limits on consideration of the initial appeal and enable itself to reach vote thereon through its vote on the initial appeal the senate could then affirm the consideration limits asserted by the original point of order under these circumstances it might be possible to construct way of pursuing successful nuclear option that did not require either an initial favorable ruling by the chair or any peremptory departure from established procedures

could be brought to bear on the consideration of parliamentary questions makes them attractive as vehicle for securing changes in senate procedure they are attractive for this purpose also however because rulings on parliamentary questions are specifically decisions about procedure they may have the effect of establishing standards for subsequent proceedings for this reason they may potentially afford an alternative to formal amendment of the rules as means of procedural change exactly because rulings on parliamentary questions are procedural decisions however their use as means of achieving procedural change also presents certain potential obstacles the procedural standards that regulate these questions not only prescribe the process by which they may be settled but also place certain constraints on their substantive content the principles behind senate procedural practice do not enfranchise the body to settle parliamentary questions according to its own preferences in the immediate circumstances in the same way that it may decide ordinary questions of policy that come before it instead senate procedure implicitly presumes that rulings on parliamentary questions will represent interpretations of the meaning and force of some existing rules or other procedural standards and that those made by the chair at least will accord with previous interpretations embodied in established precedent to the extent that course of action aimed at enhancing consideration limits required proceedings at variance with these principles it would involve peremptory departure from established procedure 32 senate rule xx paragraph 1 in senate manual sec 201

comparable situations although pa rliamentary ruling brings about actual amendment of senate rules its standing as precedent renders it in effect part of the overall system of senate procedure it is in large measure this precedential force of parliamentary rulings that makes the use of parliamentary questions appear attractive as an element of nuclear option if the chair ruled that limits applied to the consideration of pending matter advocates of limiting consideration would presumably invoke the ruling as precedent for applying comparable limits to the consideration of similar matters in corresponding future circumstances to the extent that this precedent modified the way in which the system of senate procedure was applied and implemented it would operate as nuclear option to bring about procedural change the implicit justification for according precedenti force to parliamentary rulings however is the presumption that such rulings will reflect authoritative interpretations of established rules and other procedural standards the senate can consider it appropriate for earlier rulings to guide later action precisely because it can expect those rulings to be made in conformance with established procedural standards including previous interpretations embodied in precedent for this reason it is an established presumption of senate procedure that the chair is to rule on parliamentary questions in ways consistent with already established procedural standards the precedential force of parliamentary rulings accordingly entails not only that present rulings establish guidelines for future ones but also that previous rulings guide present ones if the success of nuclear option required the chair to rule in way at variance with existing procedure the course of action involved would appear to exemplify not an innovative or unorthodox use of existing procedures but an extraordinary proceeding at variance with established standards specifically if parliamentary situation arose requiring the chair to rule whether some existing procedural standard mandated limits on consideration the principle of precedent would presumably require the chair to rule consistently with past rulings on comparable questions in similar situations ruling by the chair that imposed consideration limits not previously recognized in senate procedure might be considered as involving violation of this principle if previous precedent recognized limits on consideration applicable to the instant situation and the chair ruled in favor of consideration limits its action would appear to constitute an extraordinary proceeding involving peremptory departure from the established system of senate procedure in this respect the scarcity of consideration limits in existing senate procedure sets the problem not only for the process by which nuclear option could be carried out but also for the substantive result it might achieve key impediment to the effective use of parliamentary rulings in nuclear option might be the difficulty of finding procedural basis for the chair to rule in favor of limits on consideration while remaining consistent with existing procedural standards in some circumstances nevertheless the constraint on the chair to conform parliamentary rulings to established precedent might not prevent the use of such rulings to accomplish procedural change where existing precedents are ambiguous conflicting or silent new ruling by the chair or the senate may appropriately affirm an interpretation that alters the precedential basis for subsequent decisions this principle opens up the possibility that point of order might enable

same way as the chair is pursuant to the constitutional provision that each house may determine the rules of its proceedings 33 the senate understands itself as the ultimate authority over the meaning and intent of its own rules senate procedure accordingly permits the body always to make final decision on parliamentary question through its own vote and rulings by the full senate are considered the most authoritative form of precedent for the same reason the senate has not regarded itself as constrained in its rulings by previous precedent in the same way as is the chair which operates only as an agent of the senate the senates handbook of procedural practice explains any ruling by the chair not appealed or which is sustained by vote of the senate or any verdict by the senate on point of order becomes precedent of the senate which the senate follows just as it would its rules unless and until the senate in its wisdom should reverse or modify that decision34 under these standards procedural interpretations established by rulings of the senate not only may constitute precedents to govern subsequent procedural action but may also embody actual changes in the procedural basis of senate practice by means of such rulings the senate has on occasion established interpretations of parliamentary questions that were not simply implicit in and might even be at variance with previous interpretations parliamentary decision by the senate might permit nuclear option to achieve the effect of altering senate procedural standards while yet avoiding any proceedings inconsistent with procedures already in effect the senate may exercise its authority to settle parliamentary questions about its own procedures in several different ways perhaps the most generally applicable way is through the right of any senator to appeal an initial ruling of the chair to decision of the full senate senate practice also sets forth however that the chair instead of ruling on point of order may always submit the question it presents to the senate for decision the chair does not often exercise this option but appears to have done so especially when presented with question of first impression that is situation in which previous precedent has established any interpretation of the point at issue the apparent rationale of this practice is that inasmuch as the authority of rule rests ultimately on the constitutional power of the senate to adopt it the initial decision on its interpretation is appropriately left to the same body 35 in addition however senate practice also holds that the chair ought to submit to the senate any question of order raised on constitutional grounds the possibility of constitutional point of order exists because the senate understands the constitutional provisions that operate to regulate 33 constitution art i sec 5 34 riddicks senate procedure p 987 under points of order see also the sections on points of order pp 987 996 and appeals

procedural system the senate nevertheless considers that although its procedural system accords the chair authority to interpret the standing rules it grants such authority in relation to the constitution the senate itself by contrast stands as coequal component of one of the three separate branches of the federal government it is accordingly appropriate for the senate to exercise authority in relation to the constitution36 g22g145g142g561g515g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g516g561 the authority of the senate to alter precedent in settling any parliamentary question may afford means of securing procedural change without requiring any proceedings inconsistent with precedent at the same time the possibility of grounding parliamentary question in provision of the constitution may offer supporters of consideration limits means of pursuing their goal without having to appeal to procedural requirements not already in being proceedings invoking these principles would be characteristic of what may appropriately be called constitutional option for procedural change supporters of consideration limits might raise parliamentary question proposing that some identified provision of the constitution be interp reted as entailing requirement for limits on the consideration of business then pending the senate might then settle this constitutional question in way that sustained the proposed interpretation even in the absence of previous precedent supporting it action of this kind might offer greater possibilities than other forms of nuclear option for securing procedural change without requiring extraordinary proceedings decision of the senate instituting consideration limits for specified matte rs based on an interpretation of constitutional provisions and representing the settlement of constitutional question could be viewed as harmonious with existing procedural standards both in substance and in process in these respects the course of action resulting in this decision might be considered not to involve any extraordinary proceedings outside the bounds of established procedure the chief requisite for the feasibility of such course of action might be identifying provision of the constitution that could appropriately be interpreted as supporting the desired limitations in addition as the next section discusses senate procedures governing action on constitutional points of order impose additional impediments to the effective use of this approach

earlier periods especially in connection with senate consideration of proposals to make cloture easier to obtain between 1949 and 1975 during this period proponents of consideration limits persistently argued that the constitutional power of the senate to determine its own rules cannot be regarded as exhausted by its exercise on any past occasions instead they held this power can be effective only if the capacity for its exercise remains continuously and effectively available to the senate in practice the effective exercise of the rulemaking power they contended requires that the senate be able to proceed to vote on proposals to change the rules and therefore that it must be able to limit the consideration of these proposals 36 riddicks senate procedure pp 5254 under

the senate against change including pertinent interpretations of the continuing body doctrine tend to operate in derogation of the constitutional rulemaking power to the extent that entrenchment prevents the senate from making decisions about its own rules advocates of change argued it is unconstitutional in its effects37 through this argument proponents of consideration limits attempted to use the constitutional grant of rulemaking power as means to overcome the entrenchment of senate procedure and enable it to proceed to vote on amendments to the cloture rule for reasons discussed in the section on attempts to amend the cloture rule 19531975 below however the senate ultimately always drew back from affirming that the constitution implicitly imposed any limits on the consideration of rules change proposals the principle that the chair does not rule on constitutional points of order however was illustrated several times during the proceedings on these proposals vice presidents richard nixon in 1957 hubert humphrey in 1967 and nelson rockefeller in 1975 each declined to rule whether the constitution required the senate to be able to reach vote on rules change proposals 38 in 1969 on the other hand vice president humphrey announced that cloture had been invoked on rules change proposal by the vote of simple majority he justified his making this ruling by arguing that he thereby vindicated the constitutional power of the senate to act on the rules change proposal yet did not arrogate from the senate its authority to interpret the constitution because the senate could exercise that authority through an appeal 39 g515g3g141g159g146g140g142g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g516g561g18g152g160g142g155g561g138g156g561g4g138g156g146g156g561 current discussion by contrast seems more often to presume that constitutional option might be attempted in connection with senate consideration not of proposed procedural change but of judicial nomination it would accordingly appeal to different clause of the constitution namely the provision of article ii section 2 that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint officers in the executive and judiciary branches advocates of this form of constitutional option propose to infer that the responsibility of the senate to advise and consent to nominations must entail its ability to vote on them to be effective in practice they contend the ability to vote must entail the capacity to proceed to vote and therefore the capacity to limit

just discussed the requirement that the senate itself settle parliamentary questions raised under the constitution together with the authority of the senate to revise precedent in settling parliamentary questions may offer greater possibilities for securing procedural change without requiring extraordinary proceedings c ourses of action involving the submission of point of order to the senate nevertheless may be subject to difficulty in bringing the senate to the vote that would accomplish procedural change except through preemptive departure from established procedures when the chair submits parliamentary question to the senate for decision only majority of senators voting is required to settle the matter under these conditions however because the chair is longer to rule the principle that debate occurs only at the chairs discretion longer applies instead the question is then subject to debate pursuant to the general rules of the senate and accordingly to filibuster 41 the senate may table submitted point of order but whereas tabling an appeal upholds the initial ruling of the chair tabling submitted question has the effect of rejecting the claim it makes if for example point of order claimed that limits should apply to consideration of matter tabling it would reject imposing such limits rejecting motion to table however would leave the point of order open for further debate so that determination by the senate might be prevented by filibuster these considerations suggest that the precedent for submitting constitutional points of order to the senate might pose an obstacle to the achievement of change through constitutional option the earlier discussion suggested that nuclear option could be successfully achieved through raising nonconstitutional parliamentary question only if the chair initially made favorable ruling on the question in the case of constitutional point of order the chairs immediate submission of the question to the senate would preclude any initial favorable ruling the senate could limit consideration of the submitted question only by adopting motion to table it which would have the effect of rejecting the procedural claim the question raised under these conditions it appears constitutional option might be able to succeed within the constraints of existing procedure only if rejection of the submitted point of order would secure new consideration limits in addition it is not clear how rule xx might apply to nested point of order raised under the constitution available precedent appears to illuminate whether or not the precedential principle against the chairs ruling at all on constitutional question would override the requirement of rule xx that the chair rule immediately on nested point of order

precedent appears to clarify whether the requirement of rule xx for an immediate vote on an appeal would be interpreted as extending also to the vote on the submitted question if the chair could rule on nested constitutional point of order successful constitutional option might not require an initial favorable ruling even if the chair considered itself bound to overrule the point of order in accordance with existing precedents on the subject proponents of change could appeal and rule xx would presumably enable them to secure an immediate vote on the appeal the senate could then achieve the goals of the constitutional option by settling the question in way that altered precedent if on the other hand the precedent for submitting constitutional questions would be controlling but rule xx were to be applied to submitted questions as well as to appeals proponents of the constitutional option might be able to achieve their ends because the rule would permit the senate to reach vote on the submitted question and thereby allow majority to settle it in way that altered precedent if rule xx were held neither to permit the chair to rule on nested constitutional question nor to limit senate consideration of the submitted questions however the difficulty of imposing limits on consideration of the submitted question would pose an obstacle to success of the constitutional option

g17g153g157g146g152g151g516g561 the considerations advanced in the preceding section may be summarized by examining how they might be brought to bear in contemporary attempt to institute more effective consideration limits through nuclear option recent public accounts most often contemplate course of events in which supporters of change would raise point of order with the intent of securing ruling that would have the effect of establishing consideration limits for pending matter specifically this point of order might claim that further debate on pending judicial nomination would be dilatory and therefore that an immediate vote was required 42 g18g152g146g151g157g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561g21g158g156g157g138g146g151g142g141g561g139g162g561g5g145g138g146g155g561 if the chair were to sustain such point of order the effect would presumably be to impose consideration limits on the pending nomination or other pending question such as rules change proposal this action would presumably assure that the senate could reach vote on the underlying question and decide it by simple majority in addition the ruling would constitute precedent for imposing similar limits on consideration in similar subsequent situations 42 for nontechnical descriptions of nuclear option consistent with this account see the following charles babington gop moderates wary of

limits on consideration might appeal it to the full senate the appeal would be debatable but even if supporters of change were unable to limit its consideration by invoking cloture they might do so by moving to table it the motion to table could be approved without debate and by simple majority of senators approval of the motion would confirm the initial ruling of the chair and the precedent thereby established for new means of limiting consideration of the specified type of business in this way proponents of change could establis h new consideration limits by using ones already built into the practices of the senate that govern proceedings on points of order to the extent that existing senate procedure does not provide for the limits on consideration that the ruling would establish however it might be possible to implement this form of nuclear option only with the cooperation of chair willing to engage in extrao rdinary proceedings at variance with existing senate practice by making ruling counter to previous precedent to that extent this course of action would be nuclear in the emphatic sense of involving peremptory changes in procedure outside the regulations of existing procedures g3g141g159g142g155g156g142g561g20g158g149g146g151g144g561g146g151g561g3g140g140g152g155g141g138g151g140g142g561g25g146g157g145g561g18g155g142g140g142g141g142g151g157g561 if the chair instead determined to adhere to the established principle that it rule in accordance with precedent it might find itself obliged to rule against the point of order thereby rejecting the claim that consideration limits should apply to the underlying business supporters of change might respond by appealing the ruling and if majority supported the appeal the senate would overrule the chair and establish in precedent the consideration limits claimed in the original point of order again however the appeal would be debatable so that opponents might be able by filibuster to prevent the matter from reaching vote in these circumstances motion to table the appeal would afford supporters of change assistance if the motion to table were adopted the action would affirm the original adverse ruling if it were rejected the filibuster could continue this sequence of events exemplifies how existing sena rules can be used to effect their own entrenchment against change

to the decision of the senate point of order contending that the advice and consent clause of the constitution requires the senate to be able to reach vote might well be held to constitute question of first impression in addition both this point of order and one based on the rulemaking power would appear explicitly to involve constitutional questions for the chair to rule on either point of order would accordingly seem to require action in disregard of the line of precedent supporting the submission of ce rtain parliamentary questions in this situation as with an appeal supporters of consideration limits might obtain their ends if majority voted to sustain the submitted point of order once submitted to the senate however the point of order would be debatable opponents might through filibuster be able to prevent vote on the submitted point of order and thereby forestall establishment of the desired precedent under these conditions supporters could not advance their cause by moving to table their submitted point of order for senate agreement to this motion would have the effect of overruling

of order before the senate in debatable form this difficulty would presumably arise only for point of order that presented constitutional claim or question of first impression yet it is not easy to see what grounds other than the constitutional would afford viable basis for asserting an implicit mandate for limits on consideration not already recognized in the system of senate procedure yet would not entail an appeal to any previously unrecognized principle even if such grounds could be found the state of previous precedent would still have to permit the chair to sustain the required interpretation without contravening existing standards otherwis once again the attempt to secure change could succeed only through the willingness of the chair to render favorable ruling counter to precedent g18g152g146g151g157g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561g139g162g561g17g153g153g152g151g142g151g157g156g561 it is also possible that advocates of consideration limits could construct situation in which opponents would have to raise point of order in order to forestall the establishment of new consideration limits even under these conditions however it appears that the success of nuclear option would still depend on the willingness of the chair to provide an initial ruling favorable to limits on consideration even if counter to precedent the only difference might be that in these circumstances the favorable ruling would be one overruling rather than sustaining the point of order for example supporters of change might begin by offering not point of order but motion that the senate vote at once on the underlying question before the senate if the senate entertained and adopted this motion its action would apply limits to consideration of the pending question and also would constitute precedent for admitting similar motions on similar questions on subsequent occasions opponents might be able to prevent this result only by raising point of order against the proposed motion on grounds that existing senate procedure authorizes such motion whatever ruling the chair made on this point of order opponents of the ruling could appeal the senate could limit consideration of the appeal only by tabling it which would also affirm the initial ruling if the chair overruled the point of order accordingly opponents of consideration limits might be compelled to press their position by appealing the ruling which would enable supporters to vindicate theirs by tabling the appeal as already noted however such ruling might necessarily constitute an extraordinary proceeding not sanctioned by established precedent if the initial ruling remained consistent with existing practice by sustaining the point of order against the motion to proceed to vote on the underlying matter the senate could not achieve consideration limits by tabling the appeal but only by reversing the chair on appeal reaching this result would require an upordown vote on the appeal itself and as above opponents of consideration limits could attempt to prevent this vote from occurring by filibuster the only evident means of avoiding such result without requiring peremptory departure from existing procedure might arise if the chair determ ined to admit the motion to proceed to vote on constitutional grounds in that case opponents point of order against the motion would presumably present constitutional question and senate practice would presumably require the chair to submit it to the senate the senate might then be able to establish precedent supporting consideration limits by tabling the submitted point of order even in this case however unless some existing nonconstitutional procedural standards could appropriately be interpreted as

entertaining such motion in the first place would already appear to constitute an extraordinary proceeding outside the bounds of established practice

order might alter the considerations so far presented the previous section suggested that if nested point of order were raised on constitutional grounds the precedents directing the submission of constitutional points of order would appear to conflict with the provisions of rule xx mandating immediate settlement on the other hand if the nested point of order were raised on nonconstitutional grounds the additional restrictions on consideration provided for by rule xx might affect the outcome one example of possible nonconstitutional nested point of order could be one addressing whether pending constitutional point of order should be submitted to the senate for example if the chair submitted point of order claiming constitutional warrant for limits on consideration of judicial nomination supporters of such limits might raise nested point of order claiming that the chair should proceed to rule in order to forestall possible filibuster that could prevent the senate from reaching vote on the initial point of order conversely if the chair offered to rule on the constitutional point of order opponents of consideration limits might contest this action by raising nested point of order on grounds of the precedent that constitutional points of order are to be submitted to the senate for decision in either of these cases the nested point of order might be held to present not constitutional issue but only question about the precedent for submitting constitutional points of order without departure from the standards embedded in previous practice accordingly the chair might be able to rule on the nested point of order also consistently with established precedent the chair could sustain this point of order ruling that the initial constitutional point of order must be submitted supporters of the initial point of order would then be able to appeal this ruling and under rule xx the appeal would be subject to an immediate vote inasmuch as it was nested within the initial point of order by reversing the chairs ruling on appeal the senate would authorize the chair to rule on the original constitutional point of order in this situation however the chair would still have to rule favorably on the initial point of order for otherwise the senate would remain unable to secure consideration limits by voting to table any appeal yet such ruling might entail peremptory departure from precedent on the part of the chair moreover if the sequence of events required that the chair initially attempt to rule on constitutional question this action too could be considered to involve an extraordinary proceeding at variance with established procedure under some circumstances in addition these proceedings might require the senate to establish new principle that the prohibition of rule xx against debate on an embedded point of order applied to questions submitted as well as to appeals finally this course of events would also require the senate to concede to the chair auth ority to make rulings on constitutional questions although both decisions would lie within the plen ary power of the senate to interpret its own rules the last at least would alter historic practice that the senate has always treated as being solidly anchored in its constitutional standing as branch of congress

more complicated way if the chair submitted to the senate point of order claiming that the constitution required consideration limits for judicial nominations if filibuster prevented the senate from reaching vote on this submitted point of order supporters of the point of order might then raise second point of order claiming that this filibuster was unconstitutionally preventing the senate from exercising either its advice and consent power or its authority to determine the meaning of its own rules either of these new points of order would clearly also appear to involve constitutional question so that the chair might feel compelled to submit it also to the senate supporters of the new point of order however might then raise third point of order that this new second submitted question should be held nondebatable under rule xx on the grounds that its consideration was nested within that of the original first point of order the chair might not have to submit this third point of order to the senate because it would be raised not under the constitution but under rule xx instead the chair could rule on the matter whichever way the chair ruled opponents of th ruling could appeal but rule xx would presumably apply to prevent debate of this nested appeal on nonconstitutional question under these conditions the senate would be assured of reaching vote on the appeal and by this means voting majority could sustain the third point of order this action would have the effect of limiting consideration of the previous second point of order by sustaining the second point of order in turn the senate could impose limits on consideration of the first and by sustaining the first it would institute limits on the consideration of the underlying nomination ultimately as result this course of action would assure the senate of reaching vote on the question of imposing consideration limits and of settling that question by voting majority it might thereby enable the senate to secure alterations in its effective procedure without either having to obtain supermajority vote or requiring action contrary to precedent the senate would decide the claim raised by the original point of order and the chair would not be required to decide questions either that precedent holds should be submitted nor in way contrary to established precedents in this situation the only peremptory action to change senate procedure would occur through the senates own exercise of its essentially plenary discretion under its constitutional power to determine the sense of its own rules the result of these proceedings might remain indeterminate only if the chair submitted the third point of order to the senate as question of firs t impression it might well be held question of first impression whether submitted nested point of order was subject to the same consideration limits provided by rule xx for appeals under these conditions filibuster might then prevent vote on the submitted question supporters of change might be able to respond to this filibuster only by offering further fourth point of order claiming the same applicability of rule xx with respect to the newly submitted third point of order in that case it does not appear how regress in which the same question was repeatedly raised and repeatedly submitted as question of first impression might be cut off

courses of action examined in the previous section all represent variations of nuclear option in the broadest sense defined at the outset each might succeed in overcoming the obstacles to change in senate procedure presented by the requirements of that procedure itself most of these courses of action however appear also to require proceedings that would be nuclear in the emphatic sense of not being regulated by established procedure only certain courses of action involving nested point of order seem to allow for the possibility of process in which procedural question might be decided by the senate in accordance with its plenary constitutional power over its own rules without requiring any departure from established procedure governing the decision of procedural questions most of the courses of action examined in the last section nevertheless involve proceedings at variance with existing procedure at least to the extent of initial action by the chair on parliamentary question in disregard of procedural principles well established in senate practice the action typically required is ruling by the chair on parliamentary question that would have the effect of imposing limits on consideration of pending matter in the proceedings under consideration such ruling appears requisite for placing the question of imposing limits before the senate in form on which established practice already permits limits on debate in some of these cases it is the substance of the chairs ruling that might have to disregard precedent for the requisite ruling would run counter to established interpretations of procedure that the senate had previously taken as governing practice in the area if the chair ruled consistently with established precedent the nuclear result of instituting new consideration limits could be reached only through vote of the senate in other cases the disregard of precedent would arise from the process of making the ruling for the proceedings would require the chair to depart from the established practices that would mandate the question to be submitted to the senate for decision if the chair conformed to established practice by submitting constitutional question to the senate the nuclear result could be reached only through senate vote in favor of the submitted point of order ruling that ran counter to precedent either in its substance or in its process would represent nuclear action not only in the sense of overcoming the usual obstacles to procedural change but also in the sense that the act of making the ruling would occur at variance with previous senate practice extraordinary proceedings of these kinds accordingly would not only result in change but would themselves constitute change from previous practice introduced through peremptory action

precedent and on the entrenchment of the rules might summarily alter the procedural conditions governing any subsequent proceedings aimed at further procedural change the effective procedural practice of the senate for the future could be altered not simply pursuant to senate approval of proposal having this purpose but as summary effect of proceedings in considering such proposal or for that matter some other business precedent for peremptory action to alter procedures might even have the potential to occasion lasting disruptions of the capacity of the senate for orderly deliberation43 the presence of such precedent might in principle enable voting majo rity of the senate to alter any procedure at will by raising point of order and either securing favorable ruling or being able to limit debate on the appeal or submitted question by such means voting majority might subsequently impose limitations on the consideration of any item of business prohibiting debate or amendment to any desired degree such majority might even alter applicable procedures from one item of business to the next from one form of proceeding to contrary one depending on immediate objectives in similar way the occurrence of ruling by the chair in disregard of precedent might be taken as precedent permitting the chair to rule counter to precedent in the future this discretion might conceivably be assumed even by vice president occupying the chair and acting on behalf of president with political views contrary to that of senate majority possibilities like these indicate that senate acceptance of extraordinary proceedings as means of procedural change could have effects entirely vitiating the entrenchment of senate rules these consequences might not only make it possible for voting majorities to exercise effective control over the content and interpretation of senate procedures but also raise the possibility of altogether eliminating any regularity of proceedings in the practice of the senate realization of this possibility would be inconsistent with jeffersons principle that it is much more material to the good order of deliberative body that there may be uniformity of proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the speaker or the captiousness of the members 44 under some circumstances on the other hand the senate may be able to achieve procedural change without resort to extraordinary proceedin gs for example if the parliamentary question that brings about ruling favorable to consideration limits rests on an ambiguous or unsettled point of procedure the implications of the process by which change is achieved may not be as sweeping on several previous occasions the senate has engaged in procedural actions that had the effect of changing the practice of the body by establishing novel interpretations of senate procedure it does not appear that these past occurrences have had the effect of rendering the body of senate procedure as whole volatile or subject to capricious change in contrast to some of the courses of action described above nevertheless at least some of these past proceedings involved the settlement of procedural question by action of the full senate and few appear to have involved direct appeal to constitutional principle in ways that ran counter to existing practice in these respects past occurrences of nuclear options may not be entirely comparable with those now under discussion 43 most public descriptions of nuclear option however do not appear to use the term in recognition of these potentially sweeping summary effects

potential implications of resort to proceedings not governed by established procedural standards may be illustrated by considering the attempts made by supporters of consideration limits to amend the cloture rule after the middle of the 20th century from the late 19th century onward opponents of consideration limits had often been able to prevent their establishment in the senate by filibustering or threatening to filibuster these events afford concrete illustrations of how the entrenchment of senate rules may be maintained by preventing the senate from reaching vote on change proposals the difficulties they presented however also led advocates of consideration limits to seek new means to enabling the senate to reach vote on their proposals and their recurrent efforts illustrate many of the procedural possibilities examined in the previous section most prominently supporters of change engaged in attempts to contest the entrenchment of senate rules by some form of appeal to the constitutional rulemaking power from 1953 through 1975 advocates of the amendments to the cloture rule attempted in various ways to establish the principle that pursuant to the rulemaking power at least at the beginning of congress simple voting majority of the senate should be able to impose limitations on the consideration of amendments to the rules these proceedings accordingly may accordingly be viewed as examples of constitutional option and may illuminate some considerations that contemporary constitutional option as well as nuclear option more generally might face 45

constitutional claim by arguing that in order to allow the senate to exercise its rulemaking power its rules should be regarded as not continuing automatically in effect in new congress at the opening of congress in 1953 1957 and 1959 supporters embodied this argument in motion that the senate pursuant to the constitution proceed to consider the adoption of rules in each year however the senate rejected this motion by tabling it 46 presenting the constitutional claim in this form accordingly permitted the senate to reach decision on it but only to the extent of rejecting it in 1959 moreover the senate then proceeded under the rules already in place to adopt resolution that amended the cloture rule but also added to senate rules the statement that those rules remain continuously in effect

continued use of the same approach to achieve further change in the following years as result advocates of change developed other means of challenging the entrenchment of senate rules these relied more explicitly than before on the rulemaking power at the opening of congress in 1967 1969 and 1971 supporters of consideration limits began by moving that the senate proceed to consider resolution amending the cloture rule under existing senate rules this motion is in order but debatable proponents accordingly went on to ask that the rulemaking power be interpreted as authorizing voting majority to limit consideration of motion to consider rules changes at the beginning of congress if the senate had accepted this interpretation and had gone on to adopt the motion to consider proponents could have repeated similar proceedings in order to limit consideration of the resolution itself in 1967 the motion of proponents was that pursuant to the rulemaking power the senate vote immediately on the pending motion to proceed oppo nents of this motion raised point of order against it which vice president humphrey submitted to the senate as constitutional question proponents then moved to table the submitted point of order which would have affirmed that the rulemaking power authorized majority to lim it consideration of rules change proposals the senate however defeated the tabling motion then sustained the point of order thereby declining to affirm the constitutional claim in this form 48 in 1969 and 1971 accordingly change advocates instead moved for cloture on the motion to proceed but also raised the contention that pursuant to the rulemaking power simple voting majority should be held sufficient to invoke cloture on rules change proposal at the beginning of congress in both years cloture was supported by simple majority but not by the twothirds required by rule xxii on rules changes in 1969 vice president humphrey then announced that consideration would proceed under cloture opponents however appealed this decision and the senate reversed it thereby again declining to affirm that the rulemaking power authorized majority to limit consideration of rules change 49 in 1971 the chair ruled that under the 1969 precedent the support of simple majority did not suffice to invoke cloture change advocates appealed this decision but the senate tabled the appeal thereby sustaining the chair and reaffirming the precedent against limiting debate under authority of the rulemaking power 50 48 byrd addresses on the history of the senate vol 2 p 130 crs

these occurrences change advocates abandoned the approach of moving first for an immediate vote then for procedural ruling that would permit that vote instead in 1975 they combined these efforts into single motion that the senate both proceed to consider resolution to amend the cloture rule and vote immediately on this motion to proceed the second part of this motion proposed treating the entire motion as nondebatable and subject to adoption by simple majority combining both propositions in this way overtly manifests the nuclear character of the proposed action in that the second part of the motion proposed to prescribe terms for the consideration of the motion as whole if the motion were to be considered pursuant to the previously existing rules it presumably could not make such prescription the prescription could become effective only through adoption of the motion yet the proceedings that this prescription would regulate would have to have taken place already during consideration of the motion 51 instead motion of this kind can be effective only if its own offering is accepted as bringing about summary peremptory change in the rules under which its consideration will occur its offering in itself accordingly amounts to an attempt to bring about tacit settlement of the procedural claim it raises although little subsequent commentary appears to have addressed this selfreferential character of the 1975 motion it became an important determinant of the outcome because the second part of the motion in effect embodied the procedural claim supporters sought to establish opponents had to counter that claim by raising point of or der that the motion as whole was out of order on grounds that existing rules did not permit simple majority to close consideration when vice president rockefeller submitted this point of order to the senate as constitutional question proponents moved to table it the tabling motion enabled proponents to place before the senate in nondebatable form the basic claim that voting majority should be able to limit consideration of rules change proposal the senate initially adopted the motion to table the point of order thereby endorsing the position that majority could limit debate in relation to rules change proposal by this action the senate in effect accepted for the first time the procedural claim of proponents under the rulemaking power this action might be expected to have led to an immediate vote on the motion that had been held in order opponents however then demanded division of the question on the combined motion so that its first part the motion to proceed would be considered separate from its second part embodying the procedural prescription that the motion be decided by simple majority without debate this division destroyed the selfreferential character of the procedural prescription as result the vice president held the motion to proceed the first part of the original package motion to be debatable opponents then undertook extended debate on this motion to proceed 52 51 the house of representatives for example consistently observes the principle that resolution establishing special rule for consideration of measure cannot prescribe terms for its own consideration instead such terms are established where necessary by adoption of second special rule providing for consideration of

agreed to accept proposal under which the senate would vote on compromise proposal to strengthen the cloture rule but also on reconsidering the tabling of the original point of order the senate adopted the motion to reconsider and on reconsideration rejected the motion to table thereby bringing the original point of order back before the senate the senate then voted to sustain the point of order thereby reversing its endorsement of the claim that simple majority had authority to limit consideration of rules change proposals 53

development the house of representatives confronted potential conflicts between securing the exercise of its constitutional rulemaking power and maintaining stability in its proceedings that were similar to those addressed by current discussions in the senate by the early years of the 20 th century the development of house procedures had centralized control of the floor agenda in the speaker in part through his ex officio chairmanship of the committee on rules so nearly absolute was this control that not only the minority party but dissident factions in the majority party as well became severely disaffected the leadership however was able to use the speakers control of the floor to prevent consideration of proposed changes that would mitigate that control dissidents attempted to obtain consideration for rules changes in part by arguing that constitutional rulemaking power of the house made measures to change the rules constitutionally privileged for consideration this argument bears strong resemblance to that advocated by supporters of procedural change in the senate in the mid20th century even though the issue in the senate was the procedural control exercised by minority rather than by an agent of the majority in 1910 representative george norris seized parliamentary opportunity to offer as privileged under the constitution proposal to reconstruct the committee on rules speaker joseph cannon ruled consistently with estab lished house practice that such privilege attached to measures to change the rules and th at the measure would have to be referred to his committee on rules the house reversed the ruling on appeal and proceeded to consider and adopt the resolution the reconstructed committee on rules subsequently proposed and the house adopted several important and enduring innovations in house rules including the discharge rule as initially written however the discharge rule proved not only ineffective but also susceptible to dilatory use in the following session of the same c ongress 1911 therefore representative charles fuller offered as constitutionally privileged resolution to amend this rule in accordance with the 1910 precedent speaker cannon ruled this resolution privileged but his ruling was appealed and the house reversed it continued reformers consider filibuster compromise congressional quarterly weekly

ruling of 1910 but restored the previous principle that the constitutional pow er to make rules did not entail any right to consider every possible proposal to do so cannon s precedents accordingly recounts these events under the heading proposition to amend the rules is not privileged in exercising its constitutional privilege to change the rules the house has confined itself within certain limitations54 in reestablishing this principle the house seems to have judged that according constitutional privilege to rule change proposals could permit the chamber to be tied up continually with such measures irrespective of merit and perhaps for dilatory purposes it could also have resulted in continual and possibly capricious changes in procedure instituted by temporary majorities for their immediate benefit some members who voted both to overturn the precedent in 1910 and to restore it in 1911 explained their action on the grounds that the first vote was revolutionary act that was necessitated by circumstance but that the principle involved was not sustainable as settled doctrine

the houses historic attempt to come to grips with one of the most fundamental problems of free government under law that of how to provide effectively by law for change in law and specifically of how to proceed when the law that prevents change is the law whose change is sought it is the reflexive or catch22 character of entrenchment that often makes it appear soluble only by going outside the system to cut through the dilemma current proposals for action by nuclear option have form that resembles that of the action taken by the house in 1910 because the dilemma they address has reflexive form similar to that of the house in 1910 as do contemporary advocat of consideration limits in the senate supporters of change in the house argued that the autonomy of deliberative body requires it to be able to entertain proposals to change rules when it deems necessary as do senate advocates today house reformers presented their claim as shift from an inappropriate to more correct principle of action but the house in 1911 concluded that unrestricted floor access for rules changes was subject to such abuses as to be unworkable as settled principle the events of 1975 in the senate could be viewed as representing corresponding development of thought in that body in order to promote the at tempt of that year to change the cloture rule the senate initially affirmed the propriety of permitting simple majority to close consideration of rules change at the beginning of congress by tabling point of order against motion that would have had that effect these proceedings enabled the senate to adopt amendments to the cloture rule that tended to facilitate limiting consideration at that point however the senate accepted reconsideration of the original point of order and decided to sustain it thereby rejecting the principle that voting majority could close consideration of rules changes and consequently reaffirming the entrenchment of senate rules 54 clarence cannon cannons

seemed prepared to accept some version of the claim based on the rulemaking power it always drew back in the end from ultimately confirming this claim instead affirming principles that supported entrenchment it is possible to see this course of events as manifesting the willingness of senators to accept resort to the constitutional rulemaking power as revolutionary principle but their unwillingness to maintain it as permanent possibility in the practice of the senate in present circumstances before the senate makes departure from accepted principles in favor of ones that might be unsustainable in the long run in order to achieve certain specific goals the body might wish to satisfy itself that the magnitude of the problem to be addressed genuinely warranted and its intractability genuinely required such action if consideration of this question concludes that the senate could not successfully regulate itself in the long run on the basis of the proposed principle then invoking that principle to meet immediate needs would presumably have to be justified instead on the grounds of something like revolutionary expediency like the house in 1910 the senate might have to justify its action on the grounds that the situation precluded any other means of amelioration it is of course concept that lies squarely at the heart of the american tradition that in such circumstances revolutionary action may appropriately be justified by appeals to explicitly stated arguments of exactly the kind just sketcheda concept both articulated in and exemplified by the declaration of independence itself

reflections suggest that if nuclear option involved abandonment of the practice of adherence to precedent in parliamentary rulings it could have the effect of replacing the current almost impenetrable resistance of senate procedure to change if the change is controversial with nearly uncontrollable volatility establishment of more sustainable balance between procedural stability and the senates control of its own rules might require action by other than extraordinary means presumably the senate would wish to have effective means of changing its rules at need and to adapt them to the needs of the times but it might not wish to foster continual change on an ad hoc basis in response to shifting immediate demands if rule regulating the consideration of proposals for change could be crafted in way that afforded an appropriate balance between these values the senate might be able to adopt it through its regular processes for amending its rules procedure adopted in this way could respond to considerations about what specific ways of proceeding would effectively permit action while still securing the possibility of meaningful exchange of views as the basis for finding broadly acceptable solutions if procedure were established by these means the senate might also be able to frame it in way that would take account in an explicit and appropriate way of the status of the senate as continuing body it might provide for example that change supported by majority too small to invoke cloture could be adopted but could not take effect until six years after its adoption such an arrangement would permit change in the long run while inhibiting changes by temporary majority for immediate purposes
