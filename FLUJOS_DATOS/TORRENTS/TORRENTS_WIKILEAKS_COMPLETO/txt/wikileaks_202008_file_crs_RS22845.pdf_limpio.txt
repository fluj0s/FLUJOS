issue in th ongoing sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear weapons program t okyos participation in the in ternational forum is dominated by its efforts to achieve progress on the abduc tion issue while the united states is now aggressively pursuing deal that provides ergy and economic assistance to north korea in exchange for the dismantlement of its nuc lear weapons program japan has refused to contribute aid without satisfactory progress on the kidnappings this had led to japans relative isolation in the multila teral talks although better re lations between new leaders in japan and south korea may provide some flexibility to end the impasse us interest in the abductions issue is driv by its needs for japans diplomatic and economic assistance in the negotiations as well as concerns that friction in the usjapan relationship will damage one of the united states most important alliances in the world1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845crs2 1 continued coordinated by emma chanle

politics japan policy research institute jpri working paper 101 june 2004us negotiators maintain that they str ongly support japans position on the abductees but also indicate that the issue will not block nuclear deal this stance contrasts with the pre2007 approach of the bush administrati on in which the abductions issue provided platform for tokyo and washingtons strategi c priorities to converge in the earlier six party talks the united states and japan jo ined to pressure north korea on not only nuclear weapons but also on human ri ghts refugees and the abductions the next several months are likely to be decisive for how the abductions issue will affect the usjapan relationship foremost is how progress in the sixparty talks proceeds if time pressure nd proliferation concerns lead the bush administration to accept nuclear deal with north korea that does not appear to enhance japanese security leaders in tokyo may find it difficult to convi nce their citizens to steadfastly support us strategic interests including military basing however amid some indications that tokyo may be reconsidering its priorities in the ne gotiations deal that extracts significant concessions from pyongyang could reinfor ce the fundamentally strong usjapan alliance background in the 1980s and 1990s circumstantial evid ence began to surface that north korean agents were responsible for th disappearance of several japane citizens isolated press reports addressed the suspicion but the ja panese government initially dismissed the accounts and reacted slowly to the allega tions as tokyo moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with pyongyang in the early 1990s so japanese politicians saw the issue as possible obstacle to normaliz ation and may have s uppressed information that suggested north koreas responsibility2 unconfirmed reports from north korean defectors emerged that japanese nationals were held by rth korea but the mainstream media largely ignored them then in 1996 an article appeared in wh ich north korean defector spoke about his experience at spy sc hool where native japanese trained agents in japanese language and culture support groups for the victims fa milies formed in japan and politicians particul arly those opposed to negotiating with pyongyang mobilized support in the diet parliament in 1998 py ongyangs test of an intermediaterange ballistic missile over ja pan raised security fears about the threat from north korea and made the general japanese pub lic more suspicious of its behavior eventually the kidnappings became part of the diplomatic agenda with rth korea and in september 2002 prime minister junichiro koizumi traveled to pyongyang to resolve the abductions issue and move to ward normalizing relations at the 2002 summit north korean leader kim jongil admitted to and apologized for north korean agents abduction of 13 ja panese citizens the kidnappings took placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845crs3 3 koizumi had presented list of 13 names of suspected abductees of which the north korean side said eight had died four were alive and one never entered north korea they also confirmed that one abductee not on the list was alive since then the japanese government has added three more names to the list for total of 17 abductees 4 one return abductees husband charles jenkins and two children did not return to japan with the others jenkins an american soldier who defected to north korea in 1965 feared facing desertion charges from the us military if he cam to japan japanese officials arranged for the family to reunite in indonesia and eventually for all four of them to come to japan in july 2004 turning himself into us authorities jenkins rved 25day sentence at us naval base in japan in november 2004 he was released and joined his family in northern japanin japan and europe between 1977 and 1983 he claimed that only five remained alive3 the japanese public shocked at the revelations became fixated on the drama with attention reaching its height month later when the five abductees were returned to japan in may 2004 koizumi returned to pyongyang to secure the release of five of the abductees children4 coverage of the abductees satura ted the press and the issue quickly became the top priority in japans north korea policy given north koreas record of truculen ce and denial many analysts expressed surprise that kim jongil admitted the kidna ppings and allowed the abductees and their families to return to japan however when tokyo pressed for proof of the remaining abductees deaths pyongyang produced apparen tly forged death certificates and traffic accident reports when asked for physical evidence north korean officials provided cremated human remains that most japanese felt to be of dubious origin see below and also claimed that some remains were washed away in floods the inconsistency and apparent deception compounded the japanese publics anger at north korea and reinforced the views of many conservativ politicians that pyongyang should not be trusted because of the shaky evidence toky determined that its policy would be based on the premise that all the re maining abductees are alive the effect of the abductions on japans political landscape as the abductee drama has played out three japanese prime ministers have navigated the issue in subtly different ways though alwa ys mindful of the emotional reaction of the public koizumis bold initiative to visit pyongyang in 2002 brought the issue to the surface although he may not have anticipated the strong response from the public koizumis position toward north korea gradually hardened as the publics criticism of north korea swelled and the bush administration indicated reluctance to aggressively pursue negotiated settlement with pyongyang his successor shinzo abe rose to prominence based on his hardline position toward north korea specifically on the kidnappings upon taking office abe tablished headquarters in the cabinet secretariat to coordinate abductee affairs led efforts to impose international and unilateral sanctions and restrictions when north kor ea tested missiles and nuclear device in 2006 and called for the immediate retu rn and safety of all the bductees on the assumption that all were still alive since assuming the pr emiership in 2007 yasuo fukuda has stated his interest in reengaging more actively in the sixparty talks but has not indicated that he will adjust japans policy on the abductees advocacy groups for the abductees note that he has retained the office that abe creat ed but voice some doubt that his stance will mirror abes approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845crs4 5 japan and north korea bones of contention international crisis group report june 2005 6 controversy over the remains ensued with scientific laborat ories providing conflicting reports on the dna analysis the science journal nature published an article questioning the integrity of the analysis performed by one of the labs in which one of the forensic experts who tested the remains said he could not rule out that the samples had become contaminated and therefore incapable of producing accurate results see nature volume 433434 februaryapril 2005due to the overwhelming public reaction th ere has been little open opposition to the official policy on the abductions oppos ition political parties have not challenged the ruling partys orthodoxy on the issue and politic ians from all parties have formed special diet committees to indicate th eir support for the victims advocacy groups have gained particular clout as the controversy grew the association of the families of victims kidnapped by north korea made up exclusively of relatives of the abducted have become major media figures other groups of conservative activis ts some explicitly committed to regime change in pyongyang have elevated their political influence and public profile5 among the most active of these are the national association for the rescue of japane kidnapped by north korea narkn the yokota case as with many popular movements the outrage over th abductees fates has powerful poster child megumi yokota was onl 13 years old when she was reportedly snatched by north korean agents on her wa home from school nort h korean officials claimed that she committed suicide in 1993 her case had drawn widespread media attention both domestically and internationally as the subject of documentaries and even an american folk song as leaders of the association of the families of victims kidnapped by north korea and in frequent media appearances yokotas parents have become the face of the abductee cause in 2006 president bush invited the yokotas to the white house later calling the encounter one of the most moving meetings since ive been the president earlier that day okotas mother testified in front of house subcommittee on asia and the pacific and subcommittee on africa global human rights and international operations joint hearing because of yokotas high pr ofile any progress or setback s to resolve her case is of particular symbolic importance the public reacted with outrage when north korea provided what they claimed were her cremat ed human remains to japan only to have japanese officials later announce that they were not yokotas6 at the 2002 summit north korea relayed that yokot had fifteenyearold daug hter reunion of yokotas parents with their granddaughter has been fl oated as possible path to reconciliation and observers maintain that an settlement of the yokota case would make significant impact on the public perception of the issue the abductions issue in the sixparty talks usjapanese tension as the bush administration has moved aggressively to reach deal on denuclearization with north korea in the sixparty talks since early 2007 distance has emerged between washingt on and tokyo japanese officials have expressed alarm that the united states may remove north korea from its list of statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845crs5 7 for more information see crs report rl30613 north korea terrorism list removal by larry niksch 8 for more information see crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons development and diplomacy by larry nikschsponsors of terrorism7 the removal considered likely by many analysts is one of series of phased actions agreed to in the sixparty talks in exchange for pyongyang allowing the disablement of the yongbyon reactor and providing declaration of nuclear programs in the past us leaders have li nked north koreas inclusion on the list to the abduction issue although state department officials reportedl claim that the issue is not legal obstacle for removal in december 2007 the committee on abduction of japanese citizens by north korea of japa ns lower house adopted resolution urging the united states to refrain from delisting north korea the resolution read in part we are concerned that if north korea is re moved from the list without repatriation of the detained victims the japanus alliance will be adversely affected and the japanese people will be grea tly disappointed us decision to delist north korea is unlikely to shake the foundations of the fundamentally strong lliance but japanese analysts say that the usjapan relationship could suffer in the shortterm if washington accepts weak deal if the japanese public views washington as abandoning the abductees japanese leaders may have difficulty convincing their public to tinue to support the united states on range of strategic interests including the hosting and realignment of us military bases in japan if however the government can point to enhanced japanese security because of north korean concessions on disarmament the public may be more accepting particularly if the united states continues to press pyongyang for more information on the kidnappings japannorth korean bilateral talks one of the five working groups established by the breakthrough february 13 2007 agreement in the sixparty talks is dedicated to resolving tokyos and pyongyangs bilate ral controversies8 the agreement states that the working group will hold talks to work toward the nor malization of relations on the basis of settlement of outstanding issues of concern phrase interpreted to mean the abductions and compensation to north kor ea for japans colonial rule of the korean peninsula from 19101945 two rounds of c onsultations in vietnam and mongolia yielded major progress on the stalemate only one other working group is dedicated to strictly bilateral issues the usnorth korean normalization pr ocess which some say indicates the high priority of the abduction issue on the other hand relegation of the abductions to separate track could demonstrate willingne ss to move the rest of the process forward without satisfact ory resolution of the kidnappings prospects for change in tokyos policy although the issue remains politically sensitive in japan many comme ntators acknowledge some degree of bductee fatigue among the japanese public governme nt officials and infl uential opinion leaders also privately voice concern th at the abductee issue has led to japans marginalization in the multilateral negotiations on north kor eas nuclear weapons program the combination of fears of diplom atic isolation and c oncern about range of security threats from north korea may lead the defense estab lishment and policy elite to support any shift or adjustment to the current policy on north koreahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22845crs6 9 japan and north korea bones of contention international crisis group report june 2005fukudas reputation as pragmatist w ho places special em phasis on developing closer ties with asian nations suggests th at he would be amenable to compromise approach to north korea particularly if pyongyang indicated any movement on the issue in addition his rhetoric when speaking about japans interests in north korea signifies shift from abes singular focus on the abductions issue f ukuda describes the kidnappings as one of three areas of concer n the others being pyongyangs nuclear and missile programs however fukudas tenuous hold on power and the threatened collapse of his ruling party have precluded any serious foreign policy initiatives the abductions issue and regional relations since the sixparty talks began tokyos focus on the abductions issue has isolated it from the other parties particularly china and south korea some critics say that the abductions issue allows japan to play the vi ctim while refusing to take responsibility for its own historical offenses par ticularly in the world war ii era9 thorny historical controversies between japan nd its neighbors however have showed significant signs of easing in the past few years after pe riod of rocky relations under koizumi abe and fukuda made strides in warming ties with seoul and beijing amid an overall detente in sinojapanese rela tions fukuda visited china in january 2008 when asked about the abductions i ssue during the visit chinese premier wen jiabao reportedly stated that we understa nd japans position and we are confident that resolution can be reached through dialogue new south korean president lee myung bak has stated explicitly that he does not intend to press japan to apologize for historical grievances as his predecessor did in his cap acity of special envoy lees brother who is also the vice speaker of south koreas national assembly reportedly told japanese officials that the new lead er understands and supports japans position on the abductee issue lee has also indicated that he is more willing to raise human rights issues with the north than his predecessor most observers think it is unlikely that chinese or south korean negotiators will actively champion the abductees cause but both capitals appear to recognize the need for japanese involvement and f unding in any diplomatic rrangement with north korea optimistic observers say that new leadership in tokyo and seoul combined with beijings interest in maintaining smooth re lations before the 2008 summer olympics and the bush administrations determination to reach negotiated agreement this year provide an environment ripe for breakthrough
