implications most current applications of nanotechnolog are evolutionary in nature offering incremental improvements in existing produc ts and generally m odest economic and societal benefits for example nanot echnology is being used in automobile bumpers cargo beds and stepassists to re duce weight increase resistance to dents and scratches and eliminate rust in clothes to increase stain and wrinkleresistance and in sporting goods such as baseball ba ts and golf clubs to improve performance in the longer term nanotechnology may deliver revolutionary advances with profound economic and societal implications potential applications discussed by the technologys proponents involve various grees of speculation and varying time frames the examples below suggest areas where such possible revolutionary advances may emerge and early research and development efforts that may provide insights into how such advances may be achieved detection and treatment technologies for cancer and other deadly diseases current nanotechnology dis ease detection efforts include the development of sensor s that can identify biomarkers such as altered genes that may provide an early indicator of cancer one approach uses carbon nanotubes and nanowires to identify the unique molecular signals of cancer biomarkers another approach uses nanoscale cantilevers resembling row of diving boards treated with molecules that bind only with cancer biomarkers when these molecules bind the additional weight bends the cantilevers indicating the presence and concen tration of these biomarkers nanotechnology holds promise for showing the presence location andor contours of cancer cardiovasc ular disease or neurological disease current rd efforts employ metallic magnetic and polymeric nanoparticles with strong imaging characteristics attached to an antibody or other agent that binds selectively with targeted cells the imaging results can be used to guide surgical procedures and to monitor the effectiveness of nonsurgical therapies in killing the disease or slowing its growth nanotechnology may also offer new cancer treatment approaches for example nanoshells with core of silica and an outer metallic shell can be engineered to concentrate at cancer lesion sites once at the sites harmless energy source such as nearinfrare d light can be used to cause the nanoshells to heat killing the cancer cells they are attached to another treatment approach targ ets delivery of tiny amounts of chemotherapy drug to cancer cells in this approach the drug is encapsulated inside nanoshell that is engineered to bind with an antigen on the cancer cell once bound the nanoshell dissolves releasing the chemotherapy drug killing the cancer cell such targeted delivery approach could reduce the

promise for improving the production of hydrogen from water using sun light the optical properties of these nanoscale catalysts allow the process to use wider spectrum of sunlight similarly nanostructured photovoltaic devices eg solar panels may improve the efficien cy of converting sunlight into electricity by using wider spectrum of sunlight improved hydrogen storage key challenge in fuel cell applications may be achieved by tapping the chemical properties and large surface area of certain nanostructured materials in ddition carbon nanotube fibers have the potential for reducing energy transmission losses from approximately 7 using coppe r wires to 6 using carbon nanotube fibers an equivalent nnual energy savings in the united states of 24 million barrels of oil3 universal access to clean water nanotechnology water desalination and filtration systems may offer affordable scalable and portable water filtration systems filters employing nanoscale pores work by allowing water mol ecules to pass through but prevent larger molecules such as salt ions and other impurities eg bacteria viruses heavy metals and organi c material from doing so some nanoscale filtration systems also employ matrix of polymers and nanoparticles that serve to attract water molecu to the filter and to repel contaminants4 highdensity memory devices variety of nanotechnology applications may hold the potentia l for improving the density of memory storage for example ibm has demonstrated the potential to create highdensity memory devices with an estimated storage capacity of 1 terabyte

nanotechnology also offers the potential for improved nutrition some companies are exploring the development of na nocapsules that release nutrients targeted at specific parts of the body at specific times7 selfhealing materials nanotechnology may offer approaches that enable materials to selfheal by incorporating for example nanocontainers of repa ir substance eg an epoxy throughout the material when crack or corrosion reaches nanocontainer the nanocontainer could be designed to open and release its repair material to fill the gap and seal the crack8 sensors that can warn of minute levels of toxins and pathogens in air soil or water microfluidic and nanocantilever sensors discussed earlier may be engineered to detect specific pathogens eg bacteria virus or toxins g sarin gas hydrogen cyanide by detecting their unique molecular si gnals or through selective binding with an engineered nanoparticle environmental remediation of contaminated sites the high surfacetovolume ratio high reactivity and small size of some nanoscale particles eg nanoscale iron may offer more effective and less costly solutions to environmental c ontamination by injecting engineered nanopar ticles into the ground these characteristics can be employed to enable the particles to move more easily through contaminated s ite and bond more readily with targeted contaminants9 nanotechnology is also

such as revenues market share and global trade statistics which are often used to assess and track us competitiveness in other mo re mature technolog ies and industries are not available for assessing the relative us position internationally in nanotechnology to date the federal government does not collect data on nanotechnologyrelated reve nues trade or employment nor is comparable international government data available nevertheless many experts believe that the united states is the global leader in na notechnology however some of these experts believe that in cont rast to many previous emerging technologies such as semiconductors sate llites software and biotechnology the us lead is narrower and the investment level scientific and industrial infrastructure technical capabilities and science and engineering workforces of other nations are more substantial than in the past in the absence of comprehensive nd reliable economic output data eg revenues market share trade indicator s such as inputs eg public and private research investments and non financial outputs eg scientific pape rs patents have been used to gauge nations competitiv position in emerging technologies by these measures discussed below the united states appears to lead the world generally in nanotechnology however rd investments scientific papers and patents may not provide reliable indicators of the united states current or future competitive position scientific and tec hnological leadership may not necessarily result in commercial leadership or national competitiveness for variety of reasons basic

and public understanding and attitude s ehs concerns include both direct consequences for health safety and the environment and how uncertainty about ehs implications and potential regulatory responses might aff ect us competitiveness one such effect might be the discouragement of investme nt in nanotechnology due to the possibility of regulations that might bar products from the market impose high regulatory compliance costs or result in produc t liability claims and cleanup costs some of the unique proper ties of nanoscale materials eg small size high surface areatovolume ratio have given rise to concerns about their potential implications for health safety and the nvironment while nanoscale particles occur naturally and as incidental byproducts of other human activities eg soot18 ehs concerns have been focuse d primarily on nanoscale materials that are intentionally engineered and produced much of the public dialogue about ri sks associated with nanotechnology has focused on carbon nanotubes cnts and othe r fullerenes molecules formed entirely of carbon atoms in the form of hollow sphere llipsoid or tube since they are currently being manufactured and are am

animals depend in part on their potential to accumulate especially in vital organs such as the lungs and brain that might harm or kill and diffusion in the environment that might harm ecosystems for example several produc ts on the market today contain nanoscale silver an effective antibacterial agent some scientists have raised concerns that the dispersion of nanoscale silver in the environment could kill microbes that are vital to ecosystems like nanoscale silver other nanoscale particles might produce both positive and negative effects for example some nanoscale particles have the potential to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier struct ure that protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood currently the ba rrier hinders the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain23 the characteristics of some nanoscale materials may allow pharmaceuticals to be developed to purposef ully and beneficially cross the blood brain barrier and deliver medicine directly to the brain to treat for example brain tumor alternatively other nanoscale pa rticles might uninten tionally pass through this barrier and harm humans and animals there is widespread uncertainty bout the potential

assess th relative value of nanotechnol ogys risks and benefits among those most likely to believe that benefits outweigh risk s were those earning more than 75000 per year men people who had previously heard some or lot about nanotechnology and those between the ages of 35 and 64 alternatively among those most likely to believe th at the risks of nanotechnology outweigh benefits include people earni ng 30000 or less those with high school diploma or less women racial and ethnic minorities and those between the ages of 18 and 34 or over age 6525 the pen survey found strong positiv correlation between familiarity with and awareness of nanotechnolog and perceptions that be nefits will outweigh risks however the survey data also indicat that communicating with the public about
