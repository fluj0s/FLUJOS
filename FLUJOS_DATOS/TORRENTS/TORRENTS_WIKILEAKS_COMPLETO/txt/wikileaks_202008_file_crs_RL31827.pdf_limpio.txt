copyright infringement litigation as they are today as consequence of litigation popular means of access to digital entertainment media may be foreclosed or dramatically altered while the public audience for digital consumption of entertainment grows the law and technology increasingly focus on digital means to protect copyright interests because of the great risk of piracy inherent in digital media exchanged over the internet consumers have reacted vociferously to new limitations imposed or proposed by new technological constraints many content users argue that ne w limitations on access to copyrighted materials impair their right to fair use but the contours of fair use as personal noncommercial use by end users ie consumers in dig ital environment and over the internet have not been fully establishe d or articulated by the courts arguably this process is in its early stages this report examines judicial case law which has considered the doctrine of fair use in relation to the first amendment the digital millennium copyright act and as means of protecting private nonco mmercial use of dig ital music and film by consumers it concludes that when th potential to infringe is great as it almost always will be in digital environment the courts have not been willing to expand fair use to encompass subsidiary uses such as time shifting space shifting or personal noncommercial use while many consumer advocates may wish to broaden the c ontours of fair use to permit free exchange of digital entertainment media via the internet in consumer context the courts have not done so in cases to date courts appear to be unwilling to employ the doctrine to trump the copyri ght holders interest in exclusive control of protected

involved in the nuances of copyright law as they are today the internet and digital technology have created vast new possibilities for and methods of distribution of popular entertainment such as music and film the publics current distribution and exchange practices of copyrighted material on the internet which may not be in compliance with the rights of copyright holders have nonetheless fueled consumer expectations and perhaps more than at any other time infringement claims are bringing the copyright holder and the end user into closer proximity suits against several peertopeer file sharing services such as napster for vicarious and contributory copyright infringement may have direct impact on the global internet community copyright law is ultimately commercial law it protects the creators right to financially exploit his or her intellectua l property to some extent traditional methods of copyright enforcement pitted th holder against middleman illegal replication and distribution we re more centralized in th activities of bootlegger or the innocent infringer digital technol ogy has essentially cut out the middleman and means of curtailing infringement are more visible and of greater interest to the public once unprotected material is trans mitted over the internet then as practical matter the copyright holder can longer attempt to effectively curb infringement by going after individual infringing distribut ors hence both the law and copyright holders view prevention as the key to c opyright protection encryption and other technological measures utilized to protect digital dia are referred to as digital rights management drm but while law and technology increasingl focus on drm to prevent piracy the publics experience to date with acquiring and manipulating digital media has created broad new expectations for continued access to desirable entertainment content copyright holders attempts to limit unauthorized distribution through encryption and other forms of drm and new laws that support digital protection have arguably upset those expectations consumers have reacted vociferously to new limitations imposed or proposed by new technological constraints many content users argue that new limitations on access to copyrighted materials impair their right to fair use but the contours of fair use as personal noncommercial use by end users ie consumers in dig ital environment have not been fully established or articulated by the courts arguably this process is in its early stages this report examines the concept of fair use as

the copyright clause of the constitution art i 8 cl 8 authorizes congress to promote the pr ogress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries the grant of copyright bestows monopoly on its holder to control various uses of th protected property including reproduction distribution public performance display and the preparation of derivative works1 the copyright act has many statutor limitations to the copyright monopoly of which fair use is but one they include the first sale doctrine which limits the copyright owners exclusiv control over distribution2 first sale permits the owner of particular copy or phonorecord to sell or dispose of the copy without the copyright owners permission but it expr essly disallows disposal by forprofit rental leasing or lending of sound reco rdings and computer programs other limitations include allowing certain reproductions by libraries and archives3 limited performances and displays for educational purpos or in the course of services at place of worship and certain performan ces for nonprofit charitable causes4 fair use has its origins as an equitabl rule of reason derived from english common law5 it is judiciallyarticulated concept that creates an exemption to the monopoly rights of the copyright holder many attribute its first prominent appearance in us law to be justice storys decision in folsom v marsh6 in which twovolume abridgement of the writings and letters of george washington was found to borrow too heavily from anothe r authors twelvevolume compilation7 the case is premised on the rule that fair nd bona fide abridgment of an original work is not piracy8 although the opinion holds that the abridgement in question was infringing it sets forth the factors which distinguish fair and bona fide abridgment from an infringing one these factors characterize the essence of fair use fair use remained exclusively judgemade doctrine until the 1976 copyright act when congress codified it at 17 u sc 107 the statute does not purport to provide an all inclusive definition rather it lays out its parameters specifically 107 provides that it will not be deemed in fringement when copyrighted material ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31827crs3 9campbell v acuffrose music inc 510 us 569 57778

the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work the purposes listed however are illustrative not comprehensive9 and because fair use is an equitable rule the courts will c onsider the public interest in and the goals of copyright10 courts conclusion that use is fair is mixture of law and fact in any specific context fair use and the first amendment fair use is traditionally referred to as an affirmative defense to an allegation of copyright infringement several recent cases raise the question whether copyrigh t laws including copyright protection laws such as the anticircumvention provisions of the digital millennium copyright act must pass judicial scrutiny under the free speech requirements of the first amendment although ther is broad societal right to limited use of material that is otherwise protected by copyright the doctrine is raised as defense when the use is challenged the burden of proof falls on the party claiming fair use11 the relationship between fair use and the first amendment was examined recently by the supreme court in eldred v ashcroft12 this decision upheld the constitutionality of the sony bono copyri ght term extensi on act which added twenty years to the term of copyright13 the court rejected the argument that law extending the term of copyright is in fact regulation of speech which violates the first amendment the court reasoned that because the copyright clause and the first amendment were adopted in close proximity the framers viewed copyrights limited monopoly as being compatible with fr ee speech principles copyright itself is an engine of free expression because it supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas there will rarely be direct conflic t between the copyright monopoly and the first amendment because the constitutions copyright scheme i ncorporates its ownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31827crs4 14123 s ct at 788 1517 usc 102b provides that in case does copyright protection for an

with respect to newer technologies are reverse engineer ing and the reproducti on and display of copyrighted thumbnail image on the internet in the early 1990s several courts of appeals held that the disassembly of c opyrighted computer program through reverse engineering in order to gain an understa nding of the unprotected functional elements of computer program is fair use17 the courts separate computer program into manageable components to f ilter unprotectible aspects eg expression dictated by external factors such as computers mechanical specifications from protectible creative expression

robin jeweler and christopher jennings january 23 2002 since enactment the copyright pr otection and manage ment provisions ie the anticircumvention provisions have proven controversia l while proponents assert that these provisions are essential to prot ect against massive piracy of copyrighted works critics argue that the dmca has chilling effect on rights of free speech and that its implementation will thwart th publics right of legitimate access to copyrighted works in order to exercise fa ir use to date however the courts have not been receptive to these challenges and those that have considered the anticircumvention provisions of the dmca in cluding its potential effect on fair use have upheld it access versus fair use the dmca prohibits unauthorized circumvention of measures which control access to protected work which is activity separate and apar t from copyright infringement although fair use is not defense to prohibited circumvention the ac t expressly states that fair use as defense to copyright infringement is not affected by it27 nevertheless there is relationship between access to and utilization of protected work which is not clearly addressed under the dmca28 defendants who have b een charged with violating 1201 have not been successful in asserting that access via unauthorized circumvention is necessary to permit the ex ercise of fair use in reaching this conclusion the courts have considered the relationshi p between access and fair use in universal studios v corley29 plaintiff motion pictur studios sued defendant eric corley and others for violation of 17 usc 120130 the studios distributed motion pictures for home use on digital vers atile discs dvd s and protected them from being copied using an encryption system called the content

of the plaintiffs and issu ed permanent injunction against the posting of decss31 on appeal defendantsappellants argued that the dmca unconstitutionally eliminates fair use the court rejected this as an extravagant claim32 reviewing supreme court dicta the cour t of appeals noted that t he supreme court has never held that fair use is constitutionally required 33 but the court declined to examine further the relationship between fair use and the constitution because fair use was not at issue the defendants did not claim to be engaged in fair use they were being enjoined from trafficking in decryption code that enabled unauthorized access to copyrighted materials the lower court had noted that there was scant evidence to determine the extent to whic h the antitrafficking provisions of the dmca prevents others from copying dvd movies in order to make fair use of them finally addressing the relationship be tween access and fair use the appellate court found that fair use has never been held to be guarantee of access to copyrighted material in order to copy it by th fair users preferre d technique or in the format of the original appellants have provided support for their premise that fair use of dvd movies is constitutionally required to be made by copying the original work in its original format we know of authority for the proposition that fair use as protected by the copyright act much less the constitution guarantees copying by the optimum method or in th identical format of the original the dmca does not impose even an arguable limitation on the opportunity to make variety of traditional fair uses of dvd movies such as commenting on their content quoting excerpts from th eir screenplays and even recording portions of the video images and sounds on film or tape by pointing camera camcorder or microphone at monitor as it displays the dvd movie the fact that the resulting copy will not be as perfect or as manipulable as digital copy obtained by having direct access to the dvd movie in its digital form provides basis for claim of unconstitutional limitation of fair use34 as examples the court suggested that constitutionallybased assertion of fair use permits neither the film critic to use movie camera in theater to review film nor the art student to make fair use of painting by photographing it in museumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31827crs8 35us

circumvention provisions and fair use the court concurred with the second circuits conclusion that there is legal authority which guarantees fair user the right to the most technologically conve nient way to engage in fair use38 hence the anticircumvention rules do not eliminate fair use by virtue of making it more difficult indeed the court observed that the crafting of the anticircumvention rules expressly protects the exercise of fair use the dmca bans both the act of circumventing and trafficking in devices that circumvent access controls to copyrighted work but with respect to use restrictions on protected works the act bans only the trafficking in and marketing of devices primarily designed to circumvent the use restriction protective technologies congress did not prohibit the act of circumvention because it sought to preser ve the fair use rights of persons who had lawfully acquired work see hr rep 105551 pt 1 at 18 1998 in fact congress expressly disclaimed any in tent to

thus circumventing use re strictions is not unl awful but in order to protect the rights of copyright owners while maintaining fair use congress banned trafficking in devices that are primarily designed for the purpose of circumventing any technological measure th at effectively protects right of copyright owner or that have limited commercially significant purposes other than circumventing use restrictions or th at are marketed for use in circumventing the use restrictions39 the distinctions are subtle but legally significant to the courts fair use analysis the anticircumvention rules prohibit acts and trafficking in devices intended to circumvent access controls they also prohibit trafficking in devices but not acts intended to bypass use controls even if the devices would bypass use restrictions in order to enable fair use as opposed to an infringing one thus it is not unlawful to circumvent for the purpose of engaging in fair use it is unlawful to traffic in tools that allo w fair use circumvention40 again distinguishing between access nd fair use the court concluded the dmca does not eliminate fair use or substantially impair the fair use rights of anyone congress has not banned or eliminated fair use and nothing in the dmca prevents anyone from quoting fro m work or comparing texts for the purpose of study or criticism the fair user may find it more difficult to engage in certain fair uses with regard to ectronic books but nevertheless fair use is still available41 fair use and personal use although not explicit in the copyright acts list of fair use factors there is judicial precedent for the assertion that consumers private noncommercial use of copyright protected material is embodied in the fair use doctrine much of this au thority is attributable to the oftcited us supreme court decision sanctioning time shifting in sony corp v universal city studios inc42 the court found that the sale of the betamax video tape recorder vtr did not constitute contributory copy right infringement because the device was capable of substantial noninfringing use the vtr allowed private viewers to tape free broadcast television to re play at their convenience ie time shift integral to the courts decision was its finding that subs tantial numbers of c opyright holders who licensed their work for broadcast did not object to having their broadcasts time shifted by private viewers and there was evidence of nonminimal harm to the potential market for or value of their copyrighted works congress can and has enacted express personal use limitations to

devices pay royalties on the devices which are distributed to copyright holders in recording industry assoc of america v diamond multimedia systems45 court of appeals held that the rio ndheld device capable of storing and re playing digital audio file stored on the hard drive of personal computer did not come within the ambit of the ahra in its analysis the court noted that the purpose of the ahra was to ensure the right of c onsumers to make anal og or digital audio recordings of copyrighted music fo r their private noncommercial use46 the rio could not make duplicates of any digital udio files it stored nor could it upload such file its sole output was an analog udio signal sent to user by headphones although the rio player did not come w ithin the ahra and therefore did not need to incorporate the scms the court did note the rios operation is entirely consistent with the acts main purpose the facilitation of personal use the rio merely makes copies in order to render portable or spaceshift those files that already reside on users hard drive47 although sony and diamond multimedia are frequently cited as authority for the assertion that time shifting and space shifting are personal uses that constitute legitimate fair uses the courts have been unwilling to expand these holdings to other contexts this is particularly so with digital media when the purported fair use threatens to erode or undermine the copyri ght holders ability to maintain exclusive control over the protected property in umg recordings inc v mp3com inc48 the us district court for the southern district of new york granted partial summary judgment finding that defendant mp3com infringed the copyrights of plaintiff recording companies the defendant mp3com opera ted service called m ymp3com which was advertised as permitting subscribers to store customize and listen to the recordings contained on their cds from any place wher they have an internet connection49 the defendant purchased thousands of cds in which the plaintiffs held copyrightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31827crs11 50203 f supp2d at 1135 citations omitted 5117 usc 117 52203 f supp2d at 1135and without authorization copied the recordings onto its computer server subscribers upon initial proof of ownership of the cd could then access it via the internet from any computer anywhere mp3com argued that its service was the functional equivalent of space shifting or storing the subscribers cd and was analogous to the time shifting permitted by the us supreme court in sony corp of america supra but the court disagreed finding presumptive case of copyright infringement because mp3com was in fact utilizing its unauthorized copy of the cd for the subscriber nor did the court find any other basis to s upport the defendants ssertion that its use of the plaintiffs recordings constituted fair use the court in elcom supra considered the impact of the dmca on the ability of content users to make back up c opies another type of personal use defendant makes much of the right to make backup copy of digital media for personal use holding this right up as an example of how the dmca eliminates fair use defendant relies heavily on recording industry association of america v diamond multimedia systems for the assertion that the right to make copy of electronic media for personal noncommercial use is paradigmatic fair use consistent with the copyright act but defendant overstates the significance and holding of that decision the ninth circuit was not presented with and did not hold that the right to make copy for personal use is protected as fair use right or protected as right guaranteed by the constitution rather the ninth circuit was discussing the audio home recordin g act the court held that copying for personal noncommercial use was consis tent with the audio home recording acts main purpose of facilitating personal use50 the court expressly declined to find rig ht to make backup copies and although it acknowledged that making back up c opy of an ebook would in all likelihood be fair use it distinguished it from another statutory grant under the copyright act to make backup copies of comput er programs for archival purposes51 but limited right to make back up computer progra m for archival purposes does not encompass broader right to make backup program to facilitate decryption courts have been receptive to the making of an archival copy of electronic media in order to safeguard against mechanical or electronic failure see vault corp v quaid software ltd 847 f 2d 255 267 5th cir1988 making backup copy of an ebook for personal noncommercial use would likely be upheld as noninfringing fair use but the right to make backup copy of computer programs is statutory right expressl enacted by congress in section 117a and there is as yet generally recognized right to make copy of protected work regardless of its format for personal noncommercial use there has certainly been generally recognized first amendment right to make backup copies of electronic works52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31827crs12 53am records inc v napster inc 114 f supp 2d 896 ndca 2000 affd

its users did not meet any of the statutory parameters tablishing fair use purpose and character of use while acknowledging that users downloading from napster are not engaging in paradigmatic commercial activity neither are they engaged in personal use in the traditional sense ie copying occurring within the household which doe s not confer any financial benefits on the user the court

anonymous requester54 nature of the work the court fo und that the sound recordings constitute entertainment not ducational material amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole the court found it to be undisputed that th copying of mp3 music files involves copying the entirety of the work which is inconsistent with fair use the effect of the use upon the potentia l market for the copyrighted work the record companies produced evidence monstrating that napster use reduces cd sales among college st udents and raises barriers to the companies entry into the market for digital downloading of music napster users receive for free something that they would otherwise purchase which may adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work the court also
