director and those held by cms recommendation to ensure the com pleteness and accuracy of the cms staffing table the cms adm inistrative nd fund managem ent officer should liaise with the of fice of the deput executive director of unep and unon system s support unit to put in place procedures to facilitate flow of inform ation between the three offices sufficient to ensure that all three have an

staffing table b recruitm ent of staff 30 at the tim of the audit cms was operating at about 50 percent of its official staff strength oios was particularly surprise d to note that though the executive secretary was retiring at the end of july 2004 the vacan cy notice was advertised with deadline of 20 july 2004 and the post of deputy executive secretary was also vacant 31 furtherm ore various posts for colocated agreem ent secretariats have been advertised or are pending approval for r eclassification to higher levels oios concluded that the problem is caused by inadequate arrangem ents between unep headquarters and unon for handling recru itment requests of offices away from nairobi headquarters in tim ely m anner which is partly explained by problem s experienced in getting galaxy operational within unep and cms recommendation to ensure tim ely recruitm ent and to ensure that arrangem ents exist for tem porarily filling posts where recruitm ent cannot be completed before departure the deputy executive director of unep should initiate review into current unep unon practices for dealing with recruitm ent of staff for offi ces away from nai robi 6 headquarters in the short term every effort should be m ade to bring cms back to its f ull com pliment which will reduce the need f or consultants and individual contractor s and the risk of their m isuse rec 08 32 unep

practices for dealing with recruitm ent of staff for offices away from nairobi headquarters c consultants 33 cms and the three colocated agreem ent secretariats used 54 consultants for the period january 2002 to june 2004 the current system for awarding contracts needs to be strengthened for the following reasons roster was not being used and often selection of consultants was not based on evaluation of at least three candidate s as recom mended by sections 41 and 42 stai19977 on consultants and individual contractors b docum entation that when consultant s contract period exceeded period of 6 months form evaluation of the work perform ed was carried out as required by section 313 of stai19997 c the nationality was concentrated m ainly in one location and there were guidelines on how general service consu ltants fee was determ ined thus the audit team could not ascertain the basis of the fees recommendation to ensure full com pliance with stai19997 on consultants and individual contractors the head of cms should create roster from which candidates can be selected com petitively and which includes dif ferent nationalities and genders procedures also need to be developed explaining the basis for determ ining fees and how consultant perf ormance will be evaluated rec 09 34 unep commented that the recommendation is accepted and will be implemented oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the establishm ent of the consultants roster and copy of the procedures explaining the basis f or determ ining f ees and how

arrangem ents for their selection and use one individual contractor was used continuously from january 2002 to the tim of audit in breach of stai19997 which pr ovides that individual m ay serve as an individual contractor for m ore than ne work m onths in any period of twelve consecutive m onths without the approva l of the office of hum an resources 7 managem ent ohrm the audit team verified that neither hrms of unon nor ohrm had authorized the continued use of this individual contractor justif ication f or prior arrangem ents was available for review but cms explained that the draft budget proposal for 20062008 includes justification for review by the conf erence of the parties to establish g6 post b there was m echanism for form ev aluation of individual contractors who exceed period of 6 m onths as required by section 513 of stai19997 c the nationality was concentrated m ainly in one location d roster was not kept and used nd individual contractors were often not competitively selected as required by sections 41 and 42 of stai19977 36 as the problem is adequately addressed under consultants section of this report additional recom mendation is therefore raised pas 37 the audit team confirm ed that pas d been carried out in accordance with stai20023 perform ance appraisal system up to the latest cycle where the outgoing executive secretary f elt it inappropriate to set goals and objectives for staff which might tie the hands of his successor in ddition he was unable to com plete all pas for the 20032004 cycle before his departure this problem is linked with that raised above on inadequate arrangem ents for recru itment additional recom mendation is therefore raised facility management move to new building 38 cms and its colocated agreem ent secretariats have adequate arrangem ents in place whereby an official represents and attends all task force m eetings at all stages of the planning design and im plem entation phases to discuss progress with regard to the move planned in mid2005 or thereafter b maintenance costs in new building 39 current m aintenance costs estim ated to be approxim ately us255000 have been funded by the germ an governm ent annually since the convention was located in bonn the m ove to the new building should not affect this agreem ent based on an exchange of letters with the germ an governm ent between 1984 and 1989 unep commented that this exchange was recently reconfirmed by the provisions of the new headquarters agreement between the german government unep and cms which came into force in june 2004 since the audit took place the acting executive secretary has been assured by the german authorities that the latter will continue to refund all the maintenance costs of cms including the coloc ated agreements this assurance was given in the specific context of the propos ed transfer of cms the agreements and all other agencies in bonn to new campus in 2005 in light of this additional inform ation oios has
