international threats are few but most certainly do exist mostly when private property is impressed into military service not in the theater of actual war successful takings claims in the intern ational area often involving national security are made difficult by four princi ples first international dangers have consistently prompted courts to extend extra deference to responsive government measures when resolving regulatory taki ngs claims second courts say that when dealing in foreign commerce the possibility of evolving world circumstances and us response thereto make any expect ation of government noninterference unreasonable third the benefit accruing to the property owner from the government action may outweigh the harm and fourth there is deference to the presidents constitutional role as representative of the federal government in the field of foreign relations often expressed as the political question doctrine the protection extended by the takings cl ause also depends on the legal status of the propertys owner the property of us citizens gets the most protection enemy alien property none and friendly alien propert somewhere in between depending on whether the alie n has substantial connections with the united states takings claims against the freezing and vesting of foreign assets have universally been rejected though with an occasional judicial cau tion that an overly protracted freeze might be taking in other areas government frustration of performance under internationa l commercial contracts app ears to have yielded successful takings claims while law enforcement where physical damage results from the pursuit of criminal suspects or financial damage results from the operation of front organizations has prompted so judicial concerns and minority of successful takings claims at the state level in sharp contrast with th poor record of takings claims in the above areas claimants challenging the impressing of private property into military or related government service generally have prevailed wartime or not examples include military overflights seizure and operation of coal mines during wartime and requisitioning of private

conflict and terrorism property rights issues to be sure property rights are not th first thing that leaps to mind when thinking about wars terrorism and intern ational conflicts ye t among the federal actions taken to deal with such threats direct impingements on private property rights are common besides the obvious ravages of battle there have historically been military occupations or

action of us nationals against foreign governments or their nationals such impingements on private property can be quite severe involving si gnificant assets owned by u s citizens friendly aliens or enemy aliens unsurprisingly holders of such property have cried foul they have claimed that their property was taken and manded compensation invoking the takings clause of the fifth amendment1 indeed government responses to 911 have already generated at least three reported cases resolving takings claims2 this report reveals that based on case law to date takings clause limits on federal response to international threats appear to be few but most certainly do exist chiefly when private property is impressed into military service not in the theater of actual war however the case law has not yet addressed all areas in the foreignconflicts realm that could potentially raise takings claims one further caution most cases cited in this report deal with clearly defined enemies and clearly delineated theaters of war the newer decisions are just beginning to address takings clause issues in the blurrier context of combating terrorism where the enemy may be terrorismsupporting states with whom the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32629crs2 3 forerunner in this gray area is sardino v federal reserve bank of new york 361 f2d 106 111112 2d cir cert denied 385 us 898 1966 due process

particular rele vance to international threats and national security present daunting obstacles for takings claims in this area heightened judicial deference in regulatory takings cases international dangers ve consistently prompted courts to extend extra deference to responsive government measures when dealing with regulatory takings claims regulatory takings claims are those based on the governments restriction of propertys use rather than its physical invasi on or outright expropriation of the property indeed the judi cial deference is great enoug h that our research failed to reveal any instance where regulatory taking claim based on federal government action against an international threat has succeeded statements of judicial deference are found in numerous cases rejecting regulatory takings claims against the united states claims based on 1 the federal governments temporary wa rtime shutdown of nonessen tial gold mines to free up needed mine workers and mining

reasonable investment backed expectations in most of its later regulatory takings decisions see eg palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 626 2001 emphasis added 8 this principle is loosely related to

fed cir 20025 the condor operating co and paradissiotis decisions demonstrate that heightened judicial deference is not rest ricted to international dangers of the traditionalwar variety or even to hostilities at all one element of the general regulatory takings analysis is balancing of the governmental interest advanced by the challenged government action against the burden imposed on the property owner6 the foregoing decisions in the international conflict and terrorism realms often do not explicitly link their statements of deference to this broad takingstest f actor but such relative weighing is obviously what they are doing in the case of major threats to the security of the state the governmental interest is deemed to be so compelling as to be dispositive or nearly so reduced expectations when doing business internationally another factor in the general regulatory takings test is the extent to which the governments action frustrated the reasonable investmentbacked expectations of the property ownerplaintiff7 citing this factor the courts unanimously have spurned the takings claims of persons whose re lations with foreign countries through contracts leaseholds cause s of action for compensation etc were frustrated when the united states responded to deteriorating or hos tile relations with those countries when dealing in foreign commerce these decisions say the possibility of changing world circumstances and us response thereto make any expectation of government noninterference unreasonable one is charged with awareness that relations between the affected countries might sour and that the government might act in way that interferes with ones property rights8 see eg 767 third avenue assocs v united states 48 f3d 1575 f ed cir 1995 chang v

rejected the taking claim because the challenged government action also conferred substa ntial benefit on the plaintiff even if incidental benefit accrued to the united states as well the leading case is ymca v united states 395 us 85 92 1969 where taking was found when us troops occupied buildings in panama to protect them from rioters accord abrahimyouri v united states 139 f3d 1462 fed cir 1997 belk v united states 858 f2d 706 709 fed cir 1988 deference to government conduct of foreign policy and the presidents role as commander in chief political question doctrine yet another recurring hurdle for the taking plaintiff is judicial deference to the presidents constitutional role as representative of the federal government in the field of international relations and his latitude as commander in chief matters intimately related to foreign policy and national secur ity are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention haig v agee 453 us 280 292 1981 accord regan v wald 468 us 222 242 1984 this deference plays out both as to 1 the reviewability of the government action on which the taking cla im is based and 2 as factor in the taking analysis itself reviewability of the government action on which the taking claim is based government declarations and decisions i nvolving national emergencies war and foreign relations are often held to be outside the judicial reach generally on political question grounds the classic st atement of the political question doctrine remains that of baker v carr 369 us 186 1962 which recognized that onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32629crs5 10 as have nontakings claims involving international conflicts see eg beacon products corp v reagan 633 f supp 1191 11941195 d mass 1986 whether nicaragua posed

presidents actions constituted taking certain types of cases are committed to the judicial branch for resolution to be beyond judicial reach under the doctrine case must involve at least one of six factors among them whether there is textually demonstrable commitment of the issue to coordinate political department or lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it id at 217 numerous takings claims involving in ternational conflicts have foundered on the politicalquestion shoal10 for example belk v united states 858 f2d 706 fed cir 1988 dealt with the algerian accord s under which the united states and iran ended the hostage crisis in 1981 several of the former hostages argued that because the accords extinguished their causes of acti on against iran the us had taken those causes of action11 though denying their claim on the merits the court concluded alternatively that review of policy decision made by the president during an international crisis is barred as political question most if not all of the baker v carr concerns are present in this case id at 710 most recently the federal circuit used the political question doctrine to rebuff taking claim brought by the owner of manufacturing plant in the sudan destroyed by us cruise missiles elshifa pharmaceutical industries co v united states 378 f3d 1346 fed cir 2004 the missile att ack was ordered by president clinton following bombings of two us embassies in east africa based on us belief that the perpetrators were associated with alqaeda and that the plant was manufacturing chemical weapons for alq aeda the court found that the constitution commits to the president the power to designate enem property in foreign territory so under the first baker factor the matter was nonj usticiable political question12 because the court thus had to accept that plaintiffs property was enemy property there could be taking see section ii13 however the court stressed the limited nature of its ruling in two respects the outcome might have been different it said had the planthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32629crs6 14 one presumes the court is referring to the additional process that might be required to designate enemy property in the us there can be little question that enemy property may be taken or destroyed without compensation even in the us see section ii of this report 15 penn central transp co v new york city 438 us 104 124 1978been located in the united states14 or had there been evidence that the president had in fact determined that the plant be longed to an enemy of the united states not every case or controversy that t ouches on foreign re lations lies beyond judicial cogniz ance as political question baker 369 us at 211 courts assert that the doctrine is narrow one and are aware it offers tempting refuge for the government defendant thus the political question defense was rejected in langenegger v united states 756 f2d 1565 fed cir cert denied 474 us 824 1985 where the taking claim was based on salvadors confiscation of us citizenowned land as part of an agrarian reform program encouraged by the united states resolution of the case said th court required determination of

takings analysis itself i n rockefeller center properties v united states 32 fed cl 586 1995 the merits of the taking claim were reached the treasury departments blocking of assets pursuant to the international emergency ec onomic powers act was found to further the important public interest in the presidents ability to deal with international events this public interest entered the takings

extended by the takings cl ause depends first on the legal status of the propertys owner whether us citizen friendly alien or enemy alien in the case of friendly aliens it depends furt her on the territorial or extraterritorial location of the property the law developing in this area is particularly important in light of the increasing frequency with which congressional statutes reach extraterritorial conduct and with which us offices abro ad pursue the fight against terrorism drug trafficking count erfeiters and corr upt financiers us citizens the general rule is that the takings

located in foreign country united states v verdugourquidez 494 us 259 1990 in holding that the fourth amendment does not the cour t surveyed other cases including russian volunteer fleet in which it had held that friendl aliens enjoy certain rights under the us constituti on those cases it clarified blish only that aliens receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the united states and developed substantial connections with this country id at 271 but because verdugourquidez involved the fourth amendm ent and because its holding was not based exclusively on the subs tantial connections prerequisite its authoritativeness with regard to russian volunteer fleet and the takings clause remained in doubt17 newer case law has grappled with the effect of verdugourquidez on the takings clause ruling unanimously that th substantial connecti ons rule does apply to alienfiled claims given the extraterritorial location of both plaintiffs and their property

philippine corporation was taking the court had rejected the governments broad argument that the takings clause lacks extraterritorial application in its recent elshifa case the federal circuit characterized turney as counseling in favor of applying the takings clause extraterritorially despite the absence of substantial connections placing turney squarely in conflict with verdugourquidez it expressly declined to resolve this conflict however because it did not need to elshifa could be dismissed solely on political question grounds see section i at present then the federal circuit has not ruled authoritatively on whether there is substantialconnec tions prerequisite for taking s claims brought by friendly aliens against the united states case law reviewed above however suggests that if
