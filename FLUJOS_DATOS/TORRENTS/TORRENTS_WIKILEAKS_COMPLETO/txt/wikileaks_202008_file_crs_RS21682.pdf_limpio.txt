associated w ith their purchase of the following items for use by the educator in the classroom books supplies other th an nonathletic supplies forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21682crs2 1 classroom expenses that may be deducted so must qualify under section 162 as trade or business expenses ie the expenses must be ordinary and necessary but not capital in nature presumably then the cost of computers as well as computer software with useful life of more than one year must be capitalized and their depreciation claimed as an educator classroom expense deduction or as miscellaneous itemized deduction the latter tax benefit is addressed later in this reporthealth or physical education c ourses computer equipment software and services other equipment and supplementary materials1 homeschooling expenses are not mentioned these expenses can be deducted as an adju stment to gross income the abovethe line adjustment can be taken whether or not taxpayers itemize their deductions an eligible educator is defined in section 62d1a as an individual who with respect to any tax year is an k12 teacher instructor counselor principal or aide in school for minimum of 900 hours in school year the amount of deductible classroom expe nses is not limited by the taxpayers income however educators must reduce th total amount they ve expended on eligible items by any interest from an education sa vings bond or distribution from section 529 program or coverdell education savings ccount that was excluded from income in other words if educators or members of their tax filing unit utilize earnings from these savings vehicles to pay tuition or other qua lified educational expe nses only the classroom expenses that exceed the value of th income exclusions are deductible the allowable amount of expenses would be entered on the ppropriate line on form 1040 or form 1040a filers of form 1040ez ca nnot take this adjustment to income there are few ambiguities concerning the deduction that relate to the hours requirement while the educator presumably would claim the deduction for the tax year januarydecember during which they incurre d unreimbursed classroom expenses they must have worked 900 hours in school durin g the school year septemberjune to be eligible for the tax benefit would an individual who began working as teacher at the start of the september 2006june 2007 school year be able to take the deduction in tax year 2006 for expenditures made during the firs t term if they had not yet fulfilled the hours rule but expected to do so by the end of the school year the linkage between the hours rule and the school year suggests anot her unclear point does the work time of eligible school personne l during july and august as pa rt of summer school or year round schedule for example c ount toward the requirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21682crs3 2 educators may use both the temporary cla ssroom expense deduction and the permanent deduction for unreimbursed employee business xpenses however taxpayers cannot take both deductions for the same expenses 3 for example section 62a2d requires that ite ms be used in the classroom by the individual who purchased them thus principals appare ntly could not take the deduction for books they bought for the use of teachers in their classrooms in addition school counselors or other eligible educators who subscribe to professional journals or pay dues to professional societies andor unions for example could apply these expenses toward the trade or business expense deduction but not the classroom expense deduction another example of nonclassroom expense covered by section 162 is education related to ones cu rrent job this last unreimbursed jobrelated expense will be discussed later in the report 4 certain occupations that can fully deduct workrelated expenses from gross income are performing artists and state and local official s working on fee basis individuals with disabilities also can fully deduct expenses they incur that enable them to workrelated federal tax provisions trade or business expenses there is permanent deduction for trade or business expenses in section 162 of the irc it coexists with the temporary targeted deduction2 although business expenses have been ductible for many years concern about misuse led to the imposition of limitations on their deductibility trade or business expenses generally are component of cellaneous itemized deduc tions taxpayers can only take deduction to the extent the total of miscellaneous deductions exceeds 2 of their adjusted gross income agi eligible school personnel ma want to utilize the section 162 deduction because it covers broader range of expenditures co mpared to the classroom expense deduction3 but to do so they must itemize their deductions ie they must have deductible expenses such as interest on home mortgage that exceed the standard deduction alternatively the classroom expenses duction allows educat ors to avoid having to meet the 2 of agi floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions most other taxpayers with earned income who have trade or business expenses must exceed the 2 floor for miscellaneous expenses in order to take deduction for jobrelated expenses4 i n addition the miscellaneous ite mized deduction for trade or business expenses is not allowed for purposes of the lternative minimum tax unlike the treatment of abovethe line deductions the temporary abovetheline deduction also means that eligible educators in higher income families may not have to subject classroom expe nses of 250 or less to the limit on itemized deductions higher income taxpayers must reduce their allowable itemized deductions by percentage of their income in excess of an inflationadjusted threshold the reduction is calculated after the 2 floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions use of the educator classroom expense deduction also inter acts with other tax provisions through its reduction of agi by wering their agi the adjustment to income enables taxpayers to claim more of those ductions subject to an agi floor eg medicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21682crs4 5 section 170c1 of the irc relates to char itable contributions to public entities including public schools section 170c2 covers cor porations foundations and other enterprises organized and operated exclusively for educationa l among other specified purposes eg private schools and certain charitable organizationsand miscellaneous deduc tions it also may affect the amount of certain credits eg the earned income tax credit contributions to schools educators continue to have another tax benefit available to them that could improve the qua lity of students education they like other taxpayers may make charitabl contributions to public nd private schools of magazine subscriptions for example that the schools th can distribute to t hose same teachers or others for classroom use5 educators and others can make such charitable contributions and avoid the previously discussed 2 floor applicab to miscellaneous itemized deductions taxpayers must be able to itemize their deductions to take charitable contribution deduction however the choice between taking an educator classroom expense deduction and charitable contribution deduction for computer expens has an additional complication when computers are taken as an educator ex pense deduction or miscellaneous itemized deduction taxpayers can consider only the annual depreciation associated with the computer as trade or business expense when computers are donated to schools or certain charitable organizations however taxpayers can consider the actual value eg purchase price if new and fair market value if used as charitable deduction legislative activity the
