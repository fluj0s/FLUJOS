under the immigration and nationa lity act ina to detain noncitizens aliens1 in the united states the law provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting determination of whether they should be removed from the united states and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention ie the aliens must be detained by the department of homeland security dhs aliens not subject to mandatory dete ntion may be detained pa roled or released on bond enemy combatants at the guantanamo u s military base in cuba are not under the authority of dhs nor are noncitizens incar cerated in federal state and local penitentiaries for criminal acts any alien can be detained while dhs determines whether the alien should be removed from the united states the large majority of the detained aliens have committed crime while in the united states have served their criminal sentence and are detained while underg oing deportation proceedings other detained aliens include those who arrive at portofe ntry without proper documentation eg fraudulent or invalid visas or documentation but most of these aliens are quickly returned to their country of origin th rough process known as expedited removal2 the majority of aliens rriving without proper documen tation who claim asylum are held until their credible fear hearing but some asylum seekers are held until their asylum claims have been adjudicated there are many policy issues surroundi ng detention of aliens including concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory deten tion and the justness of mandatory detention especi ally as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation some have raised concerns bout the length of time in detention for aliens who have been ordered removed dditionally issues have been raised about the amount of detention space available to house dhs detainees another area of uncertainty is the attorney generals role in the detention of noncitizens since

2003overview of noncitizen detention changes in authorities with the creation of the department of homeland security the ina provides the attorney general with broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting determinati on of whether they should be removed from the united states3 but the creation of dhs moved the ad ministration of dete ntion of noncitizens from the department of justices immigration and naturalization service ins to dhs under secretary of border and transportation security4 while current regulations vest all authorities and functions of the dhs to administer and enforce the immigration laws with the secretary of homeland security hereafter the secretary or his delegate5 it can be argued that the language in the homeland security act of 2002 hsa6 has left the attorney general with concurrent authority over immigration law7 the ninth circuit in armentero v immigration and naturalization service for example appeared to struggle with determining who should be the correct respondent in habeas petition filed by an ins detainee the ninth circuit stated because the homeland security act transf ers most immigration law enforcement responsibilities from the ins subdivision of the department of justice to the bts directorate of border and transpor tation security subdivision of the department of homeland security the ex tent of the attorney generals power to direct the detention of aliens is unclear8 the court further concluded that until the exact parameters of the attorney generals power to detain aliens under the new home land security scheme are decisively delineated we believe it makes sense for immigration habeas petitioners to name the attorney general in addition to naming the dhs secretary as respondents in their habeas petitions in addition both doj through the executive office of immigration review eoir and dhs have authority for dete rmining bond for aliens officials within dhs also make bond determina tions that may or may

d ecision the attorney general states that he retains the authority to detain or authorize bond for aliens but the authority is shared with the secretary since dhs officials make the initial determination whether an alien will remain in custody during removal proceedings11 statutory authority for detention the ina gives the attorney general the authority to issue warrant to arrest and detain any alien in the united states while awaiting determination of whether the alien should be removed from the united states12 as result of the hsa the daily responsibi lity for detaining aliens

immigration law it is permissible for state and local law enforcement officers to inquire in to the status of an immigrant during the course of their normal duties in enforcing state and local law for

proceedings and must detain all aliens who are charged as terrorists and almost all aliens charged as criminals upon their re lease from criminal incarceration whether they are released on probation or parole37 indefinite detention the mandatory detention provisions created in iirira led to some aliens being in indefinite administrative custody these aliens had been ordered removed from the united states but were detained because the aliens could not obtain travel documents to another c ountry or the immigration officials refusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32369crs8 38 most indefinite detainees were from countries that lack normal diplomatic relations with the united states eg cuba iran or north kor ea the majority of lifers were cubans who came during the mariel boatlift the mari boatlift was an influx of asylum seekers during sevenmonth period in 1980 wh approximately 125000 cubans and 25000 haitians arrived by boat to south florida bout 10 of the mariel cubans had histories of mental illness or violent crime other i ndefinite detainees were stateless people eg palestinians and persons from the former so viet union who do not meet the citizenship requirements for any of the newly independent states or persons whose nationality could not be determined other indefinite detainees were from countries that refused to accept the return of their nationals eg vietnam laos cambodia and the peoples republic of china or from countries experiencing immense upheaval others may have been indefinitely detained because the alien d strong ties to the united states and only attenuated connections to their country of orig in for example an alien may be brought by his parents to the united states as twoyear old and live in the united states for 40 years without naturalizing if the person commits crime and is removable his birth country may refuse to take him for more on the mariel cubans see us house of representatives committee on appropriations report on

estimate d that it had 5000 aliens in indefinite administrative custody39 in 54 decision in zadvydas v davis 200140 the us supreme court held that statute permitting indefinite detention would raise serious constitutional problems because the due process clause of the fifth amendment prohibits depriving any person including aliens of liberty without due process of law therefore in keeping with principles of statutory construction and the absence of clear congressional intent for indefinite detention the court read an implicit limitation into the postremoval detention statute such that detention is limited to period reasonably necessary to achieve an aliens removal the supreme court established six months after the removal or der as the presumptively reasonable period within which to effect rem oval after this period once an alien shows that there is good reason to believe that there is significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future the gove rnment must rebut that showing with sufficient evidence the court emphasized that its holding does not mean that all aliens must be released in six months nor that an alien may not be held until it has been determined that there is signif icant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future the court suggested that special arguments could be made for statutory scheme of preven tive detention for terrorists or other aliens in special circumstances and for heightened judicial deference for executive and legislative branch decisions regarding national security mattershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32369crs9 41 66 federal register p 56967 2001 8 cfr at 2414 24113 and 24114 42 michael creppy operating policies and procedures memorandum november 19 2001 reprinted in

division 45 inadmissible aliens have not yet been admitted to the united states after inspection and are ineligible to be admitted legally deporta ble aliens have been inspected and admitted to the united states but subsequently have become ineligible to remain and are subject to removal those who are physically in the ited states but who entered without inspection ie illegally are also considered inadmissible longstanding legal doctrine commonly known as the entry fiction holds that thos who are inadmissible have right to enter or remain in the country whereas those w ho are deportable do have greater protectionsin response to this decision the attorney general issued regulations governing the review of postremoval order detention cases for determination of foreseeability of removal the attorney general issu ed regulations effective november 14 2001 concerning the continued dete ntion of aliens subject to final orders of removal that are consistent with the zadvydas decision41 subsequently chief immigration judge michael creppy issued memorandum on the immigration courts policy regarding these regulations the regulations and th memorandum establish four categories of aliens whose removal from the united states is not foreseeable but whom the attorney general may continue to detain these special circumstances include aliens with highly contagious disease that poses threat to public safety aliens whose release would cause serious adverse foreign policy consequences aliens detained for security or terrorism reasons and aliens determined to be specifically dangerous of these four categories only the fourth requires the involvement of the immigration court the other three re main under dhs discretion42 between november 14 2001 and march 9 2005 only 17 aliens whose re moval was not foreseeable had been detained under the special circumstances two aliens were detained because of serious adverse foreign polic consequences and 15 were detained because they were determined to be sp ecifically dangerous43 in clark v martinez 44 the court held that the rationale it applied in zadvydas to aliens who had been admitted to the united states and were deportable also applied to aliens who had not been legally admitted into the united states were found inadmissible and orde red removed and were be ing detained beyond the statutory removal period although rem oval was not reasonably foreseeable45 accordingly the sixmonth presump tive detention period applied in zadvydas the court explicitly let stand an older decision which distinguished between the indefinite detention of an excludable alien similar to inadmissible alien under current law who sought to enter the ited states and depor table alien who hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32369crs10 46 prior to iirira aliens ine ligible to enter the country were excludable rather than inadmissible and were subject to exclusi on proceedings while deportable aliens were subject to deportation proceedings after iirira exclusion and deportation proceedings were consolidated into removal proceedings but certain aliens are subject to expedited removal the salient difference between excl udable and inadmissible aliens is that aliens who entered without inspection were not consid ered excludable whereas such aliens are now considered inadmissible which means they are not entitled to the same level of rights in removal proceedings this change was made as disincentive to entering illegally since formerly the entry fiction worked in favor of those who entered illegally 47 160 l ed 2d at 752 48 ina 235b1ai for more on expedited removal see crs report rl33109 immigration policy on expedited removal of aliens by alison siskin and ruth ellen wasem 49 under the ina expedited removal can also be applied to aliens who enter the united states without inspection ie cross the border without being inspected by an immigration inspector and cannot establish that they have been physically present in the united states for more than two years but it has yet to be applied to those who entered without inspection ina 235b1aiiientered the united states46 therefore the court had suggested that it might reach different conclusion for inde finite detention of inadmissible aliens from the one it reached in zadvydas for deportable aliens and noted that the statutory purposes and constitutional concerns for deportable aliens were not the same for inadmissible aliens however in clark v martinez it decided that to treat inadmissible aliens differently under the removal statute would render an inconsiste nt interpretation of the removal statute where the statute itself made distinction between the treatment of inadmissible and deportable aliens justice thomas criticized the courts opinion as departing from its constitutional rationale in zadvydas and its suggestion in that case that inadmissible aliens presented different situation47 at the same time justice thomas agreed with the courts fidelity to the text of the removal statute he believed that zadvydas had been wrongly decided and should have been overruled expedited removal and detention aliens who arrive in the united states without valid documentation or with false documentation are subject to process known as expedited removal under which the alien is ordere d removed from the united states and the removal decision is not subject to any further hearings reviews or appeals48 most aliens subject to this process face continuous detention aliens subject to expedited removal must be detained until they are removed and may only be released due to medical emergency or if necessary for law enforcement purposes if the arriving alien expresses fear of persecution or an intent to apply for asylum the alien is placed in deten tion until credible fear interview can be held if the alien is found to have credib fear he may be pa roled into the united states if the credible fear is unsubstantiated the alien is detained until the alien is removed from the united states49 asylum seekers as discussed earlier the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility

recognizance into the united states and given work authorization practice which enabled inadmissable aliens falsely claiming persecution to enter into the country most of the fraudulent claims were made by people attempting to come here for economic or family reasons illegally rather than through legal immigration channels50 false asylum claims utilize limited resources causing those with legitimate claims to have to wait longer to have their cases processed thus ma ny argued that the only way to deter fraudulent asylum claims was to detain asyl um seekers rather than releasing them on
