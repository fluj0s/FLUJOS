shsbc 55 reality in auditing lecture given on 7 september 1961 ah well first time i ever missed thursday bulletin i think i didnt write bulletin today i was up all last night till about six am looking at pictures that had just come back from production on tahiti looking at rushes and had to write whole picture last night and this morning and i more or less did so maybe that takes my mind well enough off things and changes the scenery enough that now i can get to work again you know every once in while i get stuck on your mind you know lets see what problem could ron have about my case why dont you run that my attention will free up okay what is this the 6th audience 7th seventh seventh of september ad 11 well it sort of seems like old times telling you how to get pcs into an engram it just seems like old times were back at the old stand i mean theres the brass rail there and theres the dusty bottles back of the bar and there we stand amongst the spittoons discussing this ancient problem well it works like this engrams never ran with the pc quote out of valence unquote you could run pc who was out of valence for just ages and ages and ages and all long engram running stems from the pc being out of valence now theres two things to keep in mind about this and one when pc is in own valence this is misnomer we merely want him in the body he was in when the incident occurred but this doesnt put the pc in his own valence you see hes joe jinks hes being joe jinks in that particular life the primary swine merchant of lower chicago see and there he sits at least for gods sakes if hes joe jinks have him the body of joe jinks you got the idea thats what we meant by in valence simply in the valence he was in when the engram occurred understandable now when we say out of valence we mean simply and entirely the pc was not in the body he was occupying during the incident but as joe jinks the swine merchant from lower chicago he has trouble this lifetime he keeps going oink ung oink and so forth he only killed seven or eight billion swine in that lifetime you see and he says he couldnt possibly have done it because he did it all from mahogany desk you see so he didnt kill any swine so it doesnt have anything to do with him you get the detachments about that so anyway there he is with picture see youve got your pc with picture so he picks up this reprehensible life not only reprehensible since he came from lower chicago but reprehensible on the basis of being swine merchant you see and he wants nothing to do with any part of this so we pick up pictures of joe jinks body sitting at desk and he is always over there and we try to run the life of joe jinks and if the auditors not aware of these things and he hasnt got good subjective reality on what can happen in the bank he does all kinds of weird oddball things like said well go through the incident again so the fellow looks at the picture again its way over there its very thin theres not much to it you know doesnt bother him so he goes through the incident again and thats hunhum well not only does it have anything nothing to do with the pc but that is the basic postulate in it it has nothing to do with him that is his solution to the problem and thats what we mean by out of valence hes always seeing himself from the area of the reception couch or hes seeing himself from the chandelier or hes seeing himself from someplace else and the pictures very thin and the body that he was in that lifetime is over there you see there is virtue in being in valence but the pc has to be in valence in order to run picture and i repeat this does not mean that he is being himself pc in valence and pc being himself are two entirely foreign different statements that have nothing to do with each other because as long as he is occupying body and thinks of the body as himself he is of course not being himself but is being body and that body of course is valence do i make my point all right so youre running him out of valence that is it has gone to this reductio ad absurdum and complete abstranormity extremity that not only is he not being himself but he is also out of valence now how does this express itself when he sees picture well its sort of thin and there isnt much to it you know and its little thing and its over there and its pretty black you see and nothing to do with him and it doesnt have any somatics in it this stuff ron talks about about somatics hahahahaha i never had any somatics and so forth actually my lumbosis is physical illness this thing that is gouging in the back you see has nothing to do with engrams you see because im not in any engrams you see theres that thing way over there it has nothing to do with you see this is quite remarkable now if the auditor is not aware of the phenomena of this character he can make some of the most classic errors ever made that is he runs pc this way and he runs the pc that way and he goes through this and asks the pc do you have picture and the pc says yes i have picture and the auditor never says well what do you think picture is well where are you viewing this picture from what mass of meat are you occupying during the script of this picture see thats interesting isnt it you never ask this so of course obviously the pc is running off his pictures and obviously the pc is handling his bank and obviously its all going all off all right right according to textbook and we say well do you have any pictures yes i have picture well whats happening in the picture there well theres fellow standing there with headsmans ax and hes about ready to chop off the my head and so forth all right does the ax fall oh yes yes the ax fell its all right everythings fine and the auditor says boy are we really making knots and he just never finds out that the fellow with the headsmans ax well hes sort of thin you see hes actually kind of an idea of fellow with headmans ax and is way over there where its good and safe way way over there fascinating of course nothing happens with the picture why because you were not running the picture the pc saw you are merely running some cooked up safe version you see and the safe version of course it isnt that the text is different the textll be the same but the safe version is we never view it from the same viewpoint that it was viewed from and if we dont do that the thing never asises so pcs who are run in that condition matter whether its some old process or routine 3 apparently never get anyplace dont pay any attention to picture the pc is not in his own valence its not picture wont do him any good you could run them by the hundreds of billions it wont do him any good youre not running engrams it has nothing to do with it he wont even be able to get off grief charge now the funny part of it is that all this phenomena im telling you about is very old and very well known way back but it has never been punched up never been punched up because we havent connected the pictures and anatomy of dianetics with the conceptual processes of scientology now the conceptual processes of scientology have this magnificent virtue they will move guy straight back into the picture he is in that is charging up the chain he is stuck in that make him out of valence from that point there on and matter what pc youre running matter how many pictures he sees and so forth eventually he will wind up in his own valence and now if the auditor doesnt know his business he wont make him handle it now weve run and run and run and all of sudden the person is in picture and he is in his quote own valence dont you see meaning some body that hes in with eighteen valences stuck inside of it dont you see but as far as the picture is concerned hes at the point of view from which he viewed the picture while it happened see thats important and he runs back to this and he goes zoooooomp and out of there hahahahaha well i got out of that well of course he did exactly what he did before the way to get out of that was never again to be in that body that was the solution to the case as far as he was concerned and so we dont then try to persuade him in some particular fashion by directing his attention mainly and only to stick with it until the process youre running knocks it out because they dont sort out endlessly they dont do it that is all there is to it now there are several approaches to this if you understand it actually you can build up little cardboard models and demonstrate this to students if you wanted to you could show oh i dont know get some of these kid cutouts of some kind or another and you say well in own valence is the thing viewed from inside this body and the pc was occupying this body and therefore if you get the idea there you look and you will see that everything he sees is from the viewpoint of this body here now of course if you are trying to run this engram with the pcs viewpoint up here while he was actually viewing it from down here of course you are not running anything that ever happened see youre running an entirely dislocated thing well all right thats fine you could make very graphic representation of this it becomes very simple and make sure that you say well the pc is not himself if he is in any valence so dont confuse being himself with being in valence or having his own valence you see anybody whos sitting there looking at the scenery from inside of body has valence thats for sure but the pictures he is making from where he is looking at them of course is the track that is the track and trying to run bunch of branch railroads you see where hes never looking at things in pictures from where he looked at them in the actual incident itself of course this is just running branch railroads this is running the shunt line from south birmingham to north colchester you see which had nothing to do with the railway and you wont get anything even vaguely resembling an erasure and so these things last forever this is the secret of hanging engram of course it isnt hanging engram the auditor never asked anybody about it it isnt an engram its picture of an engram and youre running secondary situation misuse of the word secondary but youre using removed situation youre trying to erase picture that never occurred of course the incident that the picture is of occurred but the only safe thing to do about this is to get off someplace when he sees it in the bank you see and be way over here someplace and look at it very safely its not going to erase well how many ways would there be to remedy this situation well actually practically countless ill tell you one of the oldest methods of re of handling this situation and then you can see little bit more about the mechanics of it maybe i ought to tell you the simplest method first thatd be best ill tell you the simplest method you say have you ever seen picture from inside the body that you were in at the time the thing was occurring you know explaining own valence to the fellow have you ever seen picture of this character have you ever had one during processing and very often some pc who has been long time in processing will say aye aye i have i have yes well then which ones are they well there was one there when i was in this automobile and there was this road and out in front of and the other car hit us and i ran into that one what did you do at the time well i ran into that one and that was hasnt very much to do with the case you know hahahaha hasnt had anything to do with it since great and now what that was is restimulated engram and of course the restimulation died out in few days but he still remembers this all right and you say well were there any others well i had an i had thing that really upset i was very shaky on the subject of past lives till one day i was sitting on this horse you know and this chariot ran on from the right came in from the right and knocked off the horse and that was quite real and you say well what was the picture exactly were you seeing the picture from where you were sitting on the horse oh yes yes that was what was upsetting about the whole thing haha and you say well all right thats good thats good now what did you do during processing about that well i answered the auditing question that was it ahha weve got two of them in the pc right now weve got two of them that we can lambaste and finish up all right lets take the earliest one that is always the best thing to do unless its too early you know like the rock or something take the early one and which is the guy sitting on horse and you say all right now do you remember the auditing session in which this occurred well yeah vaguely dimly well i dont want the exact date but you do remember that all right and do you remember anything about the auditing question that you answered for that good yeah well soandso and soandso all right well what is unknown about that incident about the horse and so forth i well just what you asked i really dont know what auditing session it was all right good and what else is unknown about that incident with the horse and well the auditing command i actually havent really remembered the auditing command all right and what else is unknown about that incident with the horse well its uh zzzzzzzzzz you know if you keep this up im going to have horse over here well dont worry about that you know dont worry about it everything will be all right now what else is unknown about this crash see aaaaaaaaaaaa man hell be out of present time and dont you do bad job of auditing right at that point see just run the incident the command i was giving you just flat what else dont you know about that incident with the horse see i dont know this and i dont know that and i dont know something else and i dont know something else and i dont know something else and i dont know something else and in very few minutes thatll be flat but also he will find out something that hed skipped out on it that it did exist that it was there and not only that but has been with him ever since and has always been with him and hes never been anyplace but sitting on this horse this will dawn on him eventually if you run it good and flat with just unknown you can also run what shouldnt be known about it and what should be forgotten about it or any other variation of the notknow see and youll have yourself quite an incident there and itll build up 3d and scare him half to death and remember boy will he be out of present time thats the time to do real smooth auditing and yourself have pretty good reality on the fellow actually in thenness which isnt nowness and it will keep you from collapsing his thenness onto nowness by adjusting the cans of the emeter because they might be getting too warm its these kinds of things that collapse thenness and nowness and keep the guy from running an engram you got the idea all right now we look at this there is fundamental method i dont at this time know of any better method than this and ill give you an old method its simple method of doing it just find out if he ever has been and put him back into it well if hes never been in one of these things and he cant recall any and its all just garbage and black and invisible ink well theres something else you can do about it theres an old process that does this rather arduously but it eventually accomplishes this exact thing which is recall an arc break now thats an awfully stylized auditing command almost totally limited to processing scientologists but recall an arc break would be pretty well guaranteed to unstack track to point where he would find himself in the incident that was upsetting to him its an interesting one isnt it dont interfere with whether hes calling these things from motivators hes calling motivator arc breaks motivator arc breaks well hell get it back to motivator incident dont try to put him in the overt side of the sequence dont do anything about it at all just run recall an arc break and pay attention to where hes landing on the track and he will eventually land at the base of some chain where he is in his own valence and something is happening that is pretty good i suppose you could vary the auditing command so that itd make it comprehensible to nonscientologist but ive never put in any time on that and im giving lecture now to scientologists so lets skip it that one will do it all right theres another one that will do it had fellow last night and i noticed that he kept asking about his eyes i didnt tell him it was security check question that cures up eyes and eye difficulties faster than anything is what the exact auditing command ive given you in lectures before its something on the order of what shouldnt be seen what have you done that shouldnt be seen and that will just ruin more glass prescriptions than anything you ever had in the way of eyesight just keep security checking on that basis and clear the meter left and right and in the middle and so forth what have you done that shouldnt be seen and of course hes preventing seeingness like mad of something hes done thats all people hearing this lecture probably have just now thought of what one of them is and others have heard ticking automaticity because itll very often send off an automaticity well its restraint of inspection but i didnt tell this fellow about it and instead of that he was complaining about mass that seemed to be resident behind his eyes someplace so i gave him the easy one here is another method of doing this exact thing and i said get the idea of some action going on way out there in front of you two or three hundred yards away he did i said what was it uhh he said well oddly enough he said i get my mother and driving in car and i said all right good now conceive of an action two or three hundred yards behind you and he got dog or something i said whats happened to this mass that youre complaining about back of your eyes well its shifted its moved i wasnt processing him and told him so but obviously the man was stuck in the picture wasnt he but as near as he could look toward the picture he was stuck in was way out and that is quite common action that is that far away is safer than action that is up close so people will see it now you could just follow this thing through which i didnt i just moved the somatic around and changed it all around and did something with it and explained to him that these things are pictures he was quite amazed he had been processed but he was quite amazed to connect up these odd sensations he had with this you know with the idea of pictures see he couldnt conceive of himself being stuck in picture he obviously was stuck in picture or he wouldnt have had mass that was it but he could look at that distance and you could follow this through and take process of this type which is inspection at distance and you would eventually wind up with the guy in the picture he was stuck in it would peel it right on down to where he was interesting idea huh if you yourself have somatic and youre prone to selfauditing why you can always inspect something way out only make it two or three hundred yards of course your attention at once will start collapsing on two or three hundred micromillimeters but uh i mean in close you know you look out there ohuhthuthudu and the next thing you know youre floundering around you dont know whats happening to you you know get your attention out there again you see get your attention way back there and way over to the right and way over to the left and way below you and way above you and so forth and youre peeling off some environment of some kind or another that has been stuck environment you can also get in lots of somatics and lots of trouble and have to have auditing and be able to gasp be able to gasp over the telephone to friend of yours for gods sakes come over and audit before i die in the middle of the living room i this randomity can set up with something like that but youd survive it anyhow there is method of peeling one down now because you are extremely devoted to repetitive processes and we have to have repetitive processes and they are the thing to do but when you get into handling case you have to interrogate and do other things and repetitive process is not enough it has to be punched up but ill give you repetitive process im not running them down pc has disabled leg we discover this by interrogation of the pc and observation of the pc and we are limited in this solely and entirely by this one point it is obvious to us that he has bad leg but the pc never mentions it he keeps talking about his burning ear well wed better not go into bad legs because its not real to him but the pc tells us he has bad leg we observe that he has bad leg and so forth or if he tells us he has burning ear and we happen to observe this we could run exactly the same regimen on either of these now what were asking for is if he has any odd pressures now these could be his face his chest his stomach his legs his back his gluteus maximus his mea culpa anything you see it doesnt matter what anatomically this will be what is called psychosomatic and will be his chronic psychosomatic illness and will also be probably his hidden standard and will also be numerous other things that we wrestle with see all right heres the way to handle it this is brutal by the way it is quite brutal and the auditor has to be very good and stay in there pitching with the pc all right now its who would have an unknown motion around his leg we use this new thing this valence thing and it is the valence you see and then we could compound the felony by asking what what would have an unknown motion around its leg who would have an unknown motion around his leg her leg i wish english was little more adaptable on genders english is gender happy you can usually become colloquial and say their leg and this covers the whole thing english actually the people do try to put dual gender pronoun in there you know they say their making it plural all right this sort of question will knock out infinite numbers of chronic somatics providing you flatten it and its flattened on the tone arm just as any other process now youre getting into something youre more familiar with this is an easy one to do but it is quite brutal it is quite brutal pc complains all the time that hes got this sensation in his nose well this would be what you did with his nose see got sensation on his nose all right pc complains all the time that there is absolutely sensation around the right arm same process sensation absence of sensation and presence of sensation both respond to the same process now theres way to amplify this idea and be little more positive about it and that is to shake down on the emeter what is the most real to the pc motion or confusion or some other thing some other word meaning action could be the word action dont you see it could be lots of things anything denoting commotion action confusion and so forth find the best word the secondary scale of the prehav scale at the level of motion gives you most of these synonyms and you would assess out the command and then you would use the same command form you would say who and what unknown ______ whatever word you found you see commotion confusion action i suppose youd find some pcs that have attitude im sure thatd be as close as they could get to anything like motion would be attitude because the idea they pull back into ideas theyre down below effort and into think you see dont omit attitude i should say in passing by the way theres way of running the whole prehav scale without assessment if you were ever caught out in the middle of the bush the veldt or the deserts of new york without prehav scale there is way of running it rather crude use action or attitude just use the words action or attitude for any level got the idea king all right youre running the pcs terminal is king and you say action what action or attitude would you have toward king or something of that sort what action or attitude would the king have toward you what action or attitude would king have towards another what action or attitude another toward king what action or attitude would king have toward himself you get how you could do that actually it runs the whole prehav scale in very haphazard impositive but workable fashion its probably only five times as long as proper assessment but if you ran total out of assessment material and you couldnt get an assessment and the pc wasnt going clear you see and the needle was stuck and the tone arm hadnt moved for ages and so forth and you assumed there must be some level that you knew not what of or wasnt on the scale or something of the sort after you made sure the rudiments are in and after youve made sure youd handled any hidden standard or anything like this psychosomatic present time problem of long duration all this sort of thing after you had all this straight you still couldnt get anything on the thing you could still use action or attitude what it is is just doingness pure and simple its the idea or doingness and the whole of the prehav scale is devoted to idea or doingness so action or attitude phrases it up so that it can be run as sort of blanket command and its an interesting thing for you to know just in passing its datum you should have remember it isnt good it merely works to great high level of workability but it goes on through extends the auditing time rather tremendously but it will work okay when i find these little bits and pieces of this character i like to pass them along to you whether they have vast usages or not because you may sometime or another be as i say in the deserts of north hollywood i dont think anybody in hollywood has been able to read for the last hundred years they deal exclusively in pictures all right now lets get little bit further on this line this would be then method of handling the hidden standard the chronic somatic the complaint of the pc the difficulty which he is always bringing up and so forth itd be something on the order of unknown assessed word which adds up to motion what youre heading for in that ill point up to you again youre heading for motion you want unknown motion that motion itself may not express itself well to the pc see itd be best work much better with unknown confusion for instance i was dealing with somebody who had concept of motion that can be run into wouldnt bang on an emeter nothing like that motion what the hell is motion well motion is vague idea that people have that something is changing position in space well yeah but what is motion what is motion have you ever seen motion oh im sure that ive seen motion how silly of course i must have seen motion at some time or another naturally everybody has seen motion at some time or another well name motion you have seen sigh name motion i have seen well i dont know but everybody has seen motion didnt have any concept of the idea of motion at all had concept of motion i dont know what all these this person did lot of driving thats why i resigned finally from the road safety committee people never would undertake any program that had anything whatsoever to do with road safety im saving the fact that i resigned in order to send in scathing statement at some time or another which lays down program which actually just puts more punch to the program ive had in mind for some time why i resigned as road safety organizer see i mean this is the keynote of the thing then everybody pays attention to it because this is obviously complaint you see and is bunch of entheta and somebodys mad you know and thats fine all right now we look over all of the these aspects of bank and pictures and so forth and we find out at once why the pc will not view his bank he will not view his bank because he has tremendous intolerance of two things he has tremendous intolerance of motion and he has tremendous intolerance of unknowns now his intolerance of motion is best expressed to you on the basis of motion can become intolerant to somebody he can become intolerant about motion to somebody who is extremely fixated on the subject of pain if this person is fixated on pain then he believes that all motion adds up to pain he has other concept of motion than it is pain well motion of course makes pain possible and pain cannot occur without motion and you see somebody that youre kicking in the stomach stiffen up and try not to have any motion next time youre kicking somebody in the stomach out of session of course notice the fact that they are trying to stop motion well thats very interesting the reason theyre trying to stop motion is incomprehensible unless they love pain because thats the only way pain occurs if you had thetan who wasnt trying to stop motion around the body the body would experience pain its just as simple as that if he werent trying to stop motion he wouldnt suffer from motion of course hes picked out motion as randomity and there he is and the next time you have an ache or pain why notice the fact that it seems to occur from two opposing motions just get analytical about it and observe it its two opposing motions and they sort of grind against each other or something of the sort and the sensation on that tiny tiny tiny motion between those two opposing areas gives the sensation called pain that is what pain is pain isnt anything more than that and there hasnt been enough of it so thetans dont like it well anyhow its true of all things there havent been enough of why people dont like them okay now in handling pc who has bank visible these factors then must be present that he has an intolerance of pain therefore an intolerance of motion therefore an intolerance of unknowns not necessarily therefore these two things are different spheres but doesnt like motion doesnt like unknowns he has fantastic importance attached to motion and he has fantastic importance attached to unknowns hell give you fabulously exaggerated idea of the importance of an unknown and youll find him nattering something like this well if he doesnt know about what all the fish are doing off of dover just now why anything could happen and you say well wait minute now hes not in dover hes not in the fishing business he has nothing to do with dover he had never been clear or near dover and dover has nothing to doo with him and so forth here hes talking about the fish off dover and hes worried about what fish are doing off dover and he wants to find out about what the fish are doing off dover because it is very important and you cant quite make out how its important well dont assign the fact that the fellows crazy just assign the fact the fellow has one christawful intolerance on the subject of the motion of fish and the unknowns of fish and thats it it just sums up to that he has intolerance of these things these things he cant confront and he happens to have picked out for his randomity the vast importance connected with one body of motion ie the fish off dover you finally plumb into it and he learned when he was little boy that they had soles off dover or something hes never quite sure about this and in church why they were telling him all the time he had to save his soul and its as close as he could get to the soul are those fish off dover you know it would be some squirrel cage i mean it would be as idiotic you see as this but itll be some superimportance about this particular unknown we see this all the time and we pass it by we just sort of notis it we see people terribly terribly worried about the terrible terrible conditions of the natives in upper slobovia and dont be too surprised sometime to go to upper slobovia and find the happiest natives you ever ran into you got the idea and similarly everybodys very complacent about the natives of southern east germany nobodys worrying about the natives of southern east germany and theyre in terrible condition you see so its just fad its what its what natives we are worried aboutt at the time and what natives we are not worried about at the time are regulated totally with how much unknown seems to be connected to these things and how important that unknownness seems to be to the person and the most unknownness there can be is the unknownness about motion that is the most important unknownness youll find the fellow is suffering somatic all out of proportion merely because he didnt even know he was going to be hit and he was hit and you find out that hell stick with this somatic and the somatic is there yet hes been run over by truck and that somatic isnt sticking but somebody has walked up to him suddenly and said hello joe and slapped him in the face hard enough to crack his jaw see and this somatic is stuck but it wasnt actually very brutal thing and five minutes later why he didnt even realize hed been hit you know i mean he didnt have any physical damage from the thing and you find in vain trying to evaluate the importance of an engram to the preclear is the most fruitless task you can possibly engage upon because hes been run over by trucks since time immemorial and he just never never never never never seems to attach any importance whatsoever to this fact oh well yes he was run over with truck when he was small boy and they sent him to the hospital and he had cast on his arm for couple of weeks couple of months couple of years depending on what doctor he hit and yeah he had another accident he was run over by truck when he was seven and he was run over by truck when he was ten and he was run over by truck when he was eleven well hes become accustomed to it and you wont find these somatics very rough but switching he got when he was five he has exaggerated into the most familial battle royal that anybody had ever heard of my god to hear him tell about this thing why there was blood plastered all over the ceiling and the only reason the neighbors came in is because of the bits of flesh that kept flying out of the woodshed you see this kind of thing to hear him tell it you know this was the wildest activity you know they imported an executioner from italy just specially you see to whip him and you boil this thing down and you in vain try to find any real brutality about it all you do is find switching that you yourself would not have considered very important but its very important to him in the first place somebody blew up at him that he didnt ever expect to blow up you see so thats unpredicted which gives you the unknown and somebody switched him for something he didnt do which of course is not known too unjust injustice is just an unknown penalty of some kind its penalty for an unknown crime or notexistent crime you see so there was injustice connected with it there was unprediction connected with it and in addition to that there was real familiarity connected with it and amongst these various points we get the unknownness and the motion all adding up to tremendous importance hes still trying to figure it out you can say the importances of anything is as great as the individual is still trying to figure it out and youll find those engrams which are most seriously stuck on the track are those engrams which are composed of incomprehensibles the fellow went kept calling on this girl and he kept calling on the girl and hed wave to her from the window and so forth it was rather strict planet on the subject of sex they didnt have much see he keeps calling on this girl and it seems all right with him you see and he thinks hes getting someplace with he didnt intend anything very gruesome you know and he was sort of paying court in the way they were doing on this particular planet or country and it all seemed very routine and regular and one day he drives up and runs into an ambuscade real one real ambuscade you see complete with muskets you know and hes slaughtered well he didnt have any intentions that match this slaughter and he doesnt know what would cause that family you see to be this upset about somebody paying court to their daughter and he adds up tries to keep adding this up he keeps adding this up you see keeps adding it up keeps adding it up and it doesnt ever add up of course and hell get some kind of fixed idea about it and hell say well thats it but the number of times he tells you that that is the fixed idea about it and that is it you can start being suspicious about that time because of course if he has to have fixed idea about something the unknownness of it must have been terrific he says well in actuality her father and she practiced incest and they were afraid to find it out and nobody could quite discover what this was all about and if i had paid court to her much longer why something like that would have happened and that is the way it was and that was the thing i think i guess its actually fact everybody in the neighborhood knew that she and her father practiced incest and therefore her father set her brothers on you see to shoot down in order to keep from finding this out and that is what it is thats true its true everybody in the neighborhood knew it as matter of fact it was in all the papers so forth i think i guess or something else but that was the way it was i guess and you audit little while all of sudden he comes out of fog and he says you know shed actually been pledged to marry the local duke and this was all being kept secret you see because the dukes politics were completely contrary to most of the peoples politics and there might have been quite revolution you see and they had figured out as an agent that was merely trying to reach the duke i think i guess all the time hes telling you this why these musket balls are still lodged in various portions of his anatomy and he has got somatics from all of them you see and every time he gets on this subject he gets hectic because these musket balls were hot at the time and hes never quite dared to feel that littleness of the motion of the heat you see and these musket balls start warming up every time he gets onto the mystery of this so therefore he solves the mystery but he never solves the mystery right so hes just been floundering around in this engram i can see him now hes on some other planet and he is member of the space guard of this particular planet in its polar caps and he has an igloo in which hes supposed to stand by you see as warning and hes sitting in this igloo and life has been going on fairly well while they were building the igloo in the station hes sitting there and about two months later all of sudden he starts to wonder well now i guess it was that she was going to marry the it was fathers incest with uh the uh uh uh situation i wonder what that was now llets see it must have been you get the idea and eventually he gets an illness of some kind or another and has to be carted out of the polar caps and hospitalized for long time and the medicos issue very learned papers on the subject of polar caps cause illnesses which are hot burning spots in somebodys chest and they of course become very learned on the subject and they have very very vast conferences and so forth and they bring this up at their meetings and they read papers on it and youve got this piece of pretended knowingness borne as an effort not to face the unknownness of it you see and this goes on and on and on and the primary recipient of course would be the medical profession i think theres probably fact or two in their books but most of them are based on some wild effort to solve what psychosomatic with physiological explanation and what could there be wilder lie than that the fellow has got hot musket balls in his chest so they say well theres new illness called polarolosis and here it is its very amusing to read medical records when you know great deal about the mind and so on they present you with everything but the facts they sure give you lot of learned names to back it up too and if you want to know real piece of pretended knowingness look at the heading on it and see how many authorities had to be called on to vouch for it and then if you get four or five authorities or hospitals which have vouched for all of this you can just be sure at that time it should have been garbage cans at the beginning and somebody should have audited the patient you see how this thing goes it is the idea of the importance of the unknownness and the idea of the importance of the motion and these things drop back to the degree of threat to survival and then this therefore goes back to the idea that one must survive and you start taking this apart from all lines and you get down to the basic idiocy thetan who cant help but survive he just couldnt help himself he may be surviving kind of deadly and in different forms and out of valence and so forth but the one thing he cannot do anything else but is survive he always will survive thats for sure the one thing he can absolutely count on is the one thing he is always trying to solve which is of course itself is basic idiocy and of course everything else which follows from that basic idiocy of course is idiotic but if you want to take this apart you take it apart along the road of unknown and motion and these two items give you very broad fourlane highway right down through the middle and of course you combine any phraseology that has to do with unknown which is notknow forget forgotten any of the odd numbered postulates and you combine this with any word which sums up to motion or transplantation in space and you will get process which is wild one now if you put that against valences you will get pc in pictures and it gives you your basic magic formula for getting the pc into the track and onto the track and in the bank and moving on the track and out of detached views and all these other ills that we are have been discussing make any sense to you when you see one of these things wheeling off its lot of fun this gag of telling somebody to look out there two or three hundred yards in front of him and two or three hundred yards behind him is not very new but let warn you against having him look ten or twelve feet in front of him or ten or twelve feet behind him thats too close hell jump like hes shot usually in space opera when they are conditioning thetans or when thetans are conditioning others they sometimes theres tumbler incident that nearly everybody has some cognizance of or is stuck in or something like this its quite common and they throw somebody in body down shaft and of course hes spinning so the bottom of the shaft is lighted and the top of the shaft is lighted and he is falling in the shaft and therefore the image of the top of the shaft and the image of the bottom of the shaft leave an awful lot of bright spots because hes trying to stop himself from falling all the way down so he gets vast number of bright spots stuck around him at varying distances and he doesnt quite know what these are afterwards and that is the way the picture looks well these are not very far from him and some of them are quite close to him naturally because he fell only short distance to get the closest ones and he fell further to get the further ones and i havent made any estimate of how far one of these bright spots would be but probably something on the order of about well i dont know hundred feet something like that and you tell anybody to look in closer than hundred feet just on casual inspection hes liable to run into these things and they will really hit him very casually you could be riding on bus and tell some dear old lady if you felt particularly diabolical you say close your eyes do you have any bright spots around you ten or twelve feet away from you and shell get it right there splank shell see one of these things shell get the sensation of motion you see and shell stop herself suddenly and itll be jolt thats an interesting phenomena thats an old old space opera installation of an engram and practically everybodys got that one theres whole long oh theres long long lists of these any possible way you could get somebody what dislocated now i told you the other day about dreams dreams an effort to locate oneself then what is delusory bank lets carry it just one step further instead of dreaming it asleep how about having it in the bank awake effort to locate oneself out of this you get the workability and magic of 8c tr 10 other things they have some workability because of course theyre locating somebody and they feel better but how about locating somebody in the bank well nearly every picture hes got is an effort to locate himself in an area where he felt dislocated so unknown locations could play considerable role and unknown times could play considerable role in other processes i dont particularly mean to cover those now but i should mention to you that you can have unknown locations and you can do weird things with pictures have the pc spot unknown locations of course he shakes up every delusory effort to locate himself by pictures and youll get pictures flying by in all directions are there any locations you dont know about you see that type of interrogation bingbang and all of sudden you get bank shift its quite amusing then the fact that an individual is sitting in bank which locates him so hell be in the wrong place now if you went further than that reductio ad absurdum you could get down to this interesting supposition that universe is an effort to locate oneself and youd possibly get the basic consent of why thetan is willing to be in universe its an effort to locate himself therefore because thetan doesnt have to be located and its totally idiotic i point out in the 1954 hpa tapes when this is mentioned its totally idiotic to have to be located theres good reason why anybody would have to be located it must be dirty trick then to locate thetan and it is it is give him the idea that he has to have location but that is such the fundamental idea and goes back of every universe and is back of every bank and is so wrapped around and hedged around with reasons explanations valences and all the rest of it that we must assume that it is practically unreachable as concept in processing and there are many such very senior concepts in processing that if you could just think them and realize them flash you see not on any gradient but just suddenly say well theres reason i should have to be located you know and bang youre clear just like that you see these are the thoughts that you think you should be able to think but of course you set all these other things in motion every time you think those but then you stop them if you have an allergy to motion see so you think well i ought to be why i could be cleared very easy all i have to do is get the idea that i dont have to be located diiiing you see and things go bzzuuup and bzzuuup and you dont like all that motion so you say stop and also you stop it because you dont know what was moving so theres again the unknown and the motion which blocks the road out to the release of concept now you go little bit further than this and it must have been some kind of overt to locate thetans and all of you must have been busily locating thetans madly viciously and so on in order to pile up enough overts that the thing would stick with you to this degree you see well thats all very fine but this must be prior to the overt act motivator phenomena so you think the thought and you run into the overt act motivator phenomena just up the track ways you see bang and you try to think the thought again or the concept of well i dont have to be located and bang you get into the overt motivator phenomena and that is another blocker which is cousin to what i have been talking about now you could run somebody think of locating somebody thank you think of locating somebody thank you think of locating somebody thank you for little while why the thetan says gee you know that was good of you know this old lady she couldnt cross the street she didnt know where she was and i told her where she was and ah thats nice of you know and he gets all these nice of hims you know and these nice of hims and these nice of hims and then he finally gets nailing this fellow down you see to this plank you see and whats this well i i dont know why this fellows being nailed down to the plank i didnt have anything to do with it actually my men wanted to do it and i didnt have any choice i didnt have anything to do with it its torturing him for some reason or another and all of sudden it dawns on him im locating him but they they wanted to locate him i i didnt have anything to do with it myself you see im just an innocent bystander i was an officer on this ship and the crew had mutinied i think i guess and that was why we were nailing this fellow down i suppose so you get this and then you get another one well as matter of fact that that thats locating somebody yeah i can get the idea of locating somebody pretty vicious you know get the idea of locating somebody thats pretty mean you know get the idea of gee thats mean you know then the fellow goes into total dispersal on the whole thing and he himself cant feel hes located anyplace and he becomes very difficult to audit in other words its not very good track for auditing but its just potential road its one of these potential roads that is very nice that you could drive from straight from here to italy with difficulty whatsoever on straight line you wouldnt have to mind falling off many precipices or running headon into any mountains you see or drowning in any rivers if you didnt mind that why the best way to get to italy you see is just to drive straight to italy you take somebody who has tremendous allergy to unknowns and tremendous allergy to motions combine these things and then ask him to run one of these senior concepts you see and of course hell run into the other one all the time and bingbang now the reversewise works if youve got the unknownness and the motion allergy is cleaned up pretty well which of course cleans up valences and gets him in his pictures and all that sort of thing why then of course he starts reaching back and changing his mind concerning these various things and we get back to change of mind processing and the route were looking for is the route to just change of mind the thetan can change his mind and that is it he just gets another idea about it you see he just asises the idea hes got and gets another idea about it and he feels fine about it well what boobytraps this in the first place he must have escaped from innumerable pictures and hes offtrack in numerous places and he doesnt have concept of where hes been or what hes done and the unknowness of that must be very important because actually he does have the he has set the example to himself of having escaped from these things so therefore they must have been dangerous you get how he proves it to himself he proves it to himself reversewise i ran away so it must have been rough see it proves the point see if he ran away it must have been rough not it was rough so he ran away you get the idea but it must have been rough because he ran away and hes also always proving these things to him you say my god that must be terrible engram the reason it must be terrible engram prima facie evidence it must be terrible engram is because i cant get in it see im outside the thing im not in my own valence in the engram and its way over there and it just must have been bitch kitty this must have been roughrough there must have been nothing there but big jagged rocks being pounded on somebody every three seconds you see shame blame regret and degradation are being poured into that area with coal shovels thats obvious proof of the thing is im not in it now he gets in it and he finds out that nothing happened yeah there wasnt very much in it he just struck it at time of life or frame of mind when he thought unknowns and motion were terrible and so therefore he didnt want anything to do with it and he didnt want to be in it people do not escape to the degree that things were dangerous these are not proportionate statements you know the more dangerous thing is the more escape you will have from it you get that that doesnt work that way at all the most dangerous thing there is is war on this planet for sure in terms of human activities and yet you never have any difficulty getting people to sign up to fight war thats interesting isnt it and you never have any difficulty getting contractors to build things for war so what does this mean well the most dangerous activity man engages upon has the most recruits well this is kind of backwards isnt it its then its not true that man escapes to the degree that things are dangerous he escapes to the degree that he conceives they are motionfull that he doesnt like motionthathedoesntlikefull and the degree that they are unknown now actually war may be very dangerous but its fairly well known man youve got sergeants and captains and generals and general staffs and governments and presidents and kings and so forth and their whole effort is to locate you and the whole effort of the enemy is to dislocate you so youve got an effort to dislocate being resisted and an effort to locate being obeyed and of course danger hasnt anything to do with it at all its just the degree of location involved with it and of course you get all kinds of recruits for war you could probably dream up and synthesize another activity that would be just as attractive as war if you put your mind to it it would have to be something where you were supremely well located marvelously located youd just have to fix it up so the guy was could locate and was being located known whereabouts you see known whereabouts known whereabouts known whereabouts you just have to play that one off the middle with efforts to make the whereabouts different in other words to fix and unfix the whole idea of power this is an old one from way back phoenix the whole idea of power stems from the ability to hold position all power derives from the ability to hold location when i say position of course that gives you double entendre its location the base is what derives power to the electric motor it is the base it is not the spinning amature armature its what keeps positive and negative separated that is deriving the power now you can conceive an electric motor with positive and negative terminal in the thing that would have enough rotation through magnetic fields applied to it that it would collapse its base now youve got two little things and theyre sort of pinned up there on little weak pot metal there are two heavy magnets pinned on weak pot metal pins you see and you get positive and negative going between these two magnets at hell of rate of speed you know you turn your armature through the field and those two poles will collapse on each other you take powerful magnet and the reason things come to powerful magnet is to the degree that it can stay still otherwise your magnet will race forward toward the thing these are various laws in the fields of mechanics which actually derive from the ideas of thetans all mechanics derive from the ideas of thetans all matter derives from concept of thetans and the behavior of matter is based entirely upon how thetan thinks it ought to behave chemistry is very interesting there isnt single product that doesnt have set of postulates connected with it there isnt single chemical compound or single chemical element that you cannot take apart into the number of postulates that the thetan put in it and you can find out what the postulates of it were its quite interesting an interesting study more of that thats rather dry the idea of holding base or holding situation all right theres these body of troops is holding hill and thhey cannot be dislodged well the degree they cannot be dislodged does not have anything whatsoever to do with the number of troops on the hill it may be influenced by that come to think about it but that isnt actually it its whether or not they believe they can be dislodged that is the first requisite and whether or not they have enough weapons of one character or another to resist dislodgement it only takes one man to fire an electronic cannon now you need lots of men to the degree that the hilltop can be approached so the power generated by body of troops on hilltop is totally dependent on their ability to make the enemy hold his position and their own ability to hold their position and that body of troops actually has to take responsibility for holding the enemy where they are and bodies of troops almost never take this responsibility very wholeheartedly they think they will shoot at the enemy if he approaches it never occurs to them too much although this is part of tactics strategy to pin the enemy down where he is now of course they have won the war to the degree that the enemy cannot advance and that they can continue to hold their position wars are won on the basis of held positions and dislodgments from positions now countries look very weak after wars because one of the countries has dislodged the other terminal and theres power resulting the whole subject of electricity flying saucers the electric motor that turns over your fridge whatever is running your automobile is merely based on the ability to hold location and to resist an encroachment upon the location you look at an internalcombustion engine in this wise and you learn great deal of course the pistons are trying to blow the crankcase down you see and the crankcase however is held up with bolts and the crankshaft goes zzzzzz you see it doesnt go psst down so this must be the thrust bearings and the main bearings and so forth of the crankshaft that are holding position and the piston isnt holding the position but its being dislodged but there must be something that keeps it from coming up all the way you see and something that keeps it from going down all the way youd normally conceive that the power of an engine is based upon the thrust of the piston and this is the way they normally calculate the power of engines and that isnt why the engine is powerful at all its the degree the base can be held and the amount of effort that can be applied to dislodge something from base and then the amount of effort that this base has to resist being dislodged and its an interplay of held positions and if mechanical engineer were to look over motors from this exact way he would arrive with very advanced power plants of one character or another its the ability to hold things apart and the ability to thrust them at each other while holding them apart and so on you always get generated energy by thrusting something at something that will not move if you dont believe it start an argument with somebody the power of the argument is totally proportional to the degree that they wont relent you see well youll see actual power being generated it can get pretty sparky pretty sparky all you want to do if you want to keep generating sparks why just keep pressing against the held position and of course you know how to settle any argument in the final analysis you could always run away cant dislodge the position so you could always move off and of course that theres more power being generated you see how that would be more power being generated at all theres more argument nobodys shouting nothing happening and so forth youre just gone you were one of the terminals you see and you were holding position there too so you abandon the position and you dont have all of this upset all you have after that is detached pictures now thetans friction with life and his crush against life and lifes crush against him does generate energy you know he himself has got masses of energy and he is holding position and so forth and thats where the energy basically comes from but you want to know where picture comes from the characteristics of pictures and masses and all that sort of thing well theyre to the degree that he is resisting position therefore if you want to get three dimensional picture in some pc which is 3d in solid man solid well get time when he was well ill give you an example i had good subjective reality on this company of men lined up in company front firing at company of men lined up in company front neither one of them giving way they just stood there for hours and fired at each other and boy the fronts of those uniforms were just absolutely solid all standingwave electricity of course they thought it was guns that was generating the power in the battle but it wasnt at all it was these two bodies of troops confronting each other neither one of which would give away both of which were trying to drive the other away you see and neither one of them was driving away and it was pretty combustible and of course when you run into picture like that and you start to run the picture like that the thing actually develops considerable amount of zing see therell be all kinds of electricity running around and youll see it register on your emeter the effort to hold position all right if you want to see an emeter go bingbang take somebody that is real to the pc in this lifetime and then find an argument between the two and youll get the same phenomena and youll get discharge of energy and that discharge of energy will be registered on your emeter the study of the mind goes in unfortunately without and you dont have to feel bad about this and think that you should learn more about this girls are very mostly upset by this i start talking about electric flows and so forth and im inferring ohms and ergs and all that sort of thing and girls get rather distressed they think that while i was in physics class i got on all those things but i didnt understand any part of it and i dont have much to do with mechanics and they start thinking well rather sadly well i cant really grasp this because i dont know much about electricity and so forth they back down on this particular point and they think that in order to understand scientology they have to know something about electricity physics and mechanics well ill let you in on something ill let you in on something in order to understand something about electricity and mechanics and ohms and ergs electrical engineers would have to understand scientology see it is completely reversed idea but girl in this particular lifetime is not too much or too averagely dedicated to knocking guys blocks off and knocking positions out and holding the front line trench and so forth they havent been doing it for few centuries and are out of practice and so they think that the subject of power or force is something that they shouldnt have too much acquaintance with and thats about all there is to it is theyre just out of the habit and this is why they say well i really ought to know something about this but hes now talking about something very technical that i really shouldnt know anything about and that isnt the case at all i think that girls in this particular society probably generate more power and more sparks than anything else kiplings comment upon the female of the species is more deadly than the male i would amend this to reading the female of the species generates more sparks than the male theres nothing like girl who just cant seem to get different idea in her head and insists on hanging on to that one particular timeworn idea you can explain to her inevitably and at long length how that idea is moldy and went out of style and it hasnt been worn in paris for generations and so on and you can go on and you can get quite elucidative on the subject you can flower it up and use rhetoric and threat and so forth and she finally succumbs and thats too bad and its all set now and weve now agreed you see until the following morning when she brings up this idea again you see yeah theres an awful lot of energy hanging around one of those things so dont think that girl wont hold position or try to drive somebody else from there thetan will do it male or female and banks have energy in them and are charged and person has masses in his bank and is being bothered with masses to the degree that he has experienced this interplay of energy motions and has tried to hold positions and knock people off positions and so forth and you will get resultant bank i mean thats all there is to that bank is sort of mold of what you were trying to hold position against or mold of what you were trying to dislodge from position well of course when one is dislodged from position in actuality even conceptually the person then dramatizes this to the degree of having picture from another position now do you understand where ive been going here so youll have an outofvalence view of the situation and youll see these energy masses all right but theyre parked over in some safe place and they dont have too much to do with anything and its better just to have picture of those energy masses dont you see rather than to confront the energy masses and you start to move anybody in toward this place where he was dislodged or where he failed to dislodge somebody else from position you try to move him in that with duress and command and hammer and pound and argue with him and that sort of thing well thats what the substance was of the engram so of course it doesnt work see the more hammer and pound and duress that you put in to getting him to hold this position again from which he can view the engram the more you restimulate the resistance of the engram the more you blow him out its very see its very comprehensible its just one two q and direct but if you can take him on gradient of what led up to this solid state hell find himself in it again and when he finds himself in again hell find that these are masses of confrontingness and the reality connected with it will be high and so forth and then he finds out that he did confront it and then it properly gets into the thenness where it belongs and doesnt influence the nowness in which he is living and the engram discharges you see what this is all about its actually very elementary subject and it just boils down to the fact that universes may be universes i guess but in actual fact thetans are thetans and that is far more true you see than universes are universes because universes are simply the creation of thetans and if you can subscribe to the idea that you had nothing to do with the creation of the universe but it was done by big thetan why thats all right but processing will catch that up too well now in handling pcs let warn you against handling them with idea of how bank works two auditors neither one of whom have any idea on how the bank works but both of them trying to find out how the bank works can probably audit each other rather successfully amidst the various ridges which build up because one is trying to hold the position and the other is trying to blow him out of it so they would probably get there nevertheless but good skilled auditing toward clearing would have as requisite some reality on all these points im making now the only realities you have to get on these points is just what is bank whats it look like and what is out of valenceness because anybody has out of valence spots on the track thats for sure and how does picture look and where would pc be when he is down the track you see and do pictures run consecutively from one part of the track to the other and is there thenness as well as the nowness and do energy masses exist and what are these strange masses and feelings and sensations which the pc has around his body you have reality on those various things and boy youll be able to audit you dont have to go into the esoterics of why theyre there you just have to get the subjective reality of the fact that they exist and as soon as you see that they exist quite plainly of course you are able to handle them not only yourself but you are able to handle them in somebody else now the oddity is that you can handle them in somebody else much more easily than you can handle them in yourself because you are not being affected by the various byproducts that the pc is being affected by you see it was the pc that was having the argument and you were the youre not even party to the argument so therefore you can direct attention and see the reasons that the pc cannot see the pc cannot redirect his attention because if he was totally regressed into the incident his attention would be totally fixed in the incident wouldnt it but you didnt happen to be in the incident so therefore it is very very easy for you to direct his attention in the incident because your attention with regard to that incident in which he is in is free and oddly enough the bank will always obey you much better than it will obey the pc and these are the fundamentals of why auditing works and this is how auditing works and if you dont know what youre directing his attention toward or away from and so forth you will occasionally make flubs get into all kinds of tangled skeins of auditing and have to run arc breaks 9944 percent of the auditing session will be devoted to present time problems and arc breaks see the pc actually will have as many present time problems and arc breaks as to the degree that the auditor cannot direct his attention the auditor has idea of where he is directing his attention or how hes directing the pcs attention or if the pcs attention is being directed why of course he has great deal of trouble handling the pc now you have an idea of controlling the pc is very necessary to the conduct of the session dont you well you just redefine what is controlling pc beyond keeping his body in chair and keeping him from getting up there is other control of the body that youre trying to accomplish or attempt it must be the control of the pc is simply the direction of the pcs attention by the auditor and that would be the whole statement of how do you control pc well you control pc by knowing where his attention is and doing things with his attention and of course that controls the pc and thats all there is to controlling pcs you can go endlessly into the subject and you wont thrash up any more data than that well now if you dont know where his attention is can you control the pc see it cant be done so of course then the pc is left to flounder on the track and flounder with this and flounder with that and his attention is not under any kind of control and as result what do we wind up with we run wind up with endless auditing and auditing takes as long as the auditor doesnt control the pc well when we say this then it must follow that the auditing takes as long as the auditor does not control the attention of the pc to control an automobile on the road it is rather well and you really should know where the automobile is works much better that way and in driving pc you might say its much better to know where he is and where hes going and what hes doing and repetitive command will do great deal we shouldnt undermine these things it does great deal it is directing the attention of the pc left right and center but also the attention of the pc may be doing some other things which are rather fantastic and we have to find out about this and were only trying to get the auditing command executed but in order to get it executed we have to find out where the pcs attention is and where the pcs attention is going and keep track of this otherwise he has the idea of running under driver that doesnt know where the road is much less where the automobile is both are missing and he sort of goes around and he goes through it and he doesnt quite know it almost might be enough simply to create the illusion that you know where the pc is and so forth this might be all right but there is actually substitute for subjective reality on what picture is what real picture looks like what an energy mass is what track looks like the sensation of thenness and these little odds and ends of phenomena go along with subjective reality once you improve that your auditing will go up in steep climb like one of these new aircraft theyre building over here they dont take them off on runways anymore they set them up on their tail and they light match and they go off into the sky okay all right well i wish you good luck tomorrow and this weekend and youre overdue for clearing somebody and i will have to have clear tuesday morning okay thank you
