concerns such as the spread of communism in the 1980s substantial us assi stance was provided to support central american govern ments battling leftist insurgen cies and to finance rebels seeking to overthrow revolutionary regime in nicaragua with the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 us concerns about spreading communist influence lessened as did levels of assistance to the region othe r large us assistance packages to the dr cafta countries have occurred in response to natural disasters one exception to this episodic involvement has been the preferentia l trade arrangement extended to the region since the early 1980s as part of th caribbean basin initiative cbi proximity ties the drcafta countries to th united states and so there is shared sense of political and security interests since the early 1990s all of the drcafta countries have taken steps to promote mocracy protect human rights and pursue marketled economic growth threats to security and stability remain however such as poverty and income inequality crime corruption and institu tional weakness regional leaders have asserted that drcafta is essential to strengthening the viability of their economies and supporting political stability in the region on may 17 2005 deputy secretary of state and former us trade representative robert zoellick made speech linking approval of drcafta to us strategic interests in the region zoellick argued that if th united states fails to support the fragile democracies there now by approving dr cafta higher poverty and more illegal immigration could result others added that failure to approve drcafta could discourage other countries from pursuing ft as with the united states critics of dr cafta dismissed these assertions as exagge rations asserting that even if drcafta had been rejected countries in the region would still have prefer ential access to the us market under existing cbi and related programs they further maintained that the dr cafta

proponents of the drcafta agreement argue that it will help spur needed economic growth and consolid ate democratic progress made in the region by creating institutional structures that could strengthen the rule of law and prevent opportunities for corruption they also maintain that increased competition from foreign firms as well as ongoing international scrutiny that will result from drcafta will provide extra incentives to enact deeper reforms critics of drcafta in the region include labor unions environmentalists indigenous and p easant groups the catholic church and some political parties they argue that as negotiated drcafta has inadequate labor and environmental provisions limits access to gene ric drugs necessary for fighting diseases like hivaids and unfairly pits subsidized us agricultural interests against the regions subsistence farmers public sector workers also fear provisions in drcafta that may hasten the privatization of st aterun programs observers ve noted that the extremely narrow passage of drcafta by the us cong ress in late july s sharpened the debate in the region transparency in government since the early 1990s the drcafta countries have sought with varying degrees of ccess to develop transparent and accountable democratic institutions strong institutions that encourage dialogue and citizen participation are critical to tablishing viable democracies in countries that have long been polarized by political ethnic and class differences and plagued by official corruption in july 2004 us and central am erican catholic bishops issued joint communique expressing concern about the lack of transparency in the negotiations for cafta in central america they noted that with the exception of costa rica information on the agreement was not made available to the public and that members of civil society were excluded from the negotiation process similar concerns have been expressed by ngos and opposition legislators in salvador and guatemala about the lack of public debate and time given for legislative scrutiny during those countries ratification processes4 regional leaders have downplayed these problems noting that trade capacity building tcb assistance related to drcafta will empower civic groups to demand increased accountability fro m their governments and private firms they also maintain that drcafta w ill help improve gove rnment accountability by requiring transparency in customs adminis tration competitive bidding for government procurement and stronger in tellectual property protection

issues by mary jane bolleeffects on the rural poor5 in 2004 the united nations development program identified the persistent probl ems of poverty and inequality as two of the biggest obstacles to democratic consolidation in latin america critics of drcafta have argued that the agreement might exacerbate the social nd economic inequality especially ruralurban income disparities that are pervasive in much of the region while most households stand to gain from lower prices associated with trade liberalization some sectors particularly subsistence and small farmers could lose th eir livelihoods as result of cheap agricultural imports from the united stat as they did in mexico under the north american free trade agreement nafta world bank researchers have concluded that the benefits of nafta did not reach mexicos poor southern states primarily inhabited by subsistence farmers due to lack of investment by the mexican government in infrastructure education and local institu tions those observers maintain that more transition support programs and technical assistance for small farmers are needed in the drcafta countries for all sect ors of society to take adva ntage of trade liberalization it is unclear to some who question drcaf ta whether the countries possess the political will and resources necessary to act reforms needed for the rural poor to benefit from drcafta advocates of the agreement poi nt out that guatemala and honduras have already designed national rural development plans that will complement drcafta employment and labor6 drcafta is likely to ffect employment and labor conditions in central america and the do minican republic since global textile quotas were lifted in january 2005 18 plants in four drcafta countries have closed and some 10000 jobs have been lost some say th at drcafta could mitigate the effects of textile job losses that are occurring as result of increased competition from asian producers others note that any jobs gained in export manufacturing could be offset by potential jobs lost in agriculture due to th likely influx of us agricultural products while the office of the us trade representative ustr asserts that labor laws in the cafta countries generally comply w ith the ilos core labor standards critics argue that those laws are well below international norms enforcement of domestic labor laws is weak in many cafta countries in cluding in some export processing zones epzs in salvador for example factories have collective bargaining agreements in place with the 18 unions active in the epzs

are concerned about changes in their domestic laws that may have to occur in order to comply with the agreement the dominican republic and guat emala have already had to repeal domestic laws that the ustr found to be in breach of drcafta obligations costa rica will have to make substantial legislative changes in order to open up its telecommunications and insurance sectors to foreign competition ci vil society groups reportedly fear that dr cafta provisions will make it difficult if not impossible for governments in the region to preserve essential public services and to develop ne w
