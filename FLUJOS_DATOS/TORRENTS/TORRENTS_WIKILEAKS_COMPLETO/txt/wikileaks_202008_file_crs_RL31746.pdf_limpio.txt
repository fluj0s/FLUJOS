was signed into law on december 2 2003 pl 108145 the act extends funding authorization for adoption incentive payments section 473a of the social security act through fy2008 initially created in the 1997 adop tion and safe familie s act pl 10589 as part of that acts overall strategy to promote safety and expedited permanency for children in state foster care systems the incentive payments coincided with significant increase in adoptions out of the child welfare system pl 108145 preserves much of the current adoption incentive payment structure but updates the baselines that is the number of adoptions state must exceed in order to be eligible for bonuses and provides new incentive tied to the number of adoptions of older children ge nine years and above the new law provides for three separate ba selines and allows states to receive adoption incentive payments if they exceed some or all of these baselines overall adoption the new law continues 4000 bonus for increasing overall adoptions out of foster care but tablishes new baseline for determining whether state has achieved this increase beginning with adoptions out of public foster care that were finalized in fy

increase in its overall adoptions without regard to whether it meets the older child or special needs baselines described below older child adoption independently the statute establishes new bonus for the adoption of children out of public foster care who are aged 9 years or older the older child adoption baseline is set fo r fy2003 at the number of such adoptions accomplished in fy2002 and for succeeding years the highest number of such adoptions achieved in any year beginning with fy2002 for every older child adoption over the baseline state may earn 4000 bonus state may earn bonus for an increase in its older child adop tions without regard to whether it exceeds the overall adoption baseline or the special needs baseline described below the addition of an award tied specifically to an increased number of older child adoptions was proposed by the administrati on based on hhs analysis of foster care adoption data these data indicated that older children are less likely to be adopted than younger children and that older ch ildren constitute an increasing proportion of the children waiting to be adopted special needs adoption the new law amends the prior incentive available for special needs adoptions and ties the current incentive to special needs children who are under the age of 9 years 3 the states fy2003 baseline for special needs adoptions of children under the age of 9 is the total number of such adoptions it completed in fy2002 for fy2004 and succeeding years it is the highest number of such adoptions it completed in previous year beginning with fy2002 for every one of these special needs adoptions over its baseline state may earn 2000 incentive however in order to be eligible for these incentives state must also exceed either its overall doption baseline or

not specifically or solely authorized for child welfare purposes but may be used for those purposes the three largest sources of these nondedicated funds are the tanf block grant the social services block grant ssbg and medicaid an urban institute survey of state child welfare expenditures for fy2002 showed th at while uses of these federal funds varied greatly by state nationally stat spent about 47 billion from these three sources or an estimated 43 of all fe deral funds expended by states for child welfare purposes in that year this repres ents 11 increase in the use of these funds for child welfare compared to finding s by the urban institute in its survey of state fy2000 expenditures15 there are few child welfare advocates who fully support the financing status quo but some are reluctant to accept change s that might jeopardize the current open ended entitlement nature of federal foster care and adoption assistance funding16 this is especially true of advocates and administrators who fear the loss of non dedicated funding ie tanf medicai d ssbg for child welfare purposes further while states and child welfare advocates seek greater flexibility in the use of

below presidents child welfare option the presidents fy2005 budget re proposed but did not elaborate on the ad ministrations fy2004 budget request to offer states an alternative method for fina ncing their child welfare system according to the administration fy2004 budget documen ts this option was intended to serve as an incentive for states to create innovative child welfare plans with strong emphasis on prevention and family support specific legislative language to enact this plan was introduced in the 108th congress however the administration indi cated that under this flexible funding plan states could opt to recei ve their foster care funding as an annual preestablished capped grant amount would be able to us these funds for the full range of child welfare services from family preservation and other services designed to prevent placement through provision of foster car and placement for adoption and would longer need to determine childs federal foster care eligibility status in order to use federal funds on the childs behalf at the same time states would be required to uphold existing child safety protections ag ree to maintain existing levels of state investment in child welfare programs and continue to participate in the hhs administered child and family services reviews to ensure compliance with federal child welfare policy states experiencing severe foster care crisis would under certain circumstances be able to tap tanf continency funds to meet this unanticipated need and states choosing the alternative financing plan could also opt to declare all foster care children eligible for medicaid current law provides automatic medicaid eligibility to foster care children who are eligible for federal foster care assistance only finally th presidents

care cochaired by former representatives gray and frenzel releas ed set of recommendations to restructure the current federal child welfare system17 some of these recommendations were made part of the child safety and family enhancement act child safe act which was introduced in july by representative herger hr 485618httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31746crs12 18 continued crs congressional distribution memorandum child welfare funding in titles ivb and ive of the social security act current law and as separately proposed by the pew commission on children in foster care and by the child safety and family enhancement child safe act hr 4856 aug 4 2004 by emilie stoltzfus 19 states that currently are able to claim the gr eatest percentage of their caseloads as eligible for title ive assistance would likely lose money under straightforward implementation of this approach the commission which sought to make this part of its proposal cost neutral to both the federal government and the states therefore recommended that states continue to determine title ive eligibility as they have in the past for an additional three years states that would have lost mone under the proposal would be made whole by redistributing dollars that would have gone to states that won increased funding under the proposal at the conclusion of the three year s the commission recommends that the states discontinue determining title ive eligibility under the old terms and that they negotiate permanent claims adjustment rate thus the final federal matching rate available under the pew commission recommendation is not certain 20 to access their share of the capped entitlement funds for foster care maintenance payments states would need to submit eligib claims which would be matched at 65 of their current matching rate ie federal match of roughly 33 to 54 states that currently continuedfoster care adoption assist ance and guardianship the pew commission recommendations include removing the income eligibility requirements for adoption assistance and foster care ma intenance payments which would expand eligibility for these federa l dollars the commission also recommends creating new federal funding stream to re imburse states for payments made on behalf of eligible children who leave foster care for subsidized guardianship reimbursement to states for costs associated with foster care main tenance adoption assistance and subsidized guardianship would continue or be established on an openended entitlement basis but the federal matching rate for each state which currently may range from 50 to 83 depending on the states per capita inco would be reduced by 35 ie new federal matching range of roughly 33 to 54 subject to adjustment19 the child safe act hr 4856 would also have expanded eligibility for adoption assistance and foster care mainte nance payments by removing income eligibility requirements but it did not pr opose new federal funding for subsidized guardianship like the pew commission hr 4856 would have maintained the current openended entitlement funding fo r adoption assistance but it would have provided for greater federal matching ra for adoption assistance than would the pew commission potential federal matching range of 43 to 71 unlike the pew commission hr 4856 would have placed an annual cap on the guaranteed federal foster care maintenance payment funding wh ile at the same time reducing the federal matching rate for eligible foster care maintenance payment claims by 35 as proposed by the pew commission the overall annual cap would have been established by mandatory f unding levels included in hr 4856 and each state would have had access to these mandatory funds up to its share of the total fy2003 federal expenditures for foster care maintena nce payments in fy2003 the federal government expended an estimated 1722 billion in foster care maintenance payments hr 4856 proposed funding of 1836 billion in fy2005 rising

foster care caseload could receive reimbursement for greater share of th eir caseload albeit at lower matching rate than is provided by current law however state could only receive funds up to its statutorily established cap which would be ba sed on the states past share of foster care funding for these states then the cap on fundi ng might mean that not all eligible claims would be matched by the federal government alternatively because of the reduced matching rate states that currently have hi gh percentage of their foster care maintenance payment costs reimbursed by foster the federal government might not be able to access all of the funds reserved for their care maintenance payments in given year while these states might experience reduced access to fede ral foster care maintenance payment funding in the given year hr 4856 would have given states the ability to bank any unused foster care funds for use in another year or to tran sfer those funds to their safe children strong families grantwelfare option the legislation would have provided that stat experiencing severe foster care crisis could access add itional funds for fost er care maintenance payments out of the tanf contingency fund services administration and training related to child welfare as also recommended by the pew commission hr 4856 would have created single safe children strong families grant by combining variety of current federal funding streams the grant would have provided states with capped amount of guaranteed funding in each year currently the majority of federal funding for these purposes is available as an openended entitlement for eligible administration and training costs related to state foster care and adoption assistance programs authorized under title ive of the social s ecurity act all eligib state claims are matched at 50 for administrative costs and 75 for training costs more limited discretionary and some cappe d entitlement funding is also available for services to children and their families under title ivb of the social security act the federal government matches state spending for th purposes at 75 up to the total amount of funding appropriated under both the pew commission r ecommendations and hr 4856 the proposed safe children st rong families grant could not have been used for foster care maintenance payments but would have been available for virtually any other child welfare purpose including providing services to children and their families casework support for children and other admin istrative costs and training of child welfare court and other rele vant personnel both proposals would also have provided an initial grant of guaranteed federal do llars of approximately 39 billion which is about 200 million more than the fy2003 f unding for these purposes hr 4856 would have additionally included an authorization for discretionary funding up to 200 million in each of the next 10 years stat would have received share of the mandatory and any discretiona ry money based on their hi storic allocation of the prior funding streams the pew commissi on proposes to increase the mandatory grant annually by 2 plus inflation consum

to 5010 billion in fy2014 as noted the legislation would also have permitted congress to appropriate additional discretionary funds of 200 million to the mandatory amount in each year each of the next 10 fiscal years fy2005fy201421 in order to receive these funds both the pew commission and hr 4856 would ve required states to match federal funds available to them the fede ral match would ve been 68 additional changes proposed although in some instances important details varied both the pew commission and hr 4856 proposed direct access to title ive funding by indian tribes c ontinued openended titlement funding 50 federal matching rate for development and implementation of the statewide automated child welfare information sy stem sacwis expanded hhs authority to waive title ive requirements to allow states to experiment with new ways of using this funding offered new funding to courts that handle child welfare cases and continued reserva tion of funds for child welfare related research and evaluation the two proposals also would have pr ovided some new and revised incentive payments to states although they differed significantly in their approach the pew commission recommends replacing current adoption incentive payments with permanency incentive for achievement of lasting reunification guardianship or adoption and would also provide an enha nced federal matching rate for the safe children strong families grant where state showed increased competence and reduced caseloads among its child welfare workforce hr 4856 would have retained adoption incentives as they currently ex ist and would have established new challenge grant for states that significantly exceed most or all of the national standards associated with performance indicators now used in the child and family services reviews the pew commission also recommends that at least some of states assessed penalties for noncompliance with federal child welfare po licy be used to implement states program improvement plan with this spending directed by hhs and it urges periodic review by an expert adviso ry panel of the methodology and measures used in the child and family services reviews other child welfare funding proposals the pew commission recommendations and hr 4856 suggested comprehensive changes to the current method of distributing child welfare funds and the presidents proposal would have allowed states to make significant changes in the way they receive federal child welfare dollars with the exception of hr 1534 introduced by representative cardin and the companion measures hr

introduced by senator rock efeller would have allowed states to substitute their tanf rules to determine childs eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance alternatively hr 936 introduced by representative george miller and s 448 introduced by senator dodd were companion measures that would have removed all income eligibility criteria for purposes of determining whether state can claim federal reim bursement of foster care and adoption assistance costs these bills would also have set the federal matching rate for all title ive components including training administration and data collection at states medicaid matching rate this rate may range from 50 to 83 finally s 862 introduced by senator rockefeller would have made veral adjustments to eligibility rules for federal adoption assistance including removing the current incomeeligibility requirements subsidized guardianship number of proposals in the 108th congress including the companion bills hr 936 and s 448 hr 1534 the pew commission recommendations and s 2706 introduced in july by senators clinton and snowe sought to provide federal reimbursement for subsidized guardianship payments guardianship is legally created relationship between child and an adult some states have received special waivers of federal title ive requirements that have enabled them to provide subsidized guardian ship payments on behalf of former foster care children more states are seeking this waiver authority see waivers and other states are using separate federal funds eg tanf or state dollars to provide subsidized guardianship payments for form er foster children advocates of federal reimbursement for subsidized guardianship emphasize that these payments can eliminate the monetary barrier to finding permanent placement option for certain children in foster care for whom neither adoption or reunification with their family is possibility the proposals in the 108th congress included similar legislative language or recommendations they provided that the fe deral government would reimburse part of every eligible guardianship payment on an openended entitlement basis and that payments would be available for children w ho were formerly in foster care if those children were placed with relative care givers who had undergone criminal background checks as currently prescribed by title ive other than s 2706 however all the subsidized guardianship proposals in the 108th congress were embedded in larger recommendations for change s to current law that would affect the universe of children on whose behalf state could make reimbursement claims andor the rate at whic h the federal government would match those claims other new or expanded services hr 1534 and h r 936s 448 also sought range

introduced by representative weller s 669 intr oduced by senator snowe and hr 2437 introduced by representative stark each included language that would have allowed states to claim federal reimbursement for the shortterm training of state licensed or approved private child welfare agency staff at matching rate of 75 currently states may claim reimbursement of this kind of training only at 50 federal match while reimbursement for costs associated with the longterm or short term training or education of public state child welfare employees or future employees and the shortterm training of current or prospective foster or adoptive parents and for staff at statelicensed or approved child care institutions may be claimed at 75 federal matching rate both hr 1534 and hr 2437

reimbursement for training to include costs related to short term training of current or prospective re lative guardians as noted earlier both the pew commission and hr 4856 would have expanded the list of individuals for whom federal training funds could be us ed and would have included both private child welfare workers and c ourt personnel who carry out ch ild welfare related duties to this

states develop plans to make effective use of crossjurisdictional resources the housepassed bill which modified some of the original hr 4504 language amended current title ive state plan requirements and would have provided that states must complete and re turn request from nother state for home study within 60 days of receiving the request except that state showing reason for delay that is out of

to remove legal or other barriers to the use of private agencies to complete interstate home studies encour aged the use of such contracted services when necessary to expeditiously handle in terstate home study requests and would have amended the law to promote routine consideration of both instate and outof state placement options as pa rt of case reviews and perm anency planning hr 4504 would have required the government ccountability office gao to make study of how criminal records checks are done fo r child welfare purposes and what they include22 the bill further would have authorized

across state lines these include periodic reassessment of whether the out ofstate placement remains appropriate and visit less frequently than every 12 months to child placed outofstate the housepassed hr 4 504 would have required visit at least once every six mont hs and would have allowed private agency caseworkers working under contract with state agency to make these visits current

itself which was drafted in 1960 and has not been significantly changed since then is seen as outmoded and in some cases as contributor to delays in interstate placement the housepassed hr 4504

scope of placements covered by the compact establish clear lines of financial responsibility and legal jurisdiction pr ovide for creation of binding rules including rules that establish time frames for completion of home studies and those to establish uniform standards for reporting and collectin g data the draft compact would permit an approved placemen t only after safety review and suitability review of the prospective home were completed however in the case of relative placements only it would per mit provisional placement of child following safety review and pending the suitability review finally the draft compact would establish an interstate authority composed of representative from each state in the compact which would be given the power to make binding rules resolve disputes between parties to the compact and enfo rce penalties for non compliance this draft is expected to undergo revisions before march 2005 when final draft will be presented to state

have amended current law to require that all states conform their criminal background checks to the standards included in the adoption and safe families act ie eliminate the optout provision currently

reported language hr 4737 107th congress and provisions introduced in the 108th congress s 331 and hr 443 are that the bill reported in the 107th congress included separate definition of tribe for native groups in alaska and would have required that those alaska groups meet the same federal foster care home requirements that states must meetsame general financing basis currently available to states those bills provided that tribal programs would define the service area where their plan was to be in effect and would be able to grant approval of foster care homes based on tribal standards that ensure the safety of children but would otherwise need to comply with all federal program provisions that apply to states however the hhs secretary could have waived any requirement if he found doing so would advance the best interests and safety of the children served by the tribal plan tribes that currently have agreements with state to receive some title ive reim bursement woul d be allowed to continue those agreements the provisi ons of hr 443 and s 331 were similar to those reported in the 107th congress by the senate finance committee hr 4737 at that time the congressional

argue that the increased funding for basic state grants and communitybased gr ants for the prevention of child abuse and neglect would strengthen state child abuse prevention and treatment efforts by assisting them in meeting new preventionrelated eligibility requirements included in the keeping children and families safe act of 2003 pl 10836 and by enabling states to provide more postinvestigative services to children improve the capacity of their communitybased programs to m easure the effects of their work and also allow these programs to serve more families as in other years the administration explains the requested decrease in the discretionary grants as roughly equivalent to the amount of congressional earmarks attached to this grant program for the previous fiscal year see also the discussion of child abuse prevention and treatment act above the fy2005 presidents budget renewe d the administrations call for an alternative child welfare financing opti on
