autonomous staff to their committees subcommittees while others maintain staff at the fullcommittee level and detail staff to subcommittees as needed the same house rule states t he chairman of each

the convening of congress most chairs review their committees rules from the prior congress and propose to adapt them to the committees pe rceived needs in the current congress party caucuses on each committee traditionally meet separately prior to the first official meeting of committee at committees first meeting committee rules are discussed amended and adopted for example quorum requirements s hould reflect the size and ratio of the committee which often changes from one c ongress to the next in addition the relationship between the majo rity and minority parties should be made clear how much authority should the minority have in agendasetting and other decisions such as the issuance of subpoenas the us of terms such as concurrence consultation or notifica tion related to agendase tting and other decisions will describe the relationship between the majority and minority parties or the chair and ranking minority member and the authority of each party committee rules might also need to be amended to account for ch anges to house rules that affect committees and that were contained in hres 5 committee rules usually manifest the role and authority of the committee chair the ability of the majority especially the chair to control the agenda and legislative actions of the committee and the desire of party leadership to move partyfavored legislation through committee and to the floor therefore committees rules tend to change only incrementally from one congress to the next specific items must be addressed in committee rules such as the selection of regular meeting day

and the majority party to prevail in their legislative objectives50 subcommittee authority committee chair usually works with other majorityparty members of the committee and on occasion with minorityparty members to decide what role subcommittees will play in the committees work some questions about this role are will subco mmittees be authorized to mark up legislation or solely hold hearings will the subject matter of legislation influence that decision will the role of subcommittees be uniform for all of committees subcommittees if subcommittees mark up gislation what form will be used to report their work to the full committee letter to the full committee detailing subcommittee action formal subcommittee re port the introduction of legislation reflecting the subcommittees action or so other method will subcommittees be named in committee rules what roles and authority of subcommittees will be detailed in committee rules or will the rules be silent on these matters as suggested earlier in this report different committees have differing relationships with their subcommittees and even within one committee different subcommittees might have differing roles51 procedural tools for committee chairs maintaining order and decorum as already indicated committee chairs are responsible for maintaining order and decorum in committee proceedings they also have parliamentary tools at their disposal to allow them to minimize delaying tactics52 in exercising the authority and prerogatives available chair seeks to strike balance between the responsibility of the ma jority to govern and the rights of the minority to be heard some key procedures are listed here concerning questions of order that might arise in committee session and the authority of the chair to respond to them the chair has discretion to recognize members to pose parliamentary inquiry he or she also has authority to decline to entertain an inqui ry if in the chairs judgment the inquiry is not relevant to the pending question the chair does not need to respond to hypothetical questions raised under the guise of parliamentary inquiry in addition the chair does not need to

all of th measures were referred to one or more house committees with primary committee designated for measures referred to more than one committee54 in addition to the normal complexities involved in determining co mmittees jurisdiction over measure the creation of permanent homeland security committee which has some overlapping jurisdiction with other standing committees has added new uncertainties to referral decisions in the early days of new congress when dozens of bills are introduced each day the house is in session committees mu st pay special atte ntion to referral decisions to ensure that referrals do not adversely affect their jurisdiction over specific measures or over subject matter generally concerns or disputes and suggested solutions such as rereferral or sequential referral need to be acted on quickly potentially with negotiations between committees and by being brought to the speakers attention since referrals are made on the speakers authority under

consideration by that means if the measure is deemed appropria for suspension consideration the chair notifies the speaker of the house of his desi re for the measure to be considered under suspension57 if the measure is more contentious or does not appear appropriate for suspension consideration special rule can be sought the committee chair writes letter to the rules committee often cosigned by the ranking minority member asking the panel for hearing on the measure if the rules committee holds such hearing the committee chair is traditionally the first witness to testify on behalf of the legislation perhaps with the ranki ng minority member the chair recommends the type of special rule sought for the measures consideration in his or her role as floor manager the chair determines which majorityparty members speak on measure and in what order and which members will speak in support of or in opposition to amendments th at are allowed and offered on the floor58 the committee chair is usually responsible fo r choosing for his or her party which amendments will rece ive voice votes and which will require recorded votes the chair also takes lead in raising or debating parlia mentary questions finally if the measure is to be reconciled with senate measure the committee chair works with the party leadership in selecting conferees from his or her committee
