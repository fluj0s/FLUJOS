sts research and development rd is widely seen as cornerstone of technological innovation which in turn serves as primary engine of longterm economic growth nonetheless firms are likely to invest too little in rd relative to its economic benefits because it is impossible for them to appropriate all the returns to rd thus some government support for business rd appears to be justified on economic grounds however how much support should be provided and in what manner are policy issues that stir ongoing debate in congress the federal government supports business rd in variety of ways direct and indirect one notable indirect source of support is the research and experimentation re tax credit which was enacted as part of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 and recently was extended to june 30 2004 the credit is equal to 20 of firms spending on qualified research above base amount such an incremental design is intended to give firms robust financial incentive to keep increasing their rd budgets from one year to the next and to avoid rewarding firms for rd they would have undertaken in any event in its current design the re tax credit appears to be costeffective policy instrument for increasing business rd investment some recent studies suggest that one dollar of the credits revenue cost leads to one dollar increase in business rd spending others point to the conclusion that the credit may be responsible for somewhere between 65 and 13 of business rd spending nonetheless proponents of the credi t maintain that its design contains certain flaws that reduce its effectiveness as rd tax subsidy they cite three flaws in particular first because of certain rules governing the use of the credit its maximum marginal effective rate is substantially lower than its statutory rate second the credit has never been made permanent feature of the federal tax code and third the credit confers uneven marginal benefits among firms perfor ming qualified research and among qualified business rd projects without justification in standard economic theory in the 106th congress handful of bills has been introduced that would address some or all these concerns the most farreaching is pair of identical bills in the house hr 1682 and the senate s 951 that would permanently extend the credit and create an alternative incremental credit that is more generous at the margin than the current credit there is reason to believe that these proposed changes would fail to transform the credit into what most economists regard as an optimal rd tax subsidy nonetheless on the whole critics of the credit view it as form of corporate welfare that should be curbed or abolished they contend that it serves to reward firms for doing what they would do in any event and often applies to rd

scandinavian journal of economics 94 supplement 3 1992 table 1 p 43the research and experimentation tax credit current law and selected policy issues for the 106th congress in recent decades economists have gained notoriety for their disputes over variety of policy issues but on one such issue the proper role of government in the market for research and development rd they tend to agree most economists subscribe to the view that rd lays the foundation for technological innovation which in turn is an important driving force in longterm economic growth mainly through its impact on the productivity of capital and labor other key determinants of the rate and pattern of economic growth include investment in new plant and equipment and in worker education and training technological innovation embraces complex and varied set of activities ranging from the discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge to the widespread adoption of new technologies derived from this knowledge but it also involves elements of serendipity and ingenuity that have little to do with the formal rd process the end result of this process is the generation of new or improved goods and services and new or improved practices techniques and designs for the production and distribution of goods and services over time technological innovation makes physical capital and labor more productive and yields more benefits for the economy as whole than the firms financing or performing the rd that undergirds this innovation economists who have studied the sources of economic growth attribute between onequarter and onehalf of real growth in us domestic gross product since 1945 to technological innovation1 even though rd plays central role in longterm economic growth and transformation firms are likely to invest less in rd on the whole than its potential economic benefits would warrant this is because business rd investments generate larger returns to society at large than to the firms financing the investments studies done by the late economist edwin mansfield and others indicate that on average the social rates of return on business rd investments are substantially larger than the private rates of return2 the inability of firms to capture or appropriate all the returns to their rd investm ents provides cogent economic rationale forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs2 3see library

february 8 2000 14 pgovern ment support of rd beyond what is needed to support the governments critical missions the federal government supports business rd in variety of ways direct and indirect3 one salient source of indirect support is an incremental tax credit for research expenditures since july 1981 firms have been able to claim credit against their federal income tax liabilities for spending on qualified research conducted in the united states above base amount under section 41 of the internal revenue code irc the credit also referred to as the research and experimentation re tax credit is intended to give firms robust financial incentive to incre ase their rd investments from one year to the next it was enacted as temporary provision of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 and since then it has been extended ten times most recently by the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 and significantly revised five times most recently by the small business job protection act of 1996 in fact since its enactment the credit has been continuously available except for the period from july 1 1995 to june 30 1996 when it lapsed and subsequent extensions of the credit did not retroactively cover this period the credit is due to expire on june 30 2004 this report examines the design of the current credit and some of the key policy issues it raises more specifically the report discusses whether the credit is justified on economic grounds explains how the credit works and summarizes what is known about its effectiveness and incentive effect in addition the report describes some of the key policy issues raised by the credit it concludes with discussion of legislative propos als introduced in the 106th congress that address these issues and an assessment of their potential impact on business rd investment economic rationale for the re tax credit in theory properly functioning market economy can be expected to allocate resources efficiently which is to say in manner that achieves the highest possible level of social welfare under these circumstances government intervention in the economy would be likely to result in less desirable outcomes this is not to suggest however that government intervention can never improve social welfare if any of the stringent conditions required for markets to allocate resources efficiently fails to materialize then according to standard economi c theory government intervention might achieve higher levels of social welfare most economists hold that market economy may misallocate resources under certain conditions one is the existence of excessive market power on the part of buyers and sellers another is the failure of markets for certain goods and services to emerge for instance the private market does not offer insurance for many significant risks facing individuals such as loss of income because of unemployment the presence of either condition would provide cogent economic justification for government intervention in the economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs3 4an externality is an inefficiency that arises because of the nonexistence of market for the costs or benefits of certain activities it materializes when the activities of one person or firm affect the welfare of others in ways that are not transmitted through market prices externalities can be positive or negative positive externality occurs when an entity does something that benefits others without receiving compensation for this welfare gain and negative externality exists when one entity s actions lowers the welfare of others without bearing the cost of this welfare loss 5this means that it is practically impossible to exclude someone from the benefits of newly discovered knowledge and that one persons use of such knowle dge does not diminish the stock of knowledge available for others to use for more details on the nature of public goods see stiglitz joseph economics of the public sector new york ww norton co 1988 p 119123 6jones charles i and john c williams measuring the social return to rd quarterly journal of economics november 1998 p 1119 to 1135 7the late economist edwin mansfield estimated that the average social rate of return was more continuedin effect the re tax credit represents government intervention in the market for rd or the market for the creation and development of new technical knowledge and knowhow is such intervention justified on economic grounds the answer depends largely on whether or not the credit addresses the conditions that contribute to inefficient uses of economic resources does the market for rd exhibit any such conditions in word yes the market is subject to failure that is tantamount to the nonexistence of market positive externality4 an externality positive or negative arises when one economic actors behavior affects the welfare of another in way that is not reflected in market prices as noted earlier the process of technological innovation embraces wide range of sometimes related but often discrete activities including the discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge the application of this knowledge to develop new products and processes and the widespread adoption of these new technologies by consumers and firms critical element in the process is rd conducted by firms in theory firm will invest in rd up to the point where its expected aftertax return on the investment equals its cost of capital yet it is thought that many firms do not capture all the returns to their rd investments and thus are disposed to invest less in rd than its social returns would warrant the reason lies in the primary output of rd new technical knowledge and knowhow knowledge and knowhow exhibit the chief traits of public good their consumption or use is nonexcludable and nonrival5 as result it is not possible for firms that invest in rd to prevent other firms from exploiting its results even in the presence of the patent protection the results of rd can spill over to other firms through several channels rival firms can imitate new products through rever engineering or they can hire key rd personnel away from innovating firms or researchers from an innovating firm can quit and form competing firm with funding from venture capitalists or banks the existence of those spillover effects is evidence that the social returns to rd exceed the private returns in recent paper economists charles i jones and john c williams estimated that the social rate of return to rd was two to four times greater than the private rate of return on capital6 and other research suggests that this is true in the particular case of business rd7 such gap produces inefficient outcomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs4 7continued than twice the average private rate of return for host of important indust rial innovations 56 versus 25 see mansfield edwin microeconomics of technological innovation the positive sum strategy harnessing technology for economic growth ralph landau and nathan rosenberg eds washington national academy press 1986 p 307325 8us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for continuedbecause it means that firms rd investments fall short of the levels required to achieve maximum social welfare these spillover effects constitute classic example of positive externality classic remedy for such market failure is subsidy for the activity producing the external benefits in the case of business rd the optimal subsidy would equalize the private and social returns to rd investments at the level of rd spending that engenders the highest possible social welfare the re tax credit would play such role if its average incentive effect were large enough to bridge the gap between the private and social returns to rd so one important policy issue raised by the credit is whether its average weighted incentive effect is capable of elevating business rd investment to socially optimal level ideally the re tax credit would be available only for rd projects with social returns in excess of their private returns unfortunately such targeted use of the credit is not feasible for two reasons first it is very difficult to measure accurately the social returns to rd second it is impossible to know in advance which business rd expenditures will produce greater social returns than private returns in reality the credit is available for all qualified business research regardless of its social returns as result there is barrier to firms claiming re tax credits for rd projects with private rates of return that exceed social rates of return this limitation of the credit as an rd subsidy raises another important policy issue if an aim of federal rd policy is to stimulate investment in rd projects with substantial spillover effects and assuming that public rd spending does not displace private rd spending would targeted government spending on rd be more effective than tax subsidies in accomplishing this goal design of the re tax credit under irc section 41 the re tax credit actually comprises three separate and distinct credits regular credit an alternative incremental credit and basic research credit they are alike in that each applies only to qualified research spending above base amount yet as is discussed in detail below they can differ considerably in their marginal value to firms paying for such research furthermore the re tax credit is part of the general business credit irc section 38 and thus subject to its restrictions firms that earn re credits in particular tax year but cannot use them because of these restrictions or because they lacked taxable income may carry the unused credits back up to three years or forward up to fifteen years the congressional joint committee on taxation estimates that in fy1999 the three credits combined cost the us government 16 billion in foregone tax revenues8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs5 8continued fiscal years 19992003 jcs798 washington december 14 1998 p 15regular re tax credit the regular re tax credit is equal to 20 of firms qualified research spending above base amount such an incremental design is intended to give firms robust financial incentive to spend more on rd than they otherwise would thereby shrinking the gap between actual and socially desirable levels of business rd investment the base amount is supposed to approximate firms normal rd expenditures calculating the base amount entails series of steps and the formula is different for established firms and startup firms for an established firm which is defined as firm with taxable income and qualified research expenses in three of the years from 1984 to 1988 the base amount equals the product of its fixedbase percentage and its average annual gross receipts in the four previous tax years an established firms fixed base percentage is its ratio of total qualified research spending to total gross receipts between 1984 and 1988 or its research intensity in that period see table 1 for sample calculation of the regular re tax credit for an established firm for startup firm which is defined as either firm with fewer than three years of taxable income and qualified research expenses from 1984 to 1988 or firm whose first year with taxable income and qualified research expenses was 1984 or later the base amount is determined in the same manner but with one significant difference its fixedbase percentage is fixed at 3 during the firms first five years with taxable income and qualified research expenses after 1993 at the end of that period the percentage shifts gradually so that by the eleventh year with taxable income and qualified research expenses after 1993 it equals the ratio of qualified research spending to gross receipts in five of the previous six tax years chosen by the firm consequential effect of the 3 rule is that it increases the odds that small fledgling firm will be able to claim the credit in period when it is vulnerable to failure or cash flow problems see table 2 for sample calculation of the regular re tax credit for startup firm two rules for determining the base amount have significant influence the credits maximum marginal effective rate one is that the base amount must equal 50 or more of firms qualified research spending in the current tax year hereafter this rule will be referred to as the 50percent rule and the second rule is that firms fixedbase percentage cannot exceed 16 the impact of these rules on the maximum marginal effective rate of the credit is discussed below as general rule firm can claim the regular re tax credit only if its ratio of qualified research expenses in the current tax year to its average annual gross receipts in the past four tax years is greater than its fixedbase percentage this holds true regardless of how much more firm spends on qualified research in the current tax year than in the base period in the sample calculation of the regular credit shown in table 1 the established firms research intensity in its base period was 4 but it rosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs6 to 5 in the period from 1994 to 1998 thus one desirable effect of the regular credit is that it encourages firms to become more researchintensive alternative incremental re tax credit firms performing qualified research may claim an alternative incremental re tax credit instead of the regular credit this option has been available since july 1 1996 in deciding whether to claim the alternative credit two considerations are paramount one is that once firm claims the alternative credit it must continue to claim it in succeeding tax years unless it receives permission from the internal revenue service irs to switch to the regular credit the other important consideration is that the alternative credit consists of three linked rates and the highest one is much lower than the statutory rate of the regular credit specifically the alternative credi t is equal to the sum of 265 of firms qualified research expenses in excess of 1 but not greater than 15 of its average annual gross receipts in the preceding four tax years and 32 of its qualified research expenses in excess of 15 but not greater than 20 of this same amount and 375 of its qualified research spending that exceeds 20 of this same amount by contrast the statutory rate of the regular credit is 20 see tables 1 and 2 for sample calculations of the alternative incremental re tax credit for an established firm and startup firm in general firm can claim the alternative credit if its qualified research expenses in the current tax year exceed 1 of its average gross receipts in the past four tax years this clearly is the case for the established firm shown in table 1 and the startup firm shown in table 2 furthermore firms can expect to benefit more from the alternative credit than the regular credit if their qualified research expense s in the current tax year are only slightly greater than their base amounts under the regular credit such is not the case for the established and startup firms depicted in tables 1 and 2 the calculations in the tables prove that both firms would be better off claiming the regular creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs7

research expenses the preceding discussion makes clear that crucial consideration in claiming the regular or alternative re tax credits is the definition of qualified research under irc section 41d research expenses must satisfy three criteria in order to qualify for the credit first the expenses must relate to activities that can be expensed under irc section 174 that section allows firm to deduct expenses it incurs in performing research in the experimental or laboratory sense related to its business in the year they are incurred or to amortize them over period of sixty months qualified research under section 174 includes the development of new product or process or the improvement of an existing one second the expenses eligible for the re tax credit must pertain to research undertak

research activities do not qualify for the re tax credit arguably it is more concrete about activities that do not qualify than those that do at any rate firms may not claim the credit for expenses incurred in the following activities research whose aim is to alter the style or appearance of business component research done after the start of commercial production of new or improved business component research done to adapt business component to specific customers needs research done to duplicate an existing business component practice known as reverse engineering surveys or studies related to market research management techniques data collection or testing and inspection for quality control the development of computer software for internal use with some exceptions research conducted outside the united states puerto rico or us possession research in the social sciences arts or humanities and research funded by grant moreover not all expenses incurred in qualified research are eligible for the credit under section 41 qualified research expenses cover the wages and salaries of employees engaged in qualified research the costs of materials and supplies used in qualified research rented or leased computer time used in qualified research 75 of payments for qualified research performed by nonprofit scientific research organizations that are not private foundation s and 65 of payments for qualified research performed by certain other organizations the credit does not apply to the following expenses equipment and structures used in qualified research the overhead related to this research including utility costs rent leasing fees administrative and insurance costs and property taxes and the fringe benefits of employees engaged in qualified research while firms can deduct these expenses from their taxable income their exclusion from the calculation of the credit can diminish its incentive effect recent study indicates that quali fied research expenses account for anywhere from 50 to 73 of total business rd spending as defined under current financial accounting standards9 in spite of its critical role in the use and incentive effect of the

irs regulations provide little or guidance on such key questions as how to determine if specific research project discovers information that is technological in nature or how to determine if project is part of process of experimentation for the purpose of developinga new or improved function or performance or reliability or quality the congress and irs have taken some steps to clarify the boundaries of qualified research but the issue remains source of controversy and uncertainty within the private sector the tax reform act of 1986 mandated that the treasury department issue regulations clarifying the research that qualifies for the credit in 1989 the irs issued final regulations for research performed between 1981 and 1986 however it has yet to do the same for research undertaken after 1986 in december 1998 the irs issued proposed regulations reg10517097 on the definition of qualified research under section 41d in particular it proposed that research would meet the discovery test only if the research activities are undertaken to obtain knowle dge that exceeds expands or refines the common knowledge of skilled professiona ls in the particular field of technology or science and the process of experimentation utilized fundamentally relies on principles of physi cal or biological sciences engineering or computer science the irs further proposed that the credit may be available where the technological advance sought by the taxpayer is evolutionary and in certain circumstances where the taxpayer is not the first to achieve the same advance and regardless of whether the taxpayer succeeds or fails in achieving the desired advance but final action on these proposals is still pending at public hearing on the proposed regulations held by the irs in late april 1999 several members of the business community voiced variety of concerns about them and urged the irs to reconsider much of its proposal10 the irs is mulling over the criticisms but it is not clear when final regulations will be issued credit for basic research in addition to the regular or alternative incremental re tax credit firms may claim tax credit for payments to certain organizations that perform basic research the basic research credit is intended in part to foster close collaboration between the private sector and research universities the credit is equal to 20 of basic research payments over base amount basic research payments that are less than or equal to the base amount may be included in the research expenses eligible for the regular or alternative credits irc section 41e defines basic research as any original investigation for the advancement of scientific knowledge not having specific commercial objective the credit does not apply to basic research performed

years preceding the first year in which it recorded taxable income after 1983 and firms base amount is equal to the sum of its minimum basic research amount and its maintenanceofeffort amount in the base period the minimum basic research amount is equal to the greater of 1 of firms average annual inhouse and contract research expenses during the base period or 1 of its total contract research expenses during the base period and firms minimum basic research amount must equa l 50 or more of its basic research payments in the current tax year the maintenanceofeffort amount is the difference between firms donations in the current tax year to qualified organizations eg universities for purposes other than basic research and its average annual donations to the same organizations during the base period for the same purposes multiplied by the costofliving adjustment for the current tax year expensing allowance for research expenditures as noted above under irc section 174 firms engaging in rd may deduct their qualified research expenses from taxable income in the year when they are incurred or they may amortize the expenses over 60 months without such provision firms would be required to recover their rd expenses through depreciation allowances that reflect the economic lives of the assets created through the rd in the case of patents acquired by firm that period would encompass the twenty years after patent is filed the expensing allowance was enacted in 1954 and unlike the re tax credit it benefits nearly every firm that conducts rd the allowance applies to all rd costs except the structures and equipment used in rd the costs of rd equipment must be recovered over three years and those of rd buildings over fifteen years at the rates permitted under current depreciation schedules expensing represents significant rd subsidy because it has the effect of taxing the returns to the share of an rd investment that is expensed at marginal effective rate of zero

antitrust law and foreign trade and investment can indirectly shape the domestic climate for technological innovation nonetheless the application of these tools is not always coordinated and sometimes they appear to work at crosspurposes12 within the broad spectrum of federal support for rd the credit has played relatively minor role in dollar terms since its inception in july 1981 this can be readily seen by comparing the cost of the credit measured in equivalent federal outlays to total federal spending on rd13 in fy 1998 according to estimates by the us office of management and budget the outlay equivalent of the credit totaled 33 billion or 43 of federal rd outlays that year from fy 1993 through fy 1997 the outlay equivalent of the credit averaged 25 of federal rd spending incentive effect of the re tax credit the incentive effect of the re tax credit denotes the financial incentive it offers firms to spend an additional dollar on rd basically there are two ways to assess this effect one is to analyze the credits impact on the aftertax price of rd the credit lowers the cost to firms of performing research beyond their base amounts this cost reduction presumably induces firms to spend more on qualified research and the magnitude of the increase hinges on how responsive firms are to declines in the aftertax price of rd another way to assess the credits incentive effect is to measure its impact on the profitability of business rd investments the credit lowers the marginal effective tax rate on the returns to the rd investments that qualify for it which is to say that the credit increases the aftertax rate of return on the share of rd investment that qualifies for it relative to alternative uses of that capital in this way it is meant to encourage firms to invest more in rd than they otherwise would so how much of subsidy to rd does the credit represent marginal effective rate of the credit the credit is equal to 20 of firms spending on qualified research above its base amount in reality however the marginal effective rate of the credit on rdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs13 14the original credit which was enacted as temporary provision of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 was equal to 25 of the amount by which spending on qualified research in the current tax year exceeded average qualified research expenditures in the previous three years shortly after the credit went into effect in july 1981 its formula became target of criticism key problem with the formula in the view of analysts who studied it was that it tended to undercut the incentive effect of the credit over time this stemmed from the use of moving base that depended in part on firms current spending on qualified research for example if firm raised its spending on qualified research by 100 in 1983 it not only earned continuedexpenditures above this amount turns out to be much lower than 20 this reduction is due largely to three rules governing the use of the credit one such rule is the requirement that any credit must be subtracted from the research outlays that are expensed hereafter this rule will be referred to as the basis adjustment it has the effect of taxing the credit at firms statutory income tax rate as most corporate income is taxed at rate of 35 this adjustmen t reduces the maximum marginal effective rate of the credit for many firms from 20 to 13 20 x 135 essentially the basis adjustment treats the credit as price reduction for portion of research expenses as result the value of the credit cannot be deducted another rule that can dilute the marginal effective rate of the credit was mentioned earlier the 50percent rule under this rule firms base amount cannot be less than 50 of its qualified research expenses in the current tax year for firm whose current spending on rd relative to gross income ie its research intensity is more than double its fixedbased percentage which is equivalent to its baseperiod research intensity this rule further lowers the top marginal effective rate of any credit it can claim to 65 and the price reduction for research above the base amount from 20 to 10 and further diminishing the incentive effect of the credit is rule that excludes the cost of rd equipment structures and overhead including the fringe benefits of rd personnel from qualified research expenses how this exclusion affects the credits marginal effective rate depends on the share of an rd investment that is ineligible for the credit firms past rd investments can also diminish the incentive effect of the re tax credit although this feedback effect is likely to be very small in most instances to the extent firms current rd investments boost its future gross receipts by making it more competitive in domestic or foreign markets they could set the stage for smaller re tax credits in the future such scenario would materialize if firms current rd projects eventually lead to increased gross receipts in future period and if the added receipts boost the firms base amounts for the calculation of the re tax credit and if the firms spending on qualified research grows at slower rate than its gross receipts between the present and that future period the likely outcome would be that the firm ends up claiming smaller credits because of past research successes although such feedback effect would make it harder over time for firm to claim the credit the effect is smaller than it was under the original credit which was revised in 1989 mainly to remedy this problem14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs14 14continued tax credit of 25 for that year but it also increased its base amount for the credit by 3333 in each of the next three years thereby reducing the maximum credit it could earn in that period by total of 25 3333 x 025 x 3 congress attempted to elimin ate this flaw in the design of the credit by passing the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 obra89 among other things the act altered the formula for calculating the credit so that the base amount was independent of firms current rd spending it established the current formula where firms base amount is equal to product of its fixedbase percentage and its average annual gross income in the previous four years 15hall bronwyn h how effective are fiscal incentives for rd review of the evidence p 21the marginal effective rate of the credit is equivalent to the reduction in the aftertax price of an additional dolla r of qualified research once the rate has been determined all that is needed to estimate the additional rd stimulated by the credit is measure of the tax price elasticity of rd this elasticity shows the percentage change in rd spending that would result from 1 decrease in the price of rd available studies that attempt to estimat the tax price elasticity for rd come to basically the same conclusion the tax price elasticity of us rd spending during the 1980s was around unity 10 maybe higher15 to estimate the rd spending induced by the credit all that is necessary is to multiply the estimated elasticity by the weighted average marginal effective rate of the credit assuming that the current tax price elasticity of rd is unity it is possible that the credit raises business rd investment somewhere between 10 and 20 but considering that the price responsiveness of rd demand is unlikely to remain constant over long periods such an estimate may be far off the mark in 2000 effect of the credit on aftertax returns on business rd investments the incentive effect of the credit can also be analyzed from the perspective of its impact on the returns to business rd investments as bill cox of crs made clear in 1995 report this impact depends on three factors 1 the share of an rd investment that qualifies for the credit 2 the economic life of the technology assets created by the investment and 3 the marginal effective tax rate on the income earned from these assets in essence the decision to invest in the creation of new technical knowledge or knowhow is an investment decision entailing the expenditure of funds in the present to create intangible economic assets that might yield profits sometime in the future as with any investment decision the decision to invest in rd should be based in part on the user cost of capital which is the amount needed to return the amount invested in an asset and pay competitive return on that capital part of the user cost of capital is the income taxes paid on the returns to the intangible assets created through rd less depreciation allowances and credits in effect the re tax credit raises aftertax returns on the shares of rd investments that qualify for it by reducing the user cost of capital key question is by how much does it reduce this costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs15 16for summary of coxs estimates of the effects of expensing and the re tax credit on the rates of return to rd investments see cox william tax preferences for research and experimentation are changes needed table 1 p 15 and the appendix p 33in his 1995 report cox estimated the effects of the two main tax preferences for rd the re tax credit and the expensing allowance for quali fied research expenditures on the rates of return for host of hypothetical research projects he divided the projects into three groups based on the share of each projects total cost accounted for by depreciable structures and equipment capitalintensive projects 50 of outlays intermediate projects 30 of outlays and laborintensive projects 15 of outlays in addition the groups differed in the share of outlays that qualified for both expensing and the credit 35 in the case of capitalintensive projects 50 in the case of intermediate projects and 65 in the case of laborintensive projects and within each group cox assumed that the economic lives of the technology assets produced by the projects lasted three five ten or twenty years in coxs analysis the impact of the credit can be inferred from the difference between the ratios of aftertax returns to pretax returns for the projects under expensing alone and under both expensing and the credit as one would expect he found that the credit augmented the effect of expensing on the returns to the shares of rd investmen ts that qualified for both tax subsidies in the case of capital intensive projects the weighted average ratio under expensing alone was 913 for all economic lives when the credit was included the weighted average ratio rose for all economic lives ranging from 1010 for projects with 20year economic lives to 1060 for project s with 3year economic lives16 for intermediate projects cox estimated that under expensing alone the weighted average ratio of aftertax returns to pretax returns was 948 regardless of the economic life of the project but under both expensing and the credit the weighted average ratio was higher for all economic lives ranging from 1087 for projects with 20year economic lives to 1158 for projects with 3year economic lives and for laborintensive projects the ratio under expensing alone was 974 for all economic lives but the inclusion of the credit again increased the ratios for all economic lives ranging from 1155 for projects with 20 year economic lives to 1247 for projects with 3year economic lives in short the re tax credit boosted the aftertax returns relative to pretax returns for all hypothetical rd projects by margins ranging from 11 for 20year capitalintensive projects to 28 for 3year laborintensive projects what do these striking resul ts say about the credits incentive effect the optimal rd subsidy strives to increase the returns to rd investments that firms would not make without the subsidy furthermore in theory the optimal rd subsidy equalizes the private and social returns on these additional rd investments if the subsidy is delivered through the tax code then the focus of concern necessarily shifts to aftertax returns to rd investments the optimal rd tax subsidy would try to elevate aftertax returns to rd investments beyond what firms would undertake without the subsidy to the levels that would result from taxing the social returns to rd at the same rate for example let us assume that the average pretax social return to rd is double the average pretax private return as number of studies have suggested then at corporate tax rate of 35 the optimal rd tax subsidy would seek to raise aftertax returns to business rd investments to 130httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs16 17office of technology assessment the effectiveness of research and experimentation tax credits p 2122of the pretax returns because aftertax returns would be 65 of the pretax returns without the tax subsidy the optimal tax subsidy would attempt to boost aftertax returns to level that is double pretax returns in coxs analysis the two tax subsidies had the largest impact on laborintensive rd projects yielding technology assets with 3year economic life specifically they boosted aftertax returns to 1247 of pretax returns in the case of the median project without the re credit aftertax returns were less than pretax returns by 26 by contrast the two tax subsidies had the smallest impact on capitalintensive projects with 20year economic life they raised aftertax returns to 101 of pre tax returns these results suggest that even in the best of circumstances the current re tax credit may not be large enough to bridge the gap between aftertax private and social returns to business rd investments at the same time because the social returns to rd that qualifies for the credit cannot be known when the credits are claimed it is unclear by how much the marginal effective rate of the credit should be increased what is clear is that the credit confers varying marginal benefits on rd projects and more specifically it might provide excessive subsidies to projects with belowaverage external benefits and inadequate subsidies to projects with above average external benefits effectiveness of the re tax credit an issue separate from the incentive effect of the re tax credit is its effectiveness the credits effectiveness signifies its efficacy in raising business rd investment in way that enhances economic welfare relative to alternative uses of the capital ideally the credits effectiveness would be assessed by comparing the social benefits from the added rd stimulated by the credit with the social opportunity costs of the tax revenue forgone because of the credit under such an approach the credit would be deemed effective if the social benef its arising from the rd stimulated by credit outweigh the social benefits arising from alternative uses eg increased federal spending on defense education or health care of the revenue cost of the credit however such analysis appears to have been done and it is unlikely that one ever will be undertaken because of the formidable difficulties in measuring the social returns to rd among the main difficulties are coming up with adequate price indexes for the cost components of rd in different industries establishing reasonable time frame for measuring the productivity gains from rd and devising reasonable measures of the rate of depreciation for rd capital stocks17 consequently some analysts have focused on more limited and manageable objective estimating the amount of research expenditures induced by one dollar of the credit or the credits costeffectiveness such an approach implicitly assumes that the spillover benefits of rd are large enough to justify subsidy such as the re tax credit the central policy issues tackled by this approach are whether the current re tax credit is costeffective rd subsidy and whether other policy tools eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs17 18for summary of these studies see office of technology assessment the effectiveness of research

same increase in rd investment at lower cost what do existing studies reveal about the costeffectiveness of the re tax credit for policymakers the most useful studies are those that use industry data from 1985 and after to analyze the responsiveness of business rd spending to the decrease in the tax price of research caused by the credit18 on the whole those studies concluded that from the mid1980s to the early 1990s firms responded to the credit by raising their rd spending between one and two dollars for every dollar of the credit claimed19 while these studies have flaws that limit their reliability they do sugges t that the current credit can be considered costeffective policy tool for boosting business rd investments20 for instance assuming that the one dollar of the credit generated one additional dollar of business rd spending in 1996 the most recent year for which detailed corporate income tax return data are available the credit may have raised business rd investment by as much as 22 billion in that year assuming this estimate is reasonable then it can be maintained that the credit was responsible for about 2 of us business rd spending in 1996 which totaled an estimated 121 billion policy issues raised by the credit in the minds of most econo mists the re tax credit can be justified on economic grounds moreover available evidence suggests that it is capable of boosting business rd investment in costeffective manner but this is not to imply that in its current state it is an ideal policy instrument or that it sparks controversy some believe that it should be reduced or eliminated on principle and supporters of the credit find fault with it for the followi ng reasons 1 its lack of permanence 2 its weak and uneven incentive effect across the range of rd projects and across firms performing qualified research 3 its ambiguous definition of qualified research and 4 its relative efficiency in boosting business rd investment each policy issue is discussed in detail below lack of permanence the re tax credit which recently was extended from july 1 1999 to june 30 2004 has never been permanent fixture of the federal tax code in the view of somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs18 21himmelberg charles p and bruce c peterson rd and internal finance panel study of small firms in hightech industries the review of economics and statistics february 1994 p 41analysts this lack of permanence limits the credits efficacy because it subtly encourages business managers to ignore or downplay the credit when considering whether or by how much to expand their rd budgets basically there are two reasons for this subtle effect one is that uncertainty about future tax policy toward rd compounds the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds the expected returns on prospective rd projects and this heightened uncertain ty may deter business managers from pursuing rd projects that they would pursue if they could count on the credit being available in three five ten or fifteen years second reason is the high adjustment costs that rd entails in general adjustment costs are the hidden costs firms confront when they alter their output in response to temporary conditions in the case of rd the adjustment costs become pressing managerial issue when rd budgets are cut substantial share of the typical business rd budget is composed of the wages and salaries of rd personnel for the most part these employees are costly to train and difficult to replace when they resign or are let go moreover rd scientists and engineers represent valuable assets for their employers largely because of the specialized knowledge and knowhow they possess when group of them leaves one firm and is hired by another or forms competing firm they unavoidably transfer their knowledge and knowhow to their new employers technology transfers of this sort could end up benefitting the new employer s or firms at the expense of the former employers21 adjustment costs such as these make firms reluctant to cut their rd budgets during periods of declining or stagnant revenues by the same token the adjustment costs associated with rd may be large enough to deter business managers from undertaking rd projects that are expected to earn acceptable after tax rates of return in the presence of the re tax credit but carry significant risk of earning unacceptable aftertax rates of return if the credit were to expire and not be renewed at some future date these considerations suggest that permanently extending the credit could make it more effective policy instrument for boosting business rd investment inadequate and uneven incentive effect among firms and rd projects another key policy issue raised by the current re tax credit is its apparently inadequate or suboptimal and uneven incentive effect among firms performing qualified research and among qualified research projects in this context an inadequate incentive effect denotes marginal benefit from the credit that is less than the amoun t that would be needed to boost business rd investment to levels warranted by its potential spillover benefits by contrast an uneven incentive effect signifies marginal benefit from the credit that varies from one firm to the next or from one rd proje ct to the next with clear economic justification for the variationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs19 22see for example mansfield edwin microeconomics of technological innovation the positive sum strategy edited by ralph landau and nathan rosenberg washington national academy press 1986 p 309311as was noted earlier the optimal rd tax subsidy would seek to elevate the real aftertax private returns to rd investments to the levels that would result from taxing their real social returns at the same rate some studies have indicated that the median private rate of return on business rd is about onehalf the median social rate of return22 assuming this estimate is correct then in theory the optimal rd tax subsidy might seek to double aftertax private rates of return to business rd investments in the absence of subsidy because most corporate income is taxed at rate of 35 the optimal rd tax subsidy would arguably try to increase aftertax private returns to level equal to 130 of pretax returns 2 x 135 without the subsidy aftertax returns would equal 65 of pretax returns it is likely however that the relationship between private and social returns varies markedly among rd projects this implies that subsidy rate that is optimal for projects with average spillo ver benefits would end up oversubsidizing projects with belowaverage spillovers and undersubsidizing projects with aboveaverage spillovers at any rate as cox suggested in 1995 study discussed earlier rd tax subsidy rate of 130 of pretax private returns might offer policymakers reaso nable standard for evaluating the efficiency effects of current rd tax subsidies cox discovered in the 1995 study cited earlier that the weighted average ratios of aftertax returns to pretax returns under the expensing allowance and the re tax credit for the hypothetical rd projects he examined ranged from 101 for capital intensive projects yielding technology assets with 20year economic life to 1247 for laborintensive projects yielding technology assets with 3year economic life this result raised the possibility that the combined effect of current rd tax subsidies was insufficient to raise business rd investment to levels commensurate with its potential social benefits it also raised the possibility that an increase in the maximum marginal effective rate of the re tax credit may be justified on economic grounds how much the credit rate should be increased was not clear from coxs analysis that the re tax credits incentive effect varies among firms performing qualified research in ways that cannot be justified on economic grounds is evident from another crs report by bill cox this one issued in 1996 using data on net income and rd spending reported to the securities and exchange commission by publicly traded companies cox estimated the number of companies from sample of about 900 usbased companies with research budgets ranging from the gargantuan to the lilliputian that could claim the re tax credit in 1994 he found that 78 of the firms in the sample could claim the credit and of those he found that 56 received credits with maximum effective rate of 65 and the remaining 44 received credits with maximum effective rate of 13 the firms in the former group had lower rate because they were subject to the 50percent rule furthermore his analysis showed that some of the most researchintensive firms could claim either credit or credit with maximum effective rate that was half as large as the rate received by firms with lower research intensities these results were not surprising in light of the design of the credit which gives firms significant financial incentive to spend more on research relative to sales in the present than in their base periodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs20 23office of technology assessment the effectiveness of research and experimentation tax credits p 15 and 17 in practice the credit rewards firms whose research intensity has grown since their base periods but it may offer rewards to firms whose researchintensities have stagnated or declined since their base periods such haphazard and seemingly arbitrary pattern of subsidization cannot be defended on the grounds of economic efficiency because there is evidence linking firms research intensity to the social returns to its rd investments suggested remedies include abolishing or relaxing the 50percent rule making the credit refundable especially for firms that are having difficulty raising funds in debt and equity markets establishing moving base period and permitting all expenses related to qualified research including overhead and capital expenditures to qualify for the credit ambiguous definition of qualified research yet another problem with the current re tax credit is the current definition of qualified research the definition is ambiguous to the point that it either deters firms from claiming the credit or compounds the administrative cost of the credit both for firms performing qualified research and for the irs in order to qualify for the credit research expenses must satisfy three criteria 1 they must relate to activities that are eligible for expensing under irc section 174 2 they must also relate to research done to discover information that is technological in nature and useful in the development of new or improved business component ie product process computer software technique formula or invention and 3 they must relate to activities that constitute process of experimentation whose intended aim is the development of business component with new or improved function performance or reliability or quality costly ambiguity enters the picture when executives at firms that want to claim the credit are unsure whether specific research expenses meet the often vagu criteria for example how is one to determine whether specific research project passes the discovery test or whether it is part of process of experimentation whose ultimate aim is to develop product or process with new or improved function or performance or reliability or quality lingering uncertainty over which research activities qualify for the credit has spawned numerous disputes between the irs and firms over the amounts of the credit that are claimed while there are reliable estimates of the cost to either firms or the irs of administering the credit 1995 report by the office of technology assessment made clear that the legal disputes entail considerable costs for both sides23 under the tax reform act of 1986 the irs was given the task of issuing final regulations clarifying the definition of qualified research in december 1998 the agency issued proposed regulations that have generated considerable comment and criticism from some representatives of the business sector given the contentiousness of the definition of research that qualifies for the credit it is unclear whether the irs can issue final regulations that will satisfy all concerned partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs21 24stoneman paul the economic

hearing serial 1065 washington us govt print off 1999 prepared statement of robert mcintyre p 316efficiency effects of the re tax credit chief economic rationale for the re tax credit is that firms invest too little in rd because they cannot appropriate all the returns to it this raises the question of whether the credit is the most efficient means of elevating business rd investment to the socially optimal level the credit of course is but one of variety of direct and indirect policy instruments used by the federal government to support commercial rd if it can be shown that one or more of these other instruments can boost business rd spending to the same extent at lower opportunity cost or of achieving higher level of business rd investment at the same opportunity cost then case can be made for replacing the credit with the more efficient policy instrument unfortunately there appears to be body of research that addresses this issue in the current state of knowledge policymakers who must make decisions about the size and composition of federal rd support are sometimes limited to what is known about the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative rd policy tools most economists concur that this much can be ascertained about the effectiveness of the re tax credit and direct federal rd spending first there is some evidence that the credit is as costeffective as direct government spending on rd in raising business rd investment in other words one dollar in revenue cost of the credit is thought to raise this investment as much as an additional dollar of federal research grants one reason for this is that government rd spending might not crowd out privately financed rd spending24 second government rd spending and the re tax credit both appear to have drawbacks that limit their efficiency the preceding discussion has made clear that re tax credit exerts an uneven incentive effect on rd projects and on firms performing or financing qualified research that the credit appears to offer firms too weak an incentive to raise business rd investment to socially optimal levels and that the credit cannot be targeted at projects with the highest ratio of social returns to private returns in addition some critics contend that the re tax credit is wasteful subsidy because there are clear guidelines on the research that qualifies for it and this uncertainty can have the effect of rewarding firms for research with external benefits and research that they would have done in any event25 similarly it has been pointed out that government rd spendin g can have certain effects that may diminish its efficiency effects 1 lessening of privatesector competition to develop technologies targeted for government funding 2 funding decisions that are guided more by political considerations than the potential economic merits of the research 3 government management of research projects that may lack the

and s 951 and special assistance for smaller firms hr 1682 and s 951 permanent extension of the credit total of eight bills in the 106th congress address the credits temporary status the longest period that the credit has been in effect without interruption was the five and onehalf years from july 1 1981 to december 31 1986 moreover the credit was extended for one year on four separate occasions it was extended for thirteen months once for eleven months once and for six months once and the credit has never been available for the period between july 1 1995 to june 30 1996 since the early 1990s chief obstacle to making the credit permanent has been the budget rule requiring the federal government to offset the cost of new permanent tax preferences over five consecutive fiscal years more favorable tax treatment of research consortia three bills in the current congress would liberalize the tax treatment of payments for research performed by joint rd ventures such as sematech

qualified research consortia for qualified research done on behalf of the firm making the payments moreover hr 1328 would alter the definition of qualified research consortium to specify that it must have minimum of fifteen supporting members one of which can account for over 25 of the consortiums annual research budget and hr 1682 and s 951 would redefine qualified research consortium as taxexempt organization whose primary purpose is to conduct scientific or engineering research and that has at least five supporting members one of which can account for over 50 of the annual research budget of the consortium the three bills would likely give firms stronger financial incentive to increase their payments to research consortia under current law the maximum effective rate of the credit for these payments varies from 5 to 10 but under the three bills the rate would rise to flat 20 furthermore because hr 1328 would add this incentive while retaining the terms of the regular re tax credit it would give firms stronger financial incentive to conduct research through research consortia than through their own rd facilities yet it is unclear to what extent firms participating in such consortia would raise their paymen ts to them in response to this enhanced subsidy the re tax credit is one of many factors influencing business rd investment decisions recent growth in us research consortia data on the amount invested in domestic research consortia are scanty and what is available sheds little light on the share of us business rd spending that goes to joint research ventures nonetheless it is clear that since the early 1980s the number of firms participating in us research consortia and the dollars they have spent on basic and applied research have soared one indicator of this trend is the number of joint research ventures registered with the us department of justice doj under the national cooperative research act of 1984 and the natio nal cooperative production amendments act of 1993 by registering firms joining these ventures gain added protection from antitrust lawsuits between 1985 and 1996 total of 665 joint research ventures were registered with 212 of the registrations occurring in 1995 and 199628 and as of late 1998 usbased firms had entered into more than 5000 cooperative rd agreements or cradas with federal laboratories under the federal technology transfer act of 198629 this growth in cooperative rd ventures is the product of number of factors worldwide large and small firms face growing pressure to collaborate with rivalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs27 30roos daniel frank field and james neely industry consortia investing in innovation branscomb lewis m and james h keller eds cambridge ma mit press 1998 p

customers and national and regional governments in the development of new technologies this pressure arises from variety of sources30 one is the rapid pace expanding scope increasing complexity and rising cost of technological innovation in many industries another factor is the globalization of wide range of markets and the increased international competition it brings yet another factor is the growing demands by consumers and governments in advanced economies that technology development achieve certain social or economic objectives such as less industrial pollution or improved productivity or increased safety or security in the use of wide variety of goods and services in addition firms can realize significant concrete benefits from participating in research consortia such as access to expertise and knowledge that otherwise would be unavailable risk pooling cost sharing tax subsidies for research consortia and federal rd policy the legislative proposals to liberalize the tax treatment of payments to research consortia raise certain policy issues one concerns the incentive effect of the proposals granting firms flat 20 credit for payments to research consortia could encourage firms to substitute joint research for their own research leading to net increase in business rd investment another issue relates to the rationale for federal support for joint research ventures these ventures can improve the domestic climate for technological innovation by reducing the mark et failure associated with rd cutting the costs of performing generi c research with promising commercial potential and speeding the diffusion of new technologies31 yet the recent proliferation of research consortia involving usbased firms and federal laboratories calls into question the need for additional federal subsidies for such ventures like the tax incentives proposed in hr 1682s 951 third policy issue linked to the proposals deals with the economic rationale for federal support for rd the expansion of research consortia in the past decade arguably weakens central economic rationale for federal support for research if many or all the firms in an industry collaborate in the conduct of rd it is possible that most of the returns to that rd will be appropriated reducing the need for federal rd subsidies another way to frame this issue is to ask whether industry research consortia partially or fully correct the market failure associated with rd the presence of substantial external benefits the greater the degree of correction the lesser the justification for federal rd subsidies finally economic theory indicates that an incremental tax credit would be more efficient that the flat credit contained in the legislative proposals creation of more beneficial alternative incremental credit identical bills in the house and the senate hr 1682 and s 951 would create new alternative incremental re tax credit that is more beneficial at the margin thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs28 the current re tax credit under the bills the calculation of the proposed alternative credit would be the same as the calculation of the current credit with the following exceptions the base period would be the previous eight tax years or fewer in the case of firms that have been in existence fewer than eight years the fixedbase percentage would be equal to 80 of the ratio of aggregate qualified research spending to aggregate gross receipts in the base period the base amount could be less than 50 of qualified research expenses in the current tax year and gross receipts for all firms established and startup could not fall below 1 million in each year of the base period this proposed alternative credit would address several key policy issues raised by the current credit one was discussed earlier the current credit subsidizes business rd in seemingly arbitrary and inequitable manner abolishing the 50 percent rule and permitting firms to select base periods that reflect their current rd intensity would likely do much to make the credits marginal effective rate more uniform among firms and industries furthermore the proposed credit would offer established and startup firms stronger financial incentive to keep increasing their rd spending than the current regular or alternative credits three aspects of the proposed credit would make it more beneficial at the margin 1 the absence of the 50percent rule under current law 2 the 20 reduction in firms fixedbase percentage under current law and 3 the use of moving base period the probable benefits of this enhanced incentive effect can be seen in the calculations given in the appendix which estimates the re tax credits that two actual pharmaceutical firms merck and cephalon could claim in 1998 under current law and under s 951hr 1682 under current law merck large established and perennially hugely profitable pharmaceutical firm could claim regular credit and an alternative credit of 39 million in 1998 by contrast under s 951hr 1682 merck could claim an alternative credit of 67 million cephalon small startup biopharmaceutical firm which as of 1998 had never earned profit would also be better off under the proposed alternative credit under current law it could claim regular credit of 3 million and an alternative credit of 1 million in 1998 but under s 951hr 1682 it could claim an alternative credit of 6 million another way to illuminate the incentive effect of the proposed alternative credit is to compare the average credit rates for the three re tax credits the average credit rate is defined here as the ratio of the re tax credit claimed to rd spending reported to shareholders in 1998 the estimated average credit rates for merck were 0 for the regular re tax credit 21 for the alternative incremental re tax credit and 37 for the proposed alternative re tax credit and for cephalon the same three rates were 70 25 and 137 the main point to be made here is not to demonstrate that either firm deserves larger tax credit for the rd they perform that issue could be resolved only by estimating and comparing the aftertax private and social rates of return to their rd investments rather it is to compare the credits incentive effect under current law and under the two legislative proposalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs29 32uchitelle louis basic research

for economic development americas basic research prosperity through discovery new york 1998 p 16more favorable tax treatment of basic research expenses the same two bills would also make the tax treatment of basic research expenses more favorable as result they would give firms stronger incentive to conduct basic research the national science foundation estimates that in 1999 firms spent 109 billion on basic research conducted in the united states this amount is 88 more than they spent in 1992 and 27 of all basic research done in the united states in 1999 to encourage firms to spend more on basic research the bills would replace the current incremental basic research credit with flat credit that is equal to 20 of qualified basic research expenses in addition the bills would make basic research in the social sciences eligible for the credit loosen the definition of basic research to cover research whose results are made available to the general public before they are used for commercial purposes and make payments for basic research conducted at federal laboratories eligible for the credit the proposed changes in the tax treatment of basic research expenditures raise severa l policy issues one is perceived need for more generous tax subsidy for business spending on basic research proponents of such subsidy cite recent declines in real business investment in this research to justify their insistence that the federal government take additional steps to encourage firms to invest more in basic research in support of this argument they note that the social returns to this research tend to be relatively large recent trends in real industry spending on basic research lend inconclusive support to this view according to figures published by the national science foundation us industry spent 14 less in constant 1992 dollars for this purpose in 1995 50 billion than in 1992 58 billion but the trend reversed itself between 1995 and 1998 when indus try spending on basic research rose from 50 billion to preliminary 86 billion gain of 72 second policy issue raised by the proposed enhanced tax subsidy for basic research concerns the impact of more generous tax subsidy on business investment for this purpose in the 1990s powerful constraint on this investment was an increased managerial emphasis on funding rd projects that are likely to pay off in three years or less32 arguably this emphasis had its origins in the demise of the cold war and the restructuring of major us firms and the rise of formidable foreign competition that began in the late 1980s and continued through most of the 1990s nowa days firms rely heavily on the public and nonprofit sectors to fund basic research and the basic research they conduct is intended largely to address gaps left over from publicly funded research and further their own product development33 thus it is doubtful that an enhanced tax incentive like the one proposed in hr 1682 and s 951 would be sufficient to trigger surge in business spending on basic researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs30 yet another policy issue is that the proposed liberalized credit for basic research expenses would be flat instead of incremental an argument against flat credit is that it is more likely than an incremental one to subsidize research that firms would do in any event thus in the view of many analysts the more efficient option for giving firms stronger financial incentive to increase their basic research expenditures is to offer more generous incremental re credit special assistance for smaller firms lastly hr 1682 and s 951 would target special assistance to small firms engaged in research specifically they would require the irs to find ways to reduce the cost to small firms of complying with the requirements of the re tax credit and they would create flat 20 tax credit for patent fees paid by small firms in addition the bills would give larger firms tax incentive to enter into research contracts with smaller firms by making the entire amount paid to smaller firms for contract research eligible for the re tax credit these proposals have unearthed several policy concerns some of which have long been associated with the issue of tax subsidies for small firms on the one hand they raise the question of whether such assistance to smaller firms is justified on economic grounds supporters of the two bills contend that the costs associated with applying for patents and complying with the requirements of the re tax credit are especially burdensome for smaller firms and as result they spend much less on rd than they otherwise would this is serious policy issue in their minds because small startup firms are the sources of many valuable technolog ical innovations available evidence bearing on this claim appears to be inconclusive on the other hand the proposals give rise to couple of concerns one is that they would reward some larger firms for doing what they already do perform joint research with smaller startup firms unless it can be shown that these ventures are likely to yield extraordinarily large spillover benefits it is difficult to make cogent economic argument for more generous tax subsidy for joint research between small and large firms another concern is that the proposals fail to address an important financial issue for managers at many small startup firms they are unable to claim the re tax credit during periods when it could substantially boost their cash flow because they are unprofitable and the credit is nonrefundable conclusions government support for business rd can be justified on economic grounds according to standard economic theory when firms invest in rd the total or social returns are likely to far exceed the returns captured by the firms because of this discrepancy firms are likely to invest less in rd than would be warranted by its economic benefits thus in theory economic performance is better when firms receive subsidy that boosts their returns on rd investments to the level of social returns unfortunately in this case economic theory is poor guide for policy because of the formidable problems involved in measuring the social returns to rdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs31 the federal government supports domestic rd in variety of ways direct and indirect one indirect subsidy is tax credit for research and experimentation re under irc section 41 firm may claim tax credit equal to 20 of its spending on qualified research above base amount the credit has an incremental design largely to give firms robust financial incentive to spend more on rd in given year than they otherwise would thereby shrinking the gap between actual and socially desirable levels of business rd investment for firm rd is essentially an investment decision this means that firm is likely to invest in particular rd project if its expected real aftertax rate of return exceeds its real cost of capital the re tax credit seeks to stimulate increased business rd investment by lowering the user cost of capital it appears that the re tax credit can be costeffective instrument for spurring increases in business rd investment several studies have estimated that by the end of the 1980s one dollar of the credit leads firms to raise their spending on rd by approximately one dollar maybe more these results suggest that dollar for dollar the credit is as effective as federal research spending programs in boosting business rd investment nonetheless although the re tax credit apparently has positive effect on business rd investment there is reason to believe that the effect is too modest to generate the level of this investment warranted by its likely economic benefits in 1995 crs report bill cox estimated that the combined effect of the two current rd tax subsidies the expensing allowance for research expenditures and the re tax credit on the aftertax returns variety of hypothetical rd projects fell short of the level of subsidy needed to achieve an optimal amount of business rd investment nevertheless his findings provide little guidance for policymakers about how much larger the rate should be because the social returns to particular business rd project are difficult to estimate and certainly cannot be known in advance the credits incentive effect cannot be tailored to specific projects even if it were possible to do this there is guarantee in advance that firm can use the re tax credits it earns because the credit is not refundable the credit exhibits two other problems that limit its effectiveness as rd subsidy lack of permanence and variable impact among business rd projects and firms performing research the lack of permanence dampens the credits potential for spurring continuing rises in business rd investment by increasing the already substantial uncertainty surrounding the expected returns to prospective rd projects the varied benefit of the credit among firms conducting research and among business research projects appears to lack justification on economic grounds and creates the impression that in its current design the credit subsidizes business rd in an inequitable and arbitrary manner legislation extending the rd tax credit through june 30 2004 hr 1180 pl 106170 was enacted in the first session of the 106th congress in addition total of eight bills pending in the current congress would permanently extend the credit two of these bills s 951 and hr 1682 would also liberalize the tax treatment of payments to research consortia and basic research expenditures and create an alternative re tax credit that is more beneficial at the margin than the current re tax credit these proposals would remove what many analysts see ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs32 significant flaw in the current credit its lack of permanence in addition s 951 and hr 1682 would attempt to increase the current credits incentive effect and to reduce the unevenness of its marginal benefit to firms conducting research and to specific rd projects some see need for the changes in the credit that these proposals would make in fact many of these same critics see need for an re tax credit on the ground that it rewards firms for doing what they must do in any event to remain competitive in domestic and foreign markets and for undertaking resear ch that has little or external benefits to them it constitutes form of corporate welfare that should be repealed nonetheless on economic grounds case can be made for going beyond the measures contained in eight re tax credit bills pending in the current congress at its core is the contention that the price reduction in rd engineered by the current credit is insufficient to expand business rd investment to the socially optimal level the analysis presented here suggests that at least six polic measures might significantly boost the credits incentive effect and thus make it more efficient rd tax subsidy in evaluating their desirability it is important to compare their projected revenue costs with the potential gains in economic output that could arise from the added business rd investment spurred by the measures the suggested measures are as follows raising the statutory rate of the credit to 25 or maybe higher getting rid of or relaxing the 50percent rule getting rid of or easing the basis adjustment expanding the range of expenses that is eligible for the credit clarifying the definition of qualified research in manner that reduces the prospect of prolonged legal disputes between the irs and firms claiming the credit and making the credit refundable especially for smaller newer firms suffering from cash flow troubleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs33 appendix estimation of re tax credits earned by startup firm and an established firm under current law and hr 1682s 951 one approach to evaluating the likely impact of legislative proposal to enhance the re tax credits effectiveness is to estimate the re tax credits that actual firms could claim in recent year under current law and under the proposal in the 106th congress identical bills with that aim have been introduced in the house hr 1682 and the senate s 951 to assess the implications of those proposals for the credits effectiveness this section presents estimates of the credits that two pharmaceutical firms merck co and cephalon inc could claim in 1998 under current law and under hr 1682s 951 basically the two firms were chosen for three reasons 1 they both are based in the united states 2 they both invest heavily in rd relative to sales and 3 for the purpo of claiming the re tax credit merck is an established firm and cephalon startup firm from the standpoint of market power however the two firms could not be more different merck is one of the leading discoverers developers manufacturers and sellers of prescription drugs in the world and for years it has also been one of the most profitable pharmaceutical firms worldwide cephalon by contrast is smaller and younger firm that is dedicated to the discovery development and selling of drugs to treat neurological disorders and certain cancers and had never earned profit as of 1998 table 5 summarizes the results of the comparative analysis in interpreting them it is important to keep in mind the assumptions that undergird them specifically it was assumed that each firms gross receipts were equal to their operating revenues as reported to shareholders and that each firms qualified research expenses were equal to 70 of their rd expenditures as reported to shareho lders these assumptions seem reasonable in view of the fact that the irs defines gross receipts as the gross operating receipts of firms reduced by the cost of returned goods and allowances and that anywhere from 50 to 73 of firms rd expenditures as defined under current financial accounting standards qualify for the re tax credit in addition the calculation of the alternative credits merck and cephalon could claim under current law reflects the terms of the credit as modified by the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 not the terms that were actually in effect in 1998 therefore the estimated tax credits for merck and cephalon shown in the following table should be viewed as approximations of the actual credits the two claimed if any in that year it is unclear what the margin of error is in the estimates the results point to several conclusions first and foremost hr 1682s 951 would be likely to bolster significantly the credits marginal benefit to both established and startup firms performing qualified research for example if the legislative proposals had been in effect in 1998 merck could have claimed an re tax credit that was 71 larger and cephalons credit would have been 100 larger second under current law merck would earn regular re tax credit in 1998 whereas cepahlon could claim regular credit of 31 million on rd budget that was about 98 smaller than mercks given the economic rationale for the credit such an outcome can be deemed undesirable as there is apparent reason why the future economic effects of cephalons rd in 1998 should prove more valuable than thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30479crs34 future economic effects of mercks rd in the same year and third while cephalon earned credits under current law and under the legislative proposals in 1998 it was not able to take advantage of them because it lost money in that year the best it could have done was to carry the credits forward for up to fifteen years table 4 selected financial data for merck co and cephalon inc from 1988 to 1998 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 operating
