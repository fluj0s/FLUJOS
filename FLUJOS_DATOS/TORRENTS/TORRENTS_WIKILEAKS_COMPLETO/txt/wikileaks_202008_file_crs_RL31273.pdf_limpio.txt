summarizes the provisions of these two grant programs and in the final section provides an overview of selected other federal programs that serve these age groups part c requires that states receiving grants create and maintain statewide comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families services focus on children experiencing developmental delay with respect to physical mental or other capacities and their families services are detailed for each child and his or her family in an individualized family service plan ifsp services are to be provided to the maximum extent feasible in natural environments including the home with other infants and toddlers who are not disabled states are required to identify state lead agency which might be the state educational agency sea but could be other state agencies to coordinate the program part c is funded at 417 million for fy2002 section 619 of idea authorizes grants to states for preschool programs serving children with disabilities generally ages 3 to 5 states are eligible for these grants if they are eligible for grants under the part b grants to states and make available free appropriate public education fape to all disabled children ages 3 to 5 in the state in recent years all states qualify and receive preschool grants under this section since part b grants to states are used to serve children with disabilities as young as 3 years of age as well as schoolage children section 619 is not so much separate program as it is supplementary funding for services to this age group in general the provisions requirements and guarantees under the grants to states program that apply to schoolage children with disabilities also apply to children in this age group as result section 619 is relatively brief section of the law which deals mostly with the state and substate funding formulas for the grants and statelevel activities section 619 received 390 million for fy2002 other federal programs provide early childhood services and in some cases may contribute to services for young children with

provisions of these two grant programs and in the final section provides an overview of selected other federal programs that serve these age groups1 the idea infants and toddlers program part c the state grant program for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families was created by pl 99457 in 1986 originally enacted as part h of idea the program is now authorized under part c as result of the consolidation of several other parts of the act into part d by the 1997 amendments pl 10517 the general purpose of part c is to aid each state to create and maintain statewide comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families in many respects the requirements for these statewide systems resemble the requirements under idea part b for special education and related serves for children with disabilities served in school systems however statewide coordinated systems to serve very young children the analog to state educational agencies seas do not exist in all states thus part c differs in some respects from part b in that it helps to create the state structure in which services can be delivered to infants and toddlers with disabilities target populations and services the target populations for the part c program are children under the age of 3 experiencing developmental delay2 in one orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs2 2continued communication socialemotional or adaptive development and to require that appropriate diagnostic assessments are to be used to determine such delays 3us department of education fy2002 budget justifications p h30 4section 6324 5for example under the childcare and development block grant states set sliding scales for parents copayments based on income 6a distinction is made between medical services which are provided by physician for which payments are limited to services related to determining eligibility and health services which are provided by other health professionals and paraprofessionals and for which idea payments are not limited 7ed issued proposed amendments to the part c regulations 65 fr 162 p 5380853869 september 5 2000 one purpose of these proposed regulations was to clarify the interpretation of natural environments in the discussion of the proposed regulations ed points out that while natural environments are the legally preferred settings for providing early intervention services it would be appropr iate under part c of the act and these regulations for given child to receive one or more of the early intervention services in another setting if the childs ifsp team after reviewing the relevant information about the child makes that determination p 53810 ed has withdrawn these proposed regulations 67 fr 7 p 14091410 apparently ed decided to postpone any changes to the regulations until after part c is reauthorizedmore physical mental or social skill areas children diagnosed with physical or mental conditions with high probabilities of resulting in such delays and at the states discretion children at risk of developing such delays according to the us department of education ed about 250000 infants and toddlers are served by the program3 the act has an extensive definition of early intervention services which provides useful overview of what services the statewide systems can provide and how these services should be provided4 these services are required to be provided under public supervision and at cost except where federal or state law provides system of payments by families including schedule of sliding fees5 in general the services must meet the developmental needs of infants and toddlers with disabilities the part c definition of early intervention services permits wide variety of direct and support services that could be provided including family training and home visits special instruction service coordination identification and assessment medical services limited to diagnosis and evaluation and health services6 assistive technology and transportation necessary to benefit from services the definition also includes list of providers ranging from educators and therapists to pediatricians and other physicians analogous to the least restrictive environment requirements of part b part c requires that to the maximum extent feasible services be provided in natural settings or natural environments including the home and in the community with children who are not disabled7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs3 8section 636the specific services for an individual infant or toddler are to be detailed in an individualized family service plan ifsp8 which is analogous to the individualized educational plan iep required under part b for older children with disabilities part c provides extensive details on the nature of the plan the written plan is based on multidisciplinary assessment of the childs strengths and needs and family oriented assessment of the familys resources concerns and priorities multidisciplinary team including the parents develops the plan the plan includes statements of the childs current level of development the familys resources concerns and priorities major expected outcomes for the child and timelines for achieving these outcomes specific services required to meet the childs needs the natural environment in which services will be provided or justification regarding the extent to which services will not be provided in natural environment dates of initiation and duration of services who will be the childs service coordinator who will be directly responsible for implementing the plan and steps to be taken to ensure transition of the child from the program to preschool or other appropriate services overview of requirements for statewide systems like other federal grants programs including part b of idea part c details requirements for states to be eligible for grants states then are required to assure and describe in state applications their procedures for meeting statutory requirements in general to be eligible for part c grant state must make available appropriate early intervention services to all infants and toddlers with disabilities and have statewide system to do so part c specifies that at minimum statewide system must have various components including state definition of developmental delay comprehensive child find system another analogue to part b to identify and refer to service providers potentially eligible children in the state procedures for evaluating each childs needs and the familys concerns and resources an ifsp as discussed above for each child and family policies and procedures to ensure that to the maximum extent possible services are provided in natural environments comprehensive personnel development system to recruit prepare and retain qualified service providers also analogous to part b requirements related to the personnel system the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards to ensure proper training of service providershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs4 9part c also requires federal interagency coordinating council 10see section 615 11section 639a lead state agency identified by the governor to provide overall oversight of the system and coordinate with other state federal local and private programs that serve disabled infants and toddlers creation of state interagency coordinating council appointed by the governor composed of various individuals such as parents and representatives of relevant state agencies9 and policies ensuring procedural safeguards discussed below to be eligible state must have an approved state application that among other things provides assurances that the requirements for the statewide system are fulfilled unless there are changes in law regulation or interpretation of law or regulations states application submitted under part h may still fulfill this requirement of part c overview of procedural safeguards like part b10 part c guarantees certain rights for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families11 however part cs procedural safeguards are described as minimum procedures for statewide systems and are not as detailed as those for schoolag ed children under part b in addition to the right of parents to be involved in the ifsp discussed above part c guarantees the right of confidentiality of personally identifiable information the right to accept or refuse some services without jeopardizing the right to other services the opportunity to examine records procedures to ensure the childs rights if parents are unknown or unavailable the right of written prior notice of decisions to change services or the place where services are provided the right of parents to be fully informed in their native language and the right to mediation as provided under part b parental disputes are to be resolved administrativel in timely manner like part b part c provides any party in disagreement with an administrative resolution the right to bring civil action in the appropriate state court or in us district court finally like part b the childs services and placements continue while dispute is being resolved unless the state agency and the parents agree otherwise selected additional provisions of part c by reference to sections 616 617 and 618 of part b part c grants certain powers and responsibilities to the secretary and extends certain part b state information requirements to part c grantees section 616 empowers the secretary to withhold grant funds as result of state or local failure to comply with requirements of part c section 616 also provides states with the right of federal judicial review of the secretarys decision with respect to the states eligibility under idea section 617 grants the secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs5 12for an overview of the maternal and child health block grant see crs report 97350 maternal and child health block grant by sharon kearney for an overview of the medicaid program see crs report rs20245 medicaid fact sheet by jean hearnethe right to issue regulations and to hire personnel to assist in carrying out duties under the act the section also requires that the secretary provide technical assistance to the states in providing special education and complying with the act section 618 requires states receiving grants to provide the secretary with certain information and data on children served under the act part c requires that funds under the part be used for the most part as payor of last resort the basic principle is that part c funds should not be used to pay for services that otherwise would have been provided from other public or private source if part c did not exist the exception is that part c funds may be used initially to ensure prompt services under the assumption that these funds will be reimbursed by the agency with ultimate responsibility for providing the services part c explicitly prohibits states to use part c funding to reduce medical or other assistance for or to alter eligibility of infants and toddlers with disabilities available under the maternal and child health act block grant or under medicaid12 funding and allocations to states as table 1 shows compared to the overall funding for idea funding for part c has grown relatively modestly between fy1997 and fy2002 increasing by total of about 32 although funding has grown faster than funding for the preschool program overall idea funding more than doubled during this period due mainly to increases in funds for the part b grants to states program as result funding for part c today accounts for smaller share of total idea funding 48 than it did in fy1997 78

education provisions act gepa for fy1998 the acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs6 13at current appropriations levels the minimum state grant under part c is based on 05 of the total allocation for fy2002 this amount is about 2 million twelve states currently receive this minimum grant amount 14section 619a2 permits states to serve children as young as 2 years of age under part b if they will turn 3 during the school year 15at the states discretion children experiencing developmental delay as defined by the state with respect to for example physical cognitive social or emotional development may be included as children with disabilities eligible for services 16for brief overview of the provisions of part b see crs report rl31259 idea provisions the part b requirements for preschool programs do not completely parallel the requirements for schoolage children with disabilities for example the ieps for all children covered by part b must assess the childs present level of academic performance for school age children with disabilities these assessments are made with respect to the general curriculum in the school this benchmark may not be appropriate for preschool programs so the benchmark for preschool children with disabilities is the childs participation in appropriate activities section 614d1aiii the requirement of the least restrictive environment applies to serving preschool children with disabilities as it does to services to continuedauthorized 400 million the act authorizes such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years through fy2002 the act permits the secretary of education to reserve up to 1 of funds appropriated for part c for outlying areas guam american samoa the virgin islands and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and 125 of appropriations for payments by the secretary of the interior to tribes and other entities providing services to indian infants and toddlers with disabilities the actual reservation for the outlying areas for fy2002 is about 077 of the remainder the secretary is directed to allocate to the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico amounts in proportion to each states share of children under the age of 3 except state shall receive less than the state minimum grant of 05 of the amount allocated to states or 500000 whichever is the greater amount if funds are sufficient13 if funds are insufficient the secretary is required to ratably reduce funds to all states there is substate formula because the state through the lead agency may contract with service providers as well as provide direct services and coordinating services provided by other state entities the idea preschool program section 619 section 619 of idea authorizes grants to states for preschool programs serving children with disabilities ages 3 to 514 states are eligible for these grants if they are eligible for grants under the part b grants to states and make available free appropriate public education fape to all disabled children ages 3 to 5 in the state15 currently all states qualify and receive preschool grants under this section since part b grants to states are used to serve children with disabilities as young as 3 years of age as well as schoolage children section 619 is not so much separate program as it is supplementary funding for services to this age group in general the provisions requireme nts and guarantees under the grants to states program that apply to schoolage children with disabilities also apply to children in this age group16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs7 16continued schoolage children to the maximum extent possible these children must be served with their nondisabled peers however this does not require that state provide free public education to all preschool children in order to meet this requirement the least restrictive environment lre can be met by serving disabled preschoolers in variety of settings including public or private preschool programs regular kindergarten head start programs or childcare facilities us department of education budget justifications for fy2002 p h21 17according to the fy2002 ed budget justifications p h24 about twothirds of the states and outlying areas use funds from the grants to states program to serve preschoolers with disabilities 18for further information see crs report rl30810 individuals with disabilities education act idea issues regarding full funding of part b grants to states by richard n apling 19the act specifies that the secretary shall allocate remaining funds after reserving funds for studies and evaluations under section 674e which permits the secretary to reserve up to onehalf of 1 from funds for parts b and c to carry out studies and evaluation and limits this amount once it reaches 20 million to amounts based on inflationadjusted increases in recent years the secretary has reserved somewhat less than 20 million for these purposes apparently all of this reserve is taken from appropriations for part b grants to states thus the secretary allocates the total appropriation for section 619 to the states 20section 619 defines state as the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico there is set aside for outlying areas such as american samoa or the us virgin islands section 619 requires the secretary to increase the 1998 allotments for outlying areas under section 611 the grants to states program by the amount they received in fy1997 under section 619 according to the house report accompany the bill hr 5 the intent is to continuedas result section 619 is relatively brief section of the law which deals mostly with the state and substate funding formulas for the grants and statelevel activities funding for section 619 appropriations are permanently authorized for section 619 under section 619j which authorizes 500 million for fy1998 and such sums thereafter as table 1 above indicates funding for section 619 has been relatively stable since fy1997 funding for preschool grants grew from 360 million in that fiscal year to 390 million for fy2002 about an 82 increase during the same period funding for idea overall more than doubled from about 4 billion to nearly 87 billion most of this increase occurred in the part b grants to states program the schoolage program under idea as result section 619 funding which accounted for about 89 of total idea funding in fy1997 makes up about 45 of total fy2002 funding it should be noted that although funding for the preschool program has been relatively stable overall federal funding for preschool children with disabilities probably has grown more substantially in some states because funds provided under the grants to states program can also be used to serve children in this age group17 state and substate formulas the state and substate formulas for section 619 are similar to those for the part b grants to states program18 the act directs the secretary of education to allocate funds19 if funds for that fiscal year are greater than funds for the preceding fiscal year to states20 based on the following principleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs8 20continued eliminate funding for the outlying areas under the preschool grants program and add an amount equivalent to the amount they received in fiscal year 1997 to the fiscal year 1998 allocations the outlying areas would otherwise receive under the grants to states program this would maintain overall funding for the outlying areas while eliminating paperwork associated with their allocations under the preschool grants program which is unduly burdensome for the outlying areas given the nominal amount of funding involved hrept 10595 p 115 21this provision differs from the grants to states formula which had trigger appropriation for the new formula the trigger for that formula was exceeded in fy2000 thus the base grant for the part b grants to states formula is each states fy1999 grant 22for example if overall appropriations were to grow by 20 from one fiscal year to the next state grant increases would most likely fall between 185 2015 and 215 20 15 23the base amount for the state setaside was 25 of the fy1997 grant since appropriations have grown relatively minimally since fy1997 and not at all in the last 3 fiscal years states setaside amounts presumably have changed very littleeach state first receives the amount it received in 1997 when the program was last substantially revised as base grant21 85 of remaining funds are allocated to states based on states shares of population ages 3 to 5 15 of remaining funds are allocated based on states shares of all children ages 3 to 5 living in poverty these initial allocations are then adjusted to ensure that state receives less than series of hold harmless and minimum amounts and that state receives more than maximum grant amount major limit on how much state gains when funds increase from one year to the next year is that grant increase is more than the percentage growth in overall appropriations plus or minus 15 percentage points22 since overall appropriations for the preschool grants have increased only modestly since fy1997 most of the amounts for subsequent fiscal years are based on the 1997 grant amounts which in turn were based on numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 in the various states in addition since appropriations have not changed over the last 3 fiscal years state grants have remained unchanged states are allowed to reserve certain amounts from their grants for administration and other statelevel activities the secretary calculates and reports these amounts to each state the overall amount for each state is calculated by increasing the states prior year amount by the rate of inflation or the percentage increase from the prior year in the states overall section 619 grant whichever is less23 the state may use not more than 20 of the reserve for administering the grant the remaining 80 of the reserve is used for other statewide activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31273crs9 24leas are eligible if they are eligible under the part b grants to states as established by section 613 25these systems are more fully described in section 613f with respect to local eligibility under the grant to state program major purpose of these systems is to coordinate services provided under idea with services provided under other relevant federal programs such as vocational rehabilitation and medicaid the state may use not more than 1 of its grant for this purposethe state allocates the remaining amount after subtracting the reserve for state activities to eligible local educational agencies leas24 based on formula similar to the federaltostate formula first the state determines base grant for each lea based on what the lea would have received under the priorlaw version of section 619 as if the state had allocated 75 of its grant to the local level 85 of the remaining funds are allocated based on each leas share of public and private school enrollment in the leas jurisdiction the remaining 15 is allocated based on each leas share of children in poverty as determined by the state and there are minimum or maximum lea grant amounts statelevel activities as noted above states are limited to using 20 of the stateactivities reserve for administrating section 619 this includes coordination with and providing technical assistance to other programs providing services to children with disabilities if the state educational agency sea is the lead agency for the part c program see above administrative funds from section 619 may also be used for administering that program section 619 directs states to use the remaining reserved funds for support services for children with disabilities certain direct services for preschool children with disabilities development of state improvement plan as required under subpart 1 of part d activities related to performance goals required for all of part b under section 612a16 and development and implementation statewide coordinated services system25 characteristics of children served according to ed nearly 600000 children with disabilities are being served by the preschool grants program participation in the program grew rapidly during the early and mid 1990s from about 370000 to its current level presumably as result of more states qualifying for and taking advantage of the program more recently growth in participation has leveled off for example ed reported an increase of 25 in 2000 over the prior year ed reports the following breakdown of preschoolers with disabilities 55 are children with speech or language impairments 12 have
