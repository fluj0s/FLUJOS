rates sufficient to provide full employment for labor and capital with low inflation or stable price level has been an important goal for economic policy money and monetary policy have figured importantly in achieving this goal currently it is argued central bank independence is important to achieving this end many small factors contribute to central bank independence and so the literature does not yield consistent definition of it rather the emphasis is on three aspects of independence the degree to which 1 the governing board of the central bank is isolated from the political process 2 central banks can refuse to finance government budget deficits and 3 price stability has primacy as the ultimate goal of central bank activity various indices of central bank independence have been compiled and used in empirical work to see how closely independence is related to such important performance characteristics of an economy as the rate of inflation the growth of output investment and real interest rates for industrial countries central bank independence indices embodying definitions 2 and 3 appear to be closely related to low inflation an d low variability of inflation without having any effect on output and its variability investment and real interest rates in particular factor 2 seems to be driving the results and the various measures of factor 1 have negligible effect finding that the authors tend to neglect since the federal reserve cannot directly finance the us government factor 2 is not an issue for congre ss however the results obtained with an index embodying 3 are of relevance to the conduct of monetary policy in the united states these results may be used to support efforts to redefine the objective of monetary policy to focus it exclusively on price stability critics of these studies point to three major methodological problems and one empirical problem first causation may be opposite to that posited the desire for economic stability for example may lead to independent central banks thus causation should run the other way around or it may run in both directions second central bank independence may arise because an important and influential constituency in democratic society favors low inflation thus the ultimate reason why inflation is low in some countries is the strength of important constituencies who favor low inflation and these studies fail to measure this pressure in sense they have captured only the proximate reason for low inflation not the ultimate reason third questions have been raised about the way that the authors transform nonnumeric characteristics of independence into quantitative results finally the data on which some of these empirical estimates are based are tainted in the sense that the samples comming observations from the fixed and flexible exchange rate periods the performance of central banks is quite different in each regime regardless of how its stated objective reads this report will be

economy growing at rate compatible w ith the full utilization of resources over the long run in an environment in which price inflation is stable has been an ageold goal for macroeconomic policy monetary policy and the institutional arrangements for carrying it out have long been regarded as important to achieving this goal such has been the importance accorded money in this respect that numerous monetary arrangements and policies have been proposed which if adopted their proponents argue would make such goal attainable these arrangements include the gold standard the real bills doctrine compensated dollar 100 reserve requirement banking fixed growth rate rule for the money supply bimetallic standard currency board free floating exchange rates and inflation targeting to name but few in what professor stanley fischer has called the unending search for monetary salvation 1 the current policy prescription in fashion among economists that promises to promote such goal is termed central bank independence hereafter cbi which although it has several possible definitions has come increasingly to focus on institutional arrangements as well as the central banks mandate and ability to focus single mindedly on the attainment of price stability2 the high inflation in the western world in general during the 1970s and the difference in the inflation experience of individual industrial countries which were on the whole subjected to similar external economic shocks motivated some economists to investigate the possible linkage between the rate of inflation and the institutional and political arrangements governing the establishment and functioning of central banks major conclusion of these studies is that cbi is an important part of the explanation for why some countries have had much lower inflation rates on average than others the more independent the central bank these studies conclude the lower tend to be the average rate of inflation and volatility of inflation experienced by that country the reason for these results is that independence supposedly enhances the credibility of the central bank and increased credibility gives rise to reinforcing behavior via the expectations of economic agents be they consumers suppliers of labor and capital or firms supplying output thus shifts in central bank policy are transmitted more rapidly into changes in wages interest rates and prices and thus output and employment than would be the case in the absence of strong credibility minority of the studies even claims that the better governance lower inflation and greater macroeconomic stability provided by cbi have positive effect on economic growth 3 some newer studies question the methodology underlying these results and claim that the relationship between inflation and cbi is weaker than the early studies found the evidence is mixed on whether central bank independence has cost in terms of lower output growth or greater output variability these empirical studies have not gone unnoticed by policy makers in some ways the federal reserve is more independent than many of its peers in other ways it is less for example some studies have defined price stability goal as hancing independence and there has been periodic 1 see stanley fischer the unending search for monetary salvation nber macroeconomic annual edited by b

especially high inflation although the inflation experience of individual countries is by means similar even though they were as group subjected to similar range of external economic shocks especially the two major increases in world oil prices the differences in average inflation rates among these nations motivated number of economists to investigate the possible role played by the institutional and political arrangements governing the establishment and functioning of central banks since increases in the supply of money are an essential element in explaining inflation 6 t able 1 v era ge ann

national inflation rates they did so for one of two reasons accordin g to the theoretical literature that was developed at the time an inflationary bias on the part of cbs was attributed either to requirement that they provide government with revenue via the inflation tax or to desire on the part of the government to reduce unemployment through monetary surprise or unanticipated shock since the united states government derives very little revenue from the inflation tax any inflation bias on the part of the federal reserve must be attributed to desire by the government to reduce unemployment it is widely believed that short run tradeoff exists between inflation and unemployment known as the phillips curve the ability of monetary policy to reduce unemployment in the short run is well known fact amply demonstrated in the united states and elsewhere it is generally attributed by economists to the shift in policy being surprise or unexpected event since anticipated monetary changes would have been incorporated into wage and price expectations since it is also widely believed by economists that the employment effects of such monetary surprises are only temporary their longer run consequence is higher inflation rate 7 hence central banks that try to exploit the tradeoff described by the phillips curve for whatever reason will impart an inflationary bias to their national economies8 from an economic point of view cycles produced by monetary surprises are suboptimal and this serves to underpin policy designed to create and fortify bank central independence devoted to stability cbi proponents believe that independent central banks were less likely to attempt to exploit the phillips curve tradeoff and would provide their economies with lower inflation rates as result g22g145g142g561g15g142g157g145g152g141g152g149g152g144g162g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g21g157g158g141g146g142g156g561 the basic methodology of the academic studies involves the use of linear regression which is statistical technique that attempts to estimate mathematically how important central bank independence and various parameters of that independence are to such important indicators of 7 this suggests that the longer run phillips curve is ver ticalthat permanent tradeoff exists between unemployment and the rate of inflation 8 it is believed by some that such bias exists in the ited states theory of political business cycles has come into existence and claims that the us government has influenced federal reserve policy such that prosperous economic conditions

the major studies that have attempted to measure cbi with an objective of constructing ranking of cbs by the degree of their measured independence begin by looking at the legal provisions of their charters they do so because the charter is supposed to set forth what its framers intended thus the charter usually specifies the policy objective or objectives of the cb the procedure for the appointment of the gover nor or governing body of the cb the period of tenure of these officials the conditions under which they can be removed the procedures for resolving conflicts between cb officials and political authorities and the monetary instruments under the control of the cb g4g138g141g142g561g138g151g141g561g18g138g155g148g146g151g561g507g343g351g350g347g508g561 bade and parkin

the following 1 government approves the budget of the cb determines the board members salaries and the allocation of its profits 2 the cb determines its own budget allocations but the government determines the board members salaries and the allocation of its profits 3 the cb determines its budget and board members salaries while the allocation of its profits are determined by statute or 4 the

hereafter gmt construct two cbi indexes which distinguish between the political and economic independence of cbs 12 they define political independence to mean the ability of the cb to define its policy objectives free from government influence any institutional or legal feature or custom that enhances this ability increases the political independence of the cb economic independence is defined to mean that the cb has the freedom to choose the instruments with which to pursue its final goal or goals their index of political independence gives equal weight to eight factors the maximum score central bank can obtain is eight which requires yes answer to each question such score suggests highly independent cb according to gmt the eight questions are 1 is the ceo of the cb appointed by body other than the government 2 is the ceos term more than five years 3 are the other governing board members appointed by body other than the government 4 are their terms for more than five years 5 is there an absence of mandatory provisions for government representatives to serve on the governing board 6 is there an absence of requirement that the government must approve monetary policy 7 is there provision that the cb pursues goal of price stability 12 vittorio grilli donato masciandaro and guido tabellini political and monetary institutions and public financial policies in the industrial

conflicts with the government they give the us federal reserve score of 5 out of possible 8 the reason being that answers are given to the first three questions both the german and dutch cbs get rating of 6 the highest while the swiss cb gets 5 seven factors each also given an equal weight are used to measure the degree of economic independence and they are heavily dependent on the degree to which the cb is obliged to finance government budgets briefly five of the seven factors are the degree to which direct credit to the government is not automatic given at market interest rates for temporary periods of time and in limited amounts whether the cb does not participate in the primary market for public debt and whether the cb can set its own discount rate the other two factors are related to the regulatory obligations of the cb according to this index the federal reserve obtains score of 7 as do the cbs of switzerland germany and canada

of indexes has been developed in several papers by cukierman cukierman webb and neyapti hereafter cwn and cukierman and webb13 the first index these authors compile consists of 16 legal characteristics taken from cb charters and involves both political and economic factors these sixteen characteristics are in turn grouped into four clusters related to the appointment dismissal and legal term of the cbs ceo the institutional location of the final authority for monetary policy and procedures for resolving conflicts between the cb and government the degree to which price stability is the primary objective of policy and the limits that restrict government from borrowing from the cb the individual components are not equally weighted and each countrys cb receives an overall rating in the index that falls between 0 and 1 it is possible to separate this complex index into various subindexes that correspond closely to the distinction made by gmt between political and economic independence separation that is in fact made by cwn for computation purposes the united states ranks as the fifth most independent bank on their index out of 21 advanced economies the germans and swiss are most independent in their index as well areas in which the united states is ranked as lacking independence include the relatively short term of the chairman the executive branchs ability to unconditionally dismiss the feds chairman the multiple goals of fed policy the feds lack of influence over the government budget process and the feds ability to buy government securities on the primary market it is useful to note that while several of these factors are legally allowed they are unlikely to ever occur in practice this is drawback of indices based on the legal codestatute may not correspond with practice the legal nature of the charter may not be the ultimate measure of cbi in the words of prof cukierman the basic objective difficulty in characterizing and measuring cb independence is that it is determined by multitude of legal institutional cultural and personal factors many of 13 see alex cukierman central bank strategy credibility and independence theory and

to the general public hence cwn compile second index based on survey of the opinion of monetary experts in cbs about the true nature of the independence of their institutions14 as third cbi index cwn use the turnover ra of cb ceos and cukierman and webb use such an index in political context relating turnover to major political changes this index is thought to be more illustrative in the developing world since frequent turnover in the advanced economies is rare g6g142g139g142g149g149g142g561g138g151g141g561g8g146g156g140g145g142g155g561g507g343g351g351g346g508g561 debelle and fischer df disagree semantically with the cbi literature and devise their own variation on the gmt index15 recall that one aspect of gmts definition of political independence is the presence of price stability goal df argue that defining price stability goal as enhancing independence is inconsistent by imposing strict and measurable goal on the central bank the government restricts the cbs latitude to shape monetary policy as it sees fit put another way if the cb decided that temporarily directing monetary policy at growth rather than inflation was in the nations interest under price stability goal it would not be independent to pursue that goal the rest of the literature with the exception of df argues that price stability goal enhances independence by giving the cbs an institutional buffer against political interference in pursuit of monetary surprises nevertheless the definition of price stability goal as an aspect of political independence is wellestablished and consistently used in the cbi literature and will be adhered to in this report because of their disagreement with gmt df create their own cbi index consisting of three parts they use political independence index based on the gmt definition of political independence excluding the price stability goal the price stability goal is placed in its own index called goal independence in contrast to the rest of the literature they define cb as having goal independence if there is price stability goal and lacking goal independence if price stability is the sole goal of monetary policy they make effort to measure other factors that could deprive cb of goal independence such as fixed exchange rate regime although they acknowledge that such factors would have that effect the third part of the db index is referred to as instrument independence they describe instrument independence as meaning that the cb can achieve its ultimate goal or goals in any way it chooses whether the government or the cb s assigned those goals thus for example it could exercise discretion in how rapidly the money supply was permitted to grow or it could fix interest rates at whatever level it thought was ne cessary it would not be obliged to finance the government common constraint on many central banks follow fixed rule for increasing the money supply keep interest rates low or maintain fixed exchange rate 16 they use gmts 14 limitation of this index is that it applies only to the decade of the 1980s whereas the index computed from their analysis of the legal charters of the cbs is available on an aggregate and decade by decade basis for the period 19501989 15 see guy debelle and stanley fischer how independent should central bank be in j fuhrer editor goals guidelines and constraints facing monetary policymakers federal reserve bank of boston conference series 38 1994 pp 195225 16 there has been longstanding debate among economists over whether monetary policy should be conducted on the basis of discretion or rules in broader sense the desirab ility of central bank independence must be seen in the context of this debate

regulatory duties as their measure of instrument independence curiously this measure of instrument independence relates to only two of the factors they mention the cbs freedom to set interest rates and the absence of requirement that the cb finance the governments budget deficit while goal and instrument independence as well as political and economic independence are conceptually distinct there are circumstances in which if one is mandated the other is mandated as well one could not for example impose goal of price stability on cb while simultaneously imposing on it requirement to finance government budget deficit it would also be illogical to impose on cb the requirement that it keep the money supply growing at constant percent per year or to keep the exchange rate constant visavis

not comprehensive but focuses on few of the key papers in depth to give flavor for the literature as whole it concludes with the results of two literature reviews that give an overview of the literatures general findings g4g138g141g142g561g138g151g141g561g18g138g155g148g146g151g561g507g343g351g350g347g508g561 bp used both their financial and policy indexes compiled for 12 cbs and covering the period 19551983 in their pioneering study of the effect of cbi on inflation the major conclusion of this study is stated by parkin in studying the relationship between central bank types and inflation performance it was discovered that just one of the central bank categories stands out as delivering significantly differentand lowerinflation than the others this is policy type 4central banks that are independent in the two senses that the central bank is the final monetary authority and has power to make some of the board appointments germany and switzerland differences in financial types are in significant way associated with differences in inflation performance and variations over the first three policy types are also associated with significant differences in inflation behavior 17 the study established that switzerland and germany the only two policy type 4 countries have an average inflation rate that was less than half as high as the other 10 countries in their sample while these results are interesting and served to kind research in this topic they should be read with great care in establishing their results bp commingle observations from two different international exchange rate regimes the relevance of this factor is discussed in the methodological criticisms section below

and economic independence as defined above for each of the 18 countries listed in table 1 18 the scatter of observations for each measure of independence becomes the data set for the two independent vari ables used in their regressions the dependent variable is the average inflation rates for these same countries individual regressions are computed on data averaged over the decades of the 1950s 1960s 1970s and 1980s and for the entire period 19501989 they find that their measure of economic independence is inversely related to average inflation rates in statistically significant way during the decade of the 1970s and 1980s and over the entire period 19501989 political independence is inversely related to inflation over all four periods and the entire period but it is only statistically significant over the decade 19701979 17 michael parkin domestic monetary institutions and deficits in deficits edited by buchanan rowley and tollison basil blackwell london 1986 p 321 18 see vittorio

degree of central bank independence is negatively related to the average rate of inflation in statistically significant way monetary institutions matter although this general conclusion may be true the gmt results must be interpreted carefully those from the entire period 19501989 are of questionable value because like the bade and parkin results they are derived from data taken from two quite different international exchange rate regimes the bretton woods regime of fixed exchange rates and the subsequent era of floating exchange rates for discussion see the section on methodological criticisms it is interesting in this respect that the gmt results show that neither economic nor political independence is statistically significant in explaining the inflation performance of the 16 countries in their sample during the decades 19501959 and 19601969 this is what one might reasonably expect during the fixed exchange rate era contrary to the conclusion of the authors the results for 19701979 and 19801989 suggest that the inflation performance of these countries is not so much related to the policy goal and methods of choosing cb governors and their terms of office their measure of political independence as it is to the requirement that the cb not be used to finance the governments budget deficit their measure of economic independence the political independence variable is not statistically significant for the 19801989 period and is only weakly significant for the 19701979 period 19 thus regardless of the cbs degree of political independence countries that maintain reasonable budget balance or have good prospects of financing their budget deficits from private saving may remove the pressures from their cbs making it possible for the cbs to concentrate monetary policy on achieving low inflation20 one aspect of the gmt inflation cb independence results is of interest they are able to explain high proportion of the difference in the inflation experience of their sample group of countries with their central bank independence variables for the decades of the 1970s and 1980s the r squared ranged from 66 to about 75 and for the period 19501989 nearly 8 the reason this result is interesting is that increases in the supply of money are widely acknowledged to be the proximate cause of inflation since continuous rise in the price level the essence of inflation is generally only possible with continuous rise in money growth relative to the growth of output if the degree of central bank independence is the ultimate cause of inflation 19 being weakly significant means that one is willing to set the risk of accepting as true false hypothesis at something above 5 chances in 100 20 the conclusions of the gmt study are derived from comparison of data over number of years on their measures of central bank independence and various measures of economic performance this same conclusion on the relationship of central bank independence and the control of inflation has been derived from considering several episodes of hyperinflation each of the episodic studies cited below concluded that an important reason for the successful stabilization of the affected economies was provision in the stabilization law that central banks not be used to finance governments and the faithful adherence by these governments to that law see thomas sargent the end

adduced by some other investigators reported below is not this strong final aspect of their work that has attracted attention is that central bank independence has adverse effects on the crucial

same central bank to produce the as index of central bank independence the us federal reserve rates 3 on the bp policy index 12 on the combined gmt index and 35 on the as index22 alesina and summers use sample of 16 developed countries virtually the same sample as that in table 1 with data spanning the period 19551988 they conclude the monetary discipline associated with central bank independence reduces the level and variability of inflation but does not have either large benefits or costs in terms of real macroeconomic performance 23 24 these conclusions are drawn from series of scatter diagrams one for each measure of economic performance the variable common to each scatter diagram is their cbi index the index they use as explained above is combination of the bp policy index and the sum of both of the gmt indexes converted to bp scale of 1 to 4 as with the previous study it is possible to argu that the conclusions drawn by as are at best tentative in nature this is so for several reasons first these results are established by looking at scatter diagrams there is attempt to control for other factors that could be driving the results 21 see alesina alberto and summers lawrence h central bank independence and macroeconomic performance some comparative evidence journal of money credit and banking vol 25 2 may 1993 pp 151162 some of the empirical work in this paper is based on the update of the bp index made by alesina to include additional countries see his macroeconomics and politics in nber macroeconomics annual for 1988 edited by stanley fischer cambridge mit press 1988 pp 1752 22 these various indexes are highly correlated with each other work by posen shows that the rank correlation coefficients of the bp gmt converted to bp scale and the as indexes to the cukierman index are respectively 65 62 and 62 on scale of 1 to 1 see adam posen central bank independence and disinflationary credibility missing link federal reserve bank of new york staff reports 1 may 1995 p 34 23 meaning that cbi has little or effect on average real gnp growth the variance of real gnp growth average per capita gnp growth the variance of per capita real gnp growth average unemployment the variance of unemployment the average real interest rate and the variance of real interest rates while these findings suggest longer run relationship between cbi and these measures of performance the finding of posen 1988 see below is of interest cbi apparently does not lead to an improved disinflation performance 24 this latter finding is important because it supports f undamental proposition of economics the socalled neutrality of money this is the view that changes in the growth rate of money can affect real variables such as income growth and unemployment in the short run while in the longer run it affects only the rate at which the price level and nominal wages rise and the level of market interest rates

statistically significant is presented even if they are significant there is evidence presented about the importance of cbi to the measures of economic performance25 second the data are averaged across exchange rate regimes as noted above the constraints placed on cb behavior by fixed exchange regime are quite different from those placed by flexible rate regime third since as use the combined gmt index and gmts measure of economic independence dominates that index their results may be showing that constraint placed on cb financing of government is the important factor explaining the behavior of their measures of ec onomic performance more so than those elements for example that are designed to isolate the governing boards of cbs from political interference it may well be misstatement to conclude as they do that greater cbi is conducive to low inflation without any deleterious effect on other characteristics of economic performance more qualified statement focusing on constraints placed on cb lending to governments may be more consistent with their evidence g5g158g148g146g142g155g150g138g151g496g561g25g142g139g139g496g561g138g151g141g561

those for industrial and those for developing countries the group of industrial countries is similar to those listed in table 1 and used by bp gmt and as the results reported below are only for the industrial subsample of central banks the data apply to combined period running from 1950 to 198926 the first test uses linear regression to explain the inflation behavior among the industrial countries in which the major explanatory variables are the disaggregated components of their first or legal cbi index and the turnover rate of cb ceos their third index27 fearful that statutory cbi measured by their index may not be honored in practice they hypothesize that the turnover rate for the central banks ceo may give an indication of cbi in practice28 not single variable 25 the authors rely on scatter diagramsthey do not compute regressions for that reason we do not know if the relationship between cbi and inflation is statistically significant that is we do not know if the variance in the relationship renders it indistinguishable from zero we also have r2 measure it may be for example that their measure of cbi is statistically significant in explaining th inflation behavior of these countries but that it only explains very small part of that behavior 26 although their study covers both the floating and fixed exchange rate regimes in sense this factor is controlled for by including variables to capture differences in each decade 27 actually cwn do not use the inflation rate as the variable whose behavior they try to explain rather they use transformed variable that represents the rate of depreciation of money the reason is that an average inflation rate for group of countries can be distorted if one or several countries have very high inflation rates 28 this approach is further explored in cukierman and webb 1995 the approach in this study is to judge political influence by how closely political transitio ns of various types are related to the frequency and timing of changes in the ceos of central banks given various assumptions about the length of time in which this occurs cukierman and webb compute an index of the nonpolitical turnover of the ceo in addition an index of cb political vulnerability is also computed the data cover large number of countries during the period 19501989 unfortunately they do not run separate regressions for industrial and developing countries they do try to control for developing countries by using technique to enter them as separate independent variable for the entire group of countries they find that both of the new indexes have positive effect on the transformed inflation rate see above for an explanation as well as its variability they also find that the fixed exchange rate period had negative effect on the inflation rate which is statistically significant the overall r 2 for these regressions ranged from 34 to 41 they also find that their two new measures of cb independence yield mixed results in explaining real economic growth the results depend on the index and the size of the sample only the vulnerability index affects real continued

from zero at conventional 1 to 5 levels of significance however when the measure of legal independence is entered in its aggregated form it is statistically significant while the index of ceo turnover is not at conventional levels29 this tells us that for industrial countries the rate of inflation experienced by the group is negatively related to cwns measure of cbi that is derived from the legal aspect of the banks charters the r 2s for these regressions are in the 25 to 35 range as the authors conclude laws do make difference but what laws do they have in mind those that ensure that the banks governors are independent from political influence or those that circumscribe lending by the cb to the government or various firms and enterprises or both actually it turns out to be those associated with lending to the government cwn take from the legal index those components pertaining to limits on cb lending to the government or to various firms and enterprises this subindex is similar to the gtb index of economic independence after additional regressions they conclude that this subindex drives the result for the industrial countries the other components of the legal independence variable ceo policy formation and objectivesdo not make any significant contribution to explaining inflation in industrial countries in this regard their findings are similar to those of gbt for smaller sample of developed countries unfortunately they provide neither the coefficient value of this variable nor the r 2 of the equation they do tell us that the variable is statistically significant however as an additional test cwn explore what relati onship exists between inflation variability or uncertainty and cbi30 for the industrial countries neither the aggregated legal cb index or the turnover rate of cb ceos is statistically significant at conventional 1 to 5 levels of significance the basic study by cwn has been extended by cukierman kalaitzidakis summers and webb to investigate the effect of central bank independence on other performance indicators of the economy output growth investment and real interest rates they find that neither the legal independence index nor the index of cb ceo turnover helps explain the variations in growth rates over the period 19651989 within this group of industrial countries they do find however that the legal independence index has significant negative effect on the variability of real interest rates and if ireland is excluded from the sample significantly positive effect on the level of real interest rates the last result is contrary to expectations the authors speculate that it continued interest rates the r2 however is only 005 see alex cukierman and steven b webb political influence on the central bank international evidence the world bank economic review vol 9 3 1995 pp 397423 29 it may seem curious that disaggregated components of an index may not be statistically significant when each is treated as an independent variable yet they can still be significant when combined and entered as single independent variable this may happen if the individual components of an index are themselves highly correlated an assumption of linear regression is that the independent variables are not themselves correlated when they are the statistical significance of the individual independent variables can be reduced problem known as multicollinearity if serious the variables can appear to be statistically insignificant when th ey are in fact statistically significant this is apparentl what has occurred here 30 generally economists suppose that more variable inflation rate is correlated with higher inflation rates and more variability creates more uncertainty among economic agents and it is this greater uncertainty that is the real cost that inflation imposes on an economy

whether cbs with goal independence but with economic independence as they define each term have better inflation record than those with goal independence and economic independence they create four indexes from those constructed by gmt and cwn to provide range of evidence on this issue their first index is formed by using only one feature of the gmt political independence index the presence of statutory requirement that the cb pursue monetary stability as goal they classify this index as goal independence and classify banks as less independent if their mandate is more restricted eg price stability as the sole goal this is the opposite usage from the other indices in this report the remainder of the gmt political independence index is their second index their third index consists of five components of the gmt economic independence index they leave out the two components pertaining to the supervisory responsibilities of cbs their fourth index is the overall cwn index db run five regressions for the 17 countries listed in table 1 covering the years 19501989 the only variable that is consistently statistically significant is the abbreviated gmt index of economic independence confirming the results found in the other studies that central bank financing of the governments budget deficit is the most important cause of inflation the first df index is statistically significant only when it is the sole independent variable in the regression it is not significant when it is one of several independent variables in regression 32 the adjusted r2 for these regressions is approximately 045 note also that these results are obtained from data that are averaged across different exchange rate regimes

explanation for short run tradeoff between inflation and output unemployment their interest is whether cbi can play role in explaining this tradeoff they use two cbi measures 1 the alesina and summers index which as noted above is the derived from the bp policy index and the adjusted total gtm index converted by as to bp scale and 2 the legal central bank index computed by cukierman 33 31 see alex

with other independent variables in this case the abbreviated index of economic independence df present evidence on the rank correlation between these two indexes thus we ve evidence on whether

used by as with observations spanning the period from the mid1950s through the 1980s for the entire sample period they find that the two measures of cbi play role in the tradeoff the calculated regression coefficients of the two variables are not statistically different from zero when the sample is confined to the observations subsequent to 1972 essentially the flexible exchange rate period the results are quite different both measures of cbi are statistically different from zero and both show that cbi improves the tradeoff that is for given change in aggregate demand the growth in output is larger and the inflation rate is lower in countries with more independent central banks with independence as measured above moreover the fit of the regression line to the data is improved dramatically with the r 2 increasing from 48 to 64 and 54 the authors are quick to point out however that the results are consistent with the view that greater central bank independence may have resulted in less activist monetary policy and because of that better outputinflation tradeoff were this improved tradeoff to have been exploited policymakers may soon find out according to fw that it is better than in those countries where more activist policy has been exercised note that the findings in this study may have little to do with activist monetary policy or its absence what precisely the as index measures is uncertain the index is not broken down by fw to show whether certain aspects of the index were driving the results for example it could be that the improved inflationoutput tradeoff is the result of some central banks not having to finance the budget deficits of government or prov ide finance to certain classes of borrowers it may have little to do with such factors as the independence of central bank governors from the political process g8g158g145g155g142g155g561g507g343g351g351g349g508g561 fuhrer uses linear regressions to test the influence of central bank independence on inflation the variability of inflation and economic growth when holding other macroeconomic conditions constant he performs his calculations using both the cukierman weighted cbi index and the alesinasummers as index his regressi ons cover the period 19501989 making his calculations vulnerable to the critique that they intermingle different exchange rate regimes 34 for oecd countries the relationship between inflation and cbi as defined by cukierman is statistically insignificant in both bivariate regressions and when holding other macroeconomic conditions constant35 in the bivariate regression the r2 is only 016 meaning that over 98 of the variation in the data cannot be explained by cbi using the as countries and definitions fuhrer replicates ass findings that in bivariate regression the cbiinflation relationship is statistically significant albeit with an r 2 of only 084 however fuhrer demonstrates that when controlling for other macroeconomic factors the cbiinflation relationship becomes statistically insignificant and the r2 becomes very high in some regressions the sign on the cbi variable is positive suggesting that great cbi increases inflation

alesina and summers is an artifice of the data fuhrer derives similar results when estimating the relationship between cbi and the variability of inflation measured by the cukierman index the relationship is statistically insignificant in all regressions and in one specification the sign is unexpectedly positive rather than the negative in the bivariate regression the r2 is 026 for the as countries and definitions the sign is correct for all specifications and statistically significant in the bivariate regression but when controlling for other macroeconomic factors the statistical significance of cbi disappears this suggests that the relationship between cbi and inflation found by other authors may be due to the correlation of cbi with factors that the other authors excluded fuhrers regressions between cbi and economic growth casts doubt on others evidence that cbi offers free lunch by allowing country to achieve lower inflation without lower growth again most of the evidence is statistically insignificant but in most of the regressions there is negative relationship between cbi and growth including the two specifications in which cbi is statistically significant all of the growth regressions were characterized by low r2 values suggesting that the determinants of growth are more complex and poorly understood than the determinants of inflation and inflation

other variables thought to influence inflation such as political instability openness to trade and per capita income using crosssectional analysis 36 they use the cbi index created by cukierman webb and neyapti their measurement of inflation is the average rate from 1973 to 1994 thus avoiding the problem of commingling exchange rate regimes discussed above for 18 highincome countries cbi has large negative and statistically significant effect on inflation 37 g18g152g156g142g151g561g507g343g351g351g350g508g561 one of the main arguments in favor of cbi is that it should increase the credibility of the central bank credibility is presumed to have beneficial effects on countrys macroeconomic performance specifically it is often assumed that greater credibility will make disinflationary episodes periods when the central needs to tighten policy to lower the inflation rate have less of negative effect on the economy but posen argues that central bank independence has two countervailing effects on the costs of disinflation 38 first there is the usual effect chronicled above greater central bank credibility leads to individuals adjusting their inflationary expectations more quickly to change in monetary policy when prices adjust more quickly 36 marta campillo and jeffrey miron why does inflation differ across countries in christina romer and david romer eds reducing inflation motivation and strategy university of chicago press chicago 1997 ch 9 37 interestingly when developing countries are included in the sample campillo and miron find that cbi has an even larger statistically significant and positive effect on inflation this suggests either the findings for industrial countries are not particularly robust or the effectiveness of cbi is drastically different in the developing world than the industrialized world 38 adam posen central bank independence and disinflationary credibility missing link oxford economic papers 50 1998 pp

smaller decline in output but posen argues that there is second effect working against the first if individuals believe that cbi makes variable inflation less likely they would be more willing to use nominal contracts to set wages and prices as the use of contracts becomes more prevalent prices and wages are less able to adjust in essence people worry less about inflation when it is low and so expectations adjust more slowly this would make disinflation more costly because output must fall more to make prices adjust because of these countervailing effects he argues it is not evident whether greater credibility improves macroeconomic performance posen uses series of regressions to explore these questions he defines cbi by the cukierman webbneyapti index and his observations are based on 17 oecd countries from 1950 to 1989 with one observation for each decade first he tests the hypothesis that cbi makes disinflations less costly he attempts to separate the two countervailing effects by adding separate variable for nominal wage rigidity the cbi variable is highly statistically significant but it has the wrong sign increasing cbi makes disinflation much more costly in terms of higher unemployment 39 however few other variables are controlled for and the adjusted r2 tend to be moderate ranging from 0249 to 0517 posen then tests the hypothesis that cbi makes nominal wages more rigid the results tend not to be statistically significant and have low and even negative adjusted r2s moreover the sign of the cbi variable is not consistent across different specifications in some cases cbi increases wage rigidity in other cases it decreases rigidity major problem with these tests as posen concedes is that there is consensus around straightforward method for measuring nominal wage rigidity and competing measures are not closely correlated to each other but the inconclusive evidence that cbi increases nominal wage rigidity actually strengthens the case for cbi since it suggests that the fear that greater cbi would make disinflation more costly is not strong enough factor to be measurable posen also empirically tests whether greater cbi makes disinflations faster because expectations adjust more quickly when central banks are more credible the evidence here is inconclusive with very low sometimes negative adjusted r 2s and relationship between cbi and the length of disinflation that is mostly statistically insignificant 39 these findings are supported by debelle and fischer as well as others see guy debelle and stanley fischer how independent should

claim that much of the empirical work done in this area is deficient in two major ways first they claim that cukiermans index of central bank independence based on legal criteria is contaminated by serious measurement error meaning that it is likely to be poor index for actual central bank independencea fact acknowledged by cukierman second the regressions are ols based on ordinary least squares on the basis of econometric tests they believe this to be inappropriate when both short comings are addressed brumm and krashevshi adduce evidence that the more independent the central bank the lower

eijffinger and haan surveyed 17 empirical studies on the effects of cbi on inflation that included developed countries40 six of the 17 studies are discussed at length in this report fifteen of the 17 studies found that cbi lowers inflation while the other two found that the relationship was not significant some of the studies confirm that the link between cbi and inflation was weaker during the bretton woods period prior to the early 1970s when the primary objective of central banks was the maintenance of fixed exchange rates and inflation stability was secondary objective of the studies that examined the relationship between cbi and inflation variability seven found that cbi decreases variability two found that it did not and three had mixed results most of the studies that examined the relationship between growth and cbi found relationship in 2001 berger haan and eijiffinger surveyed 30 more empirical studies written since the 1996 survey on central bank independence that include developed economies they describe the literature as extensive evidence suggesting that cbi helps to reduce inflation particularly for advanced economies 41 of the 30 15 of the studies reviewed reaffirm that cbi lowers inflation however eight studies did not find link between inflation and cbi or found that the correlation is caused by some third variable three studies had mixed results and four did not address the question some studies found that cbi has more statistically and economically robust effect on inflation in certain time periods than others and for certain measures of cbi while the newer studies confirm the findings of the earlier ones on balance scholarly dissent on the cbi issue is growing

different indexes show the term encompasses range of meanings from the methods of selecting and isolating the governing board from political influence to determining the cbs objectives and whether cbs can be used to finance government budget deficits the review of the empirical evidence suggests that for industrial countries case can be made that the rate of inflation is negatively related to those

events and developments can have profound effect on how well an economy functions many would argue that causation can in fact run in the opposite direction from that implicit ly posited in the above studies or that two way causality may be present which is incidently acknowledged by the authors of these studies thus for example fear of inflation can ad countries to establish and maintain very independent central banks and forbid them to directly or indirectly lend to government to be more specific as walsh points out high inflation if viewed as an indication of failed central bank policy might lead to the replacement of th central bankerin this case high ceo turnover is not necessarily reflection of low cb independence causing inflation 45 alternatively desire for economic stability can also cause political institutions to emerge and evolve in ways that ensure such an outcome46 in this case cb independence can be thought of as being correlated with an omitted variable responsible governance that is the true cause of low inflation if this is the case governments who lack responsibility could make their central banks statutorily independent and still not achieve low in flation for example posen theorizes that what matters most in achieving low inflation is effective support by an important constituency such as the financial sector one of the policy changes such constituency might demand to achieve low inflation is central bank independence attributing spurious causation to cbi47 thus general methodological criticism directed against all of these studies is that they have not demonstrated convincingly that causation runs in the direction they have hypothesized hence institutional reforms along lines suggested by these authors may not yield the benefits suggested by this body of empirical work g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g11g151g141g142g153g142g151g141g142g151g140g142g561 forder raises other methodological criticisms of the studies48 the studies all define independence by ranking the central banks on the basis of number of legal characteristics cbs that possess more of these characteristics are ranked as more independent he argues that the studies arbitrarily look for legal characteristics of central banks that all low inflation countries happen to share there is priori attempt to define which characteristics are necessary for independence and which characteristics are more important than others he argues that the studies have tended to arbitrarily assume that characteristics uncorrelated to inflation are not important for 45 carl walsh central bank strategies credibility and independence journal of monetary economics vol 32 1993 p 296 46 posen for example has made the case that the financial sector in many industrial countries b ecause it highly prizes price stability has emerged as major force persuading gove rnments to establish and maintain independent cbs thus it is the financial sector and its desire for price stability that causes that outcome to prevail the means to achieve this end is an independent cb see adam posen why central bank independence does not cause low inflation there is institutional

prophecies of the hypothesis that independence reduces inflation for example it is not clear that price stability goal should be defined as independence since it limits the cbs discretion but since it is correlated with low inflation it bolsters the findings that independence matters he points out thatbesides germany and switzerlandthere is consensus among the different studies as to which countries have an independent central bank if different studies cannot agree on what makes cb independent how can the studies prove that independence leads to low inflation 49 the strong relationship between independence and low inflation in germany and switzerland and the absence of strong relationship elsewhere raises the question of whether there is some other factor that caused low inflation in those two countries in fact both countries had long series of nearly balanced budgets during the period 1950s1980s removing source of upward pressure on interest rates bernanke et offer another explanation both countries targeted the growth rate of the money supply well before other countries had adopted restrictive mandates such as sole goal of price stability 50 either of these factors rather than independence could be the true cause of their low inflation nor is there any attempt in many of the studies to evaluate whether the statutory independence granted to the banks is maintained in reality for example two different countries could grant their banks the same statutory autonomy from the elected government but in practice one government could pressure the cb from behind the scenes to influence policy while the other respected its independence in these studies th two central banks would be ranked equally independent 51 cukierman and webb try to get around this problem by looking at the turnover rate of the cb ceo and survey evidence but the results from this study are inconclusive52 survey evidence about specialists perceptions of central banks independence have almost correlation to cwns legal definition of independence this indicates that legal measures of statutory independence may be misleading 53

nonnumerical legal characteristics for example for the question of how the chairman of the cb is appointed cwn assign value of 1 if appointed by the board of the central bank 075 if appointed by the board legislature and executive 05 if appointed by the legislature 025 if appointed by the executive collectively and 0 if appointed by one or two members of the executive the studies then use the ordinary least squares method to regress those numerical values on inflation to test for correlation the econometric problem with this method is that the 49 mangano points out that 40 of the

example for regression to be econometrically valid central bank that receives grade of 2 should be twice as independent as bank that receives grade of 1 and have twice the estimated effect on inflation but since the values are based on nonnumeric characteristics there is way of knowing whether it is reasonable to assume that cb with grade of 2 would have twice the effect on inflation as cb with grade of 1 the weighting of the various characteristics will also be important in the regression results it may be that only couple of characteristics really define independence if those factors are equally weighed with all characteristics the index will not reflect true independence and the regression results will be biased furthermore there are econometric problems with the sample itself if limited to advanced economies then the sample will be small and homogeneous and thus may not offer enough variation in terms of cbi and economic outcomes to yield meaningful regression results if developing countries are included the sample becomes large and diverse but runs the risk of finding spurious correlation between inflation and cbi by omitting more important factors than cbi corruption weak legal system market inte rference etc that explain the diversity of economic outcomes g6g138g157g138g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g156g561 finally timeseries study is only valid if the relationship between the variables is stable over time much of the evidence is tainted because it is obtained from an analysis that commingles data from fixed and flexible exchange rate periods and there is substantial reason to believe that the different exchange rate regimes can affect the permissible range of cb behavior the fixed exchange rate regime was in existence from 1950 through the early 1970s whilst subsequent years would have been in the flexible rate period under fixed rate regime central bank independence as measured by bp and others doesnt really mean much regardless of whether the central bank is directed to maintain low inflation rate or constant price level it must above all else maintain fixed exchange rate so long as this goal has primacy it is of little importance how its price level directive is framed under flexible rate regime an inflation goal can be pursued without the constraint of the exchange rate requirement for the same reason evidence obtained from european countries that fixed their exchange rate to the deutschmark in recent decades should be discounted it should also be noted that central bank independence changes over time in ways that some of the studies may not capture for instance the central banks of new zealand and great britain have become much more independent over the last decade

is quite imprecise as used in the literature the phrase applies to three aspects of independence 1 the degree to which the cbs governing board is isolated from the political process 2 the degree to which central banks can refuse to monetize public debt ie finance the government 3 the degree to which price stability has primacy as the ultimate goal of central bank activity when these three aspects of independence were tested against the rate of inflation for example 1 and 3 were often combined into one variable only debelle and fischer used meaning 3 as separate independent variable and they found that it had negative role to play in explaining inflation that was sometimes statistically significant thus the df result lends some support to those who seek to redefine the mandate of the federal reserve or in the words of df to take away goal independence from the federal reserv the other indices would classify 3 as increasing independence this of course presupposes that causality runs in the direction assumed by df the variables included in 1 were seen to have statistically significant effect on the indicators of economic performance from this one could conclude that to add the secretary of the treasury for example to the board of governors of the federal reserve would presumably have measurable effect on the indicators of economic performance variable designed to capture the essence of definition 2 did turn up in all of the studies as statistically significant presently however the federal reserve is forbidden to purchase other than seasoned us government securities 54 it cannot directly purchase new treasury issues the empirical studies suggest that this feature of u s law contributes to low rate of inflation proponents argue that the empirical evidence suggests that congress may in the discharge of its oversight responsibilities for monetary policy want to make the policy goal of the federal reserve more specific it may they argue wish to replace the current multigoal directive with one directing the federal reserve to achieve and maintain price level stability characteristic 3 some would argue that the evidence is not robust enough and the direction of causality is incorrect to base such policy change on however 54 do not confuse financing the government with open market purchases the major way by which the federal reserve conducts monetary policy and puts currency into circulation open market operations involve the purchase and sale of us government securities with the objective of altering the reserve position of us banks and through it money and credit conditions prevailing in the economy the data show that these purchases have not been used as means for financing the deficit of the federal government between 1980 and 1996 for example federal debt held by the public rose by approximately 3 trillion during this same period fe deral debt securities held by the federal reserve rose by about 280 billion or little less than 10 of the increase and most of these securities were required as backing for the paper currency put into circulation

independence as factor explaining differences in the rates of inflation among countries as well as differences in other major indicators of economic performance this is accomplished by the use of linear regression to appreciate the conclusions reached by these researchers it will be helpful to have an elementary understanding of this research tool equations estimated by linear regression take their form from some hypothesized relationship in which the behavior of one or more variables the independent variables is held to influence some other variable the dependent variable the application of regression analysis involves fitting straight line to group of observations usually sample selected from the universe of those variables that are suggested by the hypothesized relationship the straight line is fitted such that the deviations of the actual observations from t hose suggested by the straight line are minimized the value of the slope of that line then gives the effect of the independent variable or variables on the dependent variable while the calculated value of the slope of the line may be positive or negative or even zero its true value may not be statistically significantly different from zero because this is so it will be necessary to briefly discuss what is meant by calculated value being statistically significant to understand statistical significance let us say that the calculated effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is 10 thus changes in the independent variable by one unit change the dependent variable by 10 this assumes of course that the value 10 is really different from zero recall that it was calculated not from the universe of the independent variable but from sample taken from that universe thus it is possible that our assumption that the true value of the effect of this variable on the dependent variable is different from zero is wrong it is however possible to control for making this type of errorthat is for accepting as true relationship that is in fact not true it is common to set the control factor at 1 to 5 chances in 100 of accepting the hypothesis that the variable is different from zero when it is not if the calculated value of the independent variable lies within range that limits the error to 1 to 5 it is said to be statistically significant or statistically significantly different from zero since the purpose of this study is to establish the importance of central bank independence as factor affecting range of variables by which we judge economic performance one other summary statistic must be explained goodness of fit or r 2 the r2 is designed to measure the fraction of the variation of the dependent variable that is explained by the variation of the independent variables the r2 ranges in value between 0 and 1 the higher the r2 is the larger is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the variation of the independent variables
