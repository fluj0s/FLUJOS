us currency in use worldwide might be bogus would likely be seen not to serve the best interests of the nation as result some suggest the united states may be continueda summary of main points information publically available suggests an expansion in both the scale and scope of north korean cashgenerating criminal activity this possibly indicates situation in which criminal activity is playing an increasingly pivotal role in supporting north koreas fragile economy 32 it is widely acknowledged that undeter mined millions of dollars of socalled us 100 supernotes are currently in circ ulation given the sophistication of the bills many have concluded that they ar government produced the government of north korea has demonstrated history of engaging in criminal activity to raise cash it arguably has the disposition opportunity and technical means to produce forged supernotes past production by north korea of forg ed us currency at least until 1998 has been reported by south koreas national intelligence service indications of pyongyangs more recent production of fo rged us currency have seemingly been posited by defectors and by chinese investigators as well many observers are convinced that the dprk has been counterfeiting us currency as matter of state policy however it is not fully clear from public sources whether north korean state enterprises have continued to produce bogus dollars after 1998 at issue here is whether bills now being circulated are new or solely from stashes of earlier production runs there ppears to be reasona ble case that north korea has continued to counterfeit us currency since 1998 also not clear or publically announced is the extent to wh ich pyongyang may ve counterfeited or may be counterfeiting curre ncies other than the dollar33 as north korea is secretive and closed society activity taking place within the country such as production of bogus foreign currencies to the extent that such activities exist may be difficult to monstrate publically without compromising fragile intelligence sources nd methods in contrast distribution of counterfeit us currency is likely to take place in countri where the money can purchase items of value ie more open and ec onomically successful societies34 numerous arrestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33324crs12 34 continued downplaying the scale of alleged dprk counterfeiting

combined with secondary effects has direct bearing on us interests counterfeiting of one nations currency by another generally is considered to be an act of economic warfare direct attack on the us financial system36 there is large difference between criminal counterfe iting by private parties and that done or sanctioned by nation the counterfeiting itself might undermine confidence in the us dollar and if done extensively nough potentially damage the us economy if the extent of counte rfeiting were in the range of 15 million to 25 million per year however this would represent relativ ely small amount compared with the total us supply of currency or the amount ci rculating abroad as of february 2006 currency in circulation that is us co ins and paper currency in the hands of the public totaled about 780 billion since 1994 the value of currency in circulation has risen at the rate of 65 per year mostly stemming from foreign demand the us federal reserve estimates that between onehalf and twothirds of the value of currency in circulation is he ld outside the united states37 in the united states most domestic transactions by value are done ither electronically or by checks not cash as of december 2004 72 of the value of currency in circula tion consisted of 100 notes the denomination allegedl counterfeited by the dprk38 counterfeiting also can reduce the confiden ce by foreigners in the dollar the dollar has become the predominant medium of exchange in international transactions such degraded confidence in the dollar usually can be manifested either by surcharge on certain denominations when c onverting dollars to foreign exchange or in certain denominations of the dollar not being accepted at all currently this affects americans and other holders of dollar currency who rely on cash for transactions rather than credit cards checks or bank transfers if the counterfeiting were to become extensive enough howev er it might depress the overall exchange value

the 25 million the dprk recovere d its funds in june 2007 when the new york federal reserve bank agreed to transfer them through its facilities to bank in russia the transfer through the federa l reserve bank arguably made the funds longer illicit this allowed the dprk to proceed with its commitments under the february 13 agreement although the 25 million in the bda accounts has been released the financial sanctions still remain it is yet unclear therefore what the impact of the release of funding will be on the dprks ability to c onduct future banking transactions will the dprk be given clean bill of health by the international banking community also to be determined is the impact of the release of such funds on any future attempts by the united states to signal to the international banking community that nation individual or corporate entity is suspect of or involved in illicit activity will the united states be viewed as using the banking system for political purposes and thereby eroding some of the goodwill it has with the international banking community politicalsecurity measures the politicalsecurity prong attempts to stop the alleged counterfeiting activity by changing the costbenefit calculus of decision makers in pyongyang the strategy is to increase costs and reduce benefits in order to induce decision makers to halt the activity the inducements used are aimed primarily at raising costs and include the illicit activities initiative the proliferation security initiative diplomatic pressures as well as possible military threats and other policy related

squeezing north korea on its alleged illicit ac tivities group of policym akers sometimes referred to as the hawks favoring regime change seeks ultimately to induce crisis within the dprk that would lead to the downfall of kim jongil one way to achieve this is to cut off the money the dprk gene rates from counterfeitin g selling illicit drugs and exporting missiles second group of policymakers more in favor of engagement seeks to resolve the north kor ean problem mainly by negotiations its goal is to change the bad behavior of the dprk by bringing the country into the circle of peaceful nations and inducing it to act in accord with international standards54 each group backs initiatives to cu rb pyongyangs alleged counterfeiting but each sees the measures in different light some observers surmise that the financial action against banco delta asia announced on september 15 2005 fell too close to the september 19 joint agreement by the dprk the united states and other participants in the sixparty talks to be coincidence at the end of this fourth r ound of talks the dprk signed an agreement that set out visionary view of the end point of the process of the denuclearization of the korean peninsula55 these observers opine that the action was backed by so called hawks in the bush administration to scuttle progress being made on the diplomatic front the united states d known about the count erfeiting and money laundering activities for years why wait th ey say until the middle of round of the sixparty talks to take action56 pyongyang used the banco delta asia action as pretext to stay away from the sixparty talks and then to delay implementing the february 13 sixparty agreement by several months other observe rs state however that law enforcement efforts have timetable of their own and that the banco delta asia action occurred after threeyear inve stigation when the evidence gathering and other preparations were complete the position of the united states is that counterfeiting is an illegal activity that cannot be allowed to c ontinue in order to keep the sixparty talks moving ahead the united states arranged for the 25 million in bda accounts to be released but still maintains the designation of bda as money laundering concern the south korean government also has taken firm position on the counterfeiting issue it

will not be easy for the north to join the 30member group the current strategy of the bush administration appears to be to pressure north korea on its illicit activities but put top priority on the diplomatic process since the effects of the bda action had pyongyang scrambling the fact that the bush administration eased its fina ncial pressure on north kor ea enough for the sixparty talks to go forward indicates that it has decided that the nuclear issue takes priority over punishment at this time the b da action combined with sanctions prohibiting exports of luxury goods to the dprk seemed to generate results because they harmed the north korean elites including kim jonil directly policies aimed at an economic collapse or regime change in north korea however appear to be off the table at this time partly because neither china nor south korea thinks an economic collapse or regime change is likely to result from economic sanctions and neither country desires to deal with th economic and political effects that would follow should such collapse occur both countries are trying to improve the dprk economy south korea through investing in special industrial zones such as the kaesong

responses to the problem of north korean counterfeiting of us currency and other crimeforprofit activity is now unclear what is clear is that the bda sanctions made pyongyang more willing to meet and

seems to have increased the level of trust nd confidence between the two count ries but it also could indicate to pyongyang that the united states had st confidence in one of its own policies75 the implications for us policy of the bda action go beyond the problems with the dprk the patriot act has provi ded the united states with powerful tool to disrupt the financial unde rpinnings of unsavory

debate is the issue of crying wolf and us credibility if the bda case and the north korean c ounterfeiting issue are downplayed in order for the sixparty talks to go forward will future us law
