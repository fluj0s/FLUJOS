introduction june 19 2003 geoffrey s becker specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress us agricultural biotechnology in global markets an introduction summary us farmers have been rapidly adopting genetically engineered ge crops mainly corn soybean and cotton varieties to lower production costs and improve management however the us agricultural economy is highly dependent upon exports at time when many foreign consumers are wary of the products of agricultural biotechnology as result us exporters often have encountered barriers to trade in these markets among the most controversial barriers is in the european union eu the eu the fourthlargest foreign market for us agricultural products since 1998 has maintained facto moratorium on approvals of new ge crop varieties in may 2003 the united states launched formal challenge of the eu policy contending that it both violates international trade agreements and causes unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world the eu and other important us trading partners around the world have adopted widely divergent approaches to regulating biotechnology the wide range of approaches to ge product regulation is in part due to the fact that an international consensus on how to regulate agricultural biotechnology is still evolving us officials say they are active globally to ensure that national and international standards for genetically modified organisms gmos are consistent transparent based on scientific principles and compliant with international trade rules eg those administered through the world trade organization for example they have been working to ensure that the socalled cartagena biosafety protocol multilateral agreement on the safe handling transfer and transboundary movement of living modified organisms does not present new obstacles to us exports of such products another issue involves recent difficulties in moving us food aid to certain african countries due to what us officials said were unwarranted euprovoked concerns that such aids possible ge content could pose safety problems for recipients debate also revolves around the potential benefits and problems of introducing ge crops to developing countries congress continues to follow these issues closely for example number of leading lawmakers pressed hard for the administration to aggressively challenge the eu moratorium following the administrations decision to do so the senate and house passed resolutions sres 154 hres 252 in support of the action several house hearings have been held to review barriers to the adoption of and trade in ge agricultural products and to review challenges and opportunities for plant biotechnology development in africa additional hearings are possible whether the

table 1 multinational institutions involved in biotechnology 6 us agricultural biotechnology in global markets an introduction overview us farmers are widely adopting biotechnology growing genetically engineered ge crops mainly corn soybean and cotton varieties to lower production costs and reduce labor requirements1 in 2002 66 of an estimated 145 million acres planted to ge crops worldwide were in the united states according to the international service for the acquisition of agribiotech applications isaaa2 us crops where ge varieties are common are highly dependent upon export markets according to usda approximately 40 of all us soybeans 20 of all corn and 45 of all upland cotton production is exported these crops and their major products accounted for more than fourth 133 billion of the total annual average annual value of 526 billion for all us agricultural exports during calendar years cy 2000 to 2002 not all of these soy corn and cotton exports were ge varieties but the us marketing and regulatory systems do not distinguish between approved ge and nonge varieties commingling bulk commodity shipments provides an important cost competitive advantage for us handlers in domestic and world markets according to industry analysts these analysts observe that us adoption of agricultural biotechnology has been facilitated by the current us regulatory system the basic federal guidance for regulating biotechnology products is the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology 51 fed reg 23302 published in 1986 by the white house office of science and technology policy ostp one of its key principles is that genetically engineered products should continue to be regulated according to their characteristics and unique features not according to their method of production thus if food product produced through biotechnology is determined to be substantially equivalent to one produced by more conventional means that food is subject to additional or different regulatory processes once approved food products do not have to be labeled as to whether or not they contain any genetically modified organisms gmos except to the extent ge food is substantially different 1 for data and details on us plantings of ge crops see crs report rs21381 adoption of genetically modified agricultural products 2 isaaa global status of commercialized transgenic crops 2002 isaaa is private organization that promotes agricultural biotechnology argentina grew 22 of world acreage following by canada and china at 6 and 4 respectively twelve other countries also grew some ge crops on limited number of acres isaaa reported although ge crops are approved for commercial use in brazil an estimated 2030 of its 4042 million acres of soybeans were believed to be ge varieties in 2002 according to various usda and private analysts crs2 eg contains an allergen or has changed nutritional content however marketers are free to make such claims one way or the other so long as the labeling is truthful the framework maintains that new biotechnology products are regulated under existing federal statutory authorities all of which were conceived and enacted before the advent of commercial agricultural biotechnology3 the problem for us agriculture is that many countries remain wary of agricultural biotechnology including those in the european union eu where consumer and environmental organizations have been vocal in expressing concerns about the safety of ge crops and animals the eu and other important us trading partners have adopted widely divergent approaches to regulating biotechnology as result us exporters are encountering barriers to their products in these markets for example since 1998 the eu the fourth largest foreign market for us agricultural products has maintained facto moratorium on approvals of new ge crop varieties in may 2003 the united states canada and argentina began formal challenge of the eu policy in the world trade organization wto contending that it violates international trade agreements and also has fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world see page 7 the eu counters that it must protect its consumers by exercising the socalled precautionary approach which says that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusive regarding practices or products potential dangers to human or environmental health it should be more vigorously regulated or even prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern thus providing safeguard against future unforeseen problems under this approach which is also being emulated somewhat in other important us markets such as japan and south korea for example the products of biotechnology are deemed to be inherently different than their conventional counterparts even some countries that grow ge crops are imposing their own approval and labeling regulations for gmos for example china is planting its own ge cotton and other crops but has imposed temporary gmo import regime while it develops permanent new rules for approval and labeling of gmo farm products this has created uncertainty about continuing access to this important us export market some us producers who otherwise generally have supported biotechnology have expressed trepidation about expansion to more ge varieties due to such foreign market uncertainties their concerns have been evident as biotechnology companies work toward government approvals of ge wheat although some growers are eager to plant the new varieties when they become available others do not want commercialization approvals until there is wider global acceptance4 wheat growers too depend heavily on exports usda reports that 56 of production is exported 3 for details see crs report rl30198 food biotechnology in the united states science regulation and issues 4 gao pew initiative on food and biotechnology usda may set strict rules for biotech wheat march 17 2003 also usda seeks to avoid disruption in wheat exports after first gmo approval inside us trade march 21 2003 crs3 the average annual value of us wheat exports was 36 billion 7 of all agricultural exports in cy20002002 international oversight of agricultural biotechnology national regulation5 around the world countries have taken widely divergent approaches to regulating the products of agricultural biotechnology critics have noted that many particularly in the developing world have adopted coherent policy at all6 among those that do each has its own system although multilateral attempts to harmonize gmo regulation have been under way for several years internationally recognized standards still are evolving the disparity of national regulatory responses has been characterized as renationalization of agrifood safety regulation and sharp break from the international food safety system that evolved over the past 100 years where importers tended to accept the food and environmental safety judgments of regulators from those countries developing and exporting the products7 others argue that scientific knowledge about biotechnologys effects on food and environmental safety is still incomplete in the meantime they argue countries have right and obligation to take the precautionary approach to regulation various countries national biotechnology regulation is occurring within two broad categories approval to commercialize new products of agricultural biotechnology the united states canada japan mexico argentina and south africa are among the countries where developers seeking approvals of new ge products have found relatively flexible regulatory environment to this list might be added india and china where considerable research has been conducted on agricultural biotechnology and domestic approvals appear to be increasing but where nonetheless imports of ge crops may face obstacles8 in australia the eu and new zealand approvals 5

accept imports of ge soybean oil and chinas imposition of additional testing requirements for imported ge crop varieties may have more to do with continued crs4 have slowed total of nearly 30 countries reportedly have developed relatively coherent although in the case of some countries either somewhat ambivalent or not necessarily fully transparent policies with regard to ge approvals systems for labeling and traceability in argentina canada hong kong and the united states labeling products as to whether or not they are from gederived crops generally is voluntary however the eu and more than 20 countries have either adopted or announced plans for mandatory labeling of gmo products number of them for example australia brazil china indonesia japan new zealand saudi arabia south korea and the united kingdom an eu member have formally implemented their mandatory labeling regimes many others however have not fully outlined their proposals or indicated when they might take effect some also apparently lack implementing structures9 generally mandatory labeling also necessitates accompanying traceability requirements meaning that the marketing system must have documentable ability to trace the presence or absence of gmos through each step from farm to point of sale see also page 9 multinational oversight the wide range of national approaches to gmo regulation is in part due to the fact that an international consensus on how to regulate agricultural biotechnology is still evolving agricultural biotechnology and trade policy analysts throughout the world generally agree that an international consensus on how best to regulate agricultural biotechnology is not only desirable but necessary attempts have been under way for some years in variety of multinational institutions to develop more harmonized standards for ensuring the safety of ge crops and foods and to establish ground rules for testing enforcement and dispute resolution it is not yet clear which of these international bodies will have the greatest influence in resolving these questions although it appears likely that most if not all will have some role the ifpriphillips paper see footnote 5 observed that despite the substantial effort being undertaken there is common view on the goal of international regulation while most agree that safety is the bottom line few can agree on what that means whose opinions should hold the most weight scientists or citizens or how to handle nonsafety issues such as social economic or ethical concerns wide array of multinational bodies has or claims role in some facet of biotechnology regulation and standardsetting see table 1 several are longstanding and largely sciencebased organizations including the world health organization who the food and agriculture organization fao the food standardsfocused codex alimentarius commission the international plant protection convention ippc and the international epizootics organization oie the wto and

although not necessarily exclusively concerned about free trade codex for example was created in 1963 by fao and who to develop internationally recognized sciencebased food standards and guidelines and related materials its main objectives are to protect consumer health ensure fair trade and promote coordination of food standards work undertaken by governmental and nongovernmental organizations codex standards are used to evaluate national food regulations and to settle sanitary and phytosanitary sps related trade disputes in the wto in 1999 the codex established the ad hoc intergovernmental task force on foods derived from biotechnology the task force was charged with considering health and nutritional implications and with developing standards guidelines or recommendations as appropriate for such foods the task force held its fourth and final meeting in march 2003 when it completed work on the last of three framework documents draft principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from recombinantdna microorganisms the task forces documents were to be presented for approval by the full commission at its july 2003 meeting us officials expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the final session although deliberations over the guidelines often were contentious at the last meeting for example an open discussion was held on rules for traceability of ge products the eu led by france was advocating that they encompass rules for full traceability of ge products the united states was arguing that traceability is acceptable only for food safetypublic health purposes not merely to preserve the identity of specific products including those resulting from biotechnology the us view is that these types of questions should be considered in other codex committees because they are not unique to biotechnology10 the 2000 cartagena biosafety protocol is newer environmentallyfocused effort devoted to the safe transfer handling and use of bioengineered products crossing international borders the united states is not party to the protocol but is participating to ensure that its provisions do not undermine such trade in gm derived products see page 10

is the forum for the current trade negotiations under the doha development agenda where agriculture including potentially biotechnology is on the table bilateral efforts the us increasingly works with individual countries to harmonize regulations educate policymakers and consumers depends and eliminate barriers to trade related to biotechnology see text on issue sources ifpri usda crs7 agricultural biotechnology was not major element of international trade during the last comprehensive round of multilateral trade negotiations and therefore is not directly addressed in the 1994 uruguay round ur agreements however the us position has long been that the ur agreement on agriculture the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures and the technical barriers to trade tbt agreement provide adequate guidance for dealing with trade in gmos taken together these agreements seek to reduce or eliminate all unnecessary or arbitrary barriers to trade and ensure that sps or technical measures eg gmo labeling are transparent scientifically defensible and based on accepted international standards11 the us proposal in the current doha round of negotiations in the wto is silent on biotechnology itself but presumes continuation of this position selected us concerns us officials say they are actively engaged multilaterally and bilaterally to ensure that any national or international standards are consistent transparent based on scientific principles and compliant with international trade rules eg those administered through the wto however they face difficulties in reconciling the current us approach with the opposing perspectives of other influential countries like those in the eu and elsewhere following are discussions of selected issues in the international arena which have challenged us supporters of agricultural biotechnology the eus facto moratorium on gmo approvals12 on may 13 2003 the us trade representative ustr and the us secretary of agriculture announced that the united states canada argentina and egypt were filing case before the world trade organization against the eus facto 5year moratorium on approving new agricultural biotechnology products egypt subsequently decided against filing with the united states the administration was under increasing pressure from key members of congress and farm groups to launch such case us agricultural interests contend that not only have these policies blocked their exports to the eu but also fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world eu officials say they have been moving as quickly as possible to reinstate biotechnology approvals while trying to reassure their consumers regarding safety issues there is concern among some policymakers that the filing of wto case 11 see also ers biotechnology in agriculture confronts agreements in the wto in agriculture in the wto wrs984 december 1998 12 sources include ustr 2003

commission questions and answers on the regulation of gmos in the eu march 4 2003 and sheldon ian and tim josling biotechnology regulations and the wto international agricultural trade research consortium working paper 022 january 2002 crs8 will only escalate trade tensions between the united states and the eu where the value of twoway agricultural trade amounts to more than 14 billion annually background with minor exceptions the eu has approved agricultural biotechnology products since 1998 even though it has an elaborate approval process in place and in october 2002 implemented revisions to that process aimed at reassuring its member states and the public about the safety of its regulatory system approximately 13 products in early 2003 were awaiting approval some for as long as 6 years majority of eu states has effectively blocked the release of any new ge crops into the environment these states france belgium luxembourg the netherlands germany austria italy ireland greece spain portugal and finland say they will not implement the euwide legislation for approvals until new stricter regulations for labeling and tracing gmcontaining products also are adopted although the european commission first approved these separate proposals in july 2001 the lengthy eu decisionmaking and implementation process make it unlikely that these proposals will come into force any earlier than some time in 2004 in the 3 years before the facto ban us corn exports to the eu averaged approximately 300 million annually spain and portugal were the largest eu importers since then they have declined to less than onetenth of that value annually the result according to analysts of the eus moratorium on the approval of new corn varieties already approved in the united states although one variety of biotech corn was approved by the eu prior to the moratorium other approved varieties are being grown in the united states making exports of any us corn which is not separated as to gm or nongm varieties to the eu impractical us soybean exports to the eu have declined too from an average value of approximately 22 billion in the 3 years before the ban to about 12 billion annually 20002002 according to usda data unlike biotech corn only one variety of biotech soybeans has been widely grown in the united states the eu had approved this ge crop under its regulatory process prior to the moratorium the eu also had approved number of other gmos prior to the 1998 moratorium the wto case the usled case began with request for 60 days of formal consultations with the eu in addition to the three main filers australia chile colombia salvador honduras mexico new zealand peru and uruguay expressed their support for the case on june 19 2003 ustr spokesman issued statement announcing that the consultations were not successful and that the wto will now be asked to establish dispute settlement panel the next step at any rate resolution of the dispute could take up to 18 months the united states and its allies argue in part that the eu moratorium violates the wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures the sps agreement permits countries to regulate crops and food products to protect health and the environment but their rules must be scientifically justified and approval procedures must be operated without undue delay us interests contend that there is scientific evidence that gmderived food and feed crops are substantially different from or any less safe than conventional varieties conclusion they say even european scientific authorities have reached the moratorium has not only impacted us exports to the eu but also caused other countries particularly in the developing world to shun biotechnology which the united states has crs9 argued holds great promise for vastly improving agricultural productivity and feeding growing populations see also page 11 eu officials counter that they have shown good faith in moving as quickly as possible to restart the approval process in early april 2003 the ec threatened to take legal action at the european court of justice against the 12 member states if they fail to implement the ge approval legislation once the new labeling and tracing rules are approved nonetheless eu officials have told the united states that their cautious approach to regulating agricultural biotechnology is necessary to restore confidence among european consumers who may be more wary of changes in how their food is produced due to series of recent food safety crises13 it is unclear how wto dispute panel might rule on the useu case in part because agricultural gmos are not explicitly recognized in the uruguay round trade agreements which were concluded before the advent of widespread agricultural biotechnology if the united states wins it would validate the basic principles of the sps agreement and could discourage other countries from emulating the eu regulations the united states has pointed out that many eu farmers themselves would like to be planting and selling ge crops however win might not open eu markets to more ge imports the united states might simply have to settle for some form of alternate compensation some have suggested that win could create backlash among the european public and governments who view the united states as forcing biotechnology on unwilling consumers labeling and traceability concerns as noted number of foreign markets for us farm products have been developing systems that will require most or all gederived products to be labeled as to their ge content in the useu biotechnology dispute the usled wto challenge to the eu moratorium on gm approvals does not involve the emerging eu labeling regulations these regulations if approved as proposed would require all food feed and processed products from gmos to be labeled even if they longer contain detectable traces tolerance level for nongmo foods feeds and processed products of 09 is set for allowable adventitious presence ap that is unintended lowlevel presence of an euapproved ge substance all products with more than 09 must be labeled as gm the allowable level for unapproved ge varieties that received positive eu risk assessment during the moratorium is 05 for 3 years after which it drops to 0 the current eu regime requires labeling if ingredients contain more than 1 gmo protein or dna us officials so far have challenged formally only the eu moratorium but similar effort against the labeling and traceability rules is possible in the future us 13 for example during the 1990s bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease emerged in the united kingdom and spread to other parts of europe in 1999 high levels of dioxin were found in meat products and eggs originating in belgium pew concluded although these crises have not been caused by ge food ge food has been caught up in the general suspicion about food safety see us vs eu an examination of the trade issues surrounding genetically modified food crs10 agricultural interests argue that even if the gmo approval moratorium is lifted the new labeling and traceability rules are themselves unworkable and unnecessary and will continue to discriminate against us exports compliance with the eu labeling rule would require segregation of ge crops and foods derived from them from the time they are planted all the way through the processing and marketing chain this would entail prevention of pollen drift from ge to nonge fields and difficult and costly handling procedures such as using separate equipment storage and shipping containers or at least painstakingly cleaning them us interests argue that food companies forced to label accurately all ge products could face huge risks and liabilities all of these problems would discriminate against us shipments they add material from virginia cooperative extension asserts segregating crops at every step during growth storage transportation processing and exporting would be very difficult and costly to implement dr susan harlander former vice president of pillsbury company illustrated the situation with the following example mediumsized food company can have more than 6000 products that contain 8000 ingredients from 1000 suppliers that move through 30 processing plants on their way to being exported to as many as 100 countries implementing system to track all of these ingredients from their source as far back as the farm to the final destination is daunting task that would cost billions of dollars and even then it may not be infallible14 according to virginia extension among the issues to be resolved on labeling and detection of ge material in crops and foods are the scientific methods used to screen the product the sensitivity of the detection system what would actually be detected dna or protein what agency would manage and regulate the testing and who would be held accountable if product were mislabeled the biosafety protocol15 the cartagena biosafety protocol an outgrowth of the 1992 convention on biological diversity cbd was adopted in january 2000 and will take effect this year now that the required 50 nations have ratified it the united states is not party to the 1992 cbd and therefore cannot be party to the protocol however it has actively participated in the negotiations over the protocol text and in countries preparations for implementation the protocol addresses major area of concern not resolved by the parent cbd in 1992 the safe handling transfer and transboundary movement of bioengineered organisms and products it enables countries to obtain information about biotech organisms ie living modified organisms or lmos before they are imported into those countries it recognizes each countrys right to regulate such organisms so long 14 vines randy virginia cooperative extension specialist biotechnology information the regulation of biotechnology publication 443006

of advance informed agreements aia between the importing and exporting parties that cover the first transboundary movement of any gmo the purpose of aias is to ensure that recipient countries have the opportunity to assess environmental risks associated with the importation of biotechnology products the biosafety protocol creates the procedure by requiring exporters to seek consent from importers before the first shipment of gmo is introduced into the environment applies to seeds for planting fish for field release and microorganisms for environmental bioremediation in addition article 11 also requires that bulk shipments of gmo commodities for food feed or processing be accompanied by declarations stating that such shipments may contain gmos and are not intended for intentional introduction into the environment one section of the protocol states that lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information and knowledge regarding the extent of the potential adverse effects of living modified organism on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the party of import taking also into account risks to human health shall not prevent that party from taking decision as appropriate with regard to the import of that lmo in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects defenders of the application of this approach essentially the precautionary principle maintain that it is only temporary mechanism that gives time for scientific inquiry policymakers in europe recognize as do those in the united states the need for an assessment of risks based on accepted scientific facts however critics worry that adopting the precautionary principle in formal agreements like the protocol may create false public expectations of absolute safety and the demand for zero environmental risks further some critics maintain the precautionary approach can be used as disguised protectionism as they say already has occurred on the part of the eu in blocking us beef imports containing growth hormones and in delaying approvals of new gmos implementation of the aias and of provisions on documentation that countries can require for gmos and gmcontaining shipments also are of major concern to the united states and other gmo exporters government and industry officials from the exporting countries have been meeting with each other and with the ratifying countries to ensure that bulk grain shipments processed foods and other trade in products that may contain gmos are not disrupted due to confusing repetitive or inconsistent new requirements shipping delays burdensome paperwork and the like food aid and gmos six countries in southern africa lesotho malawi mozambique swaziland zambia and zimbabwe are experiencing continuing severe food shortages in 2002 the united nations world food program wfp announced an appeal for food aid to meet the needs of some 14 million people in the six countries however provision of food aid to meet the needs of foodshort people in the region has been made more difficult and costly by debate over the presence of genetically modified corn in us food aid shipments some of the countries expressed reluctance to accept ge corn on account of perceived environmental and commercial risks crs12 associated with potential introduction of ge seeds into southern africa agriculture one zambia refused all shipments of food aid with ge corn out of health concerns as well concern of the southern africa countries is that corn contained in us food aid shipments could be planted either accidentally or intentionally by african farmers and damage future trade with the european union introduction of genetically modified corn into their food systems could mean that crops grown for export or used in livestock feed would contain genetically modified components as noted the eu has approved and permits imports of genetically modified soybeans but has not yet approved imports of most varieties of genetically modified corn the eu is expected soon to put in place system of tracing and labeling of food products as to their ge content while livestock products will be exempted from such labeling some of the african countries express fears that eu consumers already antipathetic to ge foods will reject meat products that might have been produced from animals fed ge grain the governments of zimbabwe and mozambique have accepted us food aid shipments of corn only if it is milled prior to distribution malawi has requested that corn be milled but according to the us agency for international development usaid is allowing distribution of whole grain corn due to limited milling capacity swaziland and lesotho have expressed reservations about food aid shipments of ge corn but are accepting them only zambia has rejected any food aid containing bioengineered grain the united states has blamed eu policies for southern africa countries views on food aid containing ge products president bush for example has stated that eu governments because of their policies on ge products are hindering the cause of ending hunger in africa16 the united states maintains that genetically modified crops are safe to eat and that there is little likelihood of ge corn entering the food supply of african countries for several reasons including the fact that bioengineered varieties of corn are not well adapted to african growing conditions17 biotechnology and developing countries relatedly there is considerable debate over the potential contribution of biotechnology to food security and agricultural development in developing countries critics of biotechnology argue that the benefits of biotechnology in developing countries have not been established and that the technology poses unacceptable risks or problems for developing country agriculture18 they argue that bioengineered 16 commencement address to the us coast guard academy may 21 2003 17 for

crs13 crops could adversely affect the health of consumers and that genetically engineered crops pose unacceptable environmental risks for agriculture in developing countries critics suggest that intellectual property rights ipr protection impedes development and dissemination of ge crops in developing countries and also gives multinational companies control over developing country farmers proponents however say that the development of ge technology appears to hold great promise with the potential to complement other more traditional research methods as the new driving force for sustained agricultural productivity in the 21st century they maintain that ge foods are safe to consume that environmental risks are both negligible and manageable and that ipr difficulties have been exaggerated19 congressional response members of the house and senate agriculture house ways and means house science and senate finance committees are among those in the 108th congress who are closely monitoring biotechnology developments in the international arena as well as the administrations response if this congress follows the lead of its predecessors it is more likely to be supportive of agricultural biotechnology in international trade than to seek constraints on ge commodities traded internationally and domestically for example the senate on may 23 2003 passed by unanimous consent

food for human consumption section 10802 in addition legislation that gives the president trade promotion or fast track authority pl 107210 contains language providing that us trade negotiators should seek to negotiate rules and dispute settlement procedures that will eliminate unjustified restrictions and requirements including labeling of biotechnology products bills also were introduced in the 107th congress that took other approaches to regulating agricultural biotechnology and some could reappear in the 108th they included hr 4814 which called for mandatory labeling of ge foods and other bills in the 107th hr 4812 hr 4813 and hr 4816 which dealt respectively with legal issues raised by crosspollination with ge plants study of the safety of ge foods and liability for injury caused by ge organisms comparable bills had been introduced as of early june 2003 crs15 appendix us agency roles in agricultural biotechnology trade general21 responsibility for biotechnology trade issues and activities is shared by numerous federal agencies and departments officials who deal with them on day today basis say they communicate often either individually or in working groups to share information resolve jurisdictional questions and coordinate efforts as more difficult or controversial traderelated issues arise officials from relevant agencies may meet at successively higher levels to discuss how to formulate and implement policy response according to us officials years of experience along with established statutory authorities and the 1986 coordinated framework have provided them with strong if somewhat tacit understanding on how they will handle any given problem including which agency should take the lead role such experience has fostered an increasingly coordinated if not yet widely enunciated formal approach to biotechnology trade policy several us officials argued nonetheless some agencies are more prominent than others the office of the us trade representative ustr is generally regarded as the lead agency on biotechnology trade issues as part of its overall mandate to coordinate us trade policy including negotiating trade agreements and dealing with major disputes ustr leads the us delegation of agency representatives at quarterly sps and tbt meetings convened by the wto where biotechnology matters generally are covered back home biotechnology questions pass through the ustr stafflevel offices that handle agricultural sps and tbt matters ustr convenes and coordinates an interagency sps trade policy staff committee consisting of representatives from agencies throughout government this committee meets frequently but on an as needed basis on biotechnology trade issues some of which may arise from ongoing bilateral or multilateral negotiations and others from disputes with trading partners ustr also convenes higherlevel sps trade policy review group composed of more senior agency officials to discuss and resolve more controversial sps questions including those on biotechnology22 however other agencies take the lead on specific biotechnology issues the state department for example is at the forefront in dealing with countries implementing the cartagena biosafety protocol fda supported by usdas food safety and inspection service fsis leads on codex matters see table 1 21 sources for this section include telephone interviews with white house ustr and usda officials in late march and early april 2003 and gaos international trade concerns over biotechnology challenge us agricultural exports 22 ge labeling concerns are within the purview of the separate tbt trade policy staff committee and review groups also coordinated by ustr crs16 on occasion particularly thorny issues andor jurisdictional disputes must be resolved at the white house level which ultimately decides overall us biotechnology policy with input from its office of science and technology policy ostp the presidents special assistant for agricultural trade and food aid and biotechnology working group composed of highlevel officials under the aegis of the white house national economic council nec periodically may be called upon to discuss or referee such issues the national security council also has been involved in discussions eg those concerning whether to challenge formally the eu over its facto moratorium on new gmo approvals some critics assert that the us response to biotechnology remains largely reactive ad hoc and not well coordinated thus on any issue jurisdictional discussions may precede substantive action they contend arguing that more comprehensive longterm strategy is needed the biotechnology industry organization bio has reported on its website that ustr has circulated among interested agencies draft paper spelling out such strategy however as of early june 2003 the paper had not emerged publicly23 usda biotechnology issues and activities including international ones are addressed both at the departmental level across agencies and within the various agencies themselves usdas biotechnology coordinating committee is stafflevel interagency group that has met periodically to share information and work on biotechnology issues of mutual concern both domestic regulatory as well as trade related matters higherlevel biotechnology policy group is convened at least several times monthly by the secretary of agricultures special counsel on trade to discuss policy receive updates and map plans for upcoming interdepartmental and international meetings secretary of agriculture ann veneman on april 8 2003 named 18 people to new advisory committee on biotechnology and 21st century agriculture authority for previous advisory committee expired in 2001 eleven of the members represent agribusiness companies or agricultural producer groups the rest are from academia or consumer advocacy organizations section 3204 of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 created new biotechnology and trade program to provide grants for public and private sector projects that will address nontariff barriers to us agricultural exports involving biotechnology food safety disease or other sps concerns or that will develop through bilateral negotiations protocols on animal health grain quality and gmos the measure authorizes appropriations of up to 6 million annually through fy2007 usdas fy2004 budget proposal recommends new funding of 66 million and 20 new staff positions to support number of important crosscutting traderelated and biotechnology activities of the department and to ensure that adequate funds are available to address them effectively of this amount 21 million would be specifically for work on gmo trade issues presumably approximately third of the 23 based in part on information from bio including agriculture biotechnology international trade fact sheet available at httpwwwbioorgfoodagprioritiestradefactsasp crs17 authorized funding under section 3204 of this amount 600000 would be for the foreign agricultural services new biotechnology unit see below and the other 15 million for us activities in other countries according to department official24 congress had not yet acted on the fy2004 usda appropriation by mid june 2003 the budget documents note that usda faces growing array of challenges related to biotechnology including rapidly expanding number of regulatory market access and trade barrier issues the funds would be appropriated directly to the secretary to provide her with flexibility in allocating them among various agencies at the agency level the foreign agricultural service fas facilitates and promotes agricultural trade including trade in the products of biotechnology fas activities include education training technical assistance and issue resolution in recent years fas attention has been shifting increasingly from biotechnology capacity building eg technical assistance on the science and application of biotechnology in agriculture to monitoring and dealing with foreign regulatory policies and restrictions on trade in gmo products fas programs include25 an overseas biotech trainingeducation program involving seminars symposia and educational materials on various biotechnology issues aimed at foreign educators public officials and others cochran fellowship program biotechnology training offering shortterm us training for foreign scientists regulators journalists and policymakers to provide information about the technologys benefits and about us regulation biotechnology short courses new series of quarterly twoweek programs in the united states for foreign participants intended primarily to impart biotechnologys relationship to market access and trade in agricultural products and the factors influencing that relationship capacity building for the seed trade industry to expand seed trade with eastern europe africa and asia biotechnology research capacity building supporting the development of sciencebased research and regulatory programs and promoting global food security particularly in developing and newly emergent economies biotechnology activities with international organizations utilizing variety of approaches like briefings staged at multinational meetings eg at codex and at the rome world food summit in 2002 and at regional workshops fas generally convenes usda interagency team weekly to review sps and tbt problems in agricultural trade including those in ge products is involved in developing policy on matters requiring higherlevel decisions and leads or accompanies other agency officials on overseas missions to discuss and resolve issues 24 usda also has asked congress for 500000 in fy2004 to conduct series of regionallybased short courses on the specifics of the cartagena protocol to ensure that countries implement it in sciencebased transparent and nondiscriminatory manner 25 see the fao website biotechnology and us agricultural trade training and capacity building at httpwwwfasusdagovitpbiotechdevelopmenthtml crs18 fas staff have long been engaged in biotechnology trade issues but generally not on fulltime basis seeking to improve its focus and work the agency in 2002 established new biotechnology office reporting to the administrator and associate administrator the office hopes to have 10 fulltime staffers on board by august 2003 organized around four teams devoted exclusively to biotechnology work bilateral relations in asia and the americas bilateral relations in europe the middle east and africa international organization work eg with wto fao etc and one devoted to technical assistance capacity building and outreach usdas animal plant health inspection service aphis regulates the movement testing and commercialization of new ge crop varieties and ge veterinary biologics in the united states in addition as the lead federal agency regulating commodity imports and exports aphis works to minimize trade disruptions caused by animal and plant health issues including those related to biotechnology aphis staff participate and sometimes take the lead in us negotiations with trading partners and in multinational forums to resolve spsrelated disputes and to harmonize international standards to ensure that such issues are not used as unfair barriers to trade an increasing share of aphis harmonization work revolves around trade in ge products the agency has sought both to ensure that international biotechnology policies are sciencebased and to promote the global credibility of the us ge regulatory process it is involved in codex ippc oie the cartagena protocol and the oecd among other organizations and is in ongoing negotiations with canada on harmonization which led recently to
