to provide stopgap funding8 continuing appropriations acts commonly are referred to as continuing resolutions crs because usually they provide continuing appropriations in the form of joint reso lution rather than bill occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form congressional reliance on continuing resolutions is demonstrated by the fact that during the 55year period covering fy 1952fy2006 continuing resolutions were enacted for all but five fiscal years in recent years continuing resolutions were not needed for fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 when all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in the absence of regular appropriati ons the failure to enact continuing appropriations in timely manner results in funding gap funding gaps usually require that affected federal agencies shut down and furlough many of their employees9 in years in which the regular appropriations acts are not all enacted on time the house and senate usually resort to series of continuing resolutions to buy time to complete legislative action10 during the first 30 years that the congressional budget process under the congressional budg et act of 1974 was fully

fy2007 appropriations under deeming resolutions the congressional budget act of 1974 requi res the annual adoption of budget resolution establishing aggregate levels of revenues spending the debt limit and the surplus or deficit as well as allocations of spending with regard to the enforcement of discretionary spending vels reflected in the budget resolution the 1974 act relies mainly on points of order in sections 302 and 311 of the act dealing with allocations of discretionary spending by appropriations subcommittee and aggregate spending which includes both discretionary nd mandatory spending respectively when the house and senate do not reach final agreement on budget resolution in timely manner or fail to reach final agreement altogether during session they may be faced with difficult situation regarding the enforcement of discretionary spending levels for upcoming fiscal years the house and senate must adopt new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually ppropriated spending levels to be continuous if budget resolution is not adopted for fiscal year there are allocations of spendi ng made to the appropriations committees under section 302a and basis for th em to make the required spending suballocations under section 302b consequently when the house and sena have been presented with such situations they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide basis for updated enforcement16 the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any specific st atute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal w ith the issue on an ad hoc basis deeming resolutions were used in one or both chambers when the house and senate did not reach agreement on budget resolution in 1998 for fy1999 in 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33681crs9 17 see the discussion in the report of the h ouse
