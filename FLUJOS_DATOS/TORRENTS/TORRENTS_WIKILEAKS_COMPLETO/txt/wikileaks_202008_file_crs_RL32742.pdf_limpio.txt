this report provides an overview of the process for filling positions to which the president makes appointments with the advice and consent of the senate pas positions it also specifies for the 108th congress all nominations to fulltime positions on 34 regulatory and other collegi boards and commissions that have such positions eg consumer product safe ty commission federal reserve board election assistance commission profile s of each board and commission provide information on their organizational structures membership as of the end of the 108th congress and appointment ac tivity during that congress the appointment process for pas positions the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states1 the constitution article ii section 2 clause 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal offi cers of the united states2 three distinct stages mark the appointment process selection clearan ce and nomination by the president consideration by the senate nd appointment by the president selection clearance and nomination in this stage the white house selects and clears nominee before sending the formal nomination to the senate there are number of steps in this stage of the process for most senateconfirmed positions first with the assistance of and preliminary vetting by the white house office of presidential personne l the president selects candidate for the position interested parties including members of congress may ve input during this process most boards and commissions require political balance among their members ie more than simple majority may be from the same political party so the president normally ne gotiates over nominations w ith leaders of the oppositionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32742crs2 33 usc 102 note 4pl 108458 7601party in congress these negotiations invol ve questions not only of patronage but of policy especially when the board or commi ssion is involved in areas that at the time may be particularly sensitive this often results in packaging process in which the president submits several nominations together for positions in particular agency and the senate then confir ms them as group sometimes however only one or two nominations are submitted when three or four positions may be available when this occurs nomination may remain before the senate for many months until one or two additional nominations are submitted generally all are then quickly confirmed during the clearance process the candidate prepares and submits several forms the public financial di sclosure report standa rd form sf 278 the questionnaire for na tional security positions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement ques tionnaire the office of th counsel to the president oversees the clearance process which often includes background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi th internal revenue service irs the office of governme nt ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appoi nted if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the office of the counsel to the president has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and clearance stage is ofte n the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays pa rticularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administration or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between new presidents inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team recent amendments to the presidential transitions act of 19633 encourage presidentselect to submit for security clearance potential nominees to highlevel national security positions as soon as possi ble after the election4 for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by cu stom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state if neither senator is from the presidents party he usually defers to the recommendations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from nators of the opposition party because of their positions in the senate before maki ng nomination to federal position at the state or national level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nominee has legal authority to assu the duties and re sponsibilities of the position the authority comes with senate confirmation and pres idential appointment nominee who is hired by the agency as consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumstances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee recess appointment to the position seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32742crs3 5pl 105277

information see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presidential continuedbelow recess appointments may have political consequences however particularly if senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role some senateconfirm ed positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the vacancies act5 positions on most boards and commissions however are not covered by this act6 senate consideration in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether or not to confirm nomination7 the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the impor tance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy8 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination the senate confirmation process is centered at the committee level committee nomination activity generally includes inve stigation hearing and reporting stages as part of investigatory work committees may draw on information provided by the white house as well as information collected by the committees hearings provide public forum to discuss nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be res ponsible even if confirmation is thought to be virtual certainty hearings may provide senators and the nominee with an opportunity to go on the record with partic ular views or commitment s senators may use hearings to explore nominees qualifications articulate policy perspective or raise related oversight issues some committees hold hearings on nearly all nominations others hold hearings for only some the committee may discontinue acting on nomination at any point upon referral after inves tigation or after hearing if the committee votes to report the nomination back to the full senate it has three options it may report the nomination to the senate favorably report it unfavorably or re port it without recommendation if the committee elects not to report mination the senate may under certain circumstances discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32742crs4 9continued nominations committee and floor

ii sec 2 cl 3although the senate confirms most nominations some nominations are not confirmed rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee occu r for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for considera tion of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination if nomination is not acted upon by the senate by the end of congress it is returned to the president pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the president at the beginning of recess of 30 days or longer but the senate rule providing for this return is often waived10 appointment in the final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office the president may sign the commission at any time after confirmation once the appointee is given the commission and sworn in he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the constitution also empowers the president to

dates of the senate recesses for the 108th congress and the number of recess appoi ntments during each recess presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment pow er to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess ppointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes r ecess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the r ecess appointee may not be pa id from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given rece ss appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the nd of the session and nother individual was given the recess appointment recess ppointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next sessi on of the senate for this reason when recess appointment is made the

they are independent executive branch bodies located with four exceptions outside executive departments14 2 several members head each entity 3 the members are appoint ed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and 4 the member s serve fixed terms of office and except in few bodies the presidents power to remove them is restricted new commission or board member may be nominated and confirmed for position from which someone has resigned or died with an unexpired term or for position with new term that is alread underway occasionally if the unexpired term is for very short period the president submits two nominations of the same person simultaneously the first to comple the unexpired term and the second to complete regular term of office on some commissions the chair is subject to senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners if the president wishes to appoint as chair someone who is not on the commi ssion tw nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee one for member and the other for chair as independent entities with staggered membership executive branch boards and commissions have more political independence from the president than do executive departments nonetheless the president can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of the membership when he designates the chair or has the opportunity to fill numbe r of vacancies at once for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32742crs6 15for 3 of these 25 organizations the electi on assistance commission the federal election commission and the united states international trade commission the number of member positions is even and more than half may be of the same partypresident george w bush had the opportun ity to shape the securities and exchange commission during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies resignations and the death of member likewise during the same time period president bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the national labor relations board because of existing vacancies expiring recess appointments and resigna tions simultaneous turnove r of board or commission membership may sometimes result from coincidence it may also sometimes be the result of buildup of vacancies after ex tended periods during which the president fails to nominate or the senate fails to confirm members two other notable characteristics apply to appointments to some of the boards and commissions first for 25 of the regu latory and other collegial boards and commissions the law limits the number of appointed members who may belong to the same political party usually to more than simple majority of the appointed members eg two of three or three of five15 second advice and consent requirements also apply to inspector ge neral appointments in five of these organizations and general c ounsel appointments in three appointments during the 108th congress during the 108th congress president george w bush submitted nominations to the senate for 77 of the 153 fulltime positions on 34 regulatory and other boards and commissions most of the remaining positions were not vacant during that time total of 102 nomin ations were submitted for these positions of which 72 were confirmed 6 were wit hdrawn and 24 were returned to the president the number of nominations exceeds the numbe r of positions because the president submitted multiple nominations for some positions in some cases for example the president submitted one nomination for the end of term in progress and second nomination of the same person to the same position for the succeeding term in other cases the president submitted second nomin ation after his first choice failed to be confirmed the president also usually submits an extra nomination of an individual to whom he has gi ven recess appointment in or der to comply with law affecting the payment of that appointee

average time the president took to submit nomination after term expired or vacancy occurred may not be as meaningful when considering boards or commissions as it is when considering executive departments and singlehead inde pendent agencies nearly all positions on boards and commissions are for fixed term of office and when term expires the incumbent is usually permitted to remain in office until he or she is replaced by successor moreover nomination is frequently submitted before an incumbents term expires consequently the time taken to confirm nomination generally is not as crucial for independent regulatory boards and commissions as it is for executive departments and singlehead independent agencies where nomination is generally made to position that is vacant the length of time given nomination may be pending in the senate varies widely some nominations are confirme d within few days others may not be confirmed for several months and some are never confir med this report provides for each board or commission nominati on that was confirmed in the 108th congress the number of days between nomination and confirmation days to confirm these counts exclude days during august recesse s and between sessions of the congress this cutoff point is suggested by the senate rules which provide that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon shall be returned to the president although this rule is often waived16 the 31 days during the august 2003 recess the 41 days between the

information provided on its website the commission has been led by an acting chair on at least nine other occasions during that time httpwwwcftc govopaopatermshtm visited jan 15 2005 the rule provides that at any time that vacancy exists in the position of chairman of the commission the remaining members of the commission shall elect member to serve as acting chairman until new chairman has been appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate provided however that if the president shall appoint new chairman from among the existing members of the commission that commissioner shall serve as acting chairman for these purposes until such time as his appointment as chairman has been confirmed or rejected by the senate 17 cfr 14013 it is unclear what specific statutory authority would support rule that permits the president to make temporary appointment to an advice and consent position on this commission absent such specific statutory authority it is unclear what general legal authority would allow for such an appointment the sole statutory authority for such appointments governmentwide is the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 which would probably not apply to this
