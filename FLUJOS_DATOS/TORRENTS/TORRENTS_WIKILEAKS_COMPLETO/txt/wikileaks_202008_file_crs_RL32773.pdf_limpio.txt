purposes and activities in his september 21 2004 address to the opening meeting of the 59th session of the general assembly president bush asserted that the world must create permanent capabilities to

build peacekeeping capabilities worldwide demand for peacekeepers for many analysts continued efforts to improve the peacekeeping skills of african and other military forces is an important step towards controlling devastatin g conflicts particul arly in africa in the mid1990s several developed nations pr ovided most of the peacekeepers the perception that developed nations would not be able to sustain the burden indefinitely as well as the perception that the interests of those nati ons in africa were not sufficient to ensure needed troop commitments there led interna tional capacitybuilding efforts to focus on africa as of the end of december 2004 shortly after gpoi first started up almost 25000 of the nearly 58000 military personnel w ho were participating in the

chile and uruguay in providing trai ning to central americans issues for the 110th congress members of the 109th congress tended to be supportiv of the gpoi concept but some expressed concerns over several shortcomings lack of strategic plan and evaluation program perceived laxness in program management leading to severe delays in planning and imp lementation and sense of less than full commitment to the program by state departme nt in particular the stat department has taken steps to remedy these problems producing strate gic plan the executive summary of which is publically available27 facilitating procedures to speed planning and implementation and imple menting an evaluation program it is not yet clear whether these steps will satisfy congressional critics who attempted through appropriations legislation to move the program elsewhere s noted above the terms of the final continuing resolution pl 1105 left the program unchanged given the current congressional scrutin of private contractors performing security functions and security force training in iraq and elsewhere some may eventually question the predominance of private contractors and more recently other nations in gpoi training although congre ss has not yet raised this as an issue28 the fy2008 defense authorization bill hr 4986pl 110 181 cite d above does request gao to describe the extent to whic h gpoi uses contractors and to assess the quality and timeliness of the results achieved by the contractors and whether the united states government might have achieved similar or be tter results without contracting out functions as of the beginning of the second session of the 110th congress two practical issues concerning gpoi seemed most salie nt one is whether the ongoing evaluations of gpoi demonstrate that the program is meeting its goals and if not how to adjust the program to achieve them second is whether gpoi has become sufficiently global in its reach are gpoi training efforts having the desired effect m m b r s wonder whether the gpoi program is mee ting its goal of providing welltrained peacekeepers for and other operations there are four questions of particular concern 1 is gpoi meeting its target number of trainees 2 are those trained by gpoi to be trainers actually training ot her troops 3 are the soldiers and police trained under gpoi actually deployed to international peacekeeping operations 4 is the training provided sufficient to enable soldiers or police in the case of coespu training to handle the necessary range of peacekeeping tasks effectively these andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32773crs16 29 the standard is mastery of at least 80 of the coursework and an attendance record of 80 or better related concerns were among those raised by the senate armed services committee in the report accompanying its version of the fy2008 national defense authorization act s 1547 srept 11077 see sec tion on fy2008 congressional action above in an effort to measure results of its training the state department awarded in september 2005 contract to dfi internationa l to develop system to evaluate gpoi and to monitor its results against that metrics system thus far the dfi gpoi evaluation team has gathered figures that answer the first question with some confidence figures on the numbers of troops trai ned compiled by the gpoi evaluation program indicate that it is possible that u sfunded gpoi training efforts may indeed reach the gpoi goal of 75000 troops trained if funding continue s at current levels through fy2009 as planned gpoi eval uation data show just over 40000 foreign troops trained to standard29 through 2007 ie through the third year of the program the goal of 75000 would indicate pace of 17500 soldiers trained per year through 2010 when the program is scheduled to end the pace of training will have to speed up if the goal is to be met one area in which the numbers may fall short of some expectations is the proportion of peacekeeping trainers who are trained gpoi was initially billed as program with significant trainthet rainer component which implied large number of trainers prepared to teach other soldiers to deploy on peacekeeping missions thus far the available data s how that trainers have comprised only 66 of those trained has gpoi become sufficiently global as gpoi advances into its third year of operation some members question whether it has obtained the commitment and participation from other countries that was originally anticipated the sasc report referred to above srept 11077 acco mpanying s 1547 raises this concern participation among the g8 members is uneven it states and there appears to be effort to solicit partnershi p with nong8 countries such as india which has rich peacekeeping experience although india has recently become gpoi partner that term is used by gpoi to mean countri that receive training and support rather than those that provide it which seems to be the sense intende d here the sasc report suggests that the state departments division of labor on gpoi may contribute to the problem one possible challeng to obtaining greater contributions or participation in gpoi may be the fact that at the department of state gpoi appears to be mainly administered by the africa bureau rather than the bureau of political military affairs sasc provisions as incorporated in the fy2008 omnibus appropriations bill pl 110 181 discussed above call for gao study to describe the presidents efforts to solicit contributions for and participation in gpoi as well as the activities conducted by each member state of the g8 by nong8 member nations and by organizations and institutions they also call for gao to examine whether the state department and the defense department should concentrate administration of gpoi in one office or bureau and if so which one httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32773crs17 whether gpoi is too africacentric may also be concern regarding the relative proportion of troops trained from africa vs th rest of the world although gpoi was always intended to focus more on africa than on the rest of the world some members may regard the results thus far as too weighted towards that continent table 4 below shows that of the 40133 troops trained with gpoi funds as of december 31 2007 some 38465 or 96 were fro m subsaharan africa
