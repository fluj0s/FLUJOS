disapproval exceeded all other major european countries including those whose governments opposed the war such as france and germany in the runup to the march 2004 parliamentary elections in spain but

support for aznars policies in ir aq or suggestion that aznars successor as party leader would change course on iraq widespread predictions of conservative victory prior to march 11 suggest that the iraq issue alone would probably not have determined the election outcome rather the bombings themselves coupled with the aznar governments early response to them including its mistaken charge against
