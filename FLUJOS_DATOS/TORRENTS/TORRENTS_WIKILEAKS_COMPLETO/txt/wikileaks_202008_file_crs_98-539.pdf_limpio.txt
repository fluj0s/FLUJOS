the process of tablishing radio free iraq and radio free iran which transmitters to use possible jamming by the local governments the hiring of staff and where the staff sh ould be located an additional concern is rferl privatiza tion due to occur by december 1999 both radio free iraq and radio free iran farsi or persian language service of rferl began broadcasting on october 30 1998 the two surrogate services offer 24hour on line new service over the internet radio free iran airs 45 minutes soon to be increased to one hour of news interviews commentary and callins on shortwave broadcasts which it repeats w ith updates once each day radio free iraq shortwave broadcasts consist of 1 hour of news commentary and interviews with outsiders which is also repeated once each day with updates the goal by the summer of 1999 is to have each service br oadcast 3 hours of original programming each day with 1 repeat for total of 6 hours in each country the transmitters for the broadcasts are in various countries within the region ibb overseas the use of all the broadcasting facilities the transmitters used for the new surrogates may change from timetotime depending on transmitter availability as voa is also using them according to rferl ongoing transmitter issues include increasing transmitter capability particularly in kuwait if expanded surrogate broadcasting is to occur rferl is also seeking adequate mediumwavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98539crs5 7conversation with paul g oble rferl december 12 1998 8telephone conversation with dr adeed dawisha professor of

this region both types of transmitter expansions will require an increase in funds they say7 rferl is authorized to fill total of 12 or 14 staff positions to work directly with each of the two new surrogates as of december 1998 rferl has hired between 8 and 10 people for each servi ce although as many as 43 employees including regional specialists interpreters and broadcasting monitors are providing indirect support for these new broadcast serv ices generally the staff for radio free iran and radio free iraq are located predominately in prague but few will be in washington new york and london establishing these new surrogates has taken time newlyhired rferl journalists researchers and broadcasters for radio free iran and iraq are learning as they go on how to report in closed societ for the most part the staff reporting into iraqiran now were not with rferl in its early days of reporting into russia when it was closed therefore there is certain amount of inexperience and re inventing the wheel in operating radio fr ee iraq and radio free iran another difficulty for the new staff perhaps hindering their effectiveness has been that they are navigating between two entirely different foreign policy situations broadcasting into iraq vs into iran about midyear appointment of the directors for the new broadcast entities occurred on july 30 1998 rferl announced the appointment of dr stephen c fairbanks formerly with the state department the foreign broadcast information service and the peace corps to director of rferls farsi language service month later rferl announced the ppointment of amba ssador david newton formerly ambassador to iraq from 19841988 ambassador to yemen from 1994 1997 and middle east expert w ith the department of state the potential audience for these surrogate broadcasts is expected to be low at first but may gradually increase over time according to experts on iraq in particular the people are starved for obj ective information about what is going on inside their own country iraqis may not tr ust the surrogate radio broadcasts at first because they will likely attribute antireg ime news or cultural information to us propaganda over time however when the ir aqis are able to verify accounts to be true the audience of radio free iraq will likely gain in popularity according to proponents8 nevertheless iraqi authorities have said that they will not even bother to jam radio free iraq broadcasts sayi ng we believe our people are immune to hostile propaganda9 iranians on the other hand already have access to wide range of foreign media therefore radi free iran might have even more difficulty competing and establishing following httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98539crs6 10open letter to the presiden t from the

are tuning in to radio free iraq out of curiosity in iran on the ground interviews indicate an audience for radio free iran as well in both cases however there is indication of whether people are believing what the broadcasts are relaying foreign policy issues some members of congre ss perceived the foreign policy objectives for establishing radio free iran and radio free iraq as being comparable according to senator brownback key sponsor of cr eating surrogate broadcasting service to iran the recent elections in iran illustrate the will and desire of the people of iran for freedom democratic institutions and lifestyles now is the time to give them one more tool to support this desire the iranian people are among the most oppressed people in the world they have very little access to outside information to diverse political civil and religious thought radio free iran is just one part of multi faceted approach to the problem iran poses to the security of the united states and to our friends and allies in the region similarly surrogate broadcasting into iraq is part of broader strategy consisting of wide array of actions to address saddam hu ssein as threat to us security that broader strategy according to an open letter to the president from 28 prominent foreign policy experts mig ht include recognizing provisional government in iraq restorin g safe haven in northern iraq in which the provisional government would have author ity lifting sanctions in liberated areas of the country and releasing frozen assets to the contro l of the provisional government in iraq10 in contrast to congressional views the clinton administration was reluctant to embrace either new surrogate service but especially radio free iran while the administration supported increased farsi language broadcasting by voa it did not support surrogate service for iran at time when there has been change in the iranian government and potential for improve ment in usiranian relations state department officials voiced their positi on on the congressionally mandated creation of radio free iran saying that one should misinterpret radio free iran as an attempt to undermine the iranian government or in any way diluting the very clear position we have that we are encouraged by the developments in iran that we believe that the best way to overcome the differen ces between our two countries is to have an authorized and acknowledged dialog ue improvement in the breadth and diversity of information in the public media will add to the political debate which we note is already taking place in iran whatever happens with this radio broadcasting we think it will enrich what is already livel political debate in iran11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98539crs7 12see crs report iraq us

tive of establishing radio free iraq most foreign policy officials believe that it is small foreign policy tool with very longrun perspective that can only contribute to accomplishing us foreign policy objectives and support the iraqi opposition if used in concert with policy options12 many in congress supported establishing rrogates in iraq and iran as lowcost lowrisk efforts to support freedom but ot hers claimed that the effects of the broadcasting would be too slow with unmeasur able results the cost is relatively low at the present time 5 million for radio free iraq comparable to the initial funding for radio free asia and 4 million for radio free iran if audiences in these countries never become establis hed however or if the target country governments are successful in jamming the broadcasts then the value of surrogate broadcasting into these countries and the corre sponding 9 million may be questioned the administrations fears of antagoni zing the new iranian
