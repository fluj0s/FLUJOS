the time of rollment beneficiaries do not commit to attending specific institutions at the time of prepayment and they may use the certificates at any participating school ach year participatin g

be refunded until one year from the da of purchase or upon the death of the designated beneficiary10 unlike either statesponsored prepaid tuition plans or college savings plans account owners of

on the plans pooled contributions will not match tuition inflation in which case the state must use other resources to satisfy the plans obligations12 another reason put forth this time from the contributors perspective is that the funds in college savings plan can be used toward the full range of qhees at any eligible institution regardless of which state sponsors the plan or where the

contributors appear to have increased their use of commissioned broke rs and financial advisors18 these intermediaries are the most frequently mentioned source of plan information among persons who

twothirds of college saving s plans were sold by these intermediaries in 2003 with threefourths of new accounts coming from this source20 individuals who purchase college saving s plans through brokers and financial advisors incur sales charges of up to 575 of account assets in addition to the fees imposed by the state plans and fund companies21 congressional oversight some members of congress became concerned about such things as the overall level of fees and the extent to which they offset the value of the tax benefit the lack of uniform disclosure across plans that impedes

who enroll in 529 savings plans are not requi red to be provided the same quality of information as other mutual fund investors similarly the sec stated that investors in the statesponsored plans do not have to get the same periodic reporting as other mutual fund investors and that 529 i nvestors encounter difficulty making comparisons across plans because of the lack of standardized disclosure

the district of columbia allow residents who participate in their own states plan to claim partial or total state income tax deduction on contributions31 earnings on contributions to secti on 529

effective in tax years starting after december 31 2001 for state sponsored programs and starting after d ecember 31 2003 for programs of private institutions the federal taxexempt status of earnings

tax years starting after december 31 2 001 the expansion to first cousins makes qtps more attractive to grandparents who can transfer an account between cousins that is between their grandchildren and thereby avoid paying federal inco tax and penalty on non qualified distributions if say the original beneficiary decides not to go to college38httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31214crs12 39 this is perbeneficiary limit rather than peraccount limit if more than one account of beneficiary is rolled over in 12 month period it would represent nonqualified distribution that is subject to taxation susa n t brat planning for college using section 529 savings accounts the practical tax lawyer winter 2002 40 kristin davis miracle grow kiplingers personal finance september 2001 and httpwwwsavingforcollegecom 41 about 32 states allow parents to fund qtps with money from custodial accounts custodial 529 plans retain some features of the original accounts eg savings still belong to the child there also could be tax consequences to funding qtps in this manner due to the requirement that qtps accept only cash cont ributions ie the sale of investments in custodial accounts could produce capital gains that would be subject to taxation penelope wang education yes theres still college money december 2001 and anne tergesen what about thos custodial accounts business week march 11 2002samebeneficiary rollovers taxfree transfers from one qtp to another for the same beneficiary can ccur once in any 12month period39 t h s m beneficiary rollover permits contributors to make taxfree transfers between prepaid tuition plan and college savings plan offere d by the same state and between state and private prepaid tuition plan perhaps more importantly according to some observers the amendment to section 529 made permanent by the ppa provides an account owner with the opportunity for greater control over the inve stment of hisher funds without changing beneficiaries an account owner could for example make samebeneficiary rollover into the program of another state w ith an investment strategy the contributor prefers to those offered by the original states program40 coordination of contributions with estate gift and generationski pping transfer taxes contributors to section 529 plans rather than beneficiaries maintain control over the accounts in other words contri butors can change the beneficiary or have the plan balance refunded to them this feature has been touted as significant advantage of saving for college throug h qtp as opposed to custodial account opened under the uniform gifts to minors act ugma or the uniform transfers for minors act utma or through cove rdell education savings account these savings vehicles ultimately are owned by the child the child also can use them for whatever purpose they chose upon gaining control of the funds41 nonetheless the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 declared that payments to section 529 plans made after august 1997 are completed gifts of present interest from the contributor to the bene ficiary as result an individual can contribute up to 12000 in tax year 2007 as taxfree gift per qtp beneficiary this amount of taxfree gift is subject to indexation special gifting provision for contribu tions to section 529 plans could make them of interest to individuals with substantial resources and to families with children who will be attending college in the nottoodistant future qtp contributor may make an excludable gi ft of up to 60000 in 2007 for example byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31214crs13 treating the payment as if it were made over five years thus each grandparent could contribute 60000 for total of 120000 to each grandchilds qtp in tax year 2007 which potentially would allow more ear nings to accumulate than if each had contributed 12000 annually for five years in this instance assuming the taxfree gift annual limit remained at 12000 over th period the two grandparents could not make another excludable gift to those account beneficiaries until 2012 by making qtp contributions completed gifts the tra also generally removed the value of the payments from the contribut ors taxable estate an exception occurs however if contributor who selected th fiveyear advance exclusion option dies within the period irs rulemaking potential for abuse of section 529 accounts at the same time that the ppa permanently extended the egtrra amendments to section 529 the 2006 act added section 529 f it provides that the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe regulations to prevent abuse of 529 accounts the joint committee on taxation jct gave two examples of abuse in its technical explanation of the bill jcx3806 buse might arise because account owners can change beneficiaries without inducing tr ansfer tax payments for example taxpayer establishes severa l accounts for different benefi ciaries and contributes to each using the fiveyear rule discussed bove with the ultimate purpose of changing the beneficiaries to one indi vidual and distributing to th at beneficiary the combined account balance without further transfer ta x consequences the jct also noted that abuse might arise because taxpayer endeavors to use qtp like retirement account but section 529 does not have the same requirements and restrictions as retirement accounts the irs on march 3 2008 published in internal revenue bulletin 20089 an advance notice of rule making requesting that comments be submitted by march 18 the notice of proposed rule making nprm is expected to include general anti abuse rule that will apply when sectio n 529 accounts are established or used for purposes of avoiding or evading transfer tax the nprm also will include rules relating to the tax treatment of contributions to and participants in qtps including rules addressing the incons istency between section 529 nd the generally applicable income and transfer tax provi sions of the code in ddition the nprm will contain rules about the function and operation of the programs dr awing in part on regulations proposed in 1998 notice 200155 concerning the statutory restriction against
