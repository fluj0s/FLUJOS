the judgmentconstitutional considerations the language of the kingpin statute not withstanding there is real question whether the constitution limits imposition of the death penalty to cases in which human life has been taken in 1972 the united states supreme cour t held that the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause precl uded imposing the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the trie r of fact under the procedures then used by the federal government and most of the states in capital cases furman v georgia 408 us 238 the court subsequently held th at the defect detected in furman could not be cured by establishing mandatory rather th an discretionary deat h penalty statute for all murders woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 but that the constitution would permit capital punishment under procedure which guided the exercise of the judge and jurys discretion so that the death penalty would be reserved for only the most egregious cases gregg v georgia 428 us 153 1976 having concluded in effect in woodson that not all murders could be made subject to the death penalty the supreme court in coker v georgia 433 us 584 1977 held that imposition of the death penalty for co mmission of crime other than murder rape in that case violat ed the cruel and unusual punishment clause rape is without doubt deserving of serious punishment but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public it does not compare with murder which does involve the unjustified taking of human life although it may be accompanied by anot her crime rape by definition does not include the death of or even the serious injury to another person the murderer kills the rapist if more than that does not life is over for the victim of the murderer for the rape victim life may not be nearly so happy as it was but it is not over and normally is not beyond re pair we have the abiding conviction that the death penalty which is unique in its severity and irrevocability is an excessive penalty for the rapist w ho as such does not take human life48 later cases seem to confirm the basic implication of woodson and coker crime that does not involve the taking of life cannot be punished by death for instance the court resisted the invitation to apply its individualized capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97141crs18 49 harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 99495 1991our cases creating and clarifying the individualized capital sentencing doctrine have repeatedly suggested that there is comparable requirement outside the capital context because of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties harmelin had been convicted of possession of 672 grams of cocaine and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole 50

that irrespective of whet her he participated in planning the robbery or was present when the victims were killed enmunds driving the escape car was enough to warrant conviction and the death penalty whethe r or not he intended that life be taken or anticipated that lethal force w ould be used 458 us at 787 n2 51 robbery is serious crime deserving rious punishment it is not however crime so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death it does not compare with murder which does involve the unjustified taking of human life although it may be accompanied by another crime robbery by definition does not include the death of or even the serious inju ry of another person the murderer kills the robber if more than that does not life is over for the victim of the murderer for the robbery victim life is not over and normally is not beyond repair as was said of the crime of rape in coker we have the abiding conviction that the death penalty which is unique in its severity and irrevocability is an excessive penalty for the robber who as such does not take human life enmund v florida 458 us at 797 the death penalty may be constitutionally imposed however upon major participant in felony who acts with reckless indiffere nce to human life and whose confederates murder the victims of their common felony tison v arizona 481 us 137 158 1987the tison brothers engineered the prison escape of two previously convicted murders by smuggling freezer chest full of firearms into the prison when the car in which they were making their escape blew tire they commandeered another car and kidnapped its occupants whom the prisoners late r murdered 481 us at 13940 tison with its focus on the defendants involvement in lifethreaten ing misconduct that ended in murder leavespunishment doctrine to case challenging the impos ition of life imprisonment without parole because death is different49 and the court made life taking intent its focal point when determining the circumstances under which felony murders mig ht be declared capital offenses under the felony murder doctrine when murder occurs during the course of robbery or some other felony the murderer as well as each of the other robbers or felons is considered equally guilty of murder the court used the defendants culpable mental state with respect to the murder not the underlying felony as test to determine when the capital punishment mig ht constitutionally be imposed under the felony murder doctrine thus it concluded that the eighth amendment would not permit imposition of the death penalty to punish the getaway driv er in robbery at which he may not have been present and during which he did not himself kill attempt to kill or intend that killing take place or that lethal for ce be employed even though his confederates murdered the victims of the robbery enmund v florida 458 us 782 797 198250 the language of the court so closely tracks that used in

cat astrophic damage for which the death penalty mig ht not be consider ed disproportionately severe even if it were considered di sproportionate sancti on for rape and some murders52 some proponents of this view also point out that the composition of the court has changed since coker and enmund leading them to conclude that coker and enmund should be limited to their facts and might be decided differently today53 finally the eighth amendment standards of coker and enmund both rest on an examination of contemporary va lues evidenced inter alia by current legislative pronouncements mcclesky v

constitution as it is now understood however seems to leave little if any legislative discretion to blish capital offenses that do not involve the taking of human life on the other hand legislative bodies enjoy considerable discretion to set other forms of punishment as long as imp risonment is not cruel and unusual and as long as the fines and forfeitures are not excessive the constitutional

prior controlled substan ce convictions ussg 2d11a the drug table appended establishes the base offense level according the weight and type of controlled substance involved in hill the 208 grams of crack would carry base offense level of 28 ussg 2d11c6 but the district court found th at the 754 grams of crack involved in the 1991 dismissed indictment c onstituted relevant conduct87 and thus should be counted for sentencing guideline purposes so that the appropriate base offense level for the combined weight of the crack 754 208 962 w ould be 32 ussg 2d11c4 the court of appeals found th at the two single violations were too remote in time to be consider ed part of the common pattern necessary to consider the earlier possession relevant conduct for sent encing purposes thus the base offense level for possession of between 20 and 35 grams of crack possession offense is 28 in cases such as hill that involve more than one ty pe of controlled substance the guidelines provide conversion device to permit them to be merged into single offense level the device involves ssigning various controlled substances equivalence weights using marihuana as standard in drug equivalency table provided in sec tion 2d11 appended infra at 27 thus for example 1 gram of heroin has been assigned drug equivalenc of 1 kilogram of marihuana in the case of crack and powder cocaine 1 gram of pow der cocaine is considered the equivalent of 200 grams of marihuana and 1 gram of crack the equivalent of 20 kilograms 2000 grams of marihuana in hill this means 529 grams of cocaine yiel d marihuana equi valent weight of 1058 kilograms 529 x 200 10580 grams of marihuana and 208 grams of crack yield marihuana equivale nt weight of 416 kilograms 208 x 20 416 kilograms of marihuana together they have marihuana equivalent weight of 42658 kilograms which translates to base offense level of 28 section 2d11 modifies the base offe nse level for four factors it adds 2 levels if

forfeiture civil forfeiture is ordinarily the product of civil in rem proceedings in which the property is treated as the offender104 within the confines of due process and the language of the applicable statutes th guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant it is enough that the propert was involved in violation to which forfeiture attaches105 criminal forfeiture proceedings on the other hand are in personam proceedings and c onfiscation is only possible upon the conviction of the owner of the property and only to the extent of his interest106 civil forfeiture begins with

rfeiture is conse quence of conviction116 it is punishment even though it may also serv remedial purposes very effectively117 the indictment upon which the conviction is based must list the property which the government asserts is subject to confiscation118 since the courts jurisdiction does not depend upon initial control of the res it need not be seized before forfeiture is declared the court however in some instances may restrain the use or transfer of property the government contends is subject to confiscation119 the defenses to criminal forfeiture differ somewhat from those available in cases of civil forfeiture for example since conviction is prere quisite to confisca tion acquittal will bar forfeiture after conviction of the fendant the court usually declares forfeited property described in the indictment and found subject to confiscati on by the jury or the trier of fact120 those with claims to the propert other than the defendant are then entitled to notice and judicial
