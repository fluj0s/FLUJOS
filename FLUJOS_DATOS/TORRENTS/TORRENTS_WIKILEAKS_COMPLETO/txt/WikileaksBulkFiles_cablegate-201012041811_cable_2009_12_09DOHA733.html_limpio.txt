45 doha 00000733 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador joseph lebaron for reasons 14 b d 1 s prime minister hamad bin jassim thani who serves concurrently as foreign minister of qatar will visit washington beginning january 4 to continue the strategic consultations that qatar and the usg have pursued since june when near eastern affairs assistant secretary feltman first proposed them in doha as part of those consultations minister of state for foreign affairs ahmed almahmoud and assistant minister for foreign affairs mohamad alrumaihi visited washington last fall 2 s the prime minister travels to washington with the aim of laying the groundwork for visits in the first half of 2010 by qatars heir apparent and the amir we believe he will be prepared to discuss the gaps between the usg and goq on middle east peace and counterterrorism cooperation as well as to discuss setting the stage for joint cooperation on iran iraq and other regional issues 3 s suggested talking points for meetings with the pm we thank you for bringing with you to washington commitment to fund the pa your decision to do so is extremely important to us we view it as clear gesture of friendship to us and of commitment to partner with us on fatahhamas reconciliation just as the united states and qatar have partnered on darfur as your ally and friend we hope we can look to you to increase your cooperation with us on counterterrorism we want to work particularly closely with you and enacting policies and programs that deter financial flows to hamas and the taliban in this context we applaud your work with the imf on making needed legal and procedural changes to curtail financing to terrorists we are ready to help you with technical support and training once the imf and qatar have worked out an action plan we especially value consultations with you on iran we recognize your national need for working relationship with iran given the natural gas reserves you share with iran how best do you think we can persuade iran to give up its military nuclear aims without military confrontation we understand that you are close to announcing decision to open an embassy in baghdad but that much depends on resolving the issue of iraqs debts to qatar is there anything we can do to help we encourage you to recognize an independent kosovo as saudi arabia and others have now done we certainly appreciate your votes in favor of kosovo in the imf and world bank they are important precursors to formal recognition but when will you take that final step on yemen we know that president saleh asked qatar to stop its mediation between the central government and huthi rebels given your past involvement there what thoughts do you have on bringing about stability on the arabian peninsula we applaud qatars decision to make food security priority not just for itself but for the entire arab world food security is priority for the usg as well and we share qatars view that it must be addressed through combination of commerce investment technical assistance technology transfer and direct aid addressing the fatahhamas split and funding the pa 4 s prime minister hamad bin jassim hbj has told nea as feltman that he will come with financial commitment to fund the palestinian authority this is an extremely important gesture by qatar to the united states he will also be prepared to discuss with secretary clinton and others qatars view of hamas continued contacts with whose leaders it sees as key to bringing about stable and enduring middle east peace we expect hbj to share what other steps qatar is prepared to take in support of the palestinian authority pa and in particular mahmoud abbas whose continued leadership doha 00000733 0022 of 003 of the pa qatars leaders support hbj is likely to bring with him new ideas to reconcile hamas and fatah given qatars history of mediation efforts hbj will doubt suggest that qatar can play helpful role qatars restoration of normal operations of the israeli trade office in doha would also give testimony to qatars willingness to help achieve us objectives but we do not expect the qataris to take this step absent some significant gesture from the israelis such as much less restricted access to gaza for qatars humanitarian efforts 5 s qatar almost certainly will not be willing to break off ties or dialogue with hamas if asked to do so we think hbj will explain that the amir gave his word to both hamas and fatah that he would financially support the winner of democratic elections in palestine hamas won those elections which the bush administration pressed the amir to support actively the amir believes that it would be dishonorable to isolate hamas after he convinced its leaders to participate in elections that were backed by the united states greater cooperation on counterterrorism needed 6 s it is important to make clear to hbj that cooperation between the united states and qatar on counterterrorism issues in general needs to be greatly improved officials should make known usg concerns about the financial support to hamas by qatari charitable organizations and our concerns about the moral support hamas receives from yousef alqaradawi it is also essential to stress that highlevel qatari political support is needed if financial flows to terrorists are to stop 7 s an international monetary fund imf employee began advising qatars financial intelligence unit in october in relationship expected to last three full years on making the necessary legal and procedural changes to address the 49 areas in which international experts have recommended changes to qatars procedures we assess that the fiu is serious about making technical changes that will enhance qatars reputation as global financial center but we project that absent political support from the top the imfqatari partnership will fall short in achieving its goals need for close consultations on iran 8 s qatar shares mammoth natural gas field with iran as result qatar carefully maintains with iran high tempo of toplevel contacts which have increased since the protests following iranian presidential elections qatar does this because it is convinced that such close relationship with iran is key to safeguarding trillions of dollars in potential wealth we are convinced that qatar will not be dissuaded from maintaining those ties 9 s that said qatars leaders while careful not to say it publicly do not trust iran and qatar does not want iran to have nuclear weapons 10 s qatars relationship with iran is important to us for another reason qatar hosts the forward headquarters of centcom and allows us to use aludaid air base for unrestricted air operations over iraq and afghanistan we pay rent for these facilities and the qataris have funded about 60 percent of the improvements to aludaid since our partnership on that base began while few least of all qatar want military confrontation with iran the usg doubt would want to use these qatari facilities in any kinetic operations against iran right now we anticipate that qatar would refuse to allow qatari soil to be used to attack iran short of some sort of permanent usg security guarantee to qatar to include its offshore natural gas field shared with iran finding way forward on iraq 11 s for several months qatar has expressed frustration with the current government of iraq which it views as too shia in orientation for its liking but appears now to be prepared to consider investment offsets provided by the government of iraq but owned by qatar as means for iraq doha 00000733 0032 of 003 to repay the gois debt owed qatar that would be an avenue for the resumption of political relationship to include an hbj visit to baghdad and the opening of qatari embassy in iraq we should encourage qatars outreach to baghdad and also encourage iraqs government to shore up its relations with doha recognizing kosovo 12 c mfa assistant minister mohamad alrumaihi told ambassador december 20 that qatars imf and world bank votes in favor of kosovo show qatars true sympathies on recognizing kosovo the russian president however has asked qatar to go slow in announcing recognition he said out of sensitivity to russian concerns alrumaihi said qatar has done so he encouraged secretary clinton to ask hbj about the timing of qatars eventual recognition noting that that qatar had been approached by organizers of uk project about using its good offices with the government of kosovo to protect kosovos christian heritage once qatar formally recognizes its independence cool to yemens approach on the huthi 13 s having attempted to mediate between huthi rebels in yemen and the central government there before president saleh put an end to qatars involvement qatar believes the huthi tribes have legitimate grievances that the central government must address in dialogue and negotiations it can be expected that hbj will discourage military approach to solving the huthi problem and claim that the role of huthi elements in supporting terrorism in the guise of alqaida is overstated food security 14 u qatar will host march 34 2010 an international conference focused on food security in the arab world ifad international fund for agricultural development is cohost as is the islamic development bank the conference will have set of ambitious goals to include conference declaration establishing permanent secretariat to address the food security issues of the poorer states of the arab league according to officials of texas ams borlaug institute this will be the first such conference on regional food security issues hosted by an arab government in the 50 years the institute has been active in the middle east and north africa 15 sbu in embassy dohas judgment qatars food security policies and strategies reflect the rapidly growing intent by the amir and crown prince to make food security key national priority for qatar not just in terms of qatars own food security needs but in terms of the food security needs of the arab region hbj supports having an active food security policy as long as it has strong commercial focus 16 sbu that judgment stems from our conversations with qatar government officials while qnfsps shortterm focus is on the state of qatar and building the domestic agricultural sector to diminish reliance on imports the strategic goal of qnfsp is to export the technologies developed in qatar to countries throughout the mena region and other areas with arid climates toward that end some research results will be part of the public domain and available to everyone some technology transfer to poorer mena nations will be donorbased through the activities of the offices of the state minister for international cooperation the third component of qatars strategic goal of exporting qnfsp technology will be more commercially based and will employ publicprivate partnerships lebaron
