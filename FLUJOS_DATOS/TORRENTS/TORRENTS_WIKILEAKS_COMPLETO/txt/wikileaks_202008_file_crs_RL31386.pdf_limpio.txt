divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31386industry trade effects related to nafta summary the north american free trade agreem ent nafta signed by president george bush on december 17 1992 has been in effect since january 1994 after eight years of implementation the full ffects of nafta on the us economy are still unclear there are numerous indications that nafta has achieved many of the trade and economic benefits that proponents claimed it w ould bring although there have been adjustment costs however there is not enough evidence to quantify the impacts on specific us industries some studies show that the agreement has had an overall positive effect on the us ec onomy but that some industries have experienced losses as the united states considers further free trade initiatives with latin american countries the effects of nafta may provide policymakers some indication of how these initiatives might ffect us industries and the overall us economy most of the trade effects related to nafta are due to changes in us trade and investment patterns with xico at the time of nafta implementation the us canada free trade agreement already had been in effect for five years and some industries in the united states and canada were already highly integrated since nafta the automotive textile and apparel industr ies have experienced some of the more significant changes in trade flows which may also have affected us employment in these industries us tr ade with mexico has increased considerably more than us trade with other countries and mexico has become more significant trading partner with the united states si nce nafta implementation consequently mexicos share of total us trade has in creased while that of other countries has decreased some data on us imports ggest that mexico may be supplying the us market with goods that may have ot herwise been supplied by asian countries not all changes in trade patterns si nce 1994 however can be attributed to nafta because trade was also affected by other unrelated economic factors such as economic growth in the united states and mexico and currency fl uctuations also traderelated job gains and losses since nafta may have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to nafta and may not be totally attributable to the trade agreement to address concerns about worker di slocations related to nafta congress included two employment adjustment assistance programs in the implementing legislation the nafta transitional adjustment assistance naftataa program and the us community adjustme nt and investment program uscaip the naftataa program is now part of new consolidated trade adjustment assistance taa program passed under th trade act of 2002 pl 107210 the naftataa program provides assistance such as employment services and training to workers who have lost their jobs because of increased import competition or by production shifts the uscaip provides assistance to communities with significant job losses due to changes in trade patterns with canada or mexico while the programs have been successful in providing assistance to communities who have had significant job losses the overall

trade agreem ent nafta signed by president george bush on december 17 1992 has been in effect since january 1994 after almost ten years of imple mentation there is some evidence that nafta has achieved many of the trade and economic benefits that propone nts claimed it would bring although there have been adjustme nt costs at the sectoral level most economists but not all believe that tr ade liberalization pr omotes overall economic growth among trading partners although th ere are shortterm adjustment costs major trade issue in the 107th congress was whether or not congress would approve authority for the president to nego tiate certain trade agreements and submit the agreements for approval and imple mentation under expe dited legislative procedures this authority was formerly called fasttrack authority and is now called trade promotion authority or t pa on august 6 2002 the trade act of 2002 which included tpa was signed into law by the president pl 1072101 as the united states considers free trade initiatives with other latin american countries the effects of nafta may provi policymakers some indication of how these initiatives might affect us industrie s and the overall us economy in recent years the united states has taken further steps to liberalize trade in the western hemisphere by entering into trade negotiations for free trade area of the americas

final stages of negotiations and ftaa negotia tions are scheduled to be completed by january 2005 on november 20 1993 congress approve d the nafta implementation act submitted by president clinton pl

ebtra85 trade adjustment assistance for wo rkers in the crs trade briefing book at httpwwwcongressgovbrbkhtmlebtra85html 3 section 512 of the nafta implementation act required the president to provide comprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of nafta to the congress by july 1 1997 part of new reformed taa program the previous naftataa program provided assistance including employment services and training to workers who have lost their jobs due to import comp etition or production shifts to mexico or canada the new reformed taa program would expand eligibility for workers hurt by shift in production to certain other c ountries and extend benefits to workers previously ineligible such as secondary workers and downstream workers in the case of nafta countries2 this report will look at the broad effect of nafta on the us economy and the traderelated effects at th industry level it will also describe the two main adjustment assistance programs the report will analyze to the extent feasible the effectiveness of nafta traderelate d adjustment assistance programs overall effects of nafta the overall effect of nafta on the u s economy has been relatively small primarily because twoway tr ade with mexico amounts to less than three percent of us gdp therefore any changes in trade patterns with mexico would not be expected to be significant in relation to the overall us economy in some sectors however traderelated effects could be expected to be more significant especially in those industries that were more expos ed to the removal of tariff and nontariff trade barriers such as the textile nd apparel and automotive industries most of the traderelated effects of nafta may be attributed to changes in us trade and investment patterns with mexico at the time of nafta implementation the uscanada free trade agreement already had been in effect for five years and some industries in the united states and canada were already highly integrated most tariffs on products traded between th united states and canada were zero at the time of nafta implementa tion in contrast mexico had followed an aggressive importsubstitution policy for many years prior to nafta in which it had sought to develop certain domestic indus tries through trade protection one example is the mexican automotive industry which had been regulated by series of five decrees issued by the mexican government betw een 1962 and 1989 the decrees established import tariffs as high as 25 on automo tive goods and had high restrictions on foreign auto production in mexico u nder nafta mexico agreed to eliminate these restrictive trade policies in 1997 president clinton sub mitted congressionally mandated comprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of nafta after three years3 the report conducted by th international trade commission itc analyzes the actual impact of the first three years of nafta on the overall us economy and onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31386crs3 4 united

its impact on workers in all three nations 2001industries particularly ffected by the agreement4 the report found that nafta had small positive effect on the overall us economy but that some industries experienced significant changes in the volume of bilateral trade with nafta partners the report states that naftas most important effects are not easily measured or observed and the full effects of the agreement will take many years to make themselves known5 the report is based on data between 1993 and 1997 some of the findings include the following data inadequacies at the industry vel make it difficult to isolate the effects of nafta on absolute trade flows us trade with nafta partners increased more rapidly than ustrade with the rest of the world the share of us exports in the mexican market increased by ahigher percentage than the share of total foreign imports in industries such as autos chemi cals textiles and electronics us companies have benefitted by achieving synergies across the north american market critics of nafta predicted that the ag reement would cause industries to move their us production operations to mexico nd that thousands of us jobs would be lost recent briefing paper by the econo mic policy institute st ates that nafta has eliminated about 766000 existing or potentia l us jobs in the manufacturing industry6 one of the reports in the briefing paper maintains that the increasing trade deficit with mexico since nafta has caused manufacturing jobs in the united states to disappear and that the threat of employers to move production to mexico helped undercut workers bargaining pow er resulting in workers being downscaled to lowerpaying lesssecure jobs7 the reports findings are largely based on the assumption that the increasing us trade deficit with mexico is primarily result of nafta however while nafta may have accelerated usmexico trade since 1993 there are other important economic f actors that have contributed to the increasing trade deficit with mexico and that are not fully analyzed in the report the expansion of the us economy in the 1990s and the mexican peso devaluation of 1995 have significantly influenced trade nd investment pattern s between the united states and mexico the re port does mention the mexican peso devaluation effects but does not fully distinguish these eff ects from those of nafta another aspect of traderelated impacts is the relationship of trade deficits to overall employment levels while nafta may be partially responsible for th dislocation of workers inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31386crs4 8 in the 1990s the overall us trade deficit increased considerably while the us economy expanded and full employment levels were attained while trade deficits in the united states have not hampered the overall creation of jobs they do influence the types of jobs that are created because of the traderelate d changes in composition of us output see crs report

import restraints second update investigation 332325 usitc publication 3201 may 1999some industries growing trade deficit with mexico does not necessarily indicate an increase in overall unemployment levels8 report published in industry trade and technology review provides another perspective on the effects of nafta and factors affecting increasing usmexico trade9 the report states that only part of the growth in usmexico trade can be attributed directly to the actual provisions of nafta the report indicates that the increase in us trade with mexico si nce 1994 was also affected by currency fluctuations economic growth in the ited states and mexico and an improved general business climate in north america it states that the overall effect of nafta on employment tends to move jobs between sectors rather than to change national employment levels part of the repor ts discussion centers around the economywide estimates of employment effects and mentions the epi estimate of actual and potential job losses of 766000 as being the most extreme estimate of job losses in studies that have generated estimates of employment changes due to nafta10 the author states that this estimate relies on an unlikely linkage between jobs and trade deficits but even this high an estimate would account for relatively small percent of total us layoffs and that therefore job creation or losses are relatively small on an economywide basis the author writes that while the negative impact on workers has been greater in some industrie s the experience of workers displaced by nafta would be similar to that of work ers displaced for reasons unrelated to trade11 the report cites usitc12 study which found that workers that have been unemployed as result of trad liberalization have in the long run been reemployed in other sectors how has nafta affected us industries us trade with mexico and canada has grown more rapi dly than total us trade since 1994 but at the sectoral level it is difficult to measure th specific effects of nafta on specific industries the automo tive chemical products textile and apparel industries have experienced the most significant changes in trade flows which may also have affected employment levels in these industries not all changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31386crs5 13 data from 1997 to 2002 automotive industry category includes motor vehicles and

for inflationin trade and investment patterns since 1994 can be attributed to nafta because the us economic expansion during the 1990s and the mexican peso devaluation of 1995 also affected trade patterns this s ection discusses five major us industries that have high volumes of trade with xico and canada these industries include the automotive industry chemicals and allie d products computer equipment textiles and apparel and microelectronics13 the expansion of the us economy during the 1990s could be the most important factor to consider in evaluating the trade trends since nafta as the us economy expands so does the demand for impor ts part of the growth in imports from mexico after nafta implementation c ould have been due to economic growth in the united states and not entirely attributable to reduction in trade barriers in addition the peso devalua tion of 1995 reduced the purchasing power of the mexican people which likely reduced the demand of mexicos imports from the united states at least in the short term industry trade flows as shown in table 1 the trade flows by major industry between the united states and nafta partners from 1993 the year before nafta

the uscanada fta had been in effect for number of years at the time of nafta implementation and most of the trade barrier reductions affecting the united states were those with mexic between 1993 and

mexico or canada accounted for 64 of all exports dropping to 50 in 2002 although exports to mexico have increa sed significantly since nafta so have imports and it not known how much of all us exports actually stay in mexico some exports are destined for manufactur ing industries in mexico see section on maquiladoras below where they are processed and exported back to the united states andor other countries as finished or semifinished products in the textiles and apparel industry for example us exports increased considerably but so did us imports this probably indicates that part of the increase in us exports may not have resulted from higher demand for us products in mexico but because production of goods for us consumption sh ifted to mexico ither from the united states or other regions such as asia us imports by country the value of us imports from mexico increased faster than total us imports ce nafta implementation between 1993 and 2002 us imports from mexico increased by 237 while imports from canada increased by 90 and total us imports increased by 100 see table 3 the most significant increase occurred in the com puter equipment industry in which us imports from

82impacts on key industries some industries that had higher trade re strictions were more sensitive to the removal of tariff and nonta riff barriers and have ex perienced increasing trade deficits since nafta was passed based on the percentage change in trade patterns and the number of workers applying for taa certification see section below the more highly impacted industries include the textiles apparel and automotive industries the trade impacts in these i ndustries are discussed below in addition mexicos maquiladora industry which is closely linked to us manufacturing industries is also discussed textiles and apparel the main nafta provisions related to textiles and apparel were the elimin ation of tariffs and quotas for goods coming from mexico and eliminating mexican tariffs on us textile and apparel products to benefit from the free trade provision goods were required to meet the rules of origin provision which assured that apparel products that were traded among the three nafta partners were made of yarn and fabric made within the free trade area the strict rules of origin provisions were meant to ensure that us textiles producer s would continue to supply us apparel companies that moved to mexico without rules of origin provision apparel companies w ould have been able to im port lowcost fabrics from asia and export the final product to the ited states under the free trade provisions the average us tariffs in textiles and apparel decreased from 91 in 1992 to 13 in 1996 78 percentage point d ecrease while mexican average tariffs declined from 16 in 1992 to 53 in 1996 107 percentage point decrease in comparison average us tariffs on all mexican products decreased from 207 in 1992 to 065 in 1996 142 percentage point decrease while average mexican tariffs on all us products decreased from 10 in 1993 to 29 in 1996 71 percentage point decrease15 the elimination of nontariff barriers such as us import quotas on north americanorigin textile s and apparel likely contributed to the increasing trade deficit in this sector because of the increase in us imports total us trade with mexico in xtiles and apparel in creased 218 after nafta while the trade deficit increased 439 see table 4 in comparison us trade in textiles and apparel with all countries increased by 79 while the trade deficit increased by 98 although the hi gh increase in us imports from mexico may have displaced some us workers in this industry the usitc study suggested that nafta may have shif ted production from asian count ries to north america the study reports that us imports from nafta countries tend to have higher us content than imports from outside the region such as china hong kong and taiwan16 the data in table 4 shows that total trade with mexico in

policy of import substitution by reserving the domestic auto mobile market for domestically produced parts and vehicles the 1989 decree signifi cantly relaxed restrictions on foreign auto producers

motor vehicle imports from mexico increased from 37 billion to 209 billion 465 between 1993 and 2002 while imports from canada increased from 267 billion to 414 billion 55 and imports from all countries increased from 63 b illion to 13 24 billion 110 in auto parts imports from mexico also increased by larger percentage than imports from other countries this incr ease caused sharp rise in the us trade deficit with mexico in both motor vehicles and auto parts the trade deficit with mexico in both vehicles and parts increased from 36 billion to 257 billion or 617 since nafta mexico has become more significant trading partner in the us motor vehicle market mexicos share in us total trade in motor vehicles increased from 5 to 15 while the share from canada and other countries decreased see table 6 total us trade from nonnafta trading partners decreased from 53 to 49 which could ggest that motor vehicle imports from mexico are replacing those from other co untries although motor vehicle imports from mexico have increased significantly since nafta those from other countries may have increased at slower rate than they would have in the absence of nafta maquiladora

has expanded rapidly since nafta implementation the number of plants grew from 1789 at the end of 1990 to 2143 in 1993 just before nafta and to 3703 in 200020 after 2000 the number of maquiladoras began to decrease by april 2003 the number had fallen to 3240 some observers have concluded that the correlation in maquiladora growth after 1993 is directly due to nafta but in reality it is unclear that maquiladora growth is directly related to trade lib eralization although some provisions in the agreement may have encouraged maquila dora growth in certain sectors maquiladora activity is also influenced by the strength of the us economy and relative wages in mexico maquiladora operations usually increase durin g periods of economic expansion in the united states drop in mexican wages may be an incentive for us companies to shift production to mexico21 between 1993 and 1996 relative wages in mexico decreased considerably due to the peso devaluation since 1997 however mexican labor costs have risen 5422 as result of the higher labor costs some manufacturers have closed their mexican plants and shifte d production to asian countries in 2001 maquiladora employment levels fell for the first time since 1982 approximately 250000 jobs were lost and 253 maquiladoras were shut down partially as result of higher labor costs but also because of the slowdown in the us economy23 in textiles and apparel the maquiladora industrys second largest employer naftas market opening measures could have been factor in increased maquiladora operations24 the agreement eliminated us quotas on textiles which may have given us textile firms an incentive to construct maquiladora operations in mexico employment while some us industr ies may have benefitted from increased demand for us products in mexico or canada creating new jobs other industries have experienced job losses as mentioned prev iously data on the effects of nafta is very limited and the effect on specific us i ndustries is difficult to quantify trade related job gains and losses since nafta may have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to nafta and may not be totally attributable to the trade agreement25

largely based on the increasing us trade deficit with mexico and does not take into account ot her economic factors affecting trade and employment therefor the actual number of job losses due to nafta is probably lower than the epi estimate and may lie in range between the number of naftataa certifications and the epi figure nafta adjustment assistance programs the naftataa program provided

assistance ans have accounted for the creation or retention of 12779 jobs32 however the actual effect of the program may not be known according to us general ccounting office gao report the uscaip does not have monitoring system in place to measure the program outcomes the report states that the data in the records maintained by the uscaip are based on projections by businesses when applying fo r program financing and are not verified gao stated that federal financing progra ms similar to the uscaip that assist specific sectors or firms largely shift employment among sectors in the economy rather than raise the overall level of employment33 although the overall effects of nafta have been small but positive some communities have had economic difficulties due to local plant closures number of communities have experienced high number of traderela ted layoffs and while some have had time to absorb the losses others have not the naftataa program provided assistance for these communities but there have been implementation challenges gao study on community adjustment assistance reported the experiences of six trade impacted communities the study found that the trade adjustment assistance was limited and that all the communities had reported structural problems that impeded effective service delivery low educational levels among unemployed workers was major factor in being able to implement effective training benefits anothe r problem was the lack of data on program outcomes to evaluate efficacy the study stated that there were simple answers to community

of us jobs have been lost because of the agreement naf ta critics generally ba their arguments on the increasing trade deficit with mexico stating that increasing us imports from mexico have caused plant closures nd job losses in the united states an examination of availabl data and studies related to nafta shows that the effects of nafta are not clearcut first it is difficult to isolate the effects of nafta because of other vari ables affecting trade and i nvestment such as economic growth and exchange rates both of which affect consumer spe nding and the demand for imports foreign investment employme nt levels and rela tive wages second some of the market opening measures in mexico that resulted from nafta were already taking place prior to the agreement and nafta may have only accelerated the process although the effects of naf ta may not be easily measured the trade trends following the agreement may give some overall indication of how the market responded to the new trade rules trad between the united states and mexico expanded considerably after nafta while trade expansion has benefitted the overall us economy in term s of improved production pro cesses and the increased availability of better goods nd services for us consumer s at lower cost there also have been job losses associated with nafta the two us workforce sectors that have been adversely affected are the tex tiles and apparel industr and the automotive industry the trade effects of nafta are of si gnificance because of the possibilities of us trade agreements with chile and also the free trade area of the americas initiative nafta may provide an indication of how further trade integration in the western hemisphere would affect us indus tries one of the key concerns facing policymakers in developing trade policy initiatives is the labor issue and how to address the problem of worker dislocation in industries adversely affected by trade36 two naftarelated programs that were creat ed to provide assistance to workers and communities affected by trade with mexico or canada the naftataa program and the uscaip program have been beneficial but also have limitations according to one gao study naftataa training assi stance has not always been effective especially in cases of workers with w educational levels the study found that there were simple answers to community recovery even when assistance was available another gao report stated that the effectiveness of the uscaip program is not known because of the lack of m easuring mechanism to evaluate program outcomes
