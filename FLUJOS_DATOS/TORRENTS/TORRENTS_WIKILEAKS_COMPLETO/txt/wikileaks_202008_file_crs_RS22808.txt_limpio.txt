foreign affairs defense and trade division february 13 2008 abstract chinas rapid economic growth since 1979 has transformed it into major economic power over the past few years many analysts have contended that china could soon overtake the united states to become the worlds largest economy based on estimates of chinas economy on purchasing power parity ppp basis which attempts to factor in price differences across countries when estimating the size of foreign economy in us dollars however in december 2007 the world bank issued study that lowered its previous 2005 ppp estimate of the size of chinas economy by 40 if these new estimates are accurate it will likely be many years before chinas economy reaches us levels the new ppp data could also have an impact on us and international perceptions over other aspects of chinas economy including its living standards poverty levels and government expenditures such as on the military order code rs22808 february 13 2008 how large is chinas economy does it matter wayne m morrison and michael f martin foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22808 chinas rapid economic growth since 1979 has transformed it into major economic power over the past few years many analysts have contended that china could soon overtake the united states to become the worlds largest economy based on estimates of chinas economy on purchasing power parity ppp basis which attempts to factor in price differences across countries when estimating the size of foreign economy in us dollars however in december 2007 the world bank issued study that lowered its previous 2005 ppp estimate of the size of chinas economy by 40 if these new estimates are accurate it will likely be many years before chinas economy reaches us levels the new ppp data could also have an impact on us and international perceptions over other aspects of chinas economy including its living standards poverty levels and government expenditures such as on the military this report will not be updated measuring the size of chinas economy since embarking on road of free market reforms nearly three decades ago china has been one of the worlds fastest growing economies the actual size of chinas economy has been subject of extensive debate among economists china reports that its 2005 gross domestic product gdp was 184 trillion yuan1 using average annual nominal exchange rates at 82 yuan per dollar yields 22 trillion equal to less than one fifth the size of the us economy2 chinas per capita gdp common measurement of living standards in nominal dollars was 1761 or 42 of us levels these data would indicate that chinas economy and living standards in 2005 were vastly below us levels however economists contend that these figures are very misleading first 1 national bureau of statistics of china 2006 china statistical yearbook 2 chinas currency is the renminbi which is denominated in yuan crs2 nominal exchange rates only reflect the price of currencies in international markets which can vary greatly over time3 secondly some exchange rate mechanisms such as between the dollar and the chinese yuan may be significantly distorted by foreign government intervention4 finally nominal gdp data fail to reflect differences in prices that exist across nations surveys indicate that prices in developing countries such as china are generally much lower than they are in developed countries such as the united states and japan especially for nontraded goods and services thus measurement of developing countrys gdp expressed in nominal us dollars will likely understate often significantly the actual level of goods and services that gdp can buy domestically purchasing power parity and gdp size economists have attempted to factor in national price differentials by using purchasing power parity ppp measurement which converts foreign currencies into common currency usually the us dollar on the basis of the actual purchasing power of those currencies based on surveys of the prices of various goods and services in each respective country in other words the ppp data attempt to determine how much local currency yuan for example would be needed to purchase comparable level of goods httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22808 and services in the united states per us dollar this ppp exchange rate is then used to convert foreign economic data in national currencies into us dollars5 one of the largest ppp projects in the world is the international comparison program icp which is coordinated by the world bank the icp collects price data on more than 1000 goods and services in 146 countries and territories and makes estimates of 39 others6 the icps new ppp estimates of chinas gdp prior to december 2007 data from the icp and various private economic forecasting firms all seemed to agree that chinas economy measured on ppp basis was close to 9 trillion in 2005 ranking it as the worlds secondlargest economy after the united states based on these estimates and projections of continued rapid economic growth many analysts predicted that chinas economy would surpass that of the united states within few years7 such projections 3 thus countrys gdp could rise significantly in one year but if its currency depreciated sharply against the dollar during the same period it could appear that the actual size of the economy decreased over the previous year when data is converted to dollars 4 the chinese government intervenes heavily in exchange rate markets by buying dollars in order to limit the yuans appreciation against the dollar many analysts contend that the yuan is significantly undervalued visavis the dollar see crs report rl32165 chinas currency economic issues and options for us trade policy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte 5 some analysts contend that ppp exchange rates reflect the true value of what countrys exchange rate with the dollar would be if market forces prevailed and contend this can be used to calculate currencys undervaluation however others including the world bank reject this theory 6 the icp is an international program that conducts statistical price surveys of comparable basket of goods and services across countries in order to estimate ppp values the data is used by the world bank the international monetary fund the united nations and other international agencies to develop programs and policy goals such as poverty reduction 7 the economist intelligence unit eiu and global insight both projected in november 2007 continued crs3 helped fuel the growing debate over whether china posed an economic threat to the united states8 however newly revised ppp data released by the world bank in december 2007 purport to show that chinas economy in 2005 was 40 smaller than previously estimated9 the icps previous 2005 ppp estimate of chinas gdp hereinafter referred to as icp 1 at 88 trillion fell to 53 trillion down by 33 trillion under the icp revision hereinafter referred to as icp 2 revision10 in addition chinas per capita gdp on ppp basis dropped from 6765 to 4091 see table 1 the size of chinas gdp relative to that of the united states fell from 713 under icp 1 to 431 under icp 2 revision while per capita gdp relative to the united states dropped from 162 to 98 finally the new revision decreased chinas 2005 share of world gdp from 142 to 97 the us share rose from 205 to 225 table 1 comparison of various estimates of chinese us and japanese gdp on ppp basis 2005 china united states japan gdp values billions

old and new estimates of chinas economy is that the latter reflects for the first time the inclusion of recent price survey data provided by china11 previously the icp estimated chinas ppp data based 7 continued that chinas economy on ppp basis would overtake the united states by the year 2010 8 see crs report rl33604 is china threat to the us economy by craig k elwell marc labonte and wayne m morrison 9 the world bank 2005 international comparison program preliminary results december 17 2007 10 the icp made revisions to its estimates of gdp size for several other countries as well indias estimated gdp fell by 40 and the overall size of world gdp in ppp also dropped 11 although the new ppp estimate for china is likely to be much more accurate than previous data continued crs4 on 1986 comparative survey of prices in the united states and china and subsequent extrapolations of that data icp 2 revision significantly increased price level estimates within chinas economy the new data estimated that chinese prices were on average 42 of us levels compared to 26 under the previous estimate which is reflected in the change in the estimate of chinas ppp exchange rate from 21 yuan to the dollar to 34 the revised data indicate it will likely take many more years than previously thought before chinas gdp and living standards reach us levels12 implications for china and for uschina economic ties although chinas access to assistance and loans from international development agencies may be unaltered by the icp ppp revision the data may directly or indirectly effect chinas economic policies and its attitudes in international trade discussions china may attempt to use the ppp revisions to boost its claim that it is poor country and that given its development needs and large numbers of people living in poverty it should not be pressed to adopt economic reforms such as changes to its currency policy that could prove disruptive or be expected to adopt policies that slow its economy such as curtailing its energy use in response to international concerns over global climate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22808 change as recent article in the economist put it china would probably be quite happy to see its gdp revised down hoping that america might stop picking on smaller poorer economy13 in february 2008 the world bank stated that the icps revised estimate of chinas ppp exchange rate data would affect its estimates of poverty levels in china based on the daily cost of basic needs estimated at roughly 1 ppp and household surveys on consumption the bank estimates that the new ppp revisions would raise the estimated poverty rate in china in 2004 from 10 to 1317 or an increase from 130 million to between 169 to 221 million thus previous estimates may have underestimated the number of chinese living in poverty by up to 91 million people14 regardless of how china seeks to present the overall status of its economic development commentators are speculating on the possible implications of the smaller gdp estimate of china for its socioeconomic situation and policies including chinas political stability may be weaker than previously thought in the past dissatisfaction with chinas economic condition has lead to public unrest eg spring 1989 the rising number of protests and demonstrations over the last few years may reflect in part the 11 continued that relied on an outdated survey the data reflects price surveys over limited part of china 11 cities and surrounding rural areas and it is not clear whether the ppp data accurately reflects average national price levels especially since large segment of the population lives in the countryside thus the new china ppp estimate may somewhat overstate the national average of prices which might increase the ppp exchange rate and gdp values although the world bank contends that this figure is not likely to exceed 5 12 to illustrate under the revision chinas gdp on ppp basis china could overtake us gdp within roughly 13 years from the 2005 baseline data assuming average real gdp growth of 3 for the united states and 10 for china both of which are optimistic projections and changes in price differentials between the two countries which are unlikely 13 less fiery dragon the economist november 29 2007 14 world bank china quarterly update february 2008 p 21 crs5 dissatisfaction of chinas poor with their lack of economic progress 15 2005 article in peoples daily described chinas growing income disparity as yellow alert that could become red alert in five years if the government failed to take proper actions16 2005 united nations report stated that the income gap between the urban and rural areas was among the highest in the world and warned that this gap threatend social stability the report urged china to take greater steps to improve conditions for the rural poor and bolster education health care and the social security system17 the new ppp measurement may increase pressure within china to expand efforts to promote development in the rural areas where over 800 million people reside according to recent article in the atlantic monthly some chinese question why the government does not use its massive foreign exchange reserves to help alleviate poverty and respond to increasing income disparities across the country rather than invest those funds overseas assets such as in us treasuries18 such reallocation of chinas investment portfolio might have repercussions for the us economy19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22808 lower prospects for democracy prior to the release of the icp revision report some analysts had speculated that once china reached certain level of economic development and possessed large and educated middle class it would follow the examples of taiwan and south korea and begin to institute democratic reforms the lower estimate of chinas economy and living standards may dampen expectations in the west that china might soon move to adopt political reforms20 lower commitment to market reforms and trade liberalization in an effort to reduce income disparities and improve conditions for chinas poor there may be return to some of the command economy methods of the past the recent decision to impose strict price controls on basic food items and other household necessities might be seen as temporary retreat from market reforms finally the icp study may also alter how the us government and the us business community perceive china the possible new view of china includes 15 see crs report rl33416 social unrest in china by thomas lum 16 party school journal warns against chinas widening income gap peoples daily september 21 2005 17 chinas human development report 2005 18 the atlantic monthly the 14 trillion question by james fallows januaryfebruary 2008 19 for an analysis of the possible repercussions of reallocation of chinas investments in us treasuries see crs report rl34314 chinas holdings of us securities implications for the us economy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte 20 conversely some contend that growing middle class may hamper democracy in china especially if political reforms are seen as threat to their own economic interests or to political instability see the daily yomiuri for china stability comes before democracy january 13 2008 p 8 crs6 reevaluation of the chinese governments budget the ppp data may affect how us policymakers evaluate chinas spending levels on policies that affect us policy for example the us defense departments annual report on chinas military spending includes conversions of chinas budget data by the chinese peoples liberation army pla from nominal us dollars into ppp levels the report estimated the plas 2003 budget in 306 billion in nominal dollars and 141 billion on ppp basis21 the world bankss ppp revision could significantly decrease this estimate and other measurements of chinese military spending as well as various public spending programs22 smaller export market potential as senior fellow at the council on foreign relations wrote us businesses and entrepreneurs hoping to crack the chinese and indian markets must come to terms with middle class that is significantly smaller than thought companies with growth plans tied to the indian and chinese markets could face disappointing results23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22808 however it is important to note the limitations of ppp estimates of gdp and where and when they provide useful insight in economic analysis although the estimated size of chinas economy decreases under the ppp revisions other aspects on chinas economy remain significantly large for example trade and international financial data are generally unaffected by the reduction in chinas ppp gdp it is estimated that in 2007 china overtook the united states to become the worlds secondlargest exporter after the european union24 similarly in 2006 china was the worlds fifthlargest recipient of foreign direct investment the largest steel producer the secondlargest consumer of oil and by some accounts the largest emitter of carbon dioxide co2 in addition since 2006 china has been the worlds largest holder of foreign exchange reserves 15 trillion at the end of 200725 thus despite the icp results china remains major trade and economic power and major potential global player in international finances and investment flows 21 us department of defense annual report to congress military power of the peoples republic of china 2007 may 2007 p 26 22 the department of defense report does not describe how it arrived at its ppp estimate for china or if that data was obtained from another source the ppp exchange rate used by defense was about 18 yuan per dollar while icps rate was 20 in 2003 if the new icps revised ppp exchange rate 34were used the estimated pla budget on ppp basis would fall to 85 billion 23 walter russell mead the great fall of china angeles times december 30 2007 while the level of chinese consumer buying power may not be as large as once thought the very size of chinas population 13 billion and its rapid economic growth make it potentially huge market for us goods and services in 2007 china overtook japan to become the thirdlargest destination for us exports after canada and mexico 24 source the economist intelligence unit eiu dataservices the eiu estimated us and chinese merchandise exports at 1190 billion and 1225 billion respectively 25 china invests large share of those reserves overseas including in us securities see crs report rl34314 chinas holdings
