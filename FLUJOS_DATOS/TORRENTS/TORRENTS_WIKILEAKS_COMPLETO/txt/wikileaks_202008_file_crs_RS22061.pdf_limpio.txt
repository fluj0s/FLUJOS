april 15 2006 this report is to be updated introduction this report examines the role and curre nt status of the independent 2005 base realignment and closure brac commission it follows an earlier crs report that provided important details bout the department of defens internal base closure realignment selection process1 at this point the 2005 brac schedule is well along with congress having already approved dods final lection criteria february 2004 and its force structure plan base inventory and brac requirement certifica tion march 2004 the next important step in the brac schedule has been the presidents appointment of nine members to the new independe nt commission congressional l eaders have selected sixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22061crs2 2 the 1995 brac commission consisted of eight mbers the 2005 statute revised the number to avoid tie vote 3 the 1988 and 1991 statutes pl 100526 and pl 101510 differed to considerable degree see crs report 97305 f military base closures historical review from 1988 to 1995 by david lockwood and george siehl 4 us congress house national defense authorizati on act for fiscal year 2002 pl 107107 december 12 2001 individuals to be nominated with the pres ident choosing the remaining three the completed list of nominees has been forwarded to the senate armed services committee as of march 15 2005 after considering the nominees credentials the committee will then make its recommendations to the full senate chamber where the final decision will be agreed to or not2 it is important at this juncture to em phasize the extent to which the current 2005 brac commission is likely to follow procedures similar to those used by past commissions in 1991 1993 and 19953 the reason for this degree of replication can be attributed to the widely held view that the 1990 brac statute pl 101510 as amended provides the most successful solution to an otherwise impossible dilemma namely how to avoid eternal wrangling over which bases should be clos ed or realigned appointment of brac commissioners although the president was entitled to ppoint nine members to the new brac commission he also had the authority to ig nore the directive in which case the 2005 brac round would have been cancelled4 the president will also have second opportunity to terminate the pro cess later when he forwards the list of brac actions to congress by november 7 2005 in other words the president exercises almost complete authority throughout the process with one possible exception after receiving the presidentially approved list of actions congress can pass joint resolution of disapproval in appointing members to the commission th brac law states that the president should first consult with top congressional leader s on six of the nine candidates the selection and allocation of the six candidates are outlined below house of representatives senate speaker of the house 2 majority leader of the senate 2 minority leader 1

commission operation the experience of the 1995 brac commission may serve to establish context for anticipating the operation of the 2005 commission commission staff fifteen permanent employees fo rmed the core of staff support for the 1995 brac commission this cadre d maintained continuity throughout the various brac rounds providing legacy know ledge and experience to the augmentees brought in temporarily to perform the an alysis required during brac they also maintained the brac library which consisted of the research and reference materials and analytical tools used during previous
