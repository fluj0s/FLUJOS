from edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re neff and practicality date tue 24 jul 2001 084914 0400 cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk hi tim thanks for the remarks we can certainly spend some time talking through some of the points raised i guess i am still finding it difficult to believe that an rbar of 005 has any operational significance in estimating neff it is kind of like doing correlations between tree rings and climate correlation of 010 may be statistically significant but have practical value at all for reconstruction the same goes for an rbar of 005 in my mind i agree that what i suggested ie testing the individual correlations for significance and only using those above the some significance level for estimating rbar is somewhat ad hoc and not theoretically pleasing however it is also true that correlations below the chosen significance threshold are not significantly different from zero and could be ignored in principle just as we would do in testing variables for entry into regression model this would clearly muddy nice choice of words the rbar waters i admit in terms of the problem i am working on computing bootstrap confidence limits on annual values of 1205 rcsdetrended treering series from 14 sites it is hard to know what to do certainly using neff will result in almost none of the annual means being statistically significant over the past 1200 years i dont believe that this is true other highly conservative methods of testing significance result in very high frequency of similarly negative results ie the test of significance in spectral analysis that takes into account the multiplicity effect of testing all frequencies in an posteriori way see mitchell et 1966 climatic change pg 41 if you use this correction virtually significant bandlimited signals will ever be identified in paleoclimatological spectra so this test has very low statistical power i think that this is the crux issue type1 vs type2 error in statistical hypothesis testing the neff correction greatly increases the probability of type2 error while virtually eliminating type1 error so truth or dare consider one last thought experiment suppose you came to earth from another planet to study its climate you put out 1000 randomly distributed recording thermometers and measure daily temperatures for 1 earth year you then pick up the thermometers and return to your planet where you estimate the mean annual temperature of the earth for that one year how many degrees of freedom do you have presumably 999 now suppose that you leave those same recording thermometers in place for 20 years and calculate 20 annual means from these 20year records you also calculate an rbar of 010 how many degrees of freedom per year do you have now 999 or 99 what has changed certainly not the observation network does this mean that we can just as accurately measure the earths mean annual temperature with only 10 randomly placed thermometers if they provide temperature records with an rbar of 000 over 20 year period i wouldnt bet on it but your theory implies it to be so surely one would have more confidence ie smaller confidence intervals in mean annual tempertures estimated from 1000station network cheers ed ed re your recent questions about neff and rbar etc ive thought bit about these kind of questions over the past few years but have never completely got my head around it all in satisfactory way i agree with what phil said in his reply to you also your idea of subsamping 40 of the cores at time sounds reasonable though i dont think it would be possible to write very elegant statistical justification anyway i just wanted to add couple of points to what phil said 1 even for very low rbar the formula certainly works for idealisedsynthetic cases ie with similar standard deviations and interseries correlations etc for example i just generated 1000 random time series each 500 elements long with very weak common signal resulting in rbar0047 n1000 was the closest i could get to ninfinity without waiting for ages for the correlation matrix to be computed the formula neff n 1 n1rbar which reduces to neff 1 rbar for ninfinity gives neff 2083 for such low rbar neff seems rather few the mean of the variances of the 1000 series was 104677 if i took the globalmean timeseries ie the mean of the 1000 series then its variance was 005041 the ratio of these variances is 2077 almost the same as neff if our expectation that neff should be higher than 2083 was true then the variance of the mean series should have been much lower than it was it should be easy to try out similar synthetic tests with various options eg shorter time series sets of series with differing variances subsets with higher common signal withinsite combined with subsets with weaker common signal distant sites etc to test the formula further 2 i agree that rbar is computed from sample correlations rather than true population correlations for short overlaps the individual correlations will rarely be significant but the true correlations could be higher as well as lower so rbar could be an underestimate and neff could be an overestimate maybe you have even fewer than 20 degrees of freedom b i did wonder whether the sample rbar might be biased estimate of the population rbar given that the uncertainty ranges surrounding individual correlations are asymmetric with wider range on the lower side than the higher side but ive checked this out with synthetic data and the rbar computed from short samples is uncertain but not biased c just because rbar is only 005 does not mean that you need series 1500 elements long to be significant that would be the case for testing single correlation coefficient but rbar is the mean of many coefficients not all independent though so it is much easier to obtain significance not sure how youd test for this theoretically but monte carlo test would work given some assumptions about the core data for 100 cores each just 20 years long quick monte carlo test indicates that an rbar of 005 is indeed significant therefore rbar005 in your case with 100 cores many of which will be 20 years long should certainly be significant looking forward to your visit we can discuss this some more tim dr timothy j osborn phone 44 1603 592089
