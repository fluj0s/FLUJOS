congress for projects programs or grants where the purported congre ssional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication circ umvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes or specifies th location or recipient or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process the full text of eo 13457 can be found online at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200801200801295htmltransferred to the jurisdiction of the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on defense the former subcommittee on military quality of life veterans affairs and related agencies became the subcommittee on military construction veterans affairs and related agencies mirroring its counterpart in the senate executive order 13457 congress typically funds this act by ppropriating directly to broadly defined appropriations accounts such as military construction army or family housing air force these appropriations are stated within the statutory language of the act itself nevertheless within the budget doc umentation that the president submits to congress each year are hundreds of detailed ju stifications for i ndividual construction projects at specified locati ons for stated purposes in established funding amounts the appropriations and authorization committees consider each of these as individual requests and indicate their appr oval disapproval or additions to the project lists in the explanatory statements reported to their respective chambers while it is generally recognized by legal experts that statutor language those provisions stated in the body of legislation passed by congress and enacted by the president carries the full weight of law the legal standing of stat ements contained within what is generally considered supporting language such as ex planatory statements written into reports to the chambers by members of committees is less clear on january 29 2008 president george w bush issued executive order eo 13457 titled protecting american taxpay ers from government spending on wasteful earmarks in that eo the president stated in part that for appropriations laws and other legislation acted after the date of this order executive agencies s hould not commit obligate or expend funds on the basis of earmarks in cluded in any nonstatutory source including requests in reports of committees of the congress or other congressional documents or comm unications from or on behalf of members of congress or any othe r nonstatutory source except when required by law or when an agency has itself determined project program activity grant or othe r transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking2 the impact of eo 13457 on the current appropriation or implementation practices of either the executive or the legislative branches is unclear for example the order states that executive agencies should emphasis added not commit obligate or expend funds under certain ci rcumstances in law should ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34038crs4 3 legal interpretation in this section has been assisted by crs legislative attorney r chuck mason 4 other instances where text out side of an appropriations act may be considered as legally binding can occur when congress incorporates language such as shall be effective as if enacted by law or in accordance with into statuteinterpreted as nonbinding guidance to thos to whom it is ddressed however in subsequent section of the eo the presid ent directs that the head of each agency shall emphasis added take ll necessary steps to imp lement the policy according to certain criteria that he then lays out it should be noted that shall is much stronger directive term the eo applies only to appropriations enacted after january 29 2008 and will therefore not affect an existing or prioryear appropriation the eo does not appear to bar the imp lementation of cong ressionally directed funding in cases where spending is requi red by law or when an agency has itself determined project program activity gran t or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or ot her meritbased decisionmaking examples of such situation have existed where particular c onstruction projects have been directed in the text of previously enacted authorization acts the presidents order also allows agency heads to consider the views of house committee member officer or staff of the congress with respect to commitments obligations or expenditures to carry out any earmark when such views are in writing in addition the definition of an earma rk written into the eo may reduce somewhat the clarity of exactly what spendi ng is to be avoided that definition states that earmarks are purporte d congressional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication tha t circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation pr ocesses or specifies the location or recipient emphasis added3 while much of the eo stresses the necessity of adhering to the letter of the law this definition could be interpreted as preventing an agency from observing some statutory text more generally the eo may raise num ber of other questions regarding future expenditure of appropria ted funds two examples are suggested below 1 there are instances where construction project is not stated within the statutory text of the law in question but rather is refe renced in the text of another an example might be statutory requirement for the depa rtment of veterans affairs to construct number of cemeteries for the use of vete rans at specified locations for which appropriations are not provided until number of years later4 would the eo bar the initiation of construction until such statutory link is found and proven to unambiguously cover each project 2 the eo grants agency heads the authority to accept congressionally directed funding when project has merit under st atutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking or when considering the views of house committee member officer or staff of the congress when such views are in writing do these provisions constitute broa d discretion on the part of agency heads to accept congressional guidance on spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34038crs5 5 see div b sec 101b of the actappropriations fo r fiscal year 2007 continuing resolutions the 109th congress was unable to pass hr 5385 the military
